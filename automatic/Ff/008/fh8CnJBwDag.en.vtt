you can also manually adjust the setting
moving<00:02:11.700> on<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.000> sharpening<00:02:12.480> I'll<00:02:12.660> enable<00:02:13.050> it

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
moving on to sharpening I'll enable it

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.809 
moving on to sharpening I'll enable it
and<00:02:13.410> then<00:02:13.830> I'll<00:02:13.950> leave<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.310> at<00:02:14.430> its<00:02:14.610> default

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
and then I'll leave it at its default

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.360 
and then I'll leave it at its default
values<00:02:15.569> since<00:02:16.019> this<00:02:16.379> will<00:02:16.560> give<00:02:16.739> me<00:02:16.920> just<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
values since this will give me just the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.270 
values since this will give me just the
amount<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.670> sharpening<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.300> need<00:02:18.920> now<00:02:19.920> for

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
amount of sharpening I need now for

points<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.930> readjust<00:02:46.500> them<00:02:46.920> I'll<00:02:47.880> just<00:02:48.180> do<00:02:48.299> the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
points to readjust them I'll just do the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.650 
points to readjust them I'll just do the
same<00:02:48.450> thing<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.410> other<00:02:49.440> side

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
same thing on the other side

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.800 
same thing on the other side
now<00:02:52.320> I'll<00:02:52.500> choose<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.830> color<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.490> mask

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
now I'll choose the color of the mask

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.360 
now I'll choose the color of the mask
using<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.900> eyedropper<00:02:55.410> I'll<00:02:55.560> click<00:02:55.890> here<00:02:55.920> to

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
using the eyedropper I'll click here to

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.250 
using the eyedropper I'll click here to
get<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.610> color<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.120> I'll<00:02:57.780> add<00:02:57.960> a<00:02:57.990> bit<00:02:58.080> of

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
get the color and I'll add a bit of

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.990 
get the color and I'll add a bit of
feathering<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.860> soften<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.460> edges<00:02:59.580> of<00:02:59.910> the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
feathering to soften the edges of the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.660 
feathering to soften the edges of the
mask<00:03:00.240> I<00:03:00.570> also<00:03:01.410> want<00:03:01.740> to<00:03:01.890> make<00:03:02.040> sure<00:03:02.070> that<00:03:02.490> this

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
mask I also want to make sure that this

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.270 
mask I also want to make sure that this
mask<00:03:02.880> is<00:03:03.090> used<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.570> all<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.990> images<00:03:04.350> so<00:03:05.010> I'll

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
mask is used in all the images so I'll

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.700 
mask is used in all the images so I'll
select<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.760> mask<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.270> choose<00:03:06.330> reuse<00:03:07.050> in<00:03:07.320> all

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
select a mask and choose reuse in all

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.280 
select a mask and choose reuse in all
columns<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:09.180> can<00:03:09.210> double<00:03:09.630> check<00:03:09.660> this<00:03:10.050> by

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
columns you can double check this by

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.320 
columns you can double check this by
going<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.860> different<00:03:11.040> image

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
going to a different image

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.870 
going to a different image
so<00:03:14.290> far<00:03:14.530> it's<00:03:14.710> looking<00:03:14.770> much<00:03:15.100> better<00:03:15.280> but

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
so far it's looking much better but

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.130 
so far it's looking much better but
there's<00:03:16.030> one<00:03:16.150> more<00:03:16.360> thing<00:03:16.600> we<00:03:16.720> need<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:17.020> adjust

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
there's one more thing we need to adjust

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.710 
there's one more thing we need to adjust
and<00:03:17.650> that's<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.340> drifting<00:03:18.850> that<00:03:19.090> occurs<00:03:19.420> from

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
and that's the drifting that occurs from

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.900 
and that's the drifting that occurs from
my<00:03:19.960> object<00:03:20.140> not<00:03:20.650> being<00:03:21.010> exactly<00:03:21.670> in<00:03:21.790> the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
my object not being exactly in the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.060 
my object not being exactly in the
middle<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.360> turntable<00:03:22.960> enable<00:03:23.950> the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
middle of the turntable enable the

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.190 
middle of the turntable enable the
transform<00:03:24.580> tool<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.000> right<00:03:25.270> away<00:03:25.510> we<00:03:25.720> see<00:03:25.960> our

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
transform tool and right away we see our

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.860 
transform tool and right away we see our
crop<00:03:26.590> area<00:03:26.950> that<00:03:27.160> we<00:03:27.310> set<00:03:27.550> earlier<00:03:27.790> turn<00:03:28.660> on

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
crop area that we set earlier turn on

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
current image is shown and you can drag

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.220 
current image is shown and you can drag
this<00:03:38.020> image<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.620> match<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:39.400> anchor<00:03:39.760> image<00:03:40.230> now

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
this image to match the anchor image now

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.080 
this image to match the anchor image now
do<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.590> same<00:03:41.800> with<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.100> minor<00:03:42.310> offset<00:03:42.880> which

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
do the same with the minor offset which

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.420 
do the same with the minor offset which
will<00:03:43.300> add<00:03:43.480> an<00:03:43.750> overlay<00:03:43.900> of<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.350> images<00:03:44.830> at<00:03:45.010> 90

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
will add an overlay of the images at 90

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.480 
will add an overlay of the images at 90
and<00:03:45.580> 270<00:03:46.120> degrees

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
and 270 degrees

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.880 
and 270 degrees
and<00:03:48.580> that's<00:03:49.390> it<00:03:49.660> but<00:03:50.080> first<00:03:50.380> I'm<00:03:50.560> going<00:03:50.740> to

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
and that's it but first I'm going to

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.920 
and that's it but first I'm going to
open<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.250> viewing<00:03:51.520> parameters<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.690> check

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
open the viewing parameters to check

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.440 
open the viewing parameters to check
that<00:03:53.140> all<00:03:53.350> is<00:03:53.650> really<00:03:53.980> okay

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.290 

and<00:03:57.540> well<00:03:58.470> it's<00:03:58.740> not<00:03:58.920> okay<00:03:59.099> there<00:03:59.790> are<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.000> few

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
and well it's not okay there are a few

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.600 
and well it's not okay there are a few
images<00:04:00.480> where<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.110> mask<00:04:01.440> doesn't<00:04:01.980> fit<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:02.580> I

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
images where the mask doesn't fit so I

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.510 
images where the mask doesn't fit so I
need<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.030> go<00:04:03.150> back<00:04:03.330> and<00:04:03.599> fix<00:04:03.870> these<00:04:04.370> first<00:04:05.370> I

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
need to go back and fix these first I
