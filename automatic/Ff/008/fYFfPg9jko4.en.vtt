and this is winter it there's small

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.800 
and this is winter it there's small
things<00:01:53.579> which<00:01:53.759> make<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.969> big<00:01:54.240> difference<00:01:54.630> in

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
things which make a big difference in

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.950 
things which make a big difference in
how<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.049> interpret<00:01:55.679> things<00:01:56.509> and<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.630> love<00:01:57.810> that

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
how you interpret things and I love that

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.800 
how you interpret things and I love that
it's<00:01:58.340> nothing's<00:01:59.340> predictable<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.090> nothing

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
it's nothing's predictable and nothing

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:09.080 
it's nothing's predictable and nothing
goes<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.409> same<00:02:01.619> way<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.069> hope<00:02:02.369> ever

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.050 

it's<00:02:09.780> very<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.890> puppy

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
it's very it's a puppy

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.880 
it's very it's a puppy
hours<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.510> practice<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> day<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.620> still

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
hours of practice a day and I still

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.410 
hours of practice a day and I still
haven't<00:02:14.190> really<00:02:14.459> gotten<00:02:14.640> an<00:02:14.790> answer<00:02:14.910> for<00:02:15.270> it

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
haven't really gotten an answer for it

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.420 
haven't really gotten an answer for it
because<00:02:15.780> there's<00:02:16.500> really<00:02:16.800> from<00:02:16.980> day<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.250> day

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
because there's really from day to day

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.820 
because there's really from day to day
it<00:02:17.880> depends<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.599> mean<00:02:18.810> what<00:02:19.349> would<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.530> count

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
it depends I mean what would you count

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.740 
it depends I mean what would you count
this<00:02:19.950> recording<00:02:20.459> session<00:02:20.790> as<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.300> practice

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
this recording session as that practice

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.440 
this recording session as that practice
or<00:02:21.930> was<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.620> recording<00:02:23.099> session<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.670> and

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
or was that a recording session and and

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.630 
or was that a recording session and and
so<00:02:24.840> theoretically<00:02:25.560> today<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:25.920> only<00:02:26.069> spent

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
so theoretically today I only spent

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.100 
so theoretically today I only spent
maybe<00:02:26.819> forty<00:02:27.180> five<00:02:27.360> minutes<00:02:27.690> at<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.840> piano

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
maybe forty five minutes at the piano

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.740 
maybe forty five minutes at the piano
and<00:02:28.380> but<00:02:29.310> then<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.489> recorded<00:02:29.940> for<00:02:30.090> six<00:02:30.330> hours<00:02:30.599> or

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
and but then I recorded for six hours or

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.330 
and but then I recorded for six hours or
if<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.959> have<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.110> concert<00:02:31.500> does<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:32.010> count<00:02:32.190> as

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
if I have a concert does that count as

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.210 
if I have a concert does that count as
practice<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.890> for<00:02:34.890> me<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:35.160> course

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
practice and and for me of course

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.400 
practice and and for me of course
practice<00:02:35.610> is<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.940> means<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.690> achieving<00:02:36.959> my<00:02:37.170> goal

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
practice is a means to achieving my goal

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.190 
practice is a means to achieving my goal
which<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:38.099> perform<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:39.750> share<00:02:39.989> music

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
which is to perform and to share music

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.309 
which is to perform and to share music
with<00:02:40.349> other<00:02:40.620> people<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:42.019> generally<00:02:43.019> speaking

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
with other people and generally speaking

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.620 
with other people and generally speaking
I<00:02:43.440> try<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.709> practice<00:02:44.190> as<00:02:44.430> much<00:02:44.819> as<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.090> can<00:02:45.330> at

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
I try to practice as much as I can at

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.809 
I try to practice as much as I can at
home<00:02:45.870> because<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.739> know<00:02:46.769> my<00:02:47.130> city<00:02:47.340> I've<00:02:47.549> lived

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
which is for me many years and because

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.030 
which is for me many years and because
it's<00:02:54.239> something<00:02:54.510> which<00:02:54.870> when<00:02:55.470> I'm<00:02:55.560> home<00:02:55.860> I

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.120 
feel comfortable it's really a place
where<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.780> can<00:02:57.989> think<00:02:58.290> about<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.709> music<00:02:58.799> I'd

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
where I can think about the music I'd

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.460 
where I can think about the music I'd
like<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.400> do<00:02:59.519> I<00:02:59.549> can<00:02:59.819> practice<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:01.230> like

to work and I start practicing around
6:00<00:03:10.049> in<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.170> morning<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.650> see<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.950> sunrise

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
6:00 in the morning I see the sunrise

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.780 
6:00 in the morning I see the sunrise
outside<00:03:12.180> my<00:03:12.360> window<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.920> and<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.519> that's

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
outside my window and and and that's

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.460 
outside my window and and and that's
really<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.510> way<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:15.630> like<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.989> start<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.260> day

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
really the way I like to start the day

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.410 
really the way I like to start the day
and<00:03:17.070> then<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:17.280> course<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.609> day<00:03:17.760> develops<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:18.329> I

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
and then of course the day develops so I

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.810 
and then of course the day develops so I
can't<00:03:18.870> say<00:03:19.079> I<00:03:19.109> practice<00:03:19.530> eight<00:03:19.709> hours<00:03:20.010> or<00:03:20.250> five

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
can't say I practice eight hours or five

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.300 
can't say I practice eight hours or five
hours<00:03:21.180> or<00:03:21.359> six<00:03:21.570> hours<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.829> when<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.010> travel

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
hours or six hours and and when I travel

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.150 
hours or six hours and and when I travel
it's<00:03:23.670> it's<00:03:24.120> really<00:03:24.750> much<00:03:25.079> less<00:03:25.380> maybe<00:03:25.920> two

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
it's it's really much less maybe two

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.280 
it's it's really much less maybe two
hours<00:03:26.310> maybe<00:03:26.700> three<00:03:26.850> if<00:03:27.359> I'm<00:03:27.569> lucky<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.079> I

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
hours maybe three if I'm lucky and I

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.620 
hours maybe three if I'm lucky and I
have<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.620> time<00:03:28.829> but<00:03:29.069> really<00:03:29.730> it's<00:03:30.000> that's

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
have the time but really it's that's

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.720 
have the time but really it's that's
pushing<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:31.170> even<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.620> sometimes<00:03:32.190> four<00:03:32.489> but

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
pushing it even and sometimes four but

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.900 
pushing it even and sometimes four but
it's<00:03:32.880> an<00:03:33.750> average<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:34.560> don't<00:03:35.549> even<00:03:35.609> know<00:03:35.790> what

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
it's an average I don't even know what

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:46.260 
it's an average I don't even know what
to<00:03:36.030> say<00:03:36.239> because<00:03:36.690> it's<00:03:37.290> every<00:03:37.890> day<00:03:38.069> different

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.330
