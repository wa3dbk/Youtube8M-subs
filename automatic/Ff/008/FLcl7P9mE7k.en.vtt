we're<00:01:20.310> gonna<00:01:20.460> go<00:01:20.700> over<00:01:20.940> this<00:01:21.060> dubbing<00:01:21.540> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
we're gonna go over this dubbing a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.510 
we're gonna go over this dubbing a
couple<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.050> times<00:01:22.290> once<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:22.860> hackle<00:01:23.280> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
couple of times once with hackle and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.280 
couple of times once with hackle and
once<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:23.910> the<00:01:24.030> ribs<00:01:24.300> so<00:01:24.480> everything<00:01:24.990> will<00:01:25.140> be

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
once with the ribs so everything will be

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:36.450 
once with the ribs so everything will be
bound<00:01:25.500> down

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:46.030 

okay<00:01:37.460> now<00:01:37.670> we<00:01:37.729> try<00:01:37.969> to<00:01:38.030> hackle<00:01:38.509> in

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
start with your hackle wrap two or three

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.340 
start with your hackle wrap two or three
times<00:01:49.799> right<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.640> spot<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.390> then<00:01:52.049> start

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
times right in one spot and then start

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.580 
times right in one spot and then start
spiraling<00:01:52.830> back<00:01:53.430> four<00:01:54.000> or<00:01:54.270> five<00:01:54.509> times<00:01:54.900> toward

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
spiraling back four or five times toward

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.649 
spiraling back four or five times toward
the<00:01:55.799> rear<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.280> hook<00:01:58.790> don't<00:01:59.790> let<00:02:00.060> go<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.509> I

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
the rear of the hook don't let go like I

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:09.169 
the rear of the hook don't let go like I
just<00:02:00.720> did<00:02:07.160> when<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.280> get<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> rear<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
just did when you get to the rear of the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.540 
just did when you get to the rear of the
hook<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:12.180> stop<00:02:12.480> with<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.750> hackle<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:13.560> start

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
hook you stop with the hackle and start

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.729 
hook you stop with the hackle and start
winding<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.300> wire<00:02:15.630> rib<00:02:15.959> forward<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.620> the

opposite direction moving it back and
forth<00:02:21.120> slightly<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.790> don't<00:02:24.120> bind<00:02:24.480> down<00:02:24.750> a

hackle<00:02:25.590> fibers

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:58.420
