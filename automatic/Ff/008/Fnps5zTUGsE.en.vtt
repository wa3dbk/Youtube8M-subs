00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.140 
man how much of that of that flow that
we<00:02:34.720> can<00:02:34.900> manage<00:02:35.080> through<00:02:35.590> greening<00:02:36.150> practices

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
we can manage through greening practices

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.350 
we can manage through greening practices
and<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.890> my<00:02:39.040> surprise<00:02:39.340> we<00:02:39.850> actually<00:02:40.180> can

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
and to my surprise we actually can

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.110 
and to my surprise we actually can
eliminate<00:02:40.570> all<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.140> that<00:02:41.310> if<00:02:42.310> we<00:02:42.580> if<00:02:43.060> we

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
eliminate all of that if we if we

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.990 
eliminate all of that if we if we
continue<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:44.019> build<00:02:44.200> as<00:02:44.440> we're<00:02:44.620> building

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
continue to build as we're building

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.400 
continue to build as we're building
throughout<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.150> city<00:02:46.390> with<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:47.170> green

throughout the city with the green

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.880 
throughout the city with the green
infrastructure

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.100 

this<00:02:55.490> project<00:02:56.000> was<00:02:56.240> an<00:02:56.450> intersection

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
this project was an intersection

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.590 
this project was an intersection
improvement<00:02:57.650> project<00:02:58.160> we<00:02:58.610> had<00:02:58.850> problems<00:02:59.510> with

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
improvement project we had problems with

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.720 
improvement project we had problems with
lots<00:02:59.959> of<00:03:00.140> accidents<00:03:00.530> at<00:03:01.040> this<00:03:01.250> intersection

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
lots of accidents at this intersection

there<00:03:08.090> was<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.209> merge<00:03:08.510> lane<00:03:08.810> that<00:03:09.380> was<00:03:09.650> on<00:03:10.459> the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
there was a merge lane that was on the

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.300 
there was a merge lane that was on the
East<00:03:10.970> Walnut<00:03:11.180> Street<00:03:11.720> that<00:03:12.350> traffic<00:03:12.980> would

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
East Walnut Street that traffic would
come<00:03:13.520> up<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.790> plum<00:03:14.030> street<00:03:14.390> and<00:03:15.070> not<00:03:16.070> not<00:03:16.880> stop

and not merge as the

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.280 
and not merge as the
and<00:03:21.799> often<00:03:22.280> caused<00:03:22.549> accidents<00:03:22.849> we<00:03:23.540> also<00:03:23.659> had<00:03:24.260> a

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
and often caused accidents we also had a

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.899 
and often caused accidents we also had a
lot<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.530> localized<00:03:25.010> flooding<00:03:25.370> in<00:03:25.579> the<00:03:25.640> center

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
lot of localized flooding in the center

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.630 
lot of localized flooding in the center
section<00:03:26.120> because

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.430 

God<00:03:31.640> read<00:03:32.030> a<00:03:32.060> lot<00:03:32.330> of<00:03:32.420> storm<00:03:32.660> water<00:03:32.840> ponding<00:03:33.380> in

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
God read a lot of storm water ponding in

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.690 
God read a lot of storm water ponding in
this<00:03:33.620> intersection<00:03:34.030> so

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
this intersection so

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.250 
this intersection so
built<00:03:37.270> a<00:03:37.540> lot<00:03:37.720> of<00:03:37.750> rain<00:03:38.050> gardens

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.680 

place<00:03:43.099> up<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.519> merge<00:03:43.730> Lee<00:03:43.970> we

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
place up the merge Lee we

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.840 
place up the merge Lee we
patio<00:03:46.690> is<00:03:46.900> force<00:03:47.319> and<00:03:47.920> stormwater

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.230 

landscape<00:03:51.660> beds<00:03:51.870> that's<00:03:52.620> around

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.240 

and<00:03:56.240> we<00:03:56.870> get<00:03:57.050> a<00:03:57.440> one<00:03:57.620> stormwater<00:03:58.100> management

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
and we get a one stormwater management

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:08.910 
and we get a one stormwater management
over<00:03:58.970> -<00:03:59.150> yeah

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.130 

so<00:04:09.490> there<00:04:09.610> are<00:04:09.640> lots<00:04:09.880> of<00:04:10.060> lots<00:04:10.630> of<00:04:10.780> resources

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
so there are lots of lots of resources

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.750 
so there are lots of lots of resources
that<00:04:11.470> are<00:04:11.560> available<00:04:11.620> on<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.130> website<00:04:12.520> if<00:04:12.670> you

urban environments want to have a tree

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.589 
urban environments want to have a tree
canopy<00:04:46.259> at<00:04:46.379> 40<00:04:46.680> to<00:04:46.710> 45<00:04:47.220> percent<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:47.940> like

tree canopy and we have lots of trees

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.619 
tree canopy and we have lots of trees
that<00:04:52.199> we<00:04:52.470> need<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.740> plant<00:04:53.120> not<00:04:54.120> only<00:04:54.419> does<00:04:54.599> it

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
that we need to plant not only does it

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:56.629 
that we need to plant not only does it
help<00:04:54.900> me<00:04:55.020> in<00:04:55.289> stormwater<00:04:55.800> but<00:04:56.159> it<00:04:56.250> curbs<00:04:56.490> a

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
help me in stormwater but it curbs a

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.640 
help me in stormwater but it curbs a
heat<00:04:56.819> island<00:04:57.180> effect<00:04:57.509> in<00:04:57.780> future<00:04:58.229> property

heat island effect in future property

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.230 
heat island effect in future property
value<00:04:59.039> so

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.720 

right
