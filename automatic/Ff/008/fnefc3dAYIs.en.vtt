00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.360 
your tuning so we just want this line to
be<00:02:19.170> right<00:02:19.739> in<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.250> very<00:02:20.430> middle<00:02:20.840> now<00:02:22.370> really

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
be right in the very middle now really

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.479 
be right in the very middle now really
most<00:02:23.909> flutes<00:02:24.420> should<00:02:24.810> stay<00:02:25.200> right<00:02:26.099> about

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
most flutes should stay right about

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.360 
most flutes should stay right about
where<00:02:26.700> they<00:02:26.819> always<00:02:27.209> are<00:02:27.420> but<00:02:28.069> if<00:02:29.069> you<00:02:29.129> have<00:02:29.250> an

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
where they always are but if you have an

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.429 
where they always are but if you have an
older<00:02:29.700> flute<00:02:30.030> or<00:02:30.269> a<00:02:30.359> flute<00:02:30.689> that<00:02:30.900> hasn't<00:02:31.290> been

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
older flute or a flute that hasn't been

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.259 
older flute or a flute that hasn't been
checked<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:31.859> a<00:02:32.040> long<00:02:32.250> time<00:02:32.549> or<00:02:32.909> that's<00:02:33.030> had

checked for a long time or that's had

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.349 
checked for a long time or that's had
some<00:02:33.590> abuse<00:02:34.590> or<00:02:34.980> maybe<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.310> little<00:02:35.670> kid<00:02:35.909> using

some abuse or maybe a little kid using
it<00:02:36.569> who<00:02:36.810> hasn't<00:02:37.230> learned<00:02:37.829> how<00:02:38.129> to<00:02:38.269> take<00:02:39.269> care

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
it who hasn't learned how to take care

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.539 
it who hasn't learned how to take care
of<00:02:39.569> it<00:02:39.689> properly<00:02:39.930> they<00:02:40.799> may<00:02:41.069> have<00:02:41.340> been

of it properly they may have been

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.080 
of it properly they may have been
adjusting<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.389> top<00:02:42.719> twisty<00:02:43.379> cap<00:02:43.680> now<00:02:44.549> what<00:02:44.879> I

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
adjusting this top twisty cap now what I

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.059 
adjusting this top twisty cap now what I
need<00:02:45.329> you<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.629> know<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.049> this<00:02:46.409> is<00:02:46.470> not<00:02:46.859> to

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
need you to know is that this is not to

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.849 
need you to know is that this is not to
be<00:02:47.220> touched<00:02:47.629> because<00:02:48.629> when<00:02:49.079> we<00:02:49.200> loosen<00:02:49.650> this

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
be touched because when we loosen this

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.670 
be touched because when we loosen this
or<00:02:50.099> tighten<00:02:50.669> it<00:02:50.730> too<00:02:50.939> much<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:52.139> cork<00:02:52.470> inside

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
or tighten it too much the cork inside

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.089 
or tighten it too much the cork inside
there<00:02:53.480> shifts<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.659> little<00:02:54.900> bit<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.349> we<00:02:55.919> need

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
there shifts a little bit and we need

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.159 
there shifts a little bit and we need
that<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.310> be<00:02:56.609> in<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.730> exact<00:02:57.239> right<00:02:57.450> spot<00:02:57.510> so

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:58.169 
that to be in the exact right spot so

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.140 
that to be in the exact right spot so
that<00:02:58.349> will<00:02:58.500> be<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:58.799> tune<00:02:59.189> now<00:02:59.849> we'll<00:03:00.030> be

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
that will be on tune now we'll be

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.270 
that will be on tune now we'll be
learning<00:03:00.389> a<00:03:00.659> lot<00:03:00.870> more<00:03:00.930> about<00:03:01.200> tuning<00:03:02.099> our

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
learning a lot more about tuning our

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.190 
learning a lot more about tuning our
flutes<00:03:02.669> in<00:03:02.909> other<00:03:03.239> videos<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:04.049> will<00:03:04.169> be

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
flutes in other videos that will be

flutes in other videos that will be
coming<00:03:04.319> up<00:03:04.799> within<00:03:05.010> your<00:03:05.370> lessons<00:03:06.209> here<00:03:06.450> on

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
coming up within your lessons here on

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.500 
coming up within your lessons here on
this<00:03:06.720> site<00:03:07.019> but<00:03:07.680> for<00:03:07.739> today<00:03:08.280> let's<00:03:09.030> just<00:03:09.329> see

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
this site but for today let's just see

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.280 
this site but for today let's just see
if<00:03:09.599> we<00:03:09.659> can<00:03:09.780> remember<00:03:10.519> that<00:03:11.519> if<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:12.049> will<00:03:13.049> take

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
if we can remember that if you will take

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.219 
if we can remember that if you will take
your<00:03:13.500> tuning<00:03:13.889> rod<00:03:14.120> put<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.299> in<00:03:15.510> there<00:03:15.959> and

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:16.229 
your tuning rod put it in there and

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:19.550 
your tuning rod put it in there and
check<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.799> see<00:03:17.069> that<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.329> line<00:03:18.599> is<00:03:18.870> right<00:03:19.260> in

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
check to see that the line is right in

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.809 
check to see that the line is right in
the<00:03:19.680> middle<00:03:19.709> then<00:03:20.549> you<00:03:21.000> are<00:03:21.680> just<00:03:22.680> fine<00:03:23.489> and

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
the middle then you are just fine and

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.550 
the middle then you are just fine and
you<00:03:23.940> don't<00:03:24.060> need<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.329> worry<00:03:24.599> about<00:03:24.870> any<00:03:25.109> tuning

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
you don't need to worry about any tuning

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.330 
you don't need to worry about any tuning
problems<00:03:28.099> if<00:03:29.099> by<00:03:29.940> chance<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:31.470> line<00:03:31.739> is<00:03:32.069> very

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
problems if by chance the line is very

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.030 
problems if by chance the line is very
much<00:03:32.639> off<00:03:32.940> from<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.449> middle<00:03:33.659> on<00:03:33.930> your<00:03:34.709> flute

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
much off from the middle on your flute

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.509 
much off from the middle on your flute
what<00:03:35.940> you'll<00:03:36.090> have<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.359> do<00:03:36.720> is<00:03:37.079> loosen<00:03:37.590> this

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
what you'll have to do is loosen this

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.000 
what you'll have to do is loosen this
screw<00:03:38.579> a<00:03:39.120> little<00:03:39.299> bit<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:42.319> push<00:03:43.319> down<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:43.889> that

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
screw a little bit and push down so that

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.219 
screw a little bit and push down so that
your<00:03:44.159> cork<00:03:44.579> moves<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.239> that<00:03:45.359> will<00:03:45.569> push<00:03:45.930> the

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:46.229 
your cork moves and that will push the

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:49.159 
your cork moves and that will push the
line<00:03:46.440> lower<00:03:47.030> now<00:03:48.030> if<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.569> line<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:48.959> already

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
line lower now if the line is already

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.069 
line lower now if the line is already
too<00:03:49.739> low<00:03:50.040> then<00:03:50.609> what<00:03:50.879> you<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.239> do<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:51.780> take

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
too low then what you have to do is take

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.429 
too low then what you have to do is take
your<00:03:52.760> tuning<00:03:53.760> rod<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.299> bring<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.840> inside<00:03:55.199> here

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
your tuning rod and bring it inside here

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.369 
your tuning rod and bring it inside here
and<00:03:55.680> push<00:03:56.389> fairly<00:03:57.389> hard<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.079> will<00:03:58.229> move

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
and push fairly hard and that will move

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.080 
and push fairly hard and that will move
the<00:03:58.590> cork<00:03:58.829> inside<00:03:58.979> now<00:03:59.760> I<00:04:00.290> had<00:04:01.699> some<00:04:02.699> teachers

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
the cork inside now I had some teachers

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.759 
the cork inside now I had some teachers
when<00:04:03.329> I<00:04:03.359> was<00:04:03.599> younger<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:04.079> taught<00:04:04.290> me<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.620> do

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
when I was younger that taught me to do

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.710 
when I was younger that taught me to do
this<00:04:04.949> and<00:04:05.280> as<00:04:05.639> I've<00:04:06.060> gotten<00:04:06.389> older<00:04:06.689> and

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
this and as I've gotten older and

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.719 
this and as I've gotten older and
learned<00:04:06.989> more<00:04:07.199> about<00:04:07.260> flutes<00:04:07.859> I've<00:04:08.159> learned

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:08.729 
learned more about flutes I've learned

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.610 
learned more about flutes I've learned
that<00:04:09.060> really<00:04:09.389> we<00:04:09.599> shouldn't<00:04:09.870> be<00:04:10.049> touching

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
that really we shouldn't be touching

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.309 
that really we shouldn't be touching
this<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:12.180> even<00:04:12.359> though<00:04:12.599> I've<00:04:12.750> just<00:04:12.780> shown<00:04:13.290> you

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
this so even though I've just shown you

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.949 
this so even though I've just shown you
how<00:04:13.829> to<00:04:13.859> take<00:04:14.280> care<00:04:14.729> of<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:15.000> problem<00:04:15.810> yourself

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
how to take care of the problem yourself

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.699 
how to take care of the problem yourself
I<00:04:16.650> don't<00:04:17.430> really<00:04:17.699> recommend<00:04:18.289> trying<00:04:19.289> it<00:04:19.560> or

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
I don't really recommend trying it or

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.120 
I don't really recommend trying it or
doing<00:04:19.889> it<00:04:20.070> very<00:04:20.370> often<00:04:20.909> so<00:04:21.539> if<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:22.500> notice

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
doing it very often so if you notice

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.250 
doing it very often so if you notice
that<00:04:23.340> your<00:04:23.490> line<00:04:23.940> is<00:04:24.210> not<00:04:24.870> in

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
that your line is not in
