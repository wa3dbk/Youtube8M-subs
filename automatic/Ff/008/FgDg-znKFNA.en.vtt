00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.680

which<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.549> burgundy<00:00:55.940> in<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:56.180> of<00:00:56.239> itself<00:00:56.479> has

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
which the burgundy in and of itself has

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.780 
which the burgundy in and of itself has
been<00:00:56.839> largely<00:00:57.229> discontinued<00:00:58.159> but<00:00:58.610> it's

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
been largely discontinued but it's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.890 
been largely discontinued but it's
basically<00:01:00.100> it's<00:01:01.100> not<00:01:01.339> technically<00:01:02.239> burgundy

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
basically it's not technically burgundy

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.250 
basically it's not technically burgundy
it's<00:01:03.140> just<00:01:03.409> a<00:01:03.559> dark<00:01:03.920> Auburn<00:01:04.519> color<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.260> then

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
it's just a dark Auburn color and then

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.830 
it's just a dark Auburn color and then
on<00:01:06.920> top<00:01:07.190> of<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:07.430> you've<00:01:07.760> got<00:01:08.000> a<00:01:08.030> mix<00:01:08.450> of<00:01:08.660> a

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
on top of that you've got a mix of a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.340 
on top of that you've got a mix of a
medium<00:01:09.260> Auburn<00:01:09.800> and<00:01:10.090> dark<00:01:11.090> copper<00:01:11.750> highlight

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
medium Auburn and dark copper highlight

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.460 
medium Auburn and dark copper highlight
so<00:01:13.100> very<00:01:13.460> pretty<00:01:13.820> I<00:01:14.030> do<00:01:14.360> think<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.900> name<00:01:15.200> is

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
so very pretty I do think the name is

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.500 
so very pretty I do think the name is
slightly<00:01:16.100> misleading<00:01:16.550> because<00:01:17.000> when<00:01:17.210> I<00:01:17.240> think

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
slightly misleading because when I think

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.150 
slightly misleading because when I think
of<00:01:17.570> garnets<00:01:17.930> I<00:01:18.020> think<00:01:18.230> of<00:01:18.320> more<00:01:18.500> like<00:01:18.830> blue

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
of garnets I think of more like blue

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.140 
of garnets I think of more like blue
based<00:01:19.400> fred's<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.780> this<00:01:21.650> is<00:01:21.860> definitely<00:01:22.640> not

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
based fred's and this is definitely not

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.690 
based fred's and this is definitely not
a<00:01:23.450> blue<00:01:23.750> based<00:01:23.960> red<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.530> definitely<00:01:25.040> has<00:01:25.250> lots

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
a blue based red it definitely has lots

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.510 
a blue based red it definitely has lots
of<00:01:25.850> copper<00:01:26.210> tones<00:01:26.450> in<00:01:26.720> it<00:01:26.810> but<00:01:27.740> overall<00:01:28.130> it's

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
of copper tones in it but overall it's

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.480 
of copper tones in it but overall it's
very<00:01:28.790> very<00:01:29.510> pretty<00:01:29.900> and<00:01:30.200> it's<00:01:31.040> highlighted

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
very very pretty and it's highlighted

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.600 
very very pretty and it's highlighted
without<00:01:32.090> being<00:01:32.420> crazy<00:01:32.870> highlighted<00:01:33.610> it's

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
without being crazy highlighted it's

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.700 
without being crazy highlighted it's
just<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:34.970> very<00:01:35.570> very<00:01:35.810> beautiful<00:01:35.960> color<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.470> I

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
just a very very beautiful color and I

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.950 
just a very very beautiful color and I
think<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:37.040> works<00:01:37.250> very<00:01:37.490> well<00:01:38.000> with<00:01:38.510> this

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
think it works very well with this

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.750 
think it works very well with this
particular<00:01:39.320> style<00:01:39.830> so<00:01:40.400> if<00:01:40.520> you're<00:01:40.640> looking

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
particular style so if you're looking

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.810 
particular style so if you're looking
for<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:41.210> red<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:42.740> isn't<00:01:43.040> too<00:01:43.250> light<00:01:43.520> or<00:01:43.730> too

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
for a red that isn't too light or too

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.390 
for a red that isn't too light or too
coppery<00:01:44.570> or<00:01:45.729> too<00:01:46.729> intense<00:01:47.180> this<00:01:48.020> is<00:01:48.290> a<00:01:48.860> great

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
coppery or too intense this is a great

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.390 
coppery or too intense this is a great
choice<00:01:50.560> it's<00:01:51.560> also<00:01:51.680> a<00:01:51.830> good<00:01:51.950> choice<00:01:52.130> for

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
choice it's also a good choice for

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.000 
choice it's also a good choice for
anybody<00:01:52.640> who's<00:01:53.000> normally<00:01:53.690> into<00:01:54.530> brunette

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
anybody who's normally into brunette

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.240 
anybody who's normally into brunette
wigs<00:01:55.370> who<00:01:56.240> wants<00:01:56.540> to<00:01:56.659> venture<00:01:57.020> into<00:01:57.260> Reds<00:01:57.830> I

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
wigs who wants to venture into Reds I

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.830 
wigs who wants to venture into Reds I
think<00:01:58.820> that<00:01:58.940> this<00:01:59.060> would<00:01:59.210> be<00:01:59.330> a<00:01:59.360> very<00:01:59.510> safe

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
think that this would be a very safe

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.620 
think that this would be a very safe
choice<00:02:00.070> because<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.220> is<00:02:01.340> quite<00:02:01.850> dark<00:02:02.150> as<00:02:02.420> you

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
choice because it is quite dark as you

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.080 
choice because it is quite dark as you
can<00:02:02.810> tell<00:02:02.990> unless<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.430> sunlight<00:02:04.850> is<00:02:05.060> shining

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
can tell unless the sunlight is shining

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.030 
can tell unless the sunlight is shining
directly<00:02:05.510> on<00:02:05.930> it<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:06.260> that's<00:02:06.380> really<00:02:06.770> no

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
directly on it and that's really no

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.749 
directly on it and that's really no
different<00:02:07.070> than<00:02:07.490> most<00:02:07.670> wigs<00:02:08.590> so<00:02:09.590> this<00:02:10.310> wig

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
different than most wigs so this wig

think<00:04:06.500> that<00:04:06.820> it<00:04:07.820> tends<00:04:08.180> to<00:04:08.470> help<00:04:09.470> give<00:04:09.709> it<00:04:09.739> a

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
think that it tends to help give it a

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.470 
think that it tends to help give it a
little<00:04:09.980> bit<00:04:10.100> of<00:04:10.190> boost<00:04:10.489> so<00:04:10.880> that<00:04:11.030> way<00:04:11.150> it<00:04:11.269> sort

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
little bit of boost so that way it sort

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.920 
little bit of boost so that way it sort
of<00:04:11.540> evens<00:04:11.900> out<00:04:12.050> the<00:04:12.470> proportions<00:04:13.310> of<00:04:13.489> my<00:04:13.610> face

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
of evens out the proportions of my face

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.509 
of evens out the proportions of my face
however<00:04:14.930> this<00:04:15.290> might<00:04:15.530> be<00:04:15.709> a<00:04:15.860> lot<00:04:16.220> of<00:04:16.250> volume

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
however this might be a lot of volume

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.880 
however this might be a lot of volume
for<00:04:17.030> somebody<00:04:17.450> who's<00:04:17.600> got<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:17.840> small<00:04:18.140> frame<00:04:18.470> so
