00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.939 
have a character you've drawn and you've
said<00:00:15.120> you're<00:00:15.420> not<00:00:15.630> good<00:00:16.049> with<00:00:16.080> drawing<00:00:16.650> and

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
said you're not good with drawing and

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.189 
said you're not good with drawing and
you<00:00:17.070> mostly<00:00:17.369> do<00:00:17.609> still<00:00:17.910> life<00:00:18.090> or<00:00:18.270> anatomically

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
you mostly do still life or anatomically

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.380 
you mostly do still life or anatomically
correct<00:00:19.350> poses<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.070> faces<00:00:20.490> but<00:00:20.760> from<00:00:21.000> time<00:00:21.240> to

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
correct poses and faces but from time to

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.490 
correct poses and faces but from time to
time<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.720> try<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:21.990> create<00:00:22.199> something

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
time you try and create something

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.920 
time you try and create something
stylized<00:00:23.070> then<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:23.970> ask<00:00:24.150> what's<00:00:24.390> bad<00:00:24.630> and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
stylized then you ask what's bad and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.650 
stylized then you ask what's bad and
what's<00:00:25.170> good<00:00:25.500> well<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.460> don't<00:00:27.300> think<00:00:27.359> you're

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
what's good well I don't think you're

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.660 
what's good well I don't think you're
that<00:00:27.840> bad<00:00:28.050> at<00:00:28.199> drawing<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.189> think<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
that bad at drawing but I think the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.790 
that bad at drawing but I think the
biggest<00:00:29.880> issue<00:00:30.179> lies<00:00:30.599> with<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.199> thinking

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
biggest issue lies with you thinking

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.010 
biggest issue lies with you thinking
that<00:00:32.149> anatomically<00:00:33.149> correct<00:00:33.329> poses<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
that anatomically correct poses and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.380 
that anatomically correct poses and
faces<00:00:34.410> are<00:00:34.590> very<00:00:34.860> different<00:00:35.160> than<00:00:35.579> doing

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
faces are very different than doing

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.350 
faces are very different than doing
something<00:00:36.690> stylized<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.090> it's<00:00:39.090> something

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
something stylized and it's something

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.270 
something stylized and it's something
I've<00:00:39.660> heard<00:00:39.870> before<00:00:40.110> where<00:00:40.800> sometimes<00:00:41.100> people

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
I've heard before where sometimes people

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.270 
I've heard before where sometimes people
will<00:00:41.730> say<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.540> are<00:00:42.719> doing<00:00:43.110> stylized<00:00:43.890> stuff

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
will say they are doing stylized stuff

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.869 
will say they are doing stylized stuff
as<00:00:44.550> if<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:46.289> throw<00:00:46.710> all<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.430> rules<00:00:47.460> out

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
as if it's like throw all the rules out

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.290 
as if it's like throw all the rules out
the<00:00:48.120> window<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.510> don't<00:00:48.719> need<00:00:49.079> them

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
the window you don't need them

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.290 
the window you don't need them
you're<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.710> going<00:00:52.710> wild<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.550> anything<00:00:54.090> goes

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
you're just going wild and anything goes

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.900 
you're just going wild and anything goes
and<00:00:54.629> maybe<00:00:55.350> there<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> style<00:00:56.340> where<00:00:56.670> that's

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
and maybe there is a style where that's

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.470 
and maybe there is a style where that's
okay

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
okay

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.950 
okay
but<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.980> most<00:00:59.160> part<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.699> would<00:01:00.300> say<00:01:00.570> that's

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
but for the most part I would say that's

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.680 
but for the most part I would say that's
a<00:01:01.170> bad<00:01:01.440> way<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.770> think<00:01:02.640> about<00:01:02.820> style<00:01:03.359> and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
a bad way to think about style and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.460 
a bad way to think about style and
rather<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:05.010> would<00:01:05.689> encourage<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.960> think<00:01:07.320> of

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
rather I would encourage you to think of

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.550 
rather I would encourage you to think of
it<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:07.820> style<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.659> icing<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> cake

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
it like style is the icing on the cake

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.609 
it like style is the icing on the cake
and<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.310> cake<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.090> foundations<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
and the cake is the foundations so the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.350 
and the cake is the foundations so the
anatomically<00:01:14.490> correct<00:01:14.780> face<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
anatomically correct face the the

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.390 
anatomically correct face the the
proportion<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.570> perspective<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.530> anatomy

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
proportion the perspective the anatomy

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.390 
proportion the perspective the anatomy
all<00:01:20.759> these<00:01:21.240> things<00:01:21.600> are<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.530> cake<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.979> you

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
all these things are the cake and you

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.719 
all these things are the cake and you
want<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.700> cake<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:24.240> done<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:25.259> if<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:26.549> think

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
want the cake to be done so if you think

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.600 
want the cake to be done so if you think
of<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.659> way<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.340> little

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
of it the way you have it it's a little

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.270 
of it the way you have it it's a little
bit<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:29.970> your<00:01:30.180> foundation<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.960> weak<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.619> this

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
bit like your foundation is weak in this

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.660 
bit like your foundation is weak in this

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.080

so<00:01:33.329> maybe<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.560> cake<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.070> you've<00:01:35.579> got<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.909> cake

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
so maybe the cake is you've got the cake

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.060 
so maybe the cake is you've got the cake
batter<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.570> put<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> oven<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.590> it's

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
batter you put it in the oven and it's

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.039 
batter you put it in the oven and it's
not<00:01:38.280> done<00:01:38.579> yet<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.939> still<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> liquid<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
not done yet it's still a liquid and

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.380 
not done yet it's still a liquid and
then<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.710> took<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.130> out<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> oven<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.909> you

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
then you took it out of the oven and you

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.539 
then you took it out of the oven and you
added<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.990> style<00:01:43.409> which<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:43.979> icing<00:01:44.520> on

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
added the style which is the icing on

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.490 
added the style which is the icing on
top<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.869> cake<00:01:46.140> batter<00:01:46.380> now<00:01:47.189> if<00:01:47.549> you

all<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.329> icing<00:02:00.869> which<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.469> style<00:02:01.770> that

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
all this icing which is the style that

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.789 
all this icing which is the style that
you<00:02:02.159> put<00:02:02.430> on<00:02:02.549> top<00:02:02.990> but<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.259> no<00:02:04.469> structure

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
you put on top but you have no structure

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.510 
you put on top but you have no structure
beneath<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.719> if<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.710> have<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.369> know<00:02:08.489> a

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
beneath it but if you have you know a

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.260 
beneath it but if you have you know a
nice<00:02:08.849> cake<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:11.310> has<00:02:11.489> no<00:02:11.700> icing<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.209> you

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
nice cake and it has no icing and you

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.110 
nice cake and it has no icing and you
have<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.480> nice<00:02:12.629> cake<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.110> spice

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
have a nice cake and a spice

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.089 
have a nice cake and a spice
probably<00:02:15.120> more<00:02:15.360> people<00:02:15.810> will<00:02:16.500> prefer<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
probably more people will prefer the

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.190 
probably more people will prefer the
cake<00:02:17.310> with<00:02:17.819> icing<00:02:18.120> unless<00:02:18.780> they<00:02:19.019> have

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
cake with icing unless they have

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.710 
cake with icing unless they have
something<00:02:19.879> maybe<00:02:20.879> they<00:02:21.090> don't<00:02:21.300> like<00:02:21.450> sweet

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
something maybe they don't like sweet

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.040 
something maybe they don't like sweet
stuff<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.879> yeah<00:02:23.879> well<00:02:24.450> then<00:02:24.629> maybe<00:02:24.810> they

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
stuff and yeah well then maybe they

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.199 
stuff and yeah well then maybe they
wouldn't<00:02:25.379> but<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.430> know<00:02:26.550> in<00:02:26.760> most<00:02:26.910> cases

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
wouldn't but you know in most cases

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.509 
wouldn't but you know in most cases
people<00:02:27.690> prefer<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.200> appeal<00:02:28.530> but<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.190> needs

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
people prefer the appeal but it needs

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.420 
people prefer the appeal but it needs
that<00:02:29.940> structure<00:02:30.480> underneath<00:02:31.019> so<00:02:31.680> what<00:02:32.310> I'm

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
that structure underneath so what I'm

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.289 
that structure underneath so what I'm
really<00:02:32.959> getting<00:02:33.959> at<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.319> you<00:02:35.069> cannot<00:02:35.640> think<00:02:36.060> of

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
really getting at is you cannot think of

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.600 
really getting at is you cannot think of
it<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:36.750> well<00:02:37.560> I'm<00:02:37.799> gonna<00:02:38.069> throw<00:02:38.459> everything

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
it like well I'm gonna throw everything

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.059 
it like well I'm gonna throw everything
out<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.180> window<00:02:39.470> when<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.650> comes<00:02:40.890> to

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
out the window when it comes to

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.940 
out the window when it comes to
proportions<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.819> Anatomy<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.989> when<00:02:43.379> it<00:02:43.500> does

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
proportions and Anatomy so when it does

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.120 
proportions and Anatomy so when it does
come<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.549> stuff<00:02:45.500> perspective<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.709> one<00:02:46.980> of

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
come to that stuff perspective is one of

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.559 
come to that stuff perspective is one of
the<00:02:47.220> things<00:02:47.459> I'd<00:02:47.610> really<00:02:47.970> encourage<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.540> to

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
the things I'd really encourage you to

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.370 
the things I'd really encourage you to
work<00:02:48.810> on<00:02:49.049> and<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.829> second<00:02:50.250> thing<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:51.380> the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
work on and the second thing is the

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.850 
work on and the second thing is the
anatomy<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.579> anatomy<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:55.290> skull<00:02:55.620> now

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
anatomy the the anatomy of the skull now

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.280 
anatomy the the anatomy of the skull now
the<00:02:56.549> reason<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.090> would<00:02:57.480> encourage<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:58.079> to

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
the reason I would encourage you to

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.430 
the reason I would encourage you to
learn<00:02:59.099> perspective<00:02:59.849> is<00:03:00.079> because<00:03:01.079> you're

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
learn perspective is because you're

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.970 
learn perspective is because you're
actually<00:03:02.209> sort<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.360> doing<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.260> figure<00:03:04.769> in

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
actually sort of doing the figure in

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.910 
actually sort of doing the figure in
perspective<00:03:05.670> anyway<00:03:06.090> you've<00:03:07.019> got<00:03:07.079> it<00:03:07.440> we're

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
perspective anyway you've got it we're

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.300 
perspective anyway you've got it we're
looking<00:03:08.280> down<00:03:08.310> on<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.910> figure<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.360> so<00:03:10.110> if<00:03:11.040> you

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
looking down on the figure and so if you

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.330 
looking down on the figure and so if you
could<00:03:11.459> imagine<00:03:11.549> this<00:03:12.060> figures<00:03:12.450> head

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
could imagine this figures head

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.569 
could imagine this figures head
encapsulated<00:03:14.340> in<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.670> cube<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.870> should<00:03:16.579> it

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
encapsulated in a cube it should it

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.729 
encapsulated in a cube it should it
should<00:03:17.639> fit<00:03:18.120> properly<00:03:18.450> but<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:19.170> one<00:03:19.380> doesn't

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
should fit properly but this one doesn't

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.309 
should fit properly but this one doesn't
the<00:03:20.579> headband<00:03:21.030> isn't<00:03:21.569> following<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.290> the

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
the headband isn't following the the

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.199 
the headband isn't following the the
form<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.519> skull<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.760> there's<00:03:26.940> parts

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
form of the skull so and there's parts

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.759 
form of the skull so and there's parts
where<00:03:27.359> we're<00:03:27.540> looking<00:03:27.660> down<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.319> parts<00:03:28.620> where

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
where we're looking down and parts where

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.170 
where we're looking down and parts where
we're<00:03:28.920> sort<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.220> looking<00:03:29.400> up<00:03:29.760> like<00:03:30.000> the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
we're sort of looking up like the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.309 
we're sort of looking up like the
mechanism<00:03:30.920> in<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.400> same<00:03:32.639> view<00:03:33.420> as<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:34.079> rest

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
mechanism in the same view as the rest

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.470 
mechanism in the same view as the rest
of<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.920> hair<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.639> headband<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.209> stuff

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
of the hair and the headband and stuff

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.970 
of the hair and the headband and stuff
so<00:03:37.790> it's<00:03:38.790> gonna<00:03:39.060> be<00:03:39.269> more<00:03:39.540> work<00:03:39.569> but<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.560> would

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
so it's gonna be more work but I would

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.120 
so it's gonna be more work but I would
encourage<00:03:41.849> you<00:03:42.299> to<00:03:42.329> put<00:03:42.540> style<00:03:43.260> on<00:03:43.560> hold<00:03:43.859> for

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
encourage you to put style on hold for

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.270 
encourage you to put style on hold for
now

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
now

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.330 
now
or<00:03:44.489> at<00:03:44.609> least<00:03:45.470> do<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.620> style<00:03:46.889> thing<00:03:47.130> that's

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
or at least do the style thing that's

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.379 
or at least do the style thing that's
fine

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
fine

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.349 
fine
but<00:03:49.290> don't<00:03:49.739> ask<00:03:49.950> for<00:03:50.190> critiques<00:03:50.609> on<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:51.000> just

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
but don't ask for critiques on that just

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.000 
but don't ask for critiques on that just
yet<00:03:51.450> because<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.079> really<00:03:52.560> need<00:03:52.769> to<00:03:52.889> be

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
yet because you really need to be

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.190 
yet because you really need to be
working<00:03:53.250> on<00:03:53.459> your<00:03:53.669> foundations<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:54.780> really

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
working on your foundations you really

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.870 
working on your foundations you really
need<00:03:55.349> to<00:03:55.500> be<00:03:55.620> working<00:03:55.829> on<00:03:56.630> this<00:03:57.630> Anatomy<00:03:58.880> on

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
need to be working on this Anatomy on

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.050 
need to be working on this Anatomy on
your<00:04:00.120> anatomy<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.630> anatomically<00:04:01.410> correct

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
your anatomy and anatomically correct

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.690 
your anatomy and anatomically correct
head<00:04:03.060> structure<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:04.130> I've<00:04:05.130> put<00:04:05.370> out<00:04:05.489> some

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
head structure and I've put out some

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.110 
head structure and I've put out some
videos<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.180> cover<00:04:06.419> that<00:04:07.250> but<00:04:08.250> yeah<00:04:08.489> work<00:04:08.880> on

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
videos that cover that but yeah work on

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.199 
videos that cover that but yeah work on
that<00:04:09.359> and<00:04:09.540> try<00:04:09.709> not<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:10.769> think<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:11.310> style<00:04:11.940> as

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
that and try not to think of style as

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.300 
that and try not to think of style as
anything<00:04:12.900> more<00:04:12.930> than<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.590> icing<00:04:14.010> on<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.160> cake

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
anything more than the icing on the cake

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.690 
anything more than the icing on the cake
and<00:04:14.730> it's<00:04:15.359> the<00:04:15.599> last<00:04:15.870> part<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.739> puzzle<00:04:16.950> so

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
and it's the last part of the puzzle so

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.310 
and it's the last part of the puzzle so
the<00:04:18.329> first<00:04:18.599> part<00:04:18.840> is<00:04:19.049> all<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.880> getting<00:04:21.810> stuff

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
the first part is all the getting stuff

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.250 
the first part is all the getting stuff
to<00:04:22.740> look<00:04:22.890> correct<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.700> then<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.570> style<00:04:24.930> is

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
to look correct and then the style is

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.500 
to look correct and then the style is
just<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.830> know<00:04:26.000> tweaking<00:04:27.000> it<00:04:27.150> at

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
just you know tweaking it at

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.990 
just you know tweaking it at
and<00:04:27.800> getting<00:04:28.800> rid<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.100> some<00:04:29.220> rules<00:04:29.640> that<00:04:29.760> you

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
and getting rid of some rules that you

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.420 
and getting rid of some rules that you
already<00:04:30.240> need<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.350> know<00:04:31.560> you<00:04:31.980> need<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.280> know

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
already need to know you need to know

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.220 
already need to know you need to know
the<00:04:32.580> rules<00:04:32.790> very<00:04:32.910> well<00:04:33.210> before<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:33.900> get<00:04:34.080> rid

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
the rules very well before you get rid

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.710 
the rules very well before you get rid
of<00:04:34.260> them<00:04:34.440> and<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:35.610> same<00:04:35.790> applies<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.150> anyone

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
of them and the same applies to anyone

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.400 
of them and the same applies to anyone
who<00:04:37.020> is<00:04:37.230> just<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:38.430> know<00:04:38.550> studying<00:04:39.060> or<00:04:40.020> looking

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
who is just you know studying or looking

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.130 
who is just you know studying or looking
at<00:04:40.500> cartoons<00:04:40.950> or<00:04:41.220> manga<00:04:41.700> and<00:04:41.900> they<00:04:42.900> don't

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
at cartoons or manga and they don't

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.790 
at cartoons or manga and they don't
understand<00:04:43.940> reality<00:04:44.940> first<00:04:45.720> that<00:04:46.500> doesn't

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
understand reality first that doesn't

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.200 
understand reality first that doesn't
mean<00:04:46.920> you<00:04:47.040> need<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.220> be<00:04:47.370> able<00:04:47.550> to<00:04:47.670> draw<00:04:47.880> a<00:04:47.910> photo

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
mean you need to be able to draw a photo

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.540 
mean you need to be able to draw a photo
realistically<00:04:49.110> but<00:04:49.800> you<00:04:49.980> need<00:04:50.160> to<00:04:50.310> understand

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
realistically but you need to understand

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.990 
realistically but you need to understand
anatomy<00:04:53.550> and<00:04:53.810> proportion<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:55.050> perspective

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
anatomy and proportion and perspective

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.690 
anatomy and proportion and perspective
so<00:04:57.000> hope<00:04:57.720> that<00:04:57.930> helped<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:58.430> thanks<00:04:59.430> for
