 founded by murillo in 1660 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.560
 but not so much prefer the compositions moved with abundance of debris 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.730
 the faces of accused profiles with noses of cults and protruding cheekbones 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.950
 the scalps 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.130
 willing 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.440
 in mass of ashes that move with the air 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.760
 while solving the capable

 of Granada was the technical ease and feeling of his teacher Mena 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.810
 and in Seville complete his training under the influences of mountain 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.069
 and above all 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.289
 three European baroque artists 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:14.289
 as was the case with joseph de maple 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.849
 shale we believe in the image 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.679
 Christ of sorrows test and ana 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.039
 will greatly influence 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.039
 in the style of the teacher 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.809
 the style of fruit cristina micÃ³ as long trips giving her work a pot 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.809
 impressionism that seem clear future times 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:44.199
 the work of his workshop 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:48.619
 sometimes complicated to separate from the teacher's own kept a quality 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:51.659
 of remarkable average production always worthy 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.019
 however the teacher's hand is clearly said to notice 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.269
 in masterpieces 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.409
 like the one we have in the image 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.170
 the Christ of charity is one of those examples of the teacher's ability 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.620
 of using elements that you acquired during your history-making experiment

 in contact with notable authors 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.459

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.459
 without stopping to show its own and unmistakable style 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.039
 the christ of charity is one of his images with more salient features 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.019
 with bloody profusion iranzo highlighted 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.729
 is more typical of other schools and mentality 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:33.209
 although always under the typical formal appearance of clothing style 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.959
 the Christ of charity our Jesus

 the opposition is close 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.569
 but the body already seems deeply mistreated 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:49.709
 of the cobos 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.899

 the shroud lacks flights 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.349
 causing a feeling of heaviness 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.269
 being soaked in blood 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.909
 having on the left hip 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.539
 to let us better appreciate the family 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.649
 but the characteristic world or the usual soup is not appreciated 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:25.930
 holding on just 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.919
