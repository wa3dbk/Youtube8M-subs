00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:03.020

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:13.650
 Yeah. Nice to meet you, lapping man. 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.540
 Lego Marvel Super Heroes Warcraft What's a left turn vehicles into the trucks 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.029
 This trolling 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.029
 It's an Asshield Shield vehicle. 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.029
 What is trust in trust? 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:32.740
 Argumentator 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:34.900
 This is why I appeal to a sinner . Yes, this time, Captain America Winter 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.200
 Give me the nurses in the soldier. 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:42.730
 You take this truck here and use it. 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:45.720
 When you escape, you make a hole through the hole and run away. 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.720
 I think that's wrong. 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.350
 It's a good shield vehicle. 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.940
 Here, too Shield car north 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.880
 Siren is up. 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.180
 Here we go. 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.020
 It's a dark vehicle. 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.020
 Ahahaha 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.790
 Ah , it looks like this. 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.790
 It looks almost the same as the forest ron. 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.480
 Prist 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.480
 It looks like 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:41.200
 I can not compare it to two. 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.200
 I can not do this either. 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.830
 U 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.030
 5 I've seen a lot of things. 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.920
 Como no such thing going racing once again beating 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.920
 I'll finish it. 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:11.410
 It's a bit more durable than a police truck. 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:13.440
 Trucks in light trucks are lightly exhausted, but they are completely destroyed. 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.440
 5 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:30.599
 I do not have that racing once . 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.599
 It's hard for us. 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.040
 Gettin 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:44.530
 It's too bad to start . It's okay if it gets accelerated, 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.349
 That came came beggars 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.340
 I usually write. 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:55.530
 5 Get better durability . Good for you. 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.530
 This is the problem here, we have to go beyond us. 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.290
 Joas. I knew it . It's not going to crumble one day. Do not go. 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.760
 I saw Raptor, what does that mean? 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.330
 I have to find water. 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.330
 POSCO I'm sorry for the sauce. 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.700
 Subtitle truck art, no turbo or anything. 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:40.069
 The rice is turned off and the tea tends to be thick and the tea keeps going 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:44.769
 Now Kraft multiple bots'll set of wheels 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.769
 I do not need to see more. 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.370
 Jours 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.370
 5 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.310

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.140

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:09.490
