00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.450
 but friends we are about to put the 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.450
 timing belt on an engine 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:16.519
 diesel traffic and showing the points 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.519
 that carries the crankshaft 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.859
 camshaft 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.330
 bombay hector 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:33.510
 combining 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.570
 those three points in belt studies 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.149
 the oil pump that others throw at 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.480
 run in this case our belt already 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.960
 has the points marked to put it 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.110
 easy let's say 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.579
 in this sector and here below have the 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.649
 stork 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.980
 placing those three points in their 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.840
 position would already be put 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.989
 the timing belt we have to 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:06.269
 have the strap tightened the stretch strap 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.269
 to the maximum so that the strap between 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.690
 there the belt would already be in position 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.510
 We stretch out to work stretches with 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.510
 one key d 13 13 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.840
 to be able to appreciate fun 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.810
 AHA 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.720
 of how to work once you are given the 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.430
 attention they adjust the stretch strap 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.430
 this would be put to the part d 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.299
 distribution of the kingdom says 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.980
 to place the battle because being a 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.980
 overflow the loose 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.380
 this did not put the distribution 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.380
 My reader readied 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.810
 quality or multiple layer of admission 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.230
 recovered gas we are putting now 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.690
 Shady and water pump was changed 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.000
 the big problem that this truck had 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.000
 were the axes 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.400
 an oil pump that melted 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.900
 that would be a measure I would say but 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.140
 They put a smaller one on the teles 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.510
 devious and morphed ate in the stria 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.250
 in the center of exact 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.670
 then the lubrication was left 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:48.270
 oil pump did not locate it 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.360
 patinated there and melted connecting rod 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:55.110
 merged banking 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.810
 and it's a disaster on the whole engine already 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.200
 we almost have it liquidated 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.200
 quite 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.420
 and we are getting closer and closer to putting in 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.420
 March 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.630
 the traffic seat has put an engine 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.910
 we had some little problem with the pump 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.910
 Inyectora some cables 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.750
 I 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.200
 now
