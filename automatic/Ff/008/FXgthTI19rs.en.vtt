00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:05.720
 the alternate path is activated regardless of the presence of 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.630
 antibodies 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.840
 g3 undergoes an intro lysis producing c3 and ds3 a 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.470
 if you remember cereté 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.820
 st is also an intermediate product of the classical way 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:28.429
 the complex formed by faith 4 b and c in prose is known as convertase dc3 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:32.470
 your substrate this e3 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.470
 here in my province the one that expressed I made three 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.289
 therefore the alternate path can be activated as secondary 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:45.010
 simon of the classic way 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.190
 or also by induced activation today 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.190
 spontaneous 13 3 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.120
 cereté 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.010
 St binds antigens present in the membranes of the target cells 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.840
 it can also bind to normal cells but there the abundance of 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.840
 sialic acid inhibits its action 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.290
 once bound letters v to the antigen the factor that can adhere to c3 and d 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.290
 forming the complex c3 and db 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.550
 in this way the pact of 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.330
 can act on the factor that informants were going the baby fragments 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.060
 and hit 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.490
 the fragment that b stays together makes 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.679
 st forming the c3 yddd complex 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.950
 to work properly it is required that progerin protein according to this 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.229
 complex or else it is disarmed and inhibited 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.250
 to the set of these joined molecules 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.250
 he knows them as convertase dc3 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.880
 its function is to generate more amount of c3 and d and was prey 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.400
 as it happened in the classical way 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.469
 another c3 and d can join the conversation f3 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:18.579
 when it does 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.579
 they already become with seeing pass f5 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.450
 the new cereté complex 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.000
 st dd present canine pet produces c5 apex 5 ba from this 5 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.660
 from here the way forward is the common mechanism of the three tracks 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:51.189
 oo c 6 will join with c5n this generates the expression of hydrophobic domains 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.590
 that allow you to enter the typical Pali habitat 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:03.430
 to this complex will also be joined c7 and c8 this generates a small pore in the 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.539
 membrane 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:12.049
 finally several tenth of a second molecules in to this complex generating a 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.759
 even greater pore 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.759
 from 70 to 100 years old, diameter 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:23.189
 is that so various proteins and water ions enter 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.439
 electrolytes also escape from the cell 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.669
 in this way the cell dies by explosion
