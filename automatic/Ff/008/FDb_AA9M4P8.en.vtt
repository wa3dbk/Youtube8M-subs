00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.010
 as always I suggest you look at the 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.200
 two video essays carefully and then of 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.950
 do these tests each with his own 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.580
 video tutor this test says which part 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.310
 of mitochondria creates more space 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.470
 surface for cellular respiration 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.220
 well you see here an image of the 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.949
 mitochondrion 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.439
 and we can identify the matrix 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.439
 like this area 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:41.420
 well this area called matrix is 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.570
 formed by the inner membrane that is 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.809
 this that folds back on itself 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.059
 through clicks and calls ridges that 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.699
 are intended to increase the 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.900
 useful surface of the laboratory of 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.720
 energy that is the least contrio itself 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.270
 then 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.940
 it is not the matrix that creates more 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.790
 space but you see the membrane here 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.690
 internal membrane internal that creates the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.990
 matrix itself 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.800
 so with this we answered yes to 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.170
 to a 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:20.120
 it is not the matrix but it is the membrane 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:22.280
 internal b we pass to the c tells us 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.480
 what part of the conscious myth creates 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.570
 more space 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.970
 they are not ribosomes because they are 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.280
 ribosome contents in the matrix itself 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.200
 but they have nothing to do with the 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.899
 cellular respiration 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.740
 to draw them we can see here 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:42.880
 put the mitochondria in this position 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.880
 inside the matrix 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.509
 la of mine 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.229
 tern but it is not this that creates more 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.350
 space 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.810
 but as you have seen it is the membrane 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.590
 internal 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.630
 which is this drawn here that creates the 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.539
 more space for i 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.289
 cellular respiration processes with 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.750
 atp training you see here quickly 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.200
 cell respiration summarized 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.220
 as you see it happens inside the 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.790
 mitochondria with the exception of the lysis friend 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.680
 which occurs in the cytoplasm comes into 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.160
 this position all the rest happens 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.030
 inside the inner membrane that 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.700
 encloses the matrix 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.940
 she says the integral proteins of the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.510
 membrane 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.620
 these do not create more space 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.340
 serve to 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.040
 to the transit of substances inside and 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.879
 out of the mitochondria you see them 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:54.220
 represented in this position e 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:56.280
 they function as active protein channels 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.550
 just to allow the passage 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:04.260
 of substances within the matrix 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.260
 which designed here
