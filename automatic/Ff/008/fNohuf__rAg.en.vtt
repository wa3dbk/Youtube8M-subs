shockwaves<00:02:17.959> helix<00:02:18.459> right<00:02:19.459> there<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.980> there

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
shockwaves helix right there so there

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.339 
shockwaves helix right there so there
there<00:02:22.489> it<00:02:22.580> goes

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
there it goes

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:33.230 
there it goes
where<00:02:24.860> is<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:26.230> summer<00:02:27.230> Curtis

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.890 

there<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.900> go<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.770> thing's<00:02:35.010> gonna<00:02:35.310> start

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
there you go so this thing's gonna start

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.540 
there you go so this thing's gonna start
coming<00:02:36.900> down<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.710> I<00:02:37.950> think<00:02:38.220> it's<00:02:38.370> for<00:02:38.520> the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
coming down and I think it's for the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.680 
coming down and I think it's for the
better<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.880> think<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.210> what<00:02:39.360> they're<00:02:39.510> putting

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
better I think that what they're putting

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.410 
better I think that what they're putting
in<00:02:39.870> its<00:02:39.960> place<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.290> gonna<00:02:40.440> be<00:02:40.530> much<00:02:41.040> superior

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
in its place is gonna be much superior

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.730 
in its place is gonna be much superior
so<00:02:42.420> again<00:02:42.960> I'm<00:02:43.110> not<00:02:43.200> really<00:02:43.260> going<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.590> miss<00:02:43.680> it

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
so again I'm not really going to miss it

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.640 
so again I'm not really going to miss it
but<00:02:43.950> it's<00:02:44.100> good<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.400> get<00:02:44.520> my<00:02:44.730> final<00:02:45.420> ride<00:02:46.050> in<00:02:46.320> on

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
but it's good to get my final ride in on

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.250 
but it's good to get my final ride in on
the<00:02:46.770> shockwave<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:48.180> ends<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:48.930> vlog

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260
