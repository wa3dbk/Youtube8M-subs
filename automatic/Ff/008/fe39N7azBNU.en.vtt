sure that when you just we're in
four-four<00:00:27.690> time<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.260> accent<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.220> first

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
four-four time that you accent the first

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.290 
four-four time that you accent the first
beach<00:00:29.850> okay<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.510> it's<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.930> be<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:32.300> okay

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
beach okay so it's going to be one okay

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.149 
beach okay so it's going to be one okay
I'm<00:00:33.479> accounted<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.019> you<00:00:34.159> one-two-three-four

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:35.159 
I'm accounted for you one-two-three-four

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
one like that okay make sure you accent

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.829 
one like that okay make sure you accent
that<00:00:46.139> first<00:00:46.379> beat<00:00:46.999> now<00:00:47.999> if<00:00:48.299> you<00:00:48.420> want<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.690> get

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
that first beat now if you want to get

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:50.329 
that first beat now if you want to get
really<00:00:49.139> sophisticated<00:00:49.589> with<00:00:50.039> these<00:00:50.159> things

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
really sophisticated with these things

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:51.709 
really sophisticated with these things
you<00:00:50.519> can<00:00:50.699> actually<00:00:51.059> teach<00:00:51.269> yourself

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
you can actually teach yourself

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.110 
you can actually teach yourself
syncopation<00:00:52.499> by<00:00:52.620> using<00:00:52.979> that<00:00:53.579> accent

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
syncopation by using that accent

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.799 
syncopation by using that accent
technique<00:00:54.569> unlike<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.949> take<00:00:56.159> every<00:00:56.809> second

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
technique unlike just take every second

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.479 
technique unlike just take every second
beat<00:00:57.959> and<00:00:58.139> accent<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.799> instead<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.069> an<00:00:59.249> axe

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
beat and accent it so instead of an axe

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.270 
beat and accent it so instead of an axe
sending<00:00:59.879> one<00:01:00.089> you<00:01:00.269> could<00:01:00.420> go<00:01:00.569> one<00:01:01.139> two<00:01:01.649> three

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
sending one you could go one two three

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.340 
sending one you could go one two three
four<00:01:02.670> 1234<00:01:04.640> 1234<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.600> I'm<00:01:06.780> catching<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.200> with

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
four 1234 1234 so I'm catching that with

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.680 
four 1234 1234 so I'm catching that with

three<00:01:40.050> four<00:01:49.580> that's<00:01:50.580> one<00:01:50.760> way<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.910> teach

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
three four that's one way to teach

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.540 
three four that's one way to teach
yourself<00:01:51.480> dynamics<00:01:52.340> because<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.400> don't

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
yourself dynamics because you don't

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.330 
yourself dynamics because you don't
always<00:01:53.760> just<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:54.120> playing<00:01:54.450> loud<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.110> time

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
always just be playing loud all the time

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.560 
always just be playing loud all the time
or<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.940> know<00:01:57.060> always<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:58.080> you<00:01:58.590> know<00:01:59.150> soft<00:02:00.150> or

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
or you know always just you know soft or

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.760 
or you know always just you know soft or
somewhere<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:00.990> between<00:02:01.080> you<00:02:01.380> want<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.650> use

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
somewhere in between you want to use

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.310 
somewhere in between you want to use
dynamics<00:02:02.400> and<00:02:02.460> your<00:02:02.580> solos<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.330> I<00:02:03.810> had<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> ton

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
dynamics and your solos that I had a ton

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.870 
dynamics and your solos that I had a ton
of<00:02:04.350> color<00:02:04.650> a<00:02:04.770> ton<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.130> life<00:02:05.370> and<00:02:05.580> it<00:02:05.670> brings

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
of color a ton of life and it brings

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.380 
of color a ton of life and it brings
interest<00:02:06.300> for<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.510> listener<00:02:08.180> so<00:02:09.180> let's<00:02:09.330> go

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
interest for the listener so let's go

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.090 
interest for the listener so let's go
ahead<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.540> do<00:02:09.660> exercise<00:02:10.110> three<00:02:10.440> now<00:02:10.590> I'll<00:02:10.860> do

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.600 

exercise<00:03:18.490> for<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:21.130> is<00:03:21.280> going<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.490> be<00:03:21.580> a

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
exercise for this is going to be a

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.190 
exercise for this is going to be a
combination<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.540> sending<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.020> Diggy

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
combination of a sending and Diggy

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.780 
combination of a sending and Diggy
sending<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:23.770> it<00:03:23.890> is<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.460> most<00:03:24.670> difficult

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
sending and it is the most difficult

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.330 
sending and it is the most difficult
exercise<00:03:25.420> that<00:03:25.540> we've<00:03:25.690> done<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.050> far<00:03:27.360> so<00:03:29.340> what
