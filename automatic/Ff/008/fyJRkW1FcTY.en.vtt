00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
series opposed to my target practice

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.779 
series opposed to my target practice
series<00:00:18.480> we<00:00:18.570> focused<00:00:18.930> more<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.760> accuracies<00:00:20.760> of

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
series we focused more on accuracies of

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.250 
series we focused more on accuracies of
varying<00:00:21.119> ranges<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:21.720> have<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
varying ranges and what have you in the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.779 
varying ranges and what have you in the
shooting<00:00:22.590> range<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:23.220> focus<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.550> more<00:00:23.730> on

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
shooting range this focus is more on

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.120 
shooting range this focus is more on
actual<00:00:24.210> combat<00:00:24.769> demonstrating<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.830> weapon

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
actual combat demonstrating the weapon

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.950 
actual combat demonstrating the weapon
when<00:00:26.460> fired<00:00:26.640> from<00:00:26.670> behind<00:00:26.849> cover<00:00:27.150> showcasing

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
when fired from behind cover showcasing

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.240 
when fired from behind cover showcasing
its<00:00:28.080> damage<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:28.980> on

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
its damage and so on

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.450 
its damage and so on
this<00:00:29.340> will<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.550> done<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.849> insanity<00:00:31.189> so<00:00:32.189> keep

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
this will be done on insanity so keep

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
this will be done on insanity so keep
that<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.640> mind

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.590 

alright<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.129> this<00:00:38.129> weapon<00:00:38.489> as<00:00:38.700> with<00:00:39.360> most

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
alright so this weapon as with most

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.330 
alright so this weapon as with most
weapons<00:00:39.780> benefits<00:00:40.350> greatly<00:00:40.590> from<00:00:40.710> increased

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
weapons benefits greatly from increased

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.400 
weapons benefits greatly from increased
damage<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.930> user<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> longer

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
damage if you like to user to longer

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.600 
damage if you like to user to longer
ranges<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.040> certainly<00:00:44.219> go<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
ranges you can certainly go with the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.920 
ranges you can certainly go with the
scope<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:45.000> weapon<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.360> used<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.750> close

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
scope this weapon can be used to close

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.450 
scope this weapon can be used to close
ranges<00:00:46.320> or<00:00:46.500> long<00:00:46.680> ranges<00:00:47.039> it's<00:00:47.219> actually

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
ranges or long ranges it's actually

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.680 
ranges or long ranges it's actually
quite<00:00:47.640> accurate<00:00:48.050> it<00:00:49.610> doesn't<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.270> huge

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
quite accurate it doesn't have a huge

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.959 
quite accurate it doesn't have a huge
magazine<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.649> has<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.070> 18<00:00:53.520> shots<00:00:53.789> if

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
magazine it has I think 18 shots if

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.430 
magazine it has I think 18 shots if
you're<00:00:54.090> getting<00:00:54.329> lots<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.690> charge<00:00:54.989> shots<00:00:55.230> off

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
you're getting lots of charge shots off

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.420 
you're getting lots of charge shots off
you<00:00:55.620> will<00:00:55.770> burn<00:00:55.920> through<00:00:56.160> its<00:00:56.280> magazine

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
you will burn through its magazine

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.520 
you will burn through its magazine
pretty<00:00:56.910> quickly<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:57.899> an<00:00:57.960> option<00:00:58.379> it's

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
pretty quickly so it's an option it's

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.840 
pretty quickly so it's an option it's
certainly<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:58.829> mandatory<00:00:59.190> but<00:00:59.640> it's<00:00:59.760> an

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
certainly not mandatory but it's an

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.410 
certainly not mandatory but it's an
option

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
option

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.020 
option
yeah<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.590> again<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.520> probably<00:01:02.730> wouldn't

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
yeah and that again I probably wouldn't

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.299 
yeah and that again I probably wouldn't
bother<00:01:03.120> using<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.739> with<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> piercing<00:01:05.159> mod

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
bother using this with a piercing mod

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.950 
bother using this with a piercing mod
unless<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.729> like<00:01:05.880> shooting<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.210> cover<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:06.659> you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
unless you like shooting to cover or you

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.120 
unless you like shooting to cover or you
want<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.200> go<00:01:07.380> through<00:01:07.560> Guardian<00:01:07.830> shields

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
want to go through Guardian shields

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.890 
want to go through Guardian shields
easier<00:01:08.400> or<00:01:08.970> what-have-you<00:01:09.210> were<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:09.750> a

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
easier or what-have-you were just a

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.359 
easier or what-have-you were just a
little<00:01:10.020> more<00:01:10.170> theoretical<00:01:10.950> damage<00:01:11.189> through

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
little more theoretical damage through

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.090 
little more theoretical damage through
bypassing<00:01:12.000> shields<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.920> if<00:01:14.040> you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
bypassing shields up to you and if you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.190 
bypassing shields up to you and if you
like<00:01:14.220> use<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.520> melee<00:01:14.760> go<00:01:15.240> for<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.900> melee

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
like use it in melee go for the melee

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.890 
like use it in melee go for the melee
mod<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:17.189> no<00:01:17.729> mods<00:01:18.049> baseline<00:01:19.049> here<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:19.979> go<00:01:20.900> so

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
mod but no mods baseline here we go so

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.719 
mod but no mods baseline here we go so
and<00:01:22.380> again<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.740> weapon<00:01:23.009> shoots<00:01:23.220> out<00:01:23.340> three

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
and again this weapon shoots out three

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.429 
and again this weapon shoots out three
shots<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> full<00:01:24.479> charge<00:01:24.509> two<00:01:25.049> shots<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
shots on a full charge two shots and a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.870 
shots on a full charge two shots and a
half<00:01:25.530> charge<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.220> does<00:01:26.340> varying<00:01:26.640> damage

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
half charge and it does varying damage

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.640 
half charge and it does varying damage
depending<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.689> does<00:01:27.780> use<00:01:28.020> three

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
depending on that and it does use three

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.080 
depending on that and it does use three
shots<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.070> clip<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> full<00:01:29.640> charge<00:01:29.670> two

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
shots in the clip on a full charge two

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.399 
shots in the clip on a full charge two
and<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> half<00:01:30.420> charge<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:30.930> one<00:01:31.079> otherwise

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
and a half charge and then one otherwise

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.469 
and a half charge and then one otherwise
and<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:32.369> use<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.640> same<00:01:32.850> strategies<00:01:33.299> for

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
and you can use the same strategies for

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.240 
and you can use the same strategies for
this<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.840> would<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.530> charged

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
this that you would with a charged

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.520 
this that you would with a charged
shotgun<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.000> know<00:01:36.119> charged<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:36.990> or<00:01:37.350> behind

shotgun you know charged up or behind
cover<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.040> then<00:01:38.579> fire<00:01:39.560> like<00:01:40.560> so

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.749 

and<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:43.590> really<00:01:43.740> best<00:01:44.039> to<00:01:44.189> try<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.609> try<00:01:44.640> to

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
and it's really best to try it to try to

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.149 
and it's really best to try it to try to
make<00:01:44.880> every<00:01:45.390> shot<00:01:45.600> count<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.920> conserve

make every shot count and to conserve
ammunition<00:01:47.369> with<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.789> because<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.030> will

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
ammunition with this because you will

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.730 
ammunition with this because you will
use<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.539> ammunition<00:01:48.750> at<00:01:49.140> an<00:01:49.259> alarming<00:01:49.710> rate

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
use up ammunition at an alarming rate

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.090 
use up ammunition at an alarming rate
and<00:01:51.469> fire<00:01:52.469> to<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> mail<00:01:52.829> slot<00:01:54.049> if<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.439> mean<00:01:55.859> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
and fire to the mail slot if I mean the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.149 
and fire to the mail slot if I mean the
cluster<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.579> shots<00:01:57.350> has<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.710> know<00:01:58.799> kind<00:01:59.039> of<00:01:59.069> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
cluster of shots has you know kind of a

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.039 
cluster of shots has you know kind of a
spread<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.640> it's<00:02:00.240> difficult<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:00.810> with

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
spread to it it's difficult just with

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.449 
spread to it it's difficult just with
the<00:02:01.170> way<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.649> pellets<00:02:01.950> cluster<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
the way that the pellets cluster the

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:03.949 
the way that the pellets cluster the
bolts<00:02:02.670> cluster<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.509> get<00:02:03.600> attached<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
bolts cluster to get attached to the

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.240 
bolts cluster to get attached to the
mail<00:02:04.079> slot<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.500> gives<00:02:04.619> us<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.740> lot<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.009> ammo

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
mail slot and it gives us a lot of ammo

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.089 
mail slot and it gives us a lot of ammo
so<00:02:05.490> as<00:02:06.240> usual<00:02:06.569> I<00:02:06.959> mean<00:02:07.469> unless<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.709> very

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
so as usual I mean unless it's very

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.729 
so as usual I mean unless it's very
effective<00:02:08.369> against<00:02:09.140> using<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.590> mail

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
effective against using it on the mail

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.440 
effective against using it on the mail
slot<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.220> would<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:11.519> as<00:02:11.670> soon<00:02:11.700> use<00:02:12.000> powers<00:02:12.330> to

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
slot I would just as soon use powers to

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.500 
slot I would just as soon use powers to
finish<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.750> paws<00:02:13.400> up<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.970> mean<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.299> can

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
finish the paws up to you I mean you can

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.430 
finish the paws up to you I mean you can
especially<00:02:15.930> when<00:02:16.049> they<00:02:16.110> get<00:02:16.230> closer

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
especially when they get closer

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:26.030 
especially when they get closer
especially<00:02:17.220> if<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.400> have<00:02:17.549> a<00:02:18.470> scope<00:02:19.470> but<00:02:25.040> even

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
especially if you have a scope but even

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.490 
especially if you have a scope but even
with<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.220> scope<00:02:26.430> just<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.880> way<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
with the scope just the way that the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.170 
with the scope just the way that the
bullets<00:02:28.500> cluster<00:02:28.950> on<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.069> fully<00:02:29.280> charged<00:02:29.730> shot

bullets cluster on a fully charged shot

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.420 
bullets cluster on a fully charged shot
it'll<00:02:31.019> make<00:02:31.140> things<00:02:31.260> problematic<00:02:31.799> there's

it'll make things problematic there's

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.370 
it'll make things problematic there's
something<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.790> keep<00:02:32.879> in<00:02:33.000> mind

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.930 

like<00:03:43.920> so

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.660 

mr.<00:03:48.720> Santo<00:03:49.050> and<00:03:50.060> needs<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.180> Centurion<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:52.670> also

an idea of its damage again shield it's
not<00:04:26.250> spectacular<00:04:26.430> even<00:04:27.120> on<00:04:27.240> a<00:04:27.270> chart<00:04:27.570> shot

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780

it's not really spectacular charge head
shots<00:04:30.060> though<00:04:30.210> will<00:04:30.360> be<00:04:30.390> far<00:04:30.690> more<00:04:30.720> effective

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
shots though will be far more effective

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.360 
shots though will be far more effective
than<00:04:31.410> what<00:04:31.470> I<00:04:31.530> was<00:04:31.740> doing<00:04:31.920> then<00:04:32.040> that<00:04:32.070> was<00:04:32.220> just
