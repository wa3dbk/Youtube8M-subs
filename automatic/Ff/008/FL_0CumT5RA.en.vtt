00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.940
 and today I'll show you let's say this 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.290
 the secret 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:17.070
 pretty little known secret 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:19.650
 which is connected to the mountain of chiliad 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:25.380
 secretly pretty and hidden and not all 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:28.529
 will find and now we will move to it with 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.850
 using code that's because there 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.910
 really very long ride 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:42.390
 no matter how and there will be 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:44.579
 rely here therefore such a cheat on 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.410
 his review is so small without 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.239
 comment 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:54.870
 just demonstrated the code here and 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.550
 Now I will say a few words about 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.079
 this place 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.589
 given mystery fortunately it later even to 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:09.200
 Unfortunately I do not know how to say it right 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:12.960
 Well, this mystery has been on youtube for my 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.710
 Abbas well, only once 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.049
 also 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.450
 bloggers here and unfortunately no one else 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.240
 not aware of this then there can be 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.850
 what kind of foreign people 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.950
 which too 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.680
 parses ati time all nearby related 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.960
 maybe they did but from my Russian 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:43.530
 only one person did here and to 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:48.149
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, our goods were lost to 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.780
 Sorry, so I decided to show it too 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:56.300
 maybe you have already seen this secret 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.090
 No, that is, in fact, it's pretty and 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:04.720
 but let's say a weighty place that too 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:10.400
 connected exactly with chili adam oh damn again 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:13.910
 again maine like stop again dial the code and 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:18.290
 go back to this place them 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:22.240
 beauty here it is here that is 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:33.820
 we just need a little further 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:33.820
 land beauty let 's go here so here 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:43.060
 so now I will show you the place where 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.060
 is located this right here and 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.450
 probably give you a little advice 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.540
 that is, when you dive on the one with 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.740
 the places are just very deep then drive 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.960
 immortality code painkiller 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.840
 so called game can easily 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:07.760
 remember here I give you five minutes and 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.130
 you can dive calmly so it 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:18.650
 the place is pretty well hidden and 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:22.430
 you need to look for it as well, I 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.140
 I hope we can handle it soon 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.140
 just cope because here it is 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.930
 pretty and deeply i would say and 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.680
 hidden well i mean not everyone could 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.510
 find this grille friends with a pass and 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.340
 you know most likely this is a passage 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.430
 associated with the UFO to 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.550
 which appears after passing 90 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.239
 percent that is it is necessary to pass 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.910
 a game of one hundred percent in a thunderstorm in the rain 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.480
 to begin to appear with him and then 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.640
 you can go to my 5 lattice 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.110
 she doesn't seem to fall off then not 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.720
 I do not know 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:10.070
 here but what grating here is this 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:14.900
 fact and even here the lights are on 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:17.390
 there is well it is clear that something is not easy here 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:22.250
 so i remember even there was a mission where to us 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:25.910
 it was necessary in my opinion to cook from there 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.920
 be this is the grille which of the plot 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.350
 the lines 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:34.640
 word but nonetheless I think it all 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:38.810
 very connected very well that's because 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.730
 what even if you take the lead yes here's the map 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.230
 chiliad 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.740
 Now it turns out that indeed a 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:49.340
 somewhere here there are passages maybe so 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.669
 here it goes and comes out here could 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.310
 be we are mistaken maybe it all 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:59.870
 just some freaking grate on 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:03.320
 which does not affect it in any way 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.560
 the gameplay is not on the more secrets still nearby 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:10.550
 related but the fact that there is a grid 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:14.900
 a fact is a fact therefore it can be 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.640
 and beauty yes that is that guy yes 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.419
 who made such a video on this 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.550
 grill 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:25.970
 and he, too, said something like a wave 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.790
 fight on the rocks on the rocks on and it is very 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.700
 beautiful, that is, there is no such thing anywhere 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:36.169
 only in this place as well as it turned out 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:38.690
 there is a secret passage closed but all 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:42.220
 same secret passage so this here 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:46.250
 small place friends this is what is it 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.880
 weighty discovery up to maybe maybe 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.040
 be wrong but 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:56.630
 but no less friends I think it is 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:59.570
 everything has its own peculiarity and secret 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:03.580
 this secret on this all friends thanks 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.580
 for watching all bye
