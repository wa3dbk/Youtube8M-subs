00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.769 
I mean I think when you look back at it
yeah<00:00:26.279> obviously<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:27.359> know<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.630> always

yeah obviously you know that always
seems<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.109> happen<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.470> know<00:00:28.650> like<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.160> kind

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
seems to happen you know like the kind

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.820 
seems to happen you know like the kind
of<00:00:29.400> goalie<00:00:29.580> gets<00:00:29.730> hot<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.289> we<00:00:31.289> were<00:00:31.380> balanced

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
of goalie gets hot and we were balanced

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.770 
of goalie gets hot and we were balanced
or<00:00:32.040> weird<00:00:32.460> deflection<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.390> know<00:00:33.510> things

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
or weird deflection and you know things

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.260 
or weird deflection and you know things
can<00:00:33.930> happen<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.350> games<00:00:34.559> can<00:00:34.739> be<00:00:34.770> tied<00:00:34.980> up<00:00:35.270> but

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
can happen in games can be tied up but

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.880 
can happen in games can be tied up but
when<00:00:36.390> I'm<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.719> game<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.079> for<00:00:37.350> me<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> just<00:00:37.710> I

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
when I'm in the game is for me I just I

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.280 
when I'm in the game is for me I just I
focus<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.450> being<00:00:39.450> prepared<00:00:39.600> when<00:00:40.050> when

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
focus on being prepared when when

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.990 
focus on being prepared when when
they're<00:00:40.410> coming<00:00:40.649> down<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.829> me<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.760> know<00:00:41.790> we've

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
they're coming down on me you know we've

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.700 
they're coming down on me you know we've
done<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.149> good<00:00:42.300> job<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.510> far<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:43.260> thought<00:00:43.440> picked

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
done a good job so far we thought picked

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.440 
done a good job so far we thought picked
up<00:00:43.860> points<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.730> pretty<00:00:44.879> much<00:00:44.940> every<00:00:45.239> game<00:00:45.420> we

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
up points in pretty much every game we

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.810 
up points in pretty much every game we
played<00:00:45.809> at<00:00:45.930> home<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.590> month<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.370> just

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
played at home in this month so we just

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.299 
played at home in this month so we just
keep<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.500> keep<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.590> momentum<00:00:49.739> going<00:00:50.070> I

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
keep this keep this momentum going I

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.790 
keep this keep this momentum going I
think<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.550> should<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:50.789> good<00:00:50.940> really<00:00:51.930> held<00:00:52.379> how

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
think we should be good really held how

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.670 
think we should be good really held how
comfortable<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.370> know<00:00:53.399> okay<00:00:54.350> you<00:00:55.350> know<00:00:55.440> every

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
comfortable you know okay you know every

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.680 
comfortable you know okay you know every
day<00:00:55.770> gets<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.010> little<00:00:56.100> easier<00:00:56.449> just<00:00:57.449> when<00:00:57.600> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
day gets a little easier just when you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.939 
day gets a little easier just when you
stay<00:00:57.840> at<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> same<00:00:58.140> line<00:00:58.350> might<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> head

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
stay at the same line might have a head

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.849 
stay at the same line might have a head
for<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.219> last<00:00:59.460> few<00:01:00.300> weeks<00:01:00.390> month<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:01.590> gets

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
for the last few weeks month it gets

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.060 
for the last few weeks month it gets
easier<00:01:01.980> chemistry<00:01:02.789> builds<00:01:03.210> every<00:01:03.420> day<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.070> you

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
easier chemistry builds every day so you

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.219 
easier chemistry builds every day so you
know<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.430> take<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.060> day<00:01:06.150> by<00:01:06.180> day<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:06.990> think

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
know just take it day by day but I think

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.840 
know just take it day by day but I think
everything<00:01:07.439> right<00:01:07.710> now<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.890> going<00:01:08.760> pretty

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
everything right now is going pretty

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.910 
everything right now is going pretty
well<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.119> try<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.450> keep<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> ball<00:01:09.720> rolling

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
well just try to keep the ball rolling

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.140 
well just try to keep the ball rolling
important<00:01:10.920> was<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.729> know<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.090> your

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
important was it to you know on your

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.719 
important was it to you know on your
goal<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.780> wait<00:01:13.590> till<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.890> right<00:01:14.070> moment<00:01:14.549> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
goal to wait till the right moment to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.260 
goal to wait till the right moment to
let<00:01:15.119> loose<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.720> shot<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> backhander<00:01:17.270> you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
let loose the shot the backhander you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.210 
let loose the shot the backhander you
know<00:01:18.390> Kells<00:01:18.689> was<00:01:18.810> tied<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.740> front<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.189> he

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
know Kells was tied up in front so he

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.800 
know Kells was tied up in front so he
kind<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.640> set<00:01:20.820> up<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.000> good<00:01:21.180> pic<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.509> didn't<00:01:21.689> want

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
kind of set up a good pic I didn't want

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.480 
kind of set up a good pic I didn't want
to<00:01:21.900> force<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.320> right<00:01:22.470> through<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.340> thought

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
to force it right through and I thought

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.039 
to force it right through and I thought
maybe<00:01:23.700> I'd<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.119> little<00:01:24.210> more<00:01:24.450> neckla<00:01:24.869> on

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
maybe I'd have a little more neckla on

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.219 
maybe I'd have a little more neckla on
my<00:01:25.200> back<00:01:25.350> end<00:01:25.640> Kim<00:01:26.640> still<00:01:27.210> almost<00:01:27.420> had<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:27.990> i

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
my back end Kim still almost had it so i

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.359 
my back end Kim still almost had it so i
know<00:01:28.439> i<00:01:28.470> just<00:01:28.530> kind<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.159> sweet
