00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
PDF this would be your first page second

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.160 
PDF this would be your first page second
page<00:02:28.070> and<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.520> third<00:02:28.760> page<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.720> fourth

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
page and the third page and a fourth

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.130 
page and the third page and a fourth
page<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.560> course<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.100> then<00:02:31.880> what<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.150> does<00:02:32.330> it

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
page of course and then what it does it

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.650 
page of course and then what it does it
gets<00:02:33.320> into<00:02:35.830> full<00:02:36.830> size<00:02:37.070> pattern<00:02:37.400> what<00:02:38.390> we

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
gets into full size pattern what we

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.960 
gets into full size pattern what we
tiled<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:39.770> out<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.270> basically<00:02:42.970> which

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
tiled it out so that basically which

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.050 
tiled it out so that basically which
print<00:02:44.330> it<00:02:44.450> out<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:45.920> can<00:02:46.100> overlap<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:46.880> and

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
print it out you can overlap it and

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.390 
print it out you can overlap it and
their<00:02:47.960> overlapped<00:02:48.410> by<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:49.070> quarter<00:02:49.640> of<00:02:49.670> an<00:02:49.850> inch

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
their overlapped by a quarter of an inch

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.190 
their overlapped by a quarter of an inch
so<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:52.490> can<00:02:52.700> see<00:02:52.880> how<00:02:52.910> this<00:02:53.180> progresses<00:02:56.200> like

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
so you can see how this progresses like

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.620 
so you can see how this progresses like
so<00:02:59.860> all<00:03:00.860> you<00:03:00.980> have<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.160> do<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:01.550> just<00:03:01.880> tape<00:03:02.480> the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
so all you have to do is just tape the

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.680 
so all you have to do is just tape the
pieces<00:03:02.960> together<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:04.730> have<00:03:04.760> your<00:03:05.120> your

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
pieces together and you have your your

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.030 
pieces together and you have your your
full<00:03:05.960> size<00:03:06.230> pattern<00:03:06.530> just<00:03:06.980> like<00:03:07.070> that<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.980> I

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
full size pattern just like that so I

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.160 
full size pattern just like that so I
won't<00:03:10.250> do<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.520> rest<00:03:10.700> but<00:03:10.880> that<00:03:11.030> mean<00:03:11.210> you<00:03:11.990> get

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
won't do the rest but that mean you get

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.840 
won't do the rest but that mean you get
the<00:03:12.200> idea<00:03:12.380> of<00:03:12.770> how<00:03:13.010> this<00:03:13.250> how<00:03:13.700> this<00:03:13.910> works<00:03:15.850> like

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
the idea of how this how this works like

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.320 
the idea of how this how this works like
so<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.710> if<00:03:18.710> you<00:03:18.920> get<00:03:19.100> mixed<00:03:19.520> up<00:03:19.700> in<00:03:19.850> your<00:03:19.880> pages

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
so and if you get mixed up in your pages

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.690 
so and if you get mixed up in your pages
because<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.930> pages<00:03:21.290> aren't<00:03:21.440> numbered<00:03:21.770> but<00:03:22.580> if

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
because the pages aren't numbered but if

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.670 
because the pages aren't numbered but if
you<00:03:22.760> they're<00:03:23.240> all<00:03:23.450> they'll<00:03:24.200> print<00:03:24.470> goats

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
you they're all they'll print goats

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.530 
you they're all they'll print goats
sequentially<00:03:25.520> so<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:25.760> can<00:03:25.880> start<00:03:26.030> upper<00:03:26.360> left

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
sequentially so you can start upper left

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.540 
sequentially so you can start upper left
corner<00:03:26.780> make<00:03:27.650> your<00:03:27.800> way<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.070> first<00:03:28.340> row

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
corner make your way the first row

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.390 
corner make your way the first row
second<00:03:29.300> row<00:03:29.330> third<00:03:29.450> row<00:03:29.840> but<00:03:30.800> if<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:31.010> do<00:03:31.160> get

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
second row third row but if you do get

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.400 
second row third row but if you do get
stuck<00:03:31.970> on<00:03:32.210> a<00:03:32.270> page<00:03:32.600> like<00:03:32.810> if<00:03:32.960> you<00:03:33.050> drop<00:03:33.260> the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
stuck on a page like if you drop the

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:34.780 
stuck on a page like if you drop the
pages<00:03:33.770> off<00:03:33.890> your<00:03:34.040> desk<00:03:34.190> or<00:03:34.400> something<00:03:34.700> like

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
pages off your desk or something like

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.990 
pages off your desk or something like
that<00:03:34.850> on<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.750> last<00:03:35.900> page<00:03:36.380> of<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.920> PDF<00:03:37.820> is<00:03:37.970> a

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
that on the last page of the PDF is a

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.750 
that on the last page of the PDF is a
grid<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:39.350> the<00:03:39.740> grid<00:03:39.920> you<00:03:40.040> can<00:03:40.100> use<00:03:40.310> as<00:03:40.490> a<00:03:40.520> guide

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
grid and the grid you can use as a guide

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.660 
grid and the grid you can use as a guide
and<00:03:41.590> so<00:03:42.590> this<00:03:43.430> page<00:03:44.050> this<00:03:45.050> one<00:03:45.490> second<00:03:46.490> page

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
and so this page this one second page

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.900 
and so this page this one second page
it's<00:03:47.330> that<00:03:47.600> one<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.200> so<00:03:48.620> on<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:48.980> forth<00:03:49.040> that's

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
it's that one and so on so forth that's

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.550 
it's that one and so on so forth that's
about<00:03:50.180> it<00:03:50.230> so<00:03:51.230> really<00:03:52.010> convenient<00:03:52.430> with<00:03:52.850> PDF

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
about it so really convenient with PDF

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.260 
about it so really convenient with PDF
there's<00:03:54.560> no<00:03:54.680> waiting<00:03:54.890> for<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.190> mail<00:03:55.340> there's

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
there's no waiting for the mail there's

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.570 
there's no waiting for the mail there's
no<00:03:56.390> addition<00:03:56.810> shipping<00:03:57.140> costs<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:58.250> you're

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
no addition shipping costs and you're

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.340 
no addition shipping costs and you're
good<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:58.730> go<00:03:58.820> but<00:03:59.810> if<00:03:59.930> you<00:03:59.990> don't<00:04:00.170> have<00:04:00.320> a

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
good to go but if you don't have a

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.430 
good to go but if you don't have a
printer<00:04:00.620> or<00:04:00.830> if<00:04:01.310> you're<00:04:01.550> not<00:04:01.670> familiar<00:04:01.880> with

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
the PDF patterns on how to download if

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.810 
the PDF patterns on how to download if
you<00:04:06.560> have<00:04:06.710> trouble<00:04:06.860> downloading<00:04:07.160> that<00:04:07.490> sort

as<00:04:18.009> a<00:04:18.039> convenience<00:04:18.639> so<00:04:19.389> you're<00:04:19.539> not<00:04:19.660> paying

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
as a convenience so you're not paying

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.279 
as a convenience so you're not paying
any<00:04:20.169> more<00:04:20.579> for<00:04:21.780> something<00:04:22.780> that's<00:04:22.930> mailed<00:04:23.110> to
