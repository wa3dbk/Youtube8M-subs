00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
someone would have learned everything

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.689 
someone would have learned everything
and<00:04:49.650> again<00:04:50.650> we'll<00:04:50.800> probably<00:04:51.009> more<00:04:51.280> bunny<00:04:51.490> time

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
and again we'll probably more bunny time

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.640 
and again we'll probably more bunny time
maybe<00:04:51.940> because<00:04:52.900> he's<00:04:53.080> probably<00:04:53.259> hanging<00:04:53.500> a

hunt of trainer from phenomena then Max

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.890 
hunt of trainer from phenomena then Max
Payne<00:04:56.650> clearly<00:04:57.220> he's<00:04:57.370> diving<00:04:57.780> because<00:04:58.780> you

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
Payne clearly he's diving because you

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.570 
Payne clearly he's diving because you
can<00:04:59.139> be<00:04:59.199> dog<00:04:59.380> back<00:04:59.650> dive<00:04:59.949> left<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:00.370> right<00:05:00.490> and

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
can be dog back dive left and right and

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.070 
can be dog back dive left and right and
then<00:05:00.699> for<00:05:00.910> which<00:05:01.060> may<00:05:01.270> be<00:05:01.300> divided<00:05:01.720> new<00:05:01.840> more

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
then for which may be divided new more

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.020 
then for which may be divided new more
to<00:05:02.229> make<00:05:02.349> it<00:05:02.500> more<00:05:02.590> realistic<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:03.220> then<00:05:03.669> again

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
to make it more realistic and then again

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.339 
to make it more realistic and then again
what<00:05:04.300> time<00:05:04.509> so<00:05:04.630> that's<00:05:04.780> pretty<00:05:04.960> cool<00:05:05.110> that's

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
what time so that's pretty cool that's

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:06.719 
what time so that's pretty cool that's
Max<00:05:05.590> Payne<00:05:05.770> right<00:05:05.979> there<00:05:06.190> because<00:05:06.520> as<00:05:06.639> you<00:05:06.699> can
