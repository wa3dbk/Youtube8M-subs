00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
great music as has that emotional

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.039 
great music as has that emotional
quality<00:01:07.409> yet<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.850> go<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.329> go<00:01:09.479> too<00:01:09.540> far

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
quality yet if you go if you go too far

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.649 
quality yet if you go if you go too far
on<00:01:10.259> one<00:01:10.439> side<00:01:10.710> or<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> other<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.640> think<00:01:12.509> we

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
on one side or the other then I think we

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.380 
on one side or the other then I think we
we<00:01:12.990> lose<00:01:13.259> that<00:01:13.560> balance<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.390> great

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
we lose that balance and great

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.989 
we lose that balance and great
performances<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:17.369> both<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.670> those

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:17.999 
performances have have both of those

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:20.239 
performances have have both of those
qualities<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.710> that's<00:01:19.890> what<00:01:20.039> I<00:01:20.069> so

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:20.249 
qualities and and that's what I so

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:23.660 
qualities and and that's what I so
admired<00:01:20.609> about<00:01:20.899> Charles<00:01:21.899> recordings<00:01:22.469> is<00:01:23.460> that

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
admired about Charles recordings is that

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.879 
admired about Charles recordings is that
it<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.299> captures<00:01:25.369> not<00:01:26.369> only<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.649> very

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:28.889 
it it captures not only the the very

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.980 
it it captures not only the the very
intense<00:01:29.490> musical<00:01:29.969> expression<00:01:30.539> but<00:01:30.929> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
intense musical expression but the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.919 
intense musical expression but the
technical<00:01:31.679> level<00:01:32.060> is<00:01:33.060> all<00:01:33.299> there<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.689> match

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
and when you combine both of those

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.830 
and when you combine both of those
things<00:01:35.999> well<00:01:36.179> what<00:01:36.299> do<00:01:36.359> you<00:01:36.420> get<00:01:36.569> you<00:01:36.600> have
