the insulation off the tips of the wok
use<00:01:39.210> some<00:01:39.420> wire<00:01:39.630> strippers<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.409> carefully

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
use some wire strippers and carefully

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.430 
use some wire strippers and carefully
remove<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.760> right<00:01:41.970> amount<00:01:42.270> until<00:01:43.170> you

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
have just the wire showing do the same

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.469 
have just the wire showing do the same
for<00:01:46.290> both<00:01:46.320> sides<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.430> now<00:01:47.610> all<00:01:47.910> you're<00:01:48.330> going

for both sides so now all you're going
to<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:49.159> is<00:01:50.159> put<00:01:50.430> them<00:01:50.580> together<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:51.000> this

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
to do is put them together like this

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.830 
to do is put them together like this
twist<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.430> wires<00:01:53.670> together<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.690> have<00:01:57.810> a

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
twist the wires together and you have a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.190 
twist the wires together and you have a
spectrum<00:01:58.320> Radio<00:01:58.680> bind<00:01:58.979> plug<00:01:59.250> right<00:01:59.580> there<00:02:00.200> get

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
spectrum Radio bind plug right there get

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.260 
spectrum Radio bind plug right there get
your<00:02:01.380> spectrum<00:02:01.770> receiver<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.700> plug<00:02:02.940> your<00:02:03.090> buy

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
your spectrum receiver and plug your buy

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.780 
your spectrum receiver and plug your buy
plug<00:02:03.570> into<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.900> bind<00:02:04.140> port<00:02:04.550> now<00:02:05.550> we're<00:02:05.700> going

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
plug into the bind port now we're going

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.520 
plug into the bind port now we're going
to<00:02:05.850> test<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.300> see<00:02:06.420> if<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.570> works<00:02:06.780> get<00:02:07.350> your

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
to test and see if it works get your

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.290 
to test and see if it works get your
battery<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.100> plug<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.820> to<00:02:08.910> your<00:02:08.940> speed

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
battery and plug it in to your speed

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.850 
battery and plug it in to your speed
control<00:02:14.270> there<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.390> go<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.780> working<00:02:16.380> bind<00:02:16.590> plug

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
control there you go a working bind plug

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.410 
control there you go a working bind plug
the<00:02:17.190> blinking<00:02:17.610> light<00:02:17.820> means<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.090> you're<00:02:18.300> in

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
the blinking light means that you're in

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.090 
the blinking light means that you're in
buy<00:02:18.600> mode<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.170> should<00:02:19.350> now<00:02:19.530> bind<00:02:19.950> your

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
buy mode and you should now bind your

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.430 
buy mode and you should now bind your
transmitter<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.850> receiver<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.540> hope<00:02:22.260> this

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
transmitter to the receiver I hope this

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.890 
transmitter to the receiver I hope this
helps
