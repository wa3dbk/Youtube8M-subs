00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.750 
screen is the retina of the mind's eye
the<00:00:43.030> video<00:00:44.020> screen<00:00:44.290> is<00:00:44.590> part<00:00:44.980> of<00:00:45.160> the<00:00:45.370> physical

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
the video screen is part of the physical

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.990 
the video screen is part of the physical
structure<00:00:46.120> of<00:00:46.810> the<00:00:47.080> brain<00:00:48.000> therefore

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
structure of the brain therefore

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.090 
structure of the brain therefore
whatever<00:00:49.210> appears<00:00:49.810> on<00:00:50.050> television<00:00:50.230> emerges

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
whatever appears on television emerges

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.930 
whatever appears on television emerges
as<00:00:51.250> raw<00:00:51.460> experience<00:00:51.670> for<00:00:52.450> those<00:00:52.600> who<00:00:52.900> view<00:00:53.110> it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
as raw experience for those who view it

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.720 
as raw experience for those who view it
thus<00:00:54.940> television<00:00:55.660> is<00:00:56.110> reality<00:00:56.560> and<00:00:57.010> reality

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
thus television is reality and reality

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.010 
thus television is reality and reality
is<00:00:58.480> less<00:00:58.840> than<00:00:59.110> temperature

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
is less than temperature

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.590 
is less than temperature
after<00:01:01.830> all<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:02.220> is<00:01:02.250> nothing<00:01:02.730> outside<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
after all there is nothing outside the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.960 
after all there is nothing outside the
perception<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.260> reality<00:01:04.410> is<00:01:04.860> there<00:01:05.100> I'm

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
perception of reality is there I'm
