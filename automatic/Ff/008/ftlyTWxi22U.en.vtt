going to do my best to show you how to

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.850 
going to do my best to show you how to
do<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.870> bantu<00:01:04.260> knots<00:01:04.549> so<00:01:05.549> first<00:01:06.260> you<00:01:07.260> loop<00:01:07.619> up

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
do the bantu knots so first you loop up

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.510 
do the bantu knots so first you loop up
near<00:01:08.580> your<00:01:08.729> scalp<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:10.010> then<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.130> take<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
near your scalp and then you take the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.670 
near your scalp and then you take the
excess<00:01:11.939> lock<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.540> wrap<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.710> around<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.549> loop

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
excess lock and wrap it around the loop

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.570 
excess lock and wrap it around the loop
so<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.710> wrap<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.430> couple<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:18.030> times<00:01:18.270> and

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
so you wrap it a couple of times and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.940 
so you wrap it a couple of times and
then<00:01:20.580> after<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.570> push<00:01:22.020> what<00:01:22.799> you've

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
then after that you push what you've

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.580 
then after that you push what you've
already<00:01:23.159> wrapped<00:01:23.869> towards<00:01:24.869> your<00:01:24.990> scalp<00:01:25.350> so

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
already wrapped towards your scalp so

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.130 
already wrapped towards your scalp so
they<00:01:25.710> stay<00:01:25.979> tight<00:01:28.430> so<00:01:29.430> after<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.140> you

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
they stay tight so after you do that you

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.170 
they stay tight so after you do that you
keep<00:01:31.439> going<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.040> making<00:01:32.640> sure<00:01:32.850> there's<00:01:33.090> no

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
keep going and making sure there's no

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.800 
keep going and making sure there's no
space<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.630> between<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.710> lock<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.509> keep

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
space in between your lock so you keep

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.600 
space in between your lock so you keep
pressing<00:01:37.140> towards<00:01:37.590> your<00:01:37.740> scalp<00:01:40.430> after<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.490> do

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
pressing towards your scalp after you do

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.219 
pressing towards your scalp after you do
that<00:01:42.890> put<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.979> excess<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.850> loop<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.270> then

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
that put the excess in the loop and then

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.399 
that put the excess in the loop and then
there's<00:01:46.560> you're<00:01:46.710> not<00:01:47.659> gonna<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.020> again

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.859 

so<00:01:52.409> my<00:01:52.649> locks<00:01:52.890> are<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.310> curly<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.000> they

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
so my locks are so curly that they

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.889 
so my locks are so curly that they
already<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.950> molded<00:01:56.610> their<00:01:56.759> shape<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.659> when

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
already have molded their shape so when

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.370 
already have molded their shape so when
I<00:01:57.930> do<00:01:58.049> them<00:01:58.439> again<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:59.659> they<00:02:00.659> already<00:02:01.079> um

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
I do them again here they already um

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.139 
I do them again here they already um
fold<00:02:02.100> against<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> loop<00:02:02.869> so<00:02:03.869> again<00:02:04.969> you<00:02:05.969> wrap

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
fold against the loop so again you wrap

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.119 
fold against the loop so again you wrap
it<00:02:06.299> around<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:07.290> push<00:02:07.560> towards<00:02:07.979> your<00:02:08.099> scalp

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
it around you push towards your scalp

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.630 
it around you push towards your scalp
making<00:02:11.129> sure<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.550> guys<00:02:11.700> can<00:02:11.970> see<00:02:12.150> that

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:23.430 

so<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.700> just<00:02:15.940> wrap<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.720> push<00:02:16.930> wrap<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.440> push

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.880 

and<00:02:24.510> then<00:02:25.510> that's<00:02:26.050> how<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.260> do<00:02:26.440> your<00:02:26.470> bantu

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
knot make sure you put inside the loop

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.000 
knot make sure you put inside the loop
