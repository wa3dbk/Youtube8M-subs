00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.780 

when<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.530> started<00:00:10.890> this<00:00:10.980> project<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.610> they

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
when I started this project and they

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.250 
when I started this project and they
they<00:00:12.240> basically<00:00:12.420> handed<00:00:13.080> me<00:00:13.170> the

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260 
they basically handed me the

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.020 
they basically handed me the
responsibility<00:00:14.010> of<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.190> audio<00:00:14.490> for<00:00:14.820> it

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
responsibility of the audio for it

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.090 
responsibility of the audio for it
I<00:00:15.059> started<00:00:15.570> taking<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.930> look<00:00:16.110> at<00:00:16.290> the<00:00:16.619> concept

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
I started taking a look at the concept

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.339 
I started taking a look at the concept
art<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.430> was<00:00:17.730> being<00:00:17.910> developed<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.630> taking

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349 
art that was being developed and taking

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.080 
art that was being developed and taking
a<00:00:19.439> look<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.800> seeing<00:00:20.099> the<00:00:20.340> new<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.820> sort<00:00:21.029> of

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
a look and seeing the new the sort of

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.609 
a look and seeing the new the sort of
Renaissance<00:00:21.300> approach<00:00:22.050> they<00:00:22.290> wanted<00:00:22.560> to

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
Renaissance approach they wanted to

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.580 
Renaissance approach they wanted to
bring<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:22.860> and<00:00:23.480> it<00:00:24.480> became<00:00:24.750> obvious<00:00:25.050> pretty

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
bring in and it became obvious pretty

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.920 
bring in and it became obvious pretty
early<00:00:26.009> on<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.700> this<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.360> type<00:00:27.540> of<00:00:27.570> game

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
early on that this was the type of game

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.130 
early on that this was the type of game
that<00:00:28.230> was<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.919> story-driven<00:00:29.400> game<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.720> at<00:00:30.960> that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
that was a story-driven game so at that

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.020 
that was a story-driven game so at that
point<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.739> knew<00:00:32.040> right<00:00:32.250> away<00:00:32.279> I'd<00:00:32.610> made<00:00:32.850> my

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
point I knew right away I'd made my

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.540 
point I knew right away I'd made my
first<00:00:33.239> decision<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.739> story<00:00:35.100> needed<00:00:35.430> to

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
first decision that the story needed to

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.310 
first decision that the story needed to
be<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.030> priority<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.660> needed<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.050> at<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
be the priority it needed to be at the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.900 
be the priority it needed to be at the
forefront<00:00:37.559> with<00:00:38.040> all<00:00:38.190> due<00:00:38.340> respect<00:00:38.370> major

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
forefront with all due respect major

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.240 
forefront with all due respect major
I'll<00:00:39.480> expect<00:00:39.809> two<00:00:40.050> security<00:00:40.470> details<00:00:40.920> waiting

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
I'll expect two security details waiting

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.250 
I'll expect two security details waiting
for<00:00:41.430> us<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.000> tarmac<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.630> the<00:00:42.870> first<00:00:43.110> day<00:00:43.230> of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
for us on the tarmac in the first day of

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.810 
for us on the tarmac in the first day of
sex<00:00:43.560> I<00:00:43.830> think<00:00:44.130> as<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.430> far<00:00:44.790> more

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
sex I think as it was far more

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.150 
sex I think as it was far more
futuristic<00:00:45.240> it's<00:00:46.080> a<00:00:46.140> very<00:00:46.350> electronic<00:00:46.890> score

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
futuristic it's a very electronic score

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.390 
futuristic it's a very electronic score
than<00:00:47.580> this<00:00:47.730> one<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:47.970> think<00:00:48.120> because<00:00:48.360> it's<00:00:49.400> 25

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
than this one I think because it's 25

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.670 
than this one I think because it's 25
years<00:00:50.430> earlier<00:00:50.880> it's<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.060> generation<00:00:51.540> earlier

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
years earlier it's a generation earlier

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.290 
years earlier it's a generation earlier
it's<00:00:52.680> mechanical<00:00:53.190> augmentation<00:00:53.790> so<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
it's mechanical augmentation so the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.760 
it's mechanical augmentation so the
music<00:00:54.570> tries<00:00:54.810> to<00:00:55.050> express<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:57.380> we<00:00:58.380> decided

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
music tries to express that we decided

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.640 
music tries to express that we decided
to<00:00:58.980> try<00:00:59.910> using<00:01:00.210> organic<00:01:00.570> instruments<00:01:01.530> to

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
to try using organic instruments to

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.410 
to try using organic instruments to
represent<00:01:02.130> more<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.400> the<00:01:02.550> human<00:01:02.910> side<00:01:03.120> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
represent more of the human side and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.539 
represent more of the human side and
then<00:01:03.960> using<00:01:04.379> electronic<00:01:04.920> instruments<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
then using electronic instruments to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.880 
then using electronic instruments to
represent<00:01:05.970> more<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> augmentation<00:01:06.689> side

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.310 

it's<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:12.000> lot<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.330> acoustic<00:01:12.690> drums<00:01:12.930> there's<00:01:13.260> a

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
it's a lot of acoustic drums there's a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.480 
it's a lot of acoustic drums there's a
lot<00:01:13.440> of<00:01:13.530> choir<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.040> strings

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.100 

because<00:01:19.000> it's<00:01:19.150> interactive<00:01:19.660> the<00:01:19.720> music<00:01:19.960> has

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
because it's interactive the music has

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.830 
because it's interactive the music has
to<00:01:20.140> shift<00:01:20.500> depending<00:01:20.860> on<00:01:21.040> what<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.570> player<00:01:22.810> is

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
to shift depending on what the player is

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.780 
to shift depending on what the player is
doing<00:01:23.020> especially<00:01:23.770> in<00:01:24.040> Deus<00:01:24.280> Ex<00:01:24.460> where<00:01:24.700> the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
doing especially in Deus Ex where the

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.940 
doing especially in Deus Ex where the
player<00:01:25.000> can<00:01:25.180> play<00:01:25.360> it<00:01:25.510> stealth<00:01:26.170> or<00:01:26.440> you<00:01:26.830> can

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
player can play it stealth or you can

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.560 
player can play it stealth or you can
play<00:01:27.130> it<00:01:27.220> as<00:01:27.310> an<00:01:27.400> action<00:01:27.670> game<00:01:27.880> before<00:01:28.300> I<00:01:28.450> can

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
play it as an action game before I can

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.970 
play it as an action game before I can
play<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:28.780> socially<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.290> music<00:01:29.530> has<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:29.710> be

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
play it socially the music has to be

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.350 
play it socially the music has to be
able<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.220> reflect<00:01:30.580> all<00:01:30.850> those<00:01:31.060> different

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360

styles<00:01:31.630> of<00:01:31.660> gameplay<00:01:32.010> combat<00:01:33.010> is<00:01:33.190> just<00:01:33.370> insane

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.100 

making<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> weapon<00:01:39.120> sounds<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.720> obviously

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
making the weapon sounds is obviously

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.990 
making the weapon sounds is obviously
the<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:41.040> thing<00:01:41.220> everybody<00:01:41.640> gets<00:01:41.850> excited

about because it's a lot of fun to make
things<00:01:43.950> go<00:01:44.159> boom<00:01:46.010> we<00:01:47.010> worked<00:01:47.310> with<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
things go boom we worked with the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.899 
things go boom we worked with the
weapons<00:01:48.840> designer<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.979> went<00:01:50.159> through<00:01:50.369> tons<00:01:50.700> of

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
weapons designer we went through tons of

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.330 
weapons designer we went through tons of
different<00:01:51.000> sounds<00:01:51.450> blending<00:01:52.350> all<00:01:52.740> kinds<00:01:53.250> of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
different weapon sounds tweaking it we

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.620 
different weapon sounds tweaking it we
take<00:01:55.290> real<00:01:55.560> sounds<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.580> we<00:01:56.729> blam<00:01:57.119> these

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
take real sounds but we blam these

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.840 
take real sounds but we blam these
sounds<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.170> other<00:01:58.560> stuff<00:01:58.950> like<00:01:59.160> it's<00:01:59.670> not

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
sounds with other stuff like it's not

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.249 
sounds with other stuff like it's not
just<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.240> treating<00:02:00.600> for<00:02:00.840> sound<00:02:01.080> them

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
just like treating for sound them

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.590 
just like treating for sound them
together<00:02:01.500> it's<00:02:01.800> like<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.850> probably<00:02:03.090> 25

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
together it's like like probably 25

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.680 
together it's like like probably 25

we've<00:04:30.580> also<00:04:30.760> got<00:04:31.090> sounds<00:04:31.510> being<00:04:31.750> triggered<00:04:32.110> at

different<00:04:32.740> intervals<00:04:32.890> as<00:04:33.310> you<00:04:33.460> walk<00:04:33.700> because

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
different intervals as you walk because

different intervals as you walk because
that's<00:04:34.450> what<00:04:34.810> makes<00:04:35.050> it<00:04:35.260> feel<00:04:35.530> realistic

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
that's what makes it feel realistic

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.400 
that's what makes it feel realistic
hearing<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.060> window<00:04:37.420> break<00:04:37.690> in<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:37.960> distance

hearing a window break in the distance

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.880 
hearing a window break in the distance
as<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:38.650> walked<00:04:38.980> a<00:04:39.160> certain<00:04:39.520> path<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.890> what's

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
as you walked a certain path and what's

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.620 
as you walked a certain path and what's
cool<00:04:42.100> is<00:04:42.310> when<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:42.520> walk<00:04:42.730> back<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.180> same<00:04:43.390> way

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
cool is when you walk back the same way

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.150 
cool is when you walk back the same way
it's<00:04:43.810> not<00:04:43.870> going<00:04:44.110> to<00:04:44.170> be<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.410> same<00:04:44.590> sound<00:04:44.950> it's

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
it's not going to be the same sound it's

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.620 
it's not going to be the same sound it's
not<00:04:45.340> baked<00:04:45.640> in<00:04:45.850> we've<00:04:46.000> got<00:04:46.150> something<00:04:46.480> else

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
not baked in we've got something else

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.150 
not baked in we've got something else
cooked<00:04:46.990> up<00:04:49.350> now<00:04:50.350> you're<00:04:50.650> sitting<00:04:50.860> there<00:04:51.070> going

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
cooked up now you're sitting there going

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.460 
cooked up now you're sitting there going
okay<00:04:51.580> well<00:04:51.760> this<00:04:51.940> feels<00:04:52.240> like<00:04:52.480> it's<00:04:52.690> adapting

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
okay well this feels like it's adapting

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.500 
okay well this feels like it's adapting
to<00:04:53.770> what<00:04:54.430> I'm<00:04:54.550> doing<00:04:54.580> in<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.060> game<00:04:55.240> and

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
to what I'm doing in the game and

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.210 
to what I'm doing in the game and
ultimately<00:04:55.600> that's<00:04:56.200> the<00:04:56.470> illusion<00:04:56.950> you<00:04:56.980> want

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
ultimately that's the illusion you want

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.709 
ultimately that's the illusion you want
to<00:04:57.310> create

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.709 

my<00:05:04.409> philosophy<00:05:04.709> on<00:05:05.039> good<00:05:05.759> sound<00:05:06.089> design<00:05:06.479> I've

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:06.719 
my philosophy on good sound design I've

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:09.019 
my philosophy on good sound design I've
often<00:05:06.869> compared<00:05:07.439> it<00:05:07.589> to<00:05:07.619> to<00:05:08.429> trying<00:05:08.699> to<00:05:08.789> send

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:09.029 
often compared it to to trying to send

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:11.149 
often compared it to to trying to send
somebody<00:05:09.299> into<00:05:09.569> a<00:05:09.719> deep<00:05:09.989> hypnotic<00:05:10.229> state<00:05:10.889> and

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
somebody into a deep hypnotic state and

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.179 
somebody into a deep hypnotic state and
you're<00:05:12.059> going<00:05:12.360> down<00:05:12.539> layers<00:05:13.349> and<00:05:13.709> levels<00:05:13.860> of

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:14.189 
you're going down layers and levels of

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.699 
you're going down layers and levels of
states<00:05:14.489> and<00:05:14.759> the<00:05:14.819> better<00:05:15.269> it's<00:05:15.899> done<00:05:16.259> the<00:05:16.529> more

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:16.709 
states and the better it's done the more

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:18.589 
states and the better it's done the more
your<00:05:16.889> brain<00:05:17.129> starts<00:05:17.549> to<00:05:17.610> release<00:05:17.969> and<00:05:18.239> give<00:05:18.419> in

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
your brain starts to release and give in

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:19.999 
your brain starts to release and give in
and<00:05:18.809> let<00:05:18.839> you<00:05:19.049> go<00:05:19.199> into<00:05:19.499> that<00:05:19.649> sort<00:05:19.949> of

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
and let you go into that sort of

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.779 
and let you go into that sort of
hypnotic<00:05:20.610> state<00:05:21.029> of<00:05:21.209> playing<00:05:21.449> the<00:05:21.599> game
