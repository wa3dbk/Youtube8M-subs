not<00:03:12.400> move<00:03:12.579> in<00:03:14.880> C<00:03:16.470> so<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.650> doesn't<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:19.000> can<00:03:19.120> just

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
not move in C so it doesn't you can just

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.449

put<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:19.510> down<00:03:19.600> like<00:03:19.630> that<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:21.070> does<00:03:21.250> give<00:03:21.430> a

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
put it down like that and it does give a

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.030 
put it down like that and it does give a
little<00:03:21.609> bit<00:03:21.730> of<00:03:21.790> resistance<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:23.350> it<00:03:23.590> doesn't

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
little bit of resistance so it doesn't

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.550 
little bit of resistance so it doesn't
fall<00:03:24.310> or<00:03:24.489> anything<00:03:24.519> like<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.959> protects

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
fall or anything like that it protects
