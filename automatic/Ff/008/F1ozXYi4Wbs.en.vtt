00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.510 
down Loen in the rev range it does you
don't<00:01:56.870> have<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.170> bit<00:01:57.440> of<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.620> lumpiness<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.430> it

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
don't have a bit of a lumpiness to it

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.220 
don't have a bit of a lumpiness to it
but<00:01:58.730> yeah<00:01:58.910> it<00:01:59.030> moves<00:01:59.210> right<00:01:59.540> uh<00:01:59.600> once<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.080> get

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
but yeah it moves right uh once you get

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.890 
but yeah it moves right uh once you get
underway<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:01.000> did<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:02.120> have<00:02:02.270> fun<00:02:02.570> with<00:02:02.750> the

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
underway and did you have fun with the

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.960 
underway and did you have fun with the
torque<00:02:03.170> oh<00:02:03.380> I<00:02:03.470> had<00:02:03.770> fun<00:02:03.920> with<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.250> torque<00:02:04.520> this

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
torque oh I had fun with the torque this

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.910 
torque oh I had fun with the torque this
thing<00:02:05.180> makes<00:02:05.390> so<00:02:05.870> much<00:02:06.170> torque<00:02:06.500> right<00:02:06.710> off

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
thing makes so much torque right off

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.540 
thing makes so much torque right off
idle<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:07.940> you<00:02:08.840> know<00:02:08.960> flexible<00:02:09.649> motor<00:02:09.920> you

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
idle that you know flexible motor you

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.430 
idle that you know flexible motor you
can<00:02:10.760> give<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.210> throttle<00:02:11.570> a<00:02:11.630> twist<00:02:11.960> and<00:02:12.290> it

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
can give the throttle a twist and it

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.950 
can give the throttle a twist and it
were<00:02:12.830> just<00:02:13.070> forward<00:02:13.550> it's<00:02:13.820> it's<00:02:14.420> really<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.750> fun

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
were just forward it's it's really a fun

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.020 
were just forward it's it's really a fun
bike<00:02:15.140> now<00:02:15.920> how<00:02:16.070> did<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.340> find<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.640> shifting

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
bike now how did you find the shifting

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.360 
bike now how did you find the shifting
the<00:02:17.540> shifting<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.050> great<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.380> transmission<00:02:19.160> I

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
the shifting is great the transmission I

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.430 
the shifting is great the transmission I
thought<00:02:19.730> was<00:02:20.000> really<00:02:20.420> good<00:02:20.600> it<00:02:20.810> would<00:02:20.960> took<00:02:21.380> a

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
thought was really good it would took a

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.540 
thought was really good it would took a
little<00:02:21.560> bit<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.740> effort<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.220> get<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:22.400> from

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
little bit of effort to get it from

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.520 
little bit of effort to get it from
neutral<00:02:22.940> into<00:02:23.120> first<00:02:23.480> but<00:02:24.110> once<00:02:24.380> you're

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
neutral into first but once you're

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.100 
neutral into first but once you're
underway<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.790> up<00:02:25.910> shifts<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.420> down<00:02:26.570> shifts<00:02:26.990> I

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
underway the up shifts the down shifts I

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.480 
underway the up shifts the down shifts I
could<00:02:27.320> do<00:02:27.410> them<00:02:27.530> with<00:02:27.710> or<00:02:27.890> without<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.250> clutch

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
could do them with or without the clutch

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.030 
could do them with or without the clutch
there<00:02:28.820> they<00:02:29.030> were<00:02:29.090> flawless<00:02:29.390> right<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.530> the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
there they were flawless right and the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.560 
there they were flawless right and the
sound<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.490> exhaust<00:02:31.790> note<00:02:32.030> would<00:02:32.270> you<00:02:32.420> think

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
sound the exhaust note would you think

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.060 
sound the exhaust note would you think
yeah<00:02:32.900> I've<00:02:32.990> never<00:02:33.110> had<00:02:33.350> one<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:33.680> these<00:02:33.830> bikes

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
yeah I've never had one of these bikes

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.460 
yeah I've never had one of these bikes
so<00:02:34.430> it's<00:02:34.850> kind<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.120> intoxicating<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:35.990> caught

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
myself a couple of times pulling the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.520 
myself a couple of times pulling the
clutch<00:02:38.090> in<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.480> revving<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:38.960> up<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.170> little<00:02:39.290> bit

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
clutch in and revving it up a little bit

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
was I was a little excited when I looked

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.179 
was I was a little excited when I looked
at<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.629> front<00:03:01.870> end<00:03:02.049> because<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.470> looks<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:02.980> lot

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
at the front end because it looks a lot

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.610 
at the front end because it looks a lot
like<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.430> GSXR<00:03:04.060> front<00:03:04.390> end<00:03:04.569> yeah<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.409> brakes

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
like a GSXR front end yeah the brakes

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.890 
like a GSXR front end yeah the brakes
were<00:03:05.799> adequate<00:03:06.459> but<00:03:06.819> they<00:03:07.180> certainly<00:03:07.360> didn't

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
were adequate but they certainly didn't

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.199 
were adequate but they certainly didn't
stop<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.829> on<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.549> dime

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
stop the on a dime

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.000 
stop the on a dime
I<00:03:10.239> was<00:03:10.720> impressed<00:03:11.079> by<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.319> rear<00:03:11.590> brake<00:03:11.860> though

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
I was impressed by the rear brake though

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.589 
I was impressed by the rear brake though
I<00:03:12.040> don't<00:03:12.250> normally<00:03:12.430> use<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.849> rear<00:03:13.120> brake<00:03:13.269> much

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
I don't normally use a rear brake much

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.119 
I don't normally use a rear brake much
but<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.140> rear<00:03:14.349> brakes<00:03:14.590> got<00:03:14.799> a<00:03:14.829> lot<00:03:15.099> of

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
but the rear brakes got a lot of

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.130 
but the rear brakes got a lot of
stopping<00:03:15.579> power<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.030> combine<00:03:16.599> the<00:03:16.780> two<00:03:16.959> it

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
stopping power so combine the two it

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.830 
stopping power so combine the two it
actually<00:03:17.500> was<00:03:17.620> quite<00:03:18.159> good<00:03:18.280> okay<00:03:19.000> what<00:03:19.720> about

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.470 
enthusiast it's going to look at this
bike<00:03:32.889> and<00:03:33.159> say<00:03:33.370> that's<00:03:33.579> that's<00:03:34.000> pretty<00:03:34.269> cool

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
bike and say that's that's pretty cool

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.479 
bike and say that's that's pretty cool
and<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:35.319> think<00:03:35.409> a<00:03:35.590> lot<00:03:35.739> of<00:03:35.769> it<00:03:35.920> is<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.159> color<00:03:36.400> the

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
and I think a lot of it is to color the

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.089 
and I think a lot of it is to color the
this<00:03:37.000> metal<00:03:37.420> flake<00:03:37.629> blue<00:03:37.930> offset<00:03:38.829> with<00:03:38.980> the

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
this metal flake blue offset with the

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.059 
this metal flake blue offset with the
chrome<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.700> lots<00:03:40.690> of<00:03:40.989> Chrome

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
chrome and lots of Chrome

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.630 
chrome and lots of Chrome
I<00:03:42.129> think<00:03:42.670> it's<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.909> very<00:03:43.209> pretty<00:03:43.750> pretty<00:03:44.109> bike

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.540 

so<00:03:47.480> Steve<00:03:47.780> what<00:03:48.380> surprised<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.280> know<00:03:49.430> I

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
so Steve what surprised you I know I

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.280 
so Steve what surprised you I know I
threw<00:03:49.850> a<00:03:49.940> little<00:03:50.150> bit<00:03:50.270> of<00:03:50.330> a<00:03:50.420> curveball<00:03:50.720> at<00:03:51.260> you

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
threw a little bit of a curveball at you

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.590 
threw a little bit of a curveball at you
this<00:03:51.680> is<00:03:51.830> really<00:03:52.040> not<00:03:52.370> your<00:03:52.610> segment<00:03:53.180> what

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
this is really not your segment what

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.750 
this is really not your segment what
surprised<00:03:54.020> you<00:03:54.230> well<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.920> lot<00:03:55.460> of<00:03:55.610> things

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
surprised you well a lot of things

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.040 
surprised you well a lot of things
surprised<00:03:56.030> me<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.240> think<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.510> first<00:03:56.720> thing<00:03:56.810> was

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
surprised me I think the first thing was

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.840 
surprised me I think the first thing was
the<00:03:57.290> power<00:03:57.500> this<00:03:58.160> thing<00:03:58.220> it's<00:03:58.430> got<00:03:58.550> a<00:03:58.580> lot<00:03:58.820> of

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
the power this thing it's got a lot of

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.390 
the power this thing it's got a lot of
power<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.390> it's<00:03:59.570> all<00:03:59.780> torque<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:00.530> it's<00:04:00.800> and

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
power and it's all torque and it's and

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.640 
power and it's all torque and it's and
it<00:04:01.790> just<00:04:02.030> transmits<00:04:02.570> right<00:04:02.930> through<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.230> rear

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
it just transmits right through the rear

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.830 
it just transmits right through the rear
wheel<00:04:03.860> and<00:04:03.890> it<00:04:04.220> goes<00:04:04.460> the<00:04:05.390> second<00:04:05.690> thing<00:04:05.810> I

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
wheel and it goes the second thing I

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.540 
wheel and it goes the second thing I
guess<00:04:06.020> it<00:04:06.260> equates<00:04:06.740> to<00:04:06.860> the<00:04:06.980> power<00:04:07.160> is<00:04:07.340> just

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
guess it equates to the power is just

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.790 
guess it equates to the power is just
how<00:04:07.700> much<00:04:07.820> fun<00:04:08.000> it<00:04:08.150> was<00:04:08.270> you<00:04:08.870> know<00:04:08.990> it's<00:04:09.230> you

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
how much fun it was you know it's you

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.740 
how much fun it was you know it's you
often<00:04:10.070> see<00:04:10.250> sort<00:04:10.460> of<00:04:10.550> the<00:04:10.700> bad<00:04:11.030> attitude<00:04:11.270> guys

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
often see sort of the bad attitude guys

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.870 
often see sort of the bad attitude guys

rode one of these I'd have a smile all

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.720 
rode one of these I'd have a smile all
the<00:04:15.620> time<00:04:15.800> because<00:04:16.010> it's<00:04:16.250> that<00:04:16.489> much<00:04:16.700> fun

thumbs down I would say is perhaps the

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.270 
thumbs down I would say is perhaps the
brakes<00:04:26.120> when<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.140> use<00:04:27.260> both<00:04:27.470> brakes<00:04:27.650> actually

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
brakes when you use both brakes actually

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.640 
brakes when you use both brakes actually
pretty<00:04:28.460> pretty<00:04:28.940> good<00:04:29.210> but<00:04:29.510> front<00:04:30.320> brake<00:04:30.470> was<00:04:30.620> a
