00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.880

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
thing though is that the game looks

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.590 
thing though is that the game looks
fantastic<00:01:57.920> this<00:01:58.429> video<00:01:58.759> doesn't<00:01:59.030> quite<00:01:59.299> do<00:01:59.479> it

it was about halfway through for me that
it<00:02:21.950> really<00:02:22.130> peaked<00:02:22.420> first<00:02:23.420> you'll<00:02:23.900> start<00:02:24.200> to

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
it really peaked first you'll start to

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.890

notice the really blocky shadows then

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.650 
notice the really blocky shadows then

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
a bigger framerate dip when you use the

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.050 
a bigger framerate dip when you use the
browning<00:02:32.060> gun<00:02:32.269> aka<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.110> turret<00:02:33.410> sequences

him then you'll see pretty much poopy
character<00:02:54.049> animations<00:02:54.680> all<00:02:55.549> these<00:02:55.819> things

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
character animations all these things

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.789 
character animations all these things
are<00:02:56.389> gonna<00:02:56.510> add<00:02:56.750> up<00:02:56.900> as<00:02:57.049> you<00:02:57.170> progress<00:02:57.319> and

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799

honestly<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.459> really<00:02:58.489> sucks<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.299> they<00:02:59.420> exist

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
honestly it really sucks that they exist

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.780 
honestly it really sucks that they exist
because<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.260> initial<00:03:00.680> holy<00:03:00.920> crap<00:03:01.280> moment<00:03:01.519> of

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
because that initial holy crap moment of

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:09.020 
because that initial holy crap moment of
how<00:03:01.880> great<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.150> game<00:03:02.389> looks<00:03:02.720> is<00:03:03.220> just<00:03:04.220> amazing

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.700 

so<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.180> thing<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.450> matters<00:03:10.840> most<00:03:11.080> here<00:03:11.440> your

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
so the thing that matters most here your

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.800 
so the thing that matters most here your
gun<00:03:11.860> sound<00:03:12.190> it's<00:03:12.490> excellent<00:03:13.210> when<00:03:13.600> you're

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
gun sound it's excellent when you're

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.630 
gun sound it's excellent when you're
sniping<00:03:14.050> that<00:03:14.350> is<00:03:14.500> when<00:03:14.890> you're<00:03:15.010> not<00:03:15.190> using<00:03:15.460> a

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
sniping that is when you're not using a

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.820 
sniping that is when you're not using a
sniper<00:03:15.880> rifle<00:03:16.120> or<00:03:16.750> your<00:03:16.930> sniper's<00:03:17.440> pistol

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
sniper rifle or your sniper's pistol

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.110 
sniper rifle or your sniper's pistol
which<00:03:17.980> you'll<00:03:18.130> kind<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.310> use<00:03:18.460> if<00:03:18.670> you're<00:03:18.850> busy

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
which you'll kind of use if you're busy

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.610 
which you'll kind of use if you're busy
reloading<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:19.750> guy<00:03:19.930> sneaks<00:03:20.170> up<00:03:20.320> on<00:03:20.410> me<00:03:20.530> or

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
reloading and guy sneaks up on me or

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.000 
reloading and guy sneaks up on me or
something

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
something

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.700 
something
the<00:03:21.670> sound<00:03:21.970> for<00:03:22.270> those<00:03:22.360> other<00:03:22.630> guns<00:03:22.930> is<00:03:23.200> really

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
the sound for those other guns is really

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.490 
the sound for those other guns is really
weirdly<00:03:24.040> distorted<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:24.820> not<00:03:25.240> an<00:03:25.390> oh<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:26.320> must

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
weirdly distorted and not an oh it must

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.900 
weirdly distorted and not an oh it must
be<00:03:26.560> intentional<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:27.130> make<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.400> sound<00:03:27.550> kind<00:03:27.790> of

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
be intentional to make it sound kind of

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.460 
be intentional to make it sound kind of
like<00:03:27.970> rugged<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.660> like<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.960> guns<00:03:29.140> right<00:03:29.350> up

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
like rugged and like the guns right up

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.620 
like rugged and like the guns right up
by<00:03:29.620> your<00:03:29.800> ear<00:03:29.980> kind<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.340> way<00:03:30.460> but<00:03:31.240> in<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:31.510> way

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
by your ear kind of way but in that way

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.510 
by your ear kind of way but in that way
that<00:03:31.810> makes<00:03:31.960> you<00:03:32.170> literally<00:03:32.680> like<00:03:33.040> stand<00:03:33.400> up

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
that makes you literally like stand up

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.310 
that makes you literally like stand up
and<00:03:33.730> go<00:03:33.850> check<00:03:34.120> your<00:03:34.270> speaker<00:03:34.690> wires<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:35.170> see

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
and go check your speaker wires to see

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.260 
and go check your speaker wires to see
if<00:03:35.410> something's<00:03:36.160> like<00:03:36.310> loose<00:03:36.730> back<00:03:37.030> there

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
if something's like loose back there

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.660 
if something's like loose back there
it's<00:03:37.930> even<00:03:38.230> worse<00:03:38.500> in<00:03:38.770> the<00:03:38.860> turret<00:03:39.160> sequences

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
it's even worse in the turret sequences

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.430 
it's even worse in the turret sequences
for<00:03:39.850> some<00:03:40.000> reason<00:03:40.330> it's<00:03:40.900> almost<00:03:41.110> like<00:03:41.320> the

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
for some reason it's almost like the

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.170 
for some reason it's almost like the
game<00:03:41.590> just<00:03:41.740> doesn't<00:03:41.980> know<00:03:42.250> how<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.490> like<00:03:43.150> make

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
game just doesn't know how to like make

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.660 
game just doesn't know how to like make
sense<00:03:43.720> of<00:03:43.960> more<00:03:44.200> than<00:03:44.320> one<00:03:44.500> bullet<00:03:44.710> per<00:03:45.010> you

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
sense of more than one bullet per you

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.580 
sense of more than one bullet per you
know<00:03:45.760> trigger<00:03:46.090> pull<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.930> voice-acting

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
know trigger pull the voice-acting

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.040 
know trigger pull the voice-acting
also<00:03:47.980> pretty<00:03:48.370> bad<00:03:48.610> but<00:03:49.210> since<00:03:49.570> the<00:03:49.690> story<00:03:49.930> is

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
also pretty bad but since the story is

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.650 
also pretty bad but since the story is
kind<00:03:50.590> of<00:03:50.710> lame<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.880> kind<00:03:52.090> of<00:03:52.180> just<00:03:52.300> falls<00:03:52.510> to

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
kind of lame it kind of just falls to

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.060 
kind of lame it kind of just falls to
the<00:03:52.720> wayside<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:53.260> don't<00:03:53.440> even<00:03:53.560> really<00:03:53.770> notice

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
the wayside you don't even really notice

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.460 
the wayside you don't even really notice
the<00:03:54.190> bad<00:03:54.310> voice-acting<00:03:55.230> other<00:03:56.230> than<00:03:56.380> just

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
the bad voice-acting other than just

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.590 
the bad voice-acting other than just
maybe<00:03:56.650> one<00:03:56.860> or<00:03:56.950> two<00:03:57.070> places<00:04:00.420> because<00:04:01.420> they

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
maybe one or two places because they

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.430 
maybe one or two places because they
wouldn't<00:04:01.810> really<00:04:01.900> make<00:04:02.140> much<00:04:02.410> difference

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
wouldn't really make much difference

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.680 
wouldn't really make much difference
anyway<00:04:03.040> since<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.430> really<00:04:03.850> care<00:04:04.090> about<00:04:04.120> story

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.000 

okay<00:04:10.690> so<00:04:10.750> something<00:04:11.260> I<00:04:11.320> probably<00:04:11.650> should<00:04:11.980> have

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
okay so something I probably should have

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.740 
okay so something I probably should have
mentioned<00:04:12.160> earlier<00:04:12.640> if<00:04:12.850> you're<00:04:13.120> looking<00:04:13.540> for

mentioned earlier if you're looking for

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.140 
mentioned earlier if you're looking for
a<00:04:13.810> simulation<00:04:14.320> like<00:04:14.500> hardcore<00:04:15.070> sneak<00:04:15.670> for<00:04:15.880> 20

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
a simulation like hardcore sneak for 20

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.810 
a simulation like hardcore sneak for 20
minutes<00:04:16.450> then<00:04:16.720> take<00:04:16.900> your<00:04:17.109> very<00:04:17.859> specific<00:04:18.220> one

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
minutes then take your very specific one

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.820 
minutes then take your very specific one
shot<00:04:19.060> one<00:04:19.270> kill<00:04:19.299> then<00:04:19.930> get<00:04:20.169> back<00:04:20.320> out<00:04:20.530> without

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
shot one kill then get back out without

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.220 
shot one kill then get back out without
being<00:04:21.040> noticed<00:04:21.370> type<00:04:21.520> of<00:04:21.640> game<00:04:22.110> then<00:04:23.110> you

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
being noticed type of game then you

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.330 
being noticed type of game then you
should<00:04:23.380> keep<00:04:23.500> looking<00:04:23.590> because<00:04:23.919> that's<00:04:24.190> not

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
should keep looking because that's not

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.159 
should keep looking because that's not
this<00:04:24.490> game<00:04:24.730> that<00:04:25.270> is<00:04:25.390> what<00:04:25.540> I<00:04:25.570> was<00:04:25.840> expecting

almost a little bit too easy but it's

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.220

missions the enemies are fairly

realistic<00:05:14.650> like<00:05:14.890> when<00:05:15.070> they<00:05:15.160> can<00:05:15.430> spot<00:05:15.700> you

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
realistic like when they can spot you

it still turned out to be a honestly a

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:11.240 
it still turned out to be a honestly a
pretty<00:07:09.900> fun<00:07:10.199> just<00:07:10.530> kind<00:07:10.710> of<00:07:10.770> mindless

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
pretty fun just kind of mindless

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.120 
pretty fun just kind of mindless
headshot<00:07:12.150> filled<00:07:12.509> wrong<00:07:12.870> if<00:07:13.500> you<00:07:13.710> don't<00:07:13.830> fall

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130

into<00:07:14.370> that<00:07:14.610> very<00:07:15.120> very<00:07:15.479> specific<00:07:16.050> category<00:07:16.530> of

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 
into that very very specific category of

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.170 
into that very very specific category of
sounding<00:07:17.219> like<00:07:17.250> you<00:07:17.580> would<00:07:17.699> probably<00:07:18.000> like<00:07:18.030> it

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
sounding like you would probably like it

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.779 
sounding like you would probably like it
after<00:07:18.419> all<00:07:18.630> that<00:07:18.780> description<00:07:19.259> and<00:07:20.190> don't

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:20.789 
after all that description and don't

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:22.430 
after all that description and don't
think<00:07:21.030> that<00:07:21.150> you<00:07:21.360> can<00:07:21.570> you<00:07:21.780> know<00:07:21.900> do<00:07:22.110> as<00:07:22.259> I<00:07:22.289> did

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440 
think that you can you know do as I did

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.459 
think that you can you know do as I did
and<00:07:22.710> kind<00:07:22.889> of<00:07:22.919> tolerate<00:07:23.520> the<00:07:24.169> pretty<00:07:25.169> large

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:25.469 
and kind of tolerate the pretty large

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:27.050 
and kind of tolerate the pretty large
amount<00:07:25.770> of<00:07:25.830> just<00:07:26.039> kind<00:07:26.219> of<00:07:26.310> janky<00:07:26.550> nosov<00:07:26.969> the

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 
amount of just kind of janky nosov the

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.570 
amount of just kind of janky nosov the
game<00:07:27.240> then<00:07:28.110> you<00:07:28.229> probably<00:07:28.740> should<00:07:29.130> just<00:07:29.159> pass

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580 
game then you probably should just pass

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.129 
game then you probably should just pass
on<00:07:29.820> it<00:07:29.969> because<00:07:30.539> it

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:31.139 
on it because it

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:32.869 
on it because it
maybe<00:07:31.259> very<00:07:31.620> pretty<00:07:31.949> to<00:07:32.099> look<00:07:32.249> at<00:07:32.400> but<00:07:32.460> for

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:32.879 
maybe very pretty to look at but for

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:35.029 
maybe very pretty to look at but for
most<00:07:33.030> people<00:07:33.360> out<00:07:33.449> there<00:07:33.719> that's<00:07:34.499> probably

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 
most people out there that's probably

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:36.589 
most people out there that's probably
just<00:07:35.219> about<00:07:35.490> all<00:07:35.729> it<00:07:35.849> would<00:07:35.939> amount<00:07:36.120> to<00:07:36.240> and

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599 
just about all it would amount to and

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:38.059 
just about all it would amount to and
you<00:07:36.749> can<00:07:36.900> get<00:07:37.050> that<00:07:37.169> out<00:07:37.229> of<00:07:37.409> a<00:07:37.530> screen<00:07:37.800> shot<00:07:38.039> or

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:38.069 
you can get that out of a screen shot or

00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:40.959 
you can get that out of a screen shot or
two<00:07:38.370> so<00:07:38.729> final<00:07:39.210> rating<00:07:39.509> five<00:07:39.930> out<00:07:40.289> of<00:07:40.319> ten
