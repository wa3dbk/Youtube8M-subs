00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.720
 and 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.860
 with the easy the truth that not easy 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.630
 because it 's a space that really 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.820
 what you have to do is live it but good 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.410
 to define it very quickly I what 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.210
 I say is that the spirit of this space 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.740
 is created to continue with the 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.960
 creativity continue to investigate and follow 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.990
 realizing the gastronomic offer of the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.940
 casino of books videos and everything of everything 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.280
 what we do where at night 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.210
 turns into specific moments into a 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.210
 kind of theater no 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.830
 well all this technology what we 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.120
 supports at the multisensory level and really 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.120
 the whole theme of the screens 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.500
 projectors that are in the ceiling the table 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.560
 It is also equipped with a lot of technology 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.280
 at the level of sensors that are good 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.260
 make evolutions we get different 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.239
 parts of the table cold zones areas of 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.059
 good heat all this technology 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.820
 What really makes us is helping the 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.120
 dish to have that multiple part 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.120
 sensory 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.359
 i 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.330
 the spirit of this as it is something in which 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.830
 I insist a lot is to continue doing 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.540
 creativity and in these moments 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.860
 timely we make the experiences 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.500
 are the small plays 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.240
 undoubtedly right now who who 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.920
 will be able to enjoy it is for the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.690
 invited by the brands that 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.250
 they have helped us to sponsor this 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.450
 space 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.770
 and I think that you also have to give 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.380
 thank you because the moments that we are 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.450
 bet on a space like this 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.370
 where it is true that there is a lot of innovation 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.930
 He has a lot of creativity but he is 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.990
 important then both repsol guide 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.030
 as html 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.520
 and resolve of course, they're going to have 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.630
 the opportunity to invite people 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.430
 that they want to enjoy these 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.330
 experiences 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.330
 Y 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.760
 sounds and scents video issues 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.800
 we are playing in each one things happen 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.240
 I said before that happens table 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.970
 many things then we play many 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.320
 times with a plate in which they occur 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.210
 things on the table happen things in the 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.120
 screens happen things with sound 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.440
 there are aromatic subjects but good we are going to 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.840
 go playing with each of the dishes not 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.070
 all the dishes have everything 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.540
 undoubtedly and the most difficult of all 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.340
 this is to get all this 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.989
 multisensory history there 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.989
 the plate is not eaten around the plate 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.620
 for us water is one of the 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.430
 most important ingredients within 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.129
 the kitchen 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.140
 we wanted to recreate this rain in the 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.549
 that we also reach the people what 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.620
 will happen at a sensory level in this 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.079
 case then on giant screens 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.719
 we see the rain fall on the table 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.239
 we fall into the drops of water by the 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.829
 room there are enough sensors 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.139
 moisture that what they do is release the 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.659
 moisture compensate it and then we will have 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:10.030
 also aroma sensors that we release 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.219
 of wet earth you do not really have 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.989
 you are sitting will start to eat and 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.409
 is really feeling as if 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.409
 it was raining 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.770
 well this we have called library 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.800
 is a space where we wanted to have the 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.390
 olive oil with a lot of presence and what 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.030
 that we have is a code next to a 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.100
 alphanumeric code in which we have 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.050
 up to 216 oils in which we have the 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.340
 letter of each of the oils and where 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.170
 Well, it's going to be an important part 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.550
 within the experience that is playing 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.739
 with olive oil and do tastings of 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.300
 olive oil but not like the tastings 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.310
 of all life but let's try 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.410
 make it a little more fun to 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.080
 Well different as he slowly 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.040
 let's try to play with the oil 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.040
 but at the multisensory level 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.049
