00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
exercises which work with both because

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.920 
exercises which work with both because

starting position so down up down then

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.890 
starting position so down up down then
ends<00:00:58.440> open<00:00:59.430> close

back fingers back up just take hits
again<00:01:32.810> other<00:01:33.810> hand<00:01:47.720> then<00:01:48.720> all<00:01:49.590> right<00:01:49.940> now<00:01:50.940> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
again other hand then all right now the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.090 
again other hand then all right now the
exercises<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.990> made<00:01:52.229> our<00:01:54.410> what<00:01:55.410> you<00:01:55.530> will<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:55.830> is

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
exercises I made our what you will do is

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.710 
exercises I made our what you will do is
it's<00:01:56.940> in<00:01:57.150> three<00:01:57.390> four<00:01:57.720> so<00:01:58.080> it's<00:01:58.520> got<00:01:59.520> four<00:02:00.479> on

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
it's in three four so it's got four on

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.580 
it's in three four so it's got four on
one<00:02:01.170> hand<00:02:01.700> or<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> other<00:02:03.030> hand<00:02:03.410> and<00:02:04.410> both

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
one hand or on the other hand and both

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.300 
one hand or on the other hand and both
together<00:02:05.510> so<00:02:06.510> it's<00:02:06.870> 20<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.860> two<00:02:08.070> E<00:02:08.100> and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
together so it's 20 and a two E and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.300 
together so it's 20 and a two E and
three

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:48.620 

a<00:02:15.630> little<00:02:16.630> faster<00:02:16.810> now<00:02:30.300> same<00:02:31.300> thing<00:02:31.330> with<00:02:31.599> feet

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.210 

then<00:02:50.430> now<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.489> do<00:02:51.819> it<00:02:52.030> now<00:02:52.630> goes<00:02:52.930> into<00:02:53.260> four<00:02:53.530> so

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
then now you do it now goes into four so

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.120 
then now you do it now goes into four so
it's<00:02:54.459> one<00:02:54.970> two<00:02:55.860> three<00:02:56.860> then<00:02:57.670> alternating<00:02:59.130> so

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
it's one two three then alternating so

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:11.839 
it's one two three then alternating so
the<00:03:00.549> alternating<00:03:01.209> is<00:03:01.769> down<00:03:02.769> down<00:03:04.260> down<00:03:05.260> down

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:18.900 

so<00:03:13.799> down<00:03:14.799> up<00:03:14.830> down<00:03:14.980> up<00:03:15.220> down<00:03:15.870> up<00:03:16.870> down<00:03:17.049> up<00:03:17.910> both

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
so down up down up down up down up both

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:48.190 
so down up down up down up down up both
ends<00:03:20.310> then<00:03:21.310> alternating<00:03:22.150> down<00:03:22.450> down

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:04:17.330 

now<00:03:49.200> feet<00:04:12.439> and<00:04:13.519> then<00:04:14.519> another<00:04:15.329> one<00:04:15.599> is<00:04:16.340> you

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
now feet and then another one is you

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.490 
now feet and then another one is you
start<00:04:17.609> with<00:04:17.870> we're<00:04:18.870> going<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.049> count<00:04:19.289> each

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
start with we're going to count each

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.460 
start with we're going to count each
motion<00:04:20.039> down<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.150> up<00:04:21.209> as<00:04:21.710> one<00:04:22.710> so<00:04:24.080> 11<00:04:25.080> right

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
motion down and up as one so 11 right

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.920 
motion down and up as one so 11 right
we're<00:04:26.070> going<00:04:26.160> to<00:04:26.220> start<00:04:26.430> with<00:04:26.610> eight<00:04:27.210> on<00:04:27.630> each

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
we're going to start with eight on each

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.830 
we're going to start with eight on each
hand<00:04:28.289> and<00:04:28.940> count<00:04:29.940> backwards<00:04:30.030> so<00:04:30.630> it'll<00:04:30.750> be

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
hand and count backwards so it'll be

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:58.790 
hand and count backwards so it'll be
eight<00:04:31.020> seven<00:04:31.500> six<00:04:56.840> now<00:04:57.840> just<00:04:58.260> play<00:04:58.590> that<00:04:58.740> a

I'm<00:05:05.340> lefty<00:05:05.789> I<00:05:06.000> always<00:05:06.210> start<00:05:06.449> with<00:05:06.539> my<00:05:06.750> left

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990

with whichever side you want doesn't
matter

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.730 

then<00:05:37.800> also<00:05:38.800> you<00:05:39.400> could<00:05:40.120> do<00:05:40.300> stuff<00:05:40.690> similar<00:05:41.530> to

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
then also you could do stuff similar to

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.510 
then also you could do stuff similar to
that<00:05:41.890> with<00:05:42.280> like<00:05:43.860> the<00:05:44.860> one<00:05:45.040> we<00:05:45.190> were<00:05:45.280> doing

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
that with like the one we were doing

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.440 
that with like the one we were doing
before<00:05:46.020> like<00:05:47.370> what<00:05:48.370> instead<00:05:48.970> of<00:05:49.000> going<00:05:49.210> like

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
before like what instead of going like

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:55.420 
you'll think of different ideas and it

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.560 
you'll think of different ideas and it
will<00:06:55.570> work<00:06:55.750> out<00:06:55.960> fine<00:06:56.800> for<00:06:56.860> you<00:06:57.160> also<00:06:58.000> one<00:06:58.540> more

thing I just remembered um there's

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.770 
thing I just remembered um there's
another<00:07:02.590> fun<00:07:03.100> thing<00:07:03.130> to<00:07:03.370> do<00:07:03.610> between<00:07:03.910> floor

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
another fun thing to do between floor

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 
alternating it works out pretty good if

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:20.830 
alternating it works out pretty good if
you<00:07:12.820> do<00:07:13.090> the<00:07:13.930> down<00:07:14.350> up<00:07:14.620> motion<00:07:15.130> like<00:07:15.580> down<00:07:16.000> down

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:20.840 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.490

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:34.460 
can't really you're too good on their
good<00:07:25.500> practice<00:07:25.890> pad<00:07:32.960> that<00:07:33.960> didn't<00:07:34.230> work<00:07:34.290> out

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.470 
good practice pad that didn't work out

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.940 
good practice pad that didn't work out
too<00:07:34.530> good<00:07:34.710> oh<00:07:35.300> well<00:07:36.300> never<00:07:37.020> mind<00:07:37.110> maybe<00:07:37.710> you'll

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:37.950 
too good oh well never mind maybe you'll

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:43.580 
too good oh well never mind maybe you'll
figure<00:07:38.160> out<00:07:38.280> before<00:07:38.760> me<00:07:39.770> but<00:07:40.770> until<00:07:41.730> then<00:07:42.530> so<00:07:43.530> I

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:43.590 
figure out before me but until then so I

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.330 
figure out before me but until then so I
think<00:07:43.680> of<00:07:44.010> more<00:07:44.430> different<00:07:45.350> ideas<00:07:46.350> that's<00:07:47.160> it

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.340 
think of more different ideas that's it

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:53.300 
think of more different ideas that's it
for<00:07:47.550> this<00:07:47.640> video<00:07:47.820> so<00:07:48.300> practice<00:07:49.230> it<00:07:50.300> yeah
