resources<00:02:05.630> but<00:02:06.500> also<00:02:06.560> I<00:02:07.040> think<00:02:07.250> there's<00:02:07.460> an

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
resources but also I think there's an

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.160 
resources but also I think there's an
interesting<00:02:07.880> historical<00:02:08.479> connection<00:02:08.899> in<00:02:09.080> the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
interesting historical connection in the

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.590 
interesting historical connection in the
German<00:02:09.470> involvement<00:02:09.950> which<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:11.180> we're

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
German involvement which is that we're

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.120 
German involvement which is that we're
shooting<00:02:11.930> part<00:02:12.170> of<00:02:12.260> this<00:02:12.380> in<00:02:12.590> bobblesberg

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
shooting part of this in bobblesberg

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.390 
shooting part of this in bobblesberg
which<00:02:13.790> is<00:02:14.030> where<00:02:14.630> movies<00:02:15.230> such<00:02:15.440> as<00:02:15.470> Nosferatu

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
which is where movies such as Nosferatu

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.740 
which is where movies such as Nosferatu
in<00:02:16.640> Metropolis<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.390> Moline<00:02:17.720> and

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
in Metropolis and the Moline and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.340 
in Metropolis and the Moline and
Deitrick<00:02:18.140> films<00:02:18.470> are<00:02:18.590> made<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.910> think<00:02:20.150> that

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
Deitrick films are made and I think that

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.570 
Deitrick films are made and I think that
they<00:02:21.350> like<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.740> idea<00:02:22.040> of<00:02:22.100> science<00:02:22.459> fiction

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
they like the idea of science fiction

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.640 
they like the idea of science fiction
being<00:02:23.270> made<00:02:23.480> there<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:23.959> interesting

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
being made there and interesting

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.990 
being made there and interesting
cutting-edge<00:02:25.040> science<00:02:25.400> fiction<00:02:25.670> because<00:02:25.880> it

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
cutting-edge science fiction because it

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.930 
cutting-edge science fiction because it
was<00:02:26.120> once<00:02:26.390> made<00:02:26.660> there<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:28.280> works<00:02:28.490> so<00:02:28.670> why

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
was once made there and it works so why

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.240 
was once made there and it works so why
not<00:02:29.090> try<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.390> again<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:31.340> must<00:02:31.610> kill<00:02:31.880> me<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:33.250> am
