00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
stereo right here the wiring is right

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.010 
stereo right here the wiring is right
behind<00:01:44.860> it<00:01:45.310> so<00:01:45.640> just<00:01:45.670> plug<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.420> play<00:01:46.720> all<00:01:46.900> the

speakers are in it so

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.580 
speakers are in it so
I<00:01:50.799> grabbed<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.880> key<00:01:52.119> here<00:01:52.360> real<00:01:52.540> quick<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.470> we

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
I grabbed the key here real quick so we

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.139 
I grabbed the key here real quick so we
can<00:01:56.619> start<00:01:57.070> it<00:01:57.250> up<00:01:59.640> basically<00:02:00.640> you<00:02:00.759> put<00:02:00.970> the

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
can start it up basically you put the

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:08.130 
can start it up basically you put the
key<00:02:03.899> right<00:02:04.899> here<00:02:06.119> you'll<00:02:07.119> hear<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.509> pill<00:02:07.869> pump

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
key right here you'll hear the pill pump

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.440 
key right here you'll hear the pill pump
go<00:02:08.319> on

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.380 

you<00:02:14.050> just<00:02:14.260> push<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.590> start<00:02:14.860> button

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.360 

so<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.840> choke<00:02:20.080> is<00:02:20.110> pulled<00:02:20.530> out<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.130> got<00:02:21.280> to

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
so the choke is pulled out so you got to

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.070 
so the choke is pulled out so you got to
hold<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.760> gas<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:21.970> little<00:02:22.180> bit<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.660> warn<00:02:22.870> me

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
hold the gas a little bit to warn me

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:31.260 
hold the gas a little bit to warn me
engine<00:02:23.380> up<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:27.069> then<00:02:27.970> aunts<00:02:28.750> that's<00:02:28.990> done<00:02:30.270> you

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
engine up and then aunts that's done you

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
engine up and then aunts that's done you
can<00:02:31.330> push<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.810> choke<00:02:32.080> in<00:02:32.290> again<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.870> RPM

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
can push the choke in again and the RPM

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.010 
can push the choke in again and the RPM
is<00:02:35.470> going

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.309 

so<00:02:42.020> it<00:02:42.170> idles<00:02:42.560> nicely<00:02:43.070> no<00:02:43.580> that's<00:02:44.770> started

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.370 

and<00:02:48.499> that's<00:02:49.159> about<00:02:49.340> it

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
and that's about it

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.560 
and that's about it
custom<00:02:52.220> leather<00:02:52.460> steering<00:02:52.820> wheel<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.510> can

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
custom leather steering wheel you can

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.780 
custom leather steering wheel you can
see<00:02:53.900> that<00:02:53.930> here<00:02:55.570> all<00:02:56.570> right
