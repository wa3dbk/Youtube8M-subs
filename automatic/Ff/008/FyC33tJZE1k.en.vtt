hot azle parade I think I put it up two

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.850 
hot azle parade I think I put it up two
videos<00:03:56.280> ago<00:03:56.310> I<00:03:56.780> used<00:03:57.780> these<00:03:58.290> lipsticks<00:03:58.650> all

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
videos ago I used these lipsticks all

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.650 
videos ago I used these lipsticks all
together<00:03:59.160> this<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.580> a<00:03:59.610> Revlon<00:03:59.850> matte<00:04:00.209> lipstick

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
together this is a Revlon matte lipstick

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.260 
together this is a Revlon matte lipstick
you<00:04:00.840> know<00:04:00.959> really<00:04:01.170> red<00:04:01.760> which<00:04:02.760> looks<00:04:03.000> like<00:04:03.120> it

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
you know really red which looks like it

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.810 
you know really red which looks like it
would<00:04:03.360> be<00:04:03.420> dark<00:04:03.950> but<00:04:04.950> it<00:04:05.010> actually<00:04:05.220> swatches

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
would be dark but it actually swatches

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.120 
would be dark but it actually swatches
really<00:04:06.090> bright<00:04:06.410> so<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:07.440> guess<00:04:07.800> it<00:04:07.950> kind<00:04:08.100> of

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
really bright so I guess it kind of

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.380 
really bright so I guess it kind of
makes<00:04:08.280> sense<00:04:08.430> but<00:04:08.670> to<00:04:08.790> me<00:04:08.880> it<00:04:08.970> looks<00:04:09.120> like<00:04:09.180> it

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
makes sense but to me it looks like it

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.620 
makes sense but to me it looks like it
should<00:04:09.510> be<00:04:09.540> darker<00:04:10.010> then<00:04:11.010> it's<00:04:11.190> watches<00:04:11.550> so<00:04:12.239> I

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
should be darker then it's watches so I

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.750 
should be darker then it's watches so I
don't<00:04:12.810> like<00:04:12.989> how<00:04:13.709> bright<00:04:14.100> it<00:04:14.250> is<00:04:14.340> so<00:04:14.640> I've

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
don't like how bright it is so I've

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.900 
don't like how bright it is so I've
actually<00:04:14.940> been<00:04:15.120> mixing<00:04:15.630> it<00:04:15.750> with<00:04:15.930> this<00:04:16.200> is<00:04:16.470> a
