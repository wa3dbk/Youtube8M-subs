how it works but what it does i should

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.919 
how it works but what it does i should
say<00:00:09.960> so<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.800> sort<00:00:11.580> like<00:00:11.730> makes<00:00:11.940> another<00:00:12.360> camera

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
say so it sort like makes another camera

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.720 
say so it sort like makes another camera
that<00:00:13.110> follows<00:00:13.469> your<00:00:13.769> arrow<00:00:14.070> if<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.490> didn't

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
that follows your arrow if you didn't

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.430 
that follows your arrow if you didn't
really<00:00:14.940> know<00:00:15.030> shrilling<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:16.020> really<00:00:16.230> weird

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
really know shrilling it's really weird

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.830 
really know shrilling it's really weird
and<00:00:16.740> ordinary<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:17.940> I've<00:00:18.029> got<00:00:18.210> him<00:00:18.510> over<00:00:18.539> there

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
and ordinary so I've got him over there

whatever it's called on the ball yeah

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.920 
whatever it's called on the ball yeah
flip<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.460> then<00:00:23.640> um<00:00:23.910> we'll<00:00:24.300> find<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
flip and then um we'll find that in the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.160 
flip and then um we'll find that in the
light<00:00:25.410> tinted<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.039> think<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.550> works<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:27.210> think

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
light tinted I think that works I think

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.830 
light tinted I think that works I think
it<00:00:28.320> does<00:00:28.439> i'm<00:00:28.619> really<00:00:29.429> not<00:00:29.580> sure<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.269> i'll<00:00:30.660> go

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840

this way five barrels three four five

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.179 
this way five barrels three four five
six<00:01:14.610> six<00:01:15.210> hours<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.350> yeah<00:01:16.619> that's<00:01:16.770> where<00:01:17.040> that

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
six six hours so yeah that's where that

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.160 
six six hours so yeah that's where that
way<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.850> also<00:01:18.000> move<00:01:18.420> well<00:01:18.900> it's

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
way you can also move well it's

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.260 
way you can also move well it's
something<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.100> safe<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.430> creep<00:01:20.850> reason

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
something so safe that creep reason

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.450 
something so safe that creep reason
Frontierland<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.900> can<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.830> know<00:01:22.950> run<00:01:23.100> away
