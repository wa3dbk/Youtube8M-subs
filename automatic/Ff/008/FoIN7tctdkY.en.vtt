00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
my first frame just to see where we're

at I didn't meet her anything I just
chipped<00:00:43.710> my<00:00:43.829> way<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.430> exposure<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:45.210> said

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
chipped my way to the exposure I said

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.279

the<00:00:46.050> camera<00:00:46.350> at<00:00:46.410> 1600<00:00:47.010> ISO<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.969> 125th<00:00:48.960> just

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
the camera at 1600 ISO and a 125th just

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.200 
the camera at 1600 ISO and a 125th just
to<00:00:49.410> see<00:00:49.559> what<00:00:49.710> we've<00:00:49.800> got<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:50.190> ambient<00:00:50.610> and

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
to see what we've got for ambient and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.310 
to see what we've got for ambient and
you<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.480> see<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.899> there's<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
you can see that there's the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.549 
you can see that there's the
stratosphere<00:00:53.239> right<00:00:54.260> here<00:00:55.260> some<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.469> these

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
stratosphere right here some of these

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.459 
stratosphere right here some of these
other<00:00:55.770> casinos<00:00:56.539> the<00:00:57.539> noise<00:00:57.750> isn't<00:00:58.020> too<00:00:58.260> bad

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
other casinos the noise isn't too bad

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.520 
other casinos the noise isn't too bad
cuz<00:00:58.710> we're<00:00:58.800> at<00:00:58.859> 125th<00:00:59.609> however<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.199> city's

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
cuz we're at 125th however the city's

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.460 
cuz we're at 125th however the city's
really<00:01:01.829> dark<00:01:02.629> so<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.719> might<00:01:03.930> want<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.170> think

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
really dark so you might want to think

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.679 
really dark so you might want to think
that<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.799> would<00:01:04.890> turn<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.250> iso<00:01:05.790> up<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.540> one

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
that you would turn your iso up this one

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.260 
that you would turn your iso up this one
with<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> ISO

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.020 

but<00:01:12.899> more<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:14.130> see<00:01:14.310> all<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.700> noise<00:01:15.000> that

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
but more so you see all the noise that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.450 
but more so you see all the noise that
is<00:01:15.570> Oh<00:01:16.310> 8008

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.160 

the<00:01:20.460> city<00:01:20.700> still<00:01:21.119> isn't<00:01:21.479> what<00:01:21.689> we're<00:01:21.869> looking

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the city still isn't what we're looking

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.459 
the city still isn't what we're looking
for

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
for

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.770 
for
however<00:01:23.219> you<00:01:23.429> can<00:01:23.549> make<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.090> luxor<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
however you can make out the luxor and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.209 
however you can make out the luxor and
the<00:01:24.960> MGM<00:01:25.819> some<00:01:26.819> of<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.969> other<00:01:27.090> casinos<00:01:27.270> okay

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
the MGM some of the other casinos okay

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.399 
the MGM some of the other casinos okay
so<00:01:29.360> let's<00:01:30.360> look<00:01:30.479> at<00:01:30.659> what<00:01:30.810> happens<00:01:31.140> when<00:01:31.259> you

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
so let's look at what happens when you

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.819 
so let's look at what happens when you
go<00:01:31.560> from<00:01:31.679> a<00:01:31.829> 125th<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.969> a<00:01:33.119> second<00:01:33.539> so<00:01:34.170> faster

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
go from a 125th of a second so faster

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.550 
go from a 125th of a second so faster
shutter<00:01:35.069> speed<00:01:35.459> there's<00:01:36.209> a<00:01:36.329> 40th<00:01:36.869> well

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
shutter speed there's a 40th well

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.020 
shutter speed there's a 40th well
there's<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> dramatic<00:01:37.920> change<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.759> amount

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
there's a dramatic change in the amount

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.870 
there's a dramatic change in the amount
of<00:01:39.179> light<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:40.079> noise<00:01:40.319> is<00:01:40.560> still<00:01:40.649> nasty<00:01:41.009> but

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
of light the noise is still nasty but

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.090 
of light the noise is still nasty but
the<00:01:42.030> amount<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.539> light<00:01:42.899> that's<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.950> can

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the amount of light that's in you can

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.279 
the amount of light that's in you can
start<00:01:44.219> to<00:01:44.369> really<00:01:44.549> see<00:01:44.640> these<00:01:44.939> buildings<00:01:45.479> so

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
start to really see these buildings so

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:47.990 
start to really see these buildings so
we're<00:01:46.409> gonna<00:01:46.530> go<00:01:46.770> ahead<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.250> we're<00:01:47.849> gonna

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.529 
we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna
correct<00:01:48.979> our<00:01:49.979> white<00:01:50.280> balance<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.970> we're

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
correct our white balance and we're

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.240 
correct our white balance and we're
gonna<00:01:51.630> reframe<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.349> shot<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
gonna reframe the shot so this is the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.330 
gonna reframe the shot so this is the
bridge<00:01:53.489> at<00:01:53.789> night<00:01:54.289> we're<00:01:55.289> gonna<00:01:55.380> drop<00:01:55.709> ISO

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
bridge at night we're gonna drop ISO

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.960 
bridge at night we're gonna drop ISO
down<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.789> a<00:01:56.819> low<00:01:57.090> ISO<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.989> we<00:01:58.110> don't<00:01:58.380> get<00:01:58.560> noise

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
down to a low ISO so we don't get noise

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.550 
down to a low ISO so we don't get noise
so<00:01:59.970> let's<00:02:00.119> look<00:02:00.239> at<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.479> first<00:02:00.720> image<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.409> we

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
so let's look at the first image that we

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.520 
so let's look at the first image that we
make<00:02:01.799> now<00:02:02.759> remember<00:02:03.360> we<00:02:03.450> shoot<00:02:03.689> RAW<00:02:03.989> we<00:02:04.349> should

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
make now remember we shoot RAW we should

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.309 
make now remember we shoot RAW we should
