00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.369 

okay<00:00:02.899> so<00:00:03.899> if<00:00:04.380> I<00:00:04.560> was<00:00:04.740> going<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:06.230> tension<00:00:07.230> it

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
okay so if I was going to tension it

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.280 
okay so if I was going to tension it
forwards<00:00:08.120> our<00:00:09.120> tension<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.599> Traverse<00:00:09.929> sways

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
forwards our tension in Traverse sways

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.259 
forwards our tension in Traverse sways
with<00:00:10.650> white<00:00:10.950> tension<00:00:11.429> sponge<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.969> would<00:00:12.120> take

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
with white tension sponge I would take

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.020 
with white tension sponge I would take
the<00:00:12.420> sponge<00:00:12.599> while<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:12.960> was<00:00:13.139> still<00:00:13.410> fresh<00:00:14.030> with

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
the sponge while it was still fresh with

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.150 
the sponge while it was still fresh with
glue<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.540> expanded<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.440> know<00:00:16.560> when<00:00:16.859> we<00:00:17.039> had

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
glue and expanded you know when we had

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.099 
glue and expanded you know when we had
it<00:00:17.279> set<00:00:17.430> up<00:00:17.490> like<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.779> would<00:00:18.930> just

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
it set up like this and that would just

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.950 
it set up like this and that would just
lay<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.320> sponge<00:00:19.710> flat<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.510> okay<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.750> way

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
lay the sponge flat on it okay that way

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.320 
lay the sponge flat on it okay that way
when<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.560> shriveled<00:00:23.010> up<00:00:23.130> or<00:00:23.760> when<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.060> shrunk

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
when it shriveled up or when it shrunk

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.540 
when it shriveled up or when it shrunk
back<00:00:24.600> down<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.199> spend<00:00:25.470> would<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.800> smaller

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
back down the spend would be smaller

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.189 
back down the spend would be smaller
than<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.939> top<00:00:27.119> sheet<00:00:27.420> or<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.869> sponge<00:00:28.080> would

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
than the top sheet or the sponge would

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.980 
than the top sheet or the sponge would
be<00:00:28.320> stretched<00:00:28.650> onto<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.130> top<00:00:29.310> see<00:00:29.660> but<00:00:30.660> in

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
be stretched onto the top see but in

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.870 
be stretched onto the top see but in
this<00:00:31.109> case<00:00:31.349> I'm<00:00:31.650> going<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.040> illustrate<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
this case I'm going to illustrate the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.479 
this case I'm going to illustrate the
forward<00:00:33.360> tension<00:00:33.809> which<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.489> slightly

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
forward tension which is the slightly

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.630 
forward tension which is the slightly
more<00:00:35.670> difficult<00:00:35.820> method<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.719> doing<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.640> okay

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
more difficult method of doing it okay

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.010 
more difficult method of doing it okay
what<00:00:38.969> I'm<00:00:39.059> gonna<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.420> now<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.600> I'm<00:00:39.809> going<00:00:39.960> to

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.220 
what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to
lay<00:00:40.200> down<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.620> sheet<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:40.980> plastic<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:42.230> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
lay down this sheet of plastic and the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.330 
lay down this sheet of plastic and the
reason<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.530> was<00:00:43.590> going<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.800> do<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.219> because

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
reason I was going to do that is because

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.250 
reason I was going to do that is because
we<00:00:44.640> don't<00:00:44.850> want<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.270> glue<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.570> get<00:00:45.870> up<00:00:46.020> into

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
we don't want the glue to get up into

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.110 
we don't want the glue to get up into
the<00:00:46.469> Pips<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:47.129> only<00:00:47.309> want<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> glue<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
the Pips we only want the glue on the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.479 
the Pips we only want the glue on the
very<00:00:48.480> tips<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> Pips<00:00:49.350> because<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.399> gets

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
very tips of the Pips because if it gets

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.910 
very tips of the Pips because if it gets
on<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.760> top<00:00:51.030> sheet<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:52.170> will<00:00:52.350> cause<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.710> top

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
on the top sheet it will cause the top

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.680 
on the top sheet it will cause the top
key<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.309> stick<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> sponge<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.329> get<00:00:54.570> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
key to stick to the sponge and get it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.560 
key to stick to the sponge and get it
kind<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.079> messed<00:00:55.860> up<00:00:56.070> dimple<00:00:56.640> effect<00:00:57.210> which

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
kind of a messed up dimple effect which

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.959 
kind of a messed up dimple effect which
we<00:00:57.750> don't<00:00:57.870> want<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.410> I'm<00:00:59.129> just<00:00:59.340> gonna<00:00:59.460> lay<00:00:59.730> this

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
we don't want so I'm just gonna lay this

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.080 
we don't want so I'm just gonna lay this
baby<00:01:00.270> right<00:01:00.570> down<00:01:00.780> here<00:01:01.050> onto<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> glue<00:01:02.090> like

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
baby right down here onto the glue like

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.490 
baby right down here onto the glue like
so<00:01:05.000> okay<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.630> now<00:01:06.780> I'm<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> visually

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
so okay and now I'm going to visually

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.260 
so okay and now I'm going to visually
inspect<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.400> make<00:01:08.549> sure<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.909> there's

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
inspect it to make sure that there's

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.270 
inspect it to make sure that there's
glue<00:01:09.510> everywhere<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.830> don't<00:01:10.860> think<00:01:11.220> you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
glue everywhere and I don't think you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.179 
glue everywhere and I don't think you
could<00:01:11.430> see<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.790> but<00:01:12.030> there<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.890> make<00:01:14.040> sure

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
could see it but there is to make sure

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.679 
could see it but there is to make sure
that<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.520> glue<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:14.970> each<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.450> pips

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
that this glue on each one of the pips

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.450 
that this glue on each one of the pips
shouldn't<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.500> any<00:01:16.680> down<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.100> between<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
shouldn't be any down in between the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.090 
shouldn't be any down in between the
pips<00:01:17.759> just<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> top<00:01:18.450> okay<00:01:19.409> I've<00:01:19.680> got<00:01:19.890> me<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
pips just on the top okay I've got me a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.630 
pips just on the top okay I've got me a
volunteer<00:01:21.030> use<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> roller<00:01:22.369> spray<00:01:23.369> can

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
volunteer use of the roller spray can

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.179 
volunteer use of the roller spray can
actually<00:01:24.330> I'm<00:01:25.200> gonna<00:01:25.409> line<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.710> up<00:01:25.950> at<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
actually I'm gonna line it up at the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.340 
actually I'm gonna line it up at the
bottom<00:01:26.340> now<00:01:26.820> some<00:01:27.030> people<00:01:27.150> will<00:01:27.450> tension<00:01:28.259> it

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
bottom now some people will tension it

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.340 
bottom now some people will tension it
sideways<00:01:28.650> too<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.430> let<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.939> side<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.079> then

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
sideways too and let the side and then

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.870 
sideways too and let the side and then
roll<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.650> across<00:01:31.740> I'm<00:01:32.189> just<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.640> do<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
roll it across I'm just going to do the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.410 
roll it across I'm just going to do the
top<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.240> bottom<00:01:33.390> tension<00:01:34.790> okay<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.119> I'm<00:01:36.240> going

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
top to bottom tension okay and I'm going

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.109 
top to bottom tension okay and I'm going
to<00:01:36.479> lay<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.810> right<00:01:36.840> there

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
to lay it right there

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.539 
to lay it right there
and<00:01:39.119> then<00:01:39.210> let<00:01:39.329> me<00:01:39.390> grab<00:01:39.570> my<00:01:39.780> cane<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.549> I'm

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
and then let me grab my cane and I'm

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.039 
and then let me grab my cane and I'm
gonna<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:42.060> slightly<00:01:42.750> pull<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.619> sideways<00:01:45.049> at

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
gonna just slightly pull it sideways at

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.960 
gonna just slightly pull it sideways at
the<00:01:46.259> same<00:01:46.470> time<00:01:46.770> kind<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.250> pull<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.490> forwards

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
the same time kind of pull it forwards

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.010 
the same time kind of pull it forwards
and<00:01:48.180> roll<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:48.990> this
