iteration<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.570> that's<00:00:45.750> alright<00:00:46.050> because<00:00:46.110> we

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
iteration but that's alright because we

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.950 
iteration but that's alright because we
do<00:00:46.739> have<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.160> somewhat<00:00:47.520> refined<00:00:47.969> design<00:00:48.690> all

ability to change the resolution from

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.539

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
everything from a twenty point seven

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.889 
everything from a twenty point seven
down<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.850> eight<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.329> all<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.570> way<00:02:00.630> down<00:02:00.780> to

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
down to eight and all the way down to

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.569 
down to eight and all the way down to
even<00:02:01.200> two<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.130> quite<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.369> bit<00:02:02.490> of

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
even two so you have quite a bit of

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.370 
even two so you have quite a bit of
freedom<00:02:02.729> when<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.210> comes<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> settings<00:02:03.990> on

freedom when it comes to the settings on
the<00:02:04.649> actual<00:02:05.070> camera<00:02:05.460> itself<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:06.060> it's

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
the actual camera itself but it's

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.880 
the actual camera itself but it's
largely<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.659> same<00:02:06.780> experience<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.710> had

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.729 
with water and it has a very good
certification<00:03:06.900> on<00:03:06.959> here<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.290> will<00:03:07.500> be<00:03:07.620> able

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
certification on here so I will be able

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.040 
certification on here so I will be able
to<00:03:07.860> withstand<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.400> elements<00:03:08.430> we<00:03:09.360> have<00:03:09.599> done

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
to withstand the elements we have done

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.320 
to withstand the elements we have done
tests<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:11.130> see<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.640> test<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.030> durability

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
tests to see the to test the durability

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.140 
tests to see the to test the durability
of<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.690> c2<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.410> other<00:03:13.680> Xperia<00:03:14.400> Z<00:03:14.640> phones<00:03:14.910> in

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
of the c2 and other Xperia Z phones in

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.970 
of the c2 and other Xperia Z phones in
the<00:03:15.269> past<00:03:15.540> they<00:03:15.810> have<00:03:15.989> tested<00:03:16.230> very<00:03:16.560> well<00:03:16.650> in

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
the past they have tested very well in

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.070 
the past they have tested very well in
our<00:03:17.130> drop<00:03:17.760> tests<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.299> other<00:03:18.420> water<00:03:18.660> tests

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
our drop tests and other water tests

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.320 
our drop tests and other water tests
obviously<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:19.950> we<00:03:20.100> do<00:03:20.310> expect<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.760> same<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.180> be

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
obviously so we do expect the same to be

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.530 
obviously so we do expect the same to be
with<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.720> z3<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.590> z3<00:03:23.040> compact<00:03:23.250> but<00:03:24.209> largely

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
with this z3 and z3 compact but largely

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.699 
with this z3 and z3 compact but largely
we<00:03:24.810> are<00:03:24.930> looking<00:03:25.230> at<00:03:25.319> just<00:03:25.530> some

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
we are looking at just some

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.320 
we are looking at just some
optimizations<00:03:26.400> in<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.610> outside<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.090> some<00:03:27.209> on

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
optimizations in the outside and some on

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.150 
optimizations in the outside and some on
the<00:03:27.420> inside<00:03:27.750> as<00:03:27.959> well<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.349> may<00:03:28.470> not<00:03:28.620> be<00:03:28.799> a<00:03:28.950> huge

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
the inside as well it may not be a huge

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.710 
the inside as well it may not be a huge
update<00:03:29.700> but<00:03:29.880> then<00:03:30.000> again<00:03:30.120> that's<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.510> reason

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
update but then again that's the reason

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.170 
update but then again that's the reason
why<00:03:30.840> we<00:03:30.989> have<00:03:31.170> a<00:03:31.380> bi-yearly<00:03:31.950> release<00:03:32.790> schedule

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
why we have a bi-yearly release schedule

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.880 
why we have a bi-yearly release schedule
from<00:03:33.330> Sony<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:34.080> will<00:03:34.230> get<00:03:34.349> incremental

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
from Sony you will get incremental

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.949 
from Sony you will get incremental
updates<00:03:35.220> but<00:03:35.430> they<00:03:35.549> will<00:03:35.790> prove<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.330> provide

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
updates but they will prove to provide

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.570 
updates but they will prove to provide
an<00:03:37.170> even<00:03:37.380> better<00:03:37.530> experience<00:03:37.680> if<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.400> so

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
an even better experience if you so

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.670 
an even better experience if you so
choose<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:39.030> be<00:03:39.180> on<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.510> bleeding<00:03:39.720> edge<00:03:39.930> in

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
choose to be on the bleeding edge in

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.839 
choose to be on the bleeding edge in
this<00:03:40.769> case<00:03:40.980> we<00:03:41.130> have<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.340> even<00:03:41.400> more<00:03:41.700> refined

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
this case we have it even more refined

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.120 
this case we have it even more refined
design<00:03:42.420> but<00:03:42.660> also<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:43.200> good<00:03:43.560> experience

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
design but also a good experience

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.099 
design but also a good experience

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
are going to take it even more in-depth

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.770 
are going to take it even more in-depth
look<00:03:53.130> at<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.489> including<00:03:53.880> a<00:03:53.970> look<00:03:54.150> at<00:03:54.299> it

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
look at it including a look at it

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.050 
look at it including a look at it
