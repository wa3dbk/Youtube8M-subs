00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.879
 on cisco tivi leonid slut whether they 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.559
 thousand good morning eve took place 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.139
 match and friendly with a torpedo within 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.549
 this tournament pinata pk about unfortunately 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.799
 CSKA lost as you can 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.240
 comment on the game 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.300
 Likely to comment on two halves because 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.770
 that despite the fact that the bill was formed 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.070
 not as much as we would like 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.710
 spent all the planned replacements so in 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.199
 the first half once there is a type 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.850
 the main part I am more than creating 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.699
 quality game despite the fact that else 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.609
 was 11 however we created a very 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.949
 a large number of moments and completely 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:40.780
 owned advantage another moment that 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.219
 probably you can only complain in the first 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.670
 time for their implementation 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:49.329
 as for the second half, then by his 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.359
 the task is already in the second half on the second 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.839
 collecting it should just be evaluated 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.159
 individual level of readiness 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.589
 individual players 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.819
 level of progress or not progress 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.649
 young soccer players 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:00.909
 so on so talk about the goal on 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.850
 game in the second half 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.350
 unfortunately it is necessary because well 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.399
 this option composition 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.229
 usually one single our 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.509
 the team is playing therefore here we are already 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.659
 more repelled by individual 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.640
 estimates of the presence of two big forwards on 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.710
 field in the second half does that mean that 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.030
 theoretically possible changes in the scheme 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.159
 the game of our team no no it's not 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.290
 just once again the grief we needed 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.380
 see absolutely everyone considering that 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.590
 at the moment option with musa 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.030
 still remains the prerogative here 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.820
 second half should have been on the field 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.800
 Aliyev and the country will appear in order to 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.080
 get the necessary playing practice 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.540
 so it was such an impromptu other 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.820
 options 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.040
 naturally that is cherbourg main 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.630
 the task was not so much to play them 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.470
 inside the composition how much to give them 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.509
 opportunity for gaming practice in general 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.100
 lose our players do not like 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.440
 even in friendly matches 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.580
 nevertheless yesterday there was a defeat like 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.209
 in general, they responded to it well 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.860
 still you control games and 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.470
 the results of them he is certainly important but 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.840
 the winter was extremely important, understandably there 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.730
 played the whole match with a new composition then 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.650
 there was a completely different reaction therefore 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.000
 enough kept everything to this 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:28.599
 applies to and including me because 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.220
 I repeat that at the moment 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:35.250
 the results do not have key values 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.770
 second collection program coming to an end 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.520
 what feelings have you all done then 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.200
 that conceived but in general, yes in general, all 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.370
 still 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.600
 it is clear that we planned to have 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.940
 at least 1 more 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.470
 skilled rival but nothing 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.420
 don't make it happen not like 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.350
 happened therefore in general on we 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.420
 have completed this program minimal there is 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.600
 damage only milonova Ephraim 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.130
 who essentially completely missed 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.050
 Milon collecting nearly caught 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:12.360
 Efremov completely all the rest worked 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:16.100
 in the general group as a whole the team is already 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.100
 functionally ready very well
