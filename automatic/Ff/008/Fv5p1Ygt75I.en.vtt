arrow button now you see right here this

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.770 
arrow button now you see right here this
is<00:02:27.700> something<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.150> don't<00:02:28.299> see<00:02:28.420> in<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.629> lot<00:02:28.659> of

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
is something you don't see in a lot of

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.830 
is something you don't see in a lot of
GPS<00:02:29.230> units<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.830> is<00:02:30.099> map<00:02:30.879> Corrections

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
GPS units and that is map Corrections

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.690 
GPS units and that is map Corrections
and<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.290> way<00:02:32.470> this<00:02:32.680> actually<00:02:33.280> works

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
and the way this actually works

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.580 
and the way this actually works
is<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.390> are<00:02:34.510> actually<00:02:34.659> to<00:02:34.930> make<00:02:35.049> you're

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
is that you are actually to make you're

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.350 
is that you are actually to make you're
actually<00:02:35.920> able<00:02:36.099> to<00:02:36.280> make<00:02:36.519> corrections<00:02:37.180> to

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
actually able to make corrections to

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.890 
actually able to make corrections to
maps<00:02:37.989> yourself<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.090> actually<00:02:40.599> will

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
maps yourself and that actually will

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.449 
maps yourself and that actually will
make<00:02:40.930> getting<00:02:41.410> around<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.860> lot<00:02:42.069> easier<00:02:42.400> you

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
make getting around a lot easier you

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.280 
make getting around a lot easier you
don't<00:02:42.610> have<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.090> wait<00:02:43.269> for<00:02:43.299> map<00:02:43.720> updates<00:02:44.140> but

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
don't have to wait for map updates but

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.770 
don't have to wait for map updates but
what's<00:02:44.410> very<00:02:44.769> cool<00:02:45.129> about<00:02:45.430> this<00:02:45.670> is<00:02:45.879> that<00:02:46.569> when

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
what's very cool about this is that when

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.400 
what's very cool about this is that when
you<00:02:46.810> connect<00:02:47.349> your<00:02:47.530> GPS<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:49.390> what's<00:02:50.349> very

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
you connect your GPS and what's very

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.500 
you connect your GPS and what's very
cool<00:02:50.799> about<00:02:50.980> this<00:02:51.250> is<00:02:51.459> when<00:02:51.879> you<00:02:51.910> connect<00:02:52.390> your

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
cool about this is when you connect your

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.589 
cool about this is when you connect your
GPS<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.620> your<00:02:54.010> PC<00:02:54.579> all<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:55.299> your<00:02:55.420> map

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
GPS to your PC all of your map

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.509 
GPS to your PC all of your map
Corrections<00:02:56.049> can<00:02:56.200> actually<00:02:56.470> be<00:02:56.590> uploaded<00:02:57.370> to

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
Corrections can actually be uploaded to

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.280 
Corrections can actually be uploaded to
the<00:02:57.730> TomTom<00:02:58.269> website<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.930> then<00:02:59.019> you<00:02:59.110> can

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
the TomTom website and then you can

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.259 
the TomTom website and then you can
download<00:02:59.560> other<00:03:00.010> people's<00:03:00.549> map<00:03:00.760> Corrections

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
download other people's map Corrections

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.619 
download other people's map Corrections
so<00:03:01.450> so<00:03:02.260> these<00:03:02.410> maps<00:03:02.709> actually<00:03:02.950> become

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
so so these maps actually become

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.759 
so so these maps actually become
crowd-sourced<00:03:04.629> and<00:03:04.840> allow<00:03:05.049> you<00:03:05.109> to<00:03:05.290> have<00:03:05.530> up

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
crowd-sourced and allow you to have up

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.150 
crowd-sourced and allow you to have up
to<00:03:06.069> the<00:03:06.190> date<00:03:06.370> maps<00:03:07.060> whenever<00:03:08.019> you<00:03:08.620> are<00:03:08.890> out

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
to the date maps whenever you are out

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.119 
to the date maps whenever you are out
there<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:09.700> it's<00:03:10.030> actually<00:03:10.599> very<00:03:10.629> very<00:03:11.200> cool

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
there and it's actually very very cool

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.119 
there and it's actually very very cool
stuff<00:03:12.519> now<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:13.120> does<00:03:13.299> come<00:03:13.769> with<00:03:14.769> the

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
stuff now it does come with the

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.880 
stuff now it does come with the
necessary<00:03:15.489> mounting<00:03:16.150> hardware<00:03:16.329> as<00:03:16.810> well<00:03:16.890> and

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
necessary mounting hardware as well and

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.050 
necessary mounting hardware as well and
what's<00:03:18.459> great<00:03:18.640> about<00:03:18.730> this<00:03:19.090> is<00:03:19.390> it's<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.079> very

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
what's great about this is it's a very

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.619 
what's great about this is it's a very
cool<00:03:22.060> design<00:03:22.329> it<00:03:23.290> still<00:03:23.739> folds<00:03:24.280> flat<00:03:24.629> even

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
cool design it still folds flat even

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.069 
cool design it still folds flat even
when<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:26.769> have<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.849> mount<00:03:28.359> attached<00:03:28.780> to

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
when you have the the mount attached to

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.390 
when you have the the mount attached to
it<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.260> lot<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:29.590> mounts<00:03:29.829> you<00:03:29.859> know<00:03:30.010> take<00:03:30.190> up<00:03:30.310> a

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
it a lot of mounts you know take up a

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.909 
it a lot of mounts you know take up a
lot<00:03:30.519> of<00:03:30.549> space<00:03:30.819> they<00:03:31.060> extend<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.470> know<00:03:32.560> three

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
lot of space they extend you know three

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.039 
lot of space they extend you know three
or<00:03:33.010> four<00:03:33.040> inches<00:03:33.519> away<00:03:33.669> from<00:03:33.849> the<00:03:34.329> GPS<00:03:34.840> unit

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
or four inches away from the GPS unit

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.870 
or four inches away from the GPS unit
this<00:03:35.349> one<00:03:35.530> actually<00:03:35.769> folds<00:03:36.069> flat<00:03:36.220> so<00:03:36.760> when

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
this one actually folds flat so when

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.819 
this one actually folds flat so when
you're<00:03:37.000> traveling<00:03:37.269> with<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:38.019> unit<00:03:38.349> you<00:03:38.650> can

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
you're traveling with this unit you can

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.129 
you're traveling with this unit you can
still<00:03:39.160> take<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:40.239> mount<00:03:40.450> with<00:03:40.660> you<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:40.989> you

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
still take the mount with you and you

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.900 
still take the mount with you and you
don't<00:03:41.260> have<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.650> worry<00:03:42.010> about<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.700> mount

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
don't have to worry about the mount

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.809 
don't have to worry about the mount
taking<00:03:43.269> up<00:03:43.389> all<00:03:43.599> kinds<00:03:43.989> of<00:03:44.049> space<00:03:44.349> in<00:03:44.590> your<00:03:45.310> bag

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
taking up all kinds of space in your bag

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.580 
taking up all kinds of space in your bag
and<00:03:46.239> also<00:03:46.480> as<00:03:46.630> you<00:03:46.720> can<00:03:46.780> see<00:03:46.870> it<00:03:47.109> has<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.230> nice

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
and also as you can see it has a nice

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.589 
and also as you can see it has a nice
big<00:03:48.250> speaker<00:03:48.819> on<00:03:48.940> it<00:03:49.060> so<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.329> you're<00:03:49.450> going
