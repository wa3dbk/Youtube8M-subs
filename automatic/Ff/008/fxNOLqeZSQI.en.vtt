that

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.460 

right<00:01:22.050> now<00:01:22.229> I'm<00:01:22.380> playing<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.800> recruit<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:24.470> like

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
right now I'm playing on recruit I like

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.450 
right now I'm playing on recruit I like
to<00:01:25.500> plan<00:01:25.830> recruit<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.400> I'm<00:01:26.520> making<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.970> video

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
to plan recruit if I'm making a video

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.280 
to plan recruit if I'm making a video
because<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.729> makes<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.150> lot<00:01:30.300> harder<00:01:30.360> how<00:01:31.229> you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
because it makes it a lot harder how you

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.880 
because it makes it a lot harder how you
had<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.560> hold<00:01:31.830> him<00:01:31.920> from<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.340> camera<00:01:32.990> so

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.680 

right<00:01:39.490> now<00:01:39.640> I've<00:01:39.729> got<00:01:39.760> two<00:01:40.030> thousand<00:01:40.479> six

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
right now I've got two thousand six

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.440 
right now I've got two thousand six
hundred<00:01:40.780> seventy<00:01:41.590> points<00:01:41.830> I'm<00:01:42.790> still<00:01:43.090> only<00:01:43.180> on

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
hundred seventy points I'm still only on

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.359 
hundred seventy points I'm still only on
level<00:01:43.560> 5<00:01:44.560> i've<00:01:44.830> got<00:01:45.370> a<00:01:45.400> ray<00:01:45.640> gun<00:01:45.670> hand<00:01:46.180> this<00:01:46.390> gun

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
level 5 i've got a ray gun hand this gun

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.040 
level 5 i've got a ray gun hand this gun
so<00:01:48.369> it's<00:01:49.210> pretty<00:01:49.390> good

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.020 

I<00:01:55.140> think<00:01:56.010> that's<00:01:56.160> about<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.580> best<00:01:56.730> way<00:01:56.970> to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
I think that's about the best way to

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.090 
I think that's about the best way to
make<00:01:57.300> money<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:58.020> if<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.320> set<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.710> up<00:01:58.830> right

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
make money and if you set it up right

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.000 
make money and if you set it up right
you<00:01:59.760> can<00:01:59.940> shoot<00:02:00.210> them<00:02:00.480> one<00:02:01.200> time<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.860> like

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
you can shoot them one time and like

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.950 
you can shoot them one time and like
then<00:02:02.310> hit<00:02:02.580> them<00:02:02.730> see<00:02:02.970> like<00:02:03.330> an<00:02:03.450> extra<00:02:03.660> 10

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
then hit them see like an extra 10

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.590 
then hit them see like an extra 10
points<00:02:04.380> each<00:02:04.530> kill<00:02:05.010> then<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:06.120> the<00:02:06.150> second

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
points each kill then on the second

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.050 
points each kill then on the second
level<00:02:06.690> you<00:02:06.900> shoot<00:02:07.140> them<00:02:07.260> like<00:02:07.470> twice<00:02:08.060> so

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
level you shoot them like twice so

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.140 
level you shoot them like twice so
really<00:02:09.630> even<00:02:10.410> get<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.710> more<00:02:10.890> money<00:02:11.130> it's<00:02:11.940> more

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
really even get to more money it's more

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.450 
really even get to more money it's more
difficult<00:02:12.300> but<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:12.960> gets<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.200> more<00:02:13.410> money<00:02:16.460> but

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
difficult but it gets you more money but

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.910 
difficult but it gets you more money but
on<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:20.160> harder<00:02:20.550> level<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:22.290> can<00:02:22.440> only<00:02:22.590> tap

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
on the harder level you can only tap

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.090 
on the harder level you can only tap
them<00:02:23.190> up<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.490> level<00:02:23.640> two<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:27.710> you<00:02:28.710> can't<00:02:28.980> make

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
them up to level two so you can't make

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.840 
them up to level two so you can't make
it<00:02:29.250> much<00:02:29.490> money

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.630 

weirdly<00:02:34.660> i<00:02:35.140> keep<00:02:35.470> on<00:02:35.620> getting<00:02:35.680> lucky<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.430> keep
