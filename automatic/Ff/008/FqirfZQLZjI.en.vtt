00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
something like this doesn't have to be

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.849 
something like this doesn't have to be
perfect<00:02:28.000> in<00:02:28.630> fact<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.109> opposite<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.530> perfect

is<00:02:29.980> awesome<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.609> can<00:02:30.760> base<00:02:31.090> what<00:02:31.329> you're

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
is awesome you can base what you're

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
only do like half the galaxy so that i

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.070 
only do like half the galaxy so that i
can<00:03:25.350> do<00:03:25.650> dual<00:03:26.160> towns<00:03:26.520> for<00:03:26.850> them<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.959> way<00:03:28.050> i

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
can do dual towns for them the way i

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
like to think of it is you're gonna have

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.920 
like to think of it is you're gonna have
some<00:03:29.760> more<00:03:29.910> galaxies<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.660> you're<00:03:30.750> going<00:03:30.840> to

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
some more galaxies and you're going to

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.390 
some more galaxies and you're going to
have<00:03:31.050> some<00:03:31.200> cold<00:03:31.440> melt<00:03:31.650> we're<00:03:32.040> gonna<00:03:32.160> have

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
have some cold melt we're gonna have

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.920 
have some cold melt we're gonna have
some<00:03:32.940> galaxies<00:03:33.330> which<00:03:33.510> are<00:03:33.600> going<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.810> be

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
some galaxies which are going to be

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.650 
some galaxies which are going to be
purple<00:03:34.500> blue<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.340> green<00:03:35.700> based<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.180> you're

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
purple blue and green based and you're

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.000 
purple blue and green based and you're
going<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.840> have<00:03:36.930> warmer<00:03:37.260> galaxies<00:03:37.680> which<00:03:37.860> are

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
going to have warmer galaxies which are

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.790 
going to have warmer galaxies which are
red<00:03:38.459> orange<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.060> yellow<00:03:39.240> based<00:03:39.630> purple<00:03:40.260> also

red orange and yellow based purple also

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.460 
red orange and yellow based purple also
since<00:03:41.130> it<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:41.550> comprised<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.330> a<00:03:42.630> lot<00:03:43.020> of<00:03:43.200> red

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
since it is comprised of a lot of red

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.250 
since it is comprised of a lot of red
will<00:03:44.400> also<00:03:44.730> go<00:03:44.940> really<00:03:45.360> well<00:03:45.630> with<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:46.020> warmer

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
will also go really well with the warmer

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.590 
will also go really well with the warmer
galaxies<00:03:46.740> another<00:03:47.550> one<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.880> those<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.240> between

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
galaxies another one of those in between

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.020 
galaxies another one of those in between
the<00:03:48.810> kind<00:03:49.020> of<00:03:49.110> colors<00:03:49.380> is<00:03:49.560> green<00:03:49.920> green<00:03:50.580> looks

important life lesson here never give up
even<00:04:06.959> if<00:04:07.049> it<00:04:07.170> looks<00:04:07.319> like<00:04:07.409> crap<00:04:07.650> in<00:04:07.829> the

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
even if it looks like crap in the

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.949 
even if it looks like crap in the
beginning<00:04:08.040> because<00:04:08.420> things<00:04:09.420> have<00:04:09.659> a<00:04:09.689> way<00:04:09.810> of

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
beginning because things have a way of

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.949 
beginning because things have a way of
working<00:04:10.170> themselves<00:04:10.500> out<00:04:11.069> so<00:04:11.819> right<00:04:12.720> now<00:04:12.750> we

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
working themselves out so right now we

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.869 
working themselves out so right now we
could<00:04:13.200> just<00:04:13.319> have<00:04:13.500> some<00:04:13.739> splotches<00:04:14.069> of<00:04:14.280> purple

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
could just have some splotches of purple

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.270 
could just have some splotches of purple
and<00:04:15.060> orange<00:04:15.299> which<00:04:15.750> looks<00:04:16.500> kind<00:04:16.799> of<00:04:16.859> rough<00:04:17.040> but

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
and orange which looks kind of rough but

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.460 
and orange which looks kind of rough but
I<00:04:17.699> promise<00:04:18.209> you<00:04:18.239> it<00:04:18.600> will<00:04:18.720> look<00:04:18.900> good<00:04:19.079> in<00:04:19.320> the

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
I promise you it will look good in the

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.650 
I promise you it will look good in the
end<00:04:19.620> let's<00:04:20.370> move<00:04:20.489> on<00:04:20.639> the<00:04:20.760> green<00:04:20.970> in<00:04:21.000> point<00:04:21.329> I

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
end let's move on the green in point I

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.409 
end let's move on the green in point I
find<00:04:22.229> that<00:04:22.380> adding<00:04:22.740> white<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.639> whichever

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
find that adding white to whichever

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.080 
find that adding white to whichever
color<00:04:24.720> you're<00:04:24.930> about<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.260> do<00:04:25.440> well<00:04:26.250> even<00:04:26.550> in<00:04:26.970> my

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
color you're about to do well even in my

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.629 
color you're about to do well even in my
sleep<00:04:27.150> kind<00:04:27.660> of<00:04:27.720> multi<00:04:28.199> to<00:04:28.260> thing<00:04:29.190> when<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:29.490> go

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
sleep kind of multi to thing when you go

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.029 
sleep kind of multi to thing when you go
to<00:04:29.699> javits<00:04:30.150> so<00:04:30.780> don't<00:04:31.260> be<00:04:31.350> afraid<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.620> add<00:04:31.830> some

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
to javits so don't be afraid to add some

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:40.589 
to javits so don't be afraid to add some
way<00:04:32.160> if<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:32.550> feel<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.300> colors<00:04:33.570> are<00:04:33.780> dark

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.969 

also<00:04:41.599> try<00:04:41.810> to<00:04:41.870> think<00:04:42.050> of<00:04:42.229> your<00:04:42.319> darker<00:04:42.680> colors

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
also try to think of your darker colors

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:44.619 
also try to think of your darker colors
like<00:04:43.220> blues<00:04:43.490> and<00:04:43.639> purples<00:04:43.789> I'm<00:04:44.210> going<00:04:44.360> around

like blues and purples I'm going around

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:47.110 
like blues and purples I'm going around
the<00:04:45.020> outside<00:04:45.050> of<00:04:45.620> galaxies<00:04:46.250> it'll<00:04:46.819> just<00:04:46.849> give

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
the outside of galaxies it'll just give

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.089 
the outside of galaxies it'll just give
a<00:04:47.150> nice<00:04:47.330> faded<00:04:47.930> look<00:04:48.110> to<00:04:48.349> it<00:04:48.470> and<00:04:48.949> it<00:04:49.069> just

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
a nice faded look to it and it just

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:53.980 
a nice faded look to it and it just
really<00:04:49.460> wants<00:04:49.789> the<00:04:50.060> black<00:04:52.720> you're<00:04:53.720> gonna<00:04:53.840> have

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
really wants the black you're gonna have

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.409 
really wants the black you're gonna have
something<00:04:54.229> like<00:04:54.470> this<00:04:54.879> let's<00:04:55.879> move<00:04:56.060> on<00:04:56.210> to<00:04:56.360> the

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
something like this let's move on to the

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.689 
something like this let's move on to the
next<00:04:56.479> step<00:04:56.840> now<00:04:57.139> is<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.979> fun<00:04:58.129> and<00:04:58.430> you're

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
next step now is the fun and you're

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.850 
next step now is the fun and you're
super<00:04:59.030> easy<00:04:59.270> part<00:04:59.569> you<00:05:00.199> remember<00:05:00.470> that<00:05:00.500> spun

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
super easy part you remember that spun

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.110 
super easy part you remember that spun
do<00:05:00.979> we<00:05:01.069> use<00:05:01.190> in<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.370> beginning<00:05:01.490> with<00:05:01.819> a<00:05:01.849> white

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
do we use in the beginning with a white

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.960 
do we use in the beginning with a white
paint<00:05:02.419> bring<00:05:03.349> it<00:05:03.440> back<00:05:03.560> dip<00:05:04.220> it<00:05:04.250> in<00:05:04.490> water<00:05:04.520> and

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
paint bring it back dip it in water and

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.510 
paint bring it back dip it in water and
flick<00:05:05.810> it<00:05:05.840> like<00:05:06.470> a<00:05:06.500> stone<00:05:08.979> you<00:05:09.979> can<00:05:10.099> also<00:05:10.250> get

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
flick it like a stone you can also get

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.850 
flick it like a stone you can also get
closer<00:05:10.849> with<00:05:11.240> more<00:05:11.569> like<00:05:11.810> forceful<00:05:12.440> flip

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
closer with more like forceful flip

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.149 
closer with more like forceful flip
cycles<00:05:13.370> to<00:05:14.090> kind<00:05:14.419> of<00:05:14.509> imitate<00:05:15.050> where<00:05:15.440> galaxies

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.159 
cycles to kind of imitate where galaxies

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:18.640 
cycles to kind of imitate where galaxies
are<00:05:16.190> to<00:05:17.030> show<00:05:17.240> more<00:05:17.720> of<00:05:17.810> a<00:05:17.900> density<00:05:18.319> of<00:05:18.349> stars

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
are to show more of a density of stars

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.469 
are to show more of a density of stars
just<00:05:19.130> like<00:05:19.220> right<00:05:19.520> here<00:05:19.699> I<00:05:19.729> have<00:05:19.940> a<00:05:19.970> big<00:05:20.210> galaxy

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
just like right here I have a big galaxy

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.309 
just like right here I have a big galaxy
so<00:05:21.020> you<00:05:21.800> just<00:05:21.949> really<00:05:22.250> focusing<00:05:22.699> in<00:05:22.849> there

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 
so you just really focusing in there

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:26.740 
so you just really focusing in there
it's<00:05:24.319> also<00:05:24.440> fun<00:05:24.830> to<00:05:25.130> take<00:05:25.909> one<00:05:26.120> of<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.360> Bears

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
it's also fun to take one of the Bears

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.710 
it's also fun to take one of the Bears
lodge's<00:05:27.440> on<00:05:27.740> there<00:05:28.130> and<00:05:28.340> kind<00:05:29.180> of<00:05:29.300> make<00:05:29.539> a

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
lodge's on there and kind of make a

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.050 
lodge's on there and kind of make a
shooting<00:05:30.050> star<00:05:30.229> out<00:05:30.530> of<00:05:30.560> it<00:05:30.740> so<00:05:31.099> just<00:05:31.370> go<00:05:32.030> ahead

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
shooting star out of it so just go ahead

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.600 
shooting star out of it so just go ahead
and<00:05:32.210> get<00:05:32.360> this<00:05:32.719> one<00:05:33.009> you<00:05:34.009> just<00:05:34.190> want<00:05:34.340> to<00:05:34.370> drag

it with
huh

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
huh

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.010 
huh
so<00:05:38.340> that's<00:05:39.340> kind<00:05:39.610> of<00:05:39.669> it<00:05:39.819> your<00:05:40.270> hands<00:05:40.660> will<00:05:40.840> get

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
so that's kind of it your hands will get

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.279 
so that's kind of it your hands will get
messy<00:05:41.430> Yolo<00:05:42.430> so<00:05:42.880> besides<00:05:43.120> that<00:05:43.419> kind<00:05:44.110> of<00:05:44.169> an

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
messy Yolo so besides that kind of an

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.050 
messy Yolo so besides that kind of an
optional<00:05:44.680> step<00:05:44.710> you<00:05:45.099> can<00:05:45.130> add<00:05:45.430> a<00:05:45.460> quote<00:05:45.819> I

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
optional step you can add a quote I

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.999 
optional step you can add a quote I
think<00:05:46.569> it<00:05:46.660> looks<00:05:46.840> really<00:05:46.900> good<00:05:47.229> to<00:05:47.500> do<00:05:47.650> it<00:05:47.800> in

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
think it looks really good to do it in

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.999 
think it looks really good to do it in
gold<00:05:48.490> letters<00:05:49.270> so<00:05:49.840> I<00:05:49.870> had<00:05:50.229> that<00:05:50.530> gold<00:05:50.800> acrylic

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:51.009 
gold letters so I had that gold acrylic

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:53.159 
gold letters so I had that gold acrylic
paint<00:05:51.400> that<00:05:51.550> i<00:05:51.610> showed<00:05:51.789> earlier<00:05:51.940> and<00:05:52.330> i'll<00:05:53.080> go
