00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 very good guys surely many 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.049
 Sometimes you asked how we recorded 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.470
 the screen we upload videos to 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.840
 Youtube 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.910
 good if you really want to know one of 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.920
 the applications that get to do this 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.920
 that two here in antro tube 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.310
 today we bring this free application 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.290
 that we can find it in the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.150
 google play by the name of aceta 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.730
 screen recorder as you can see there 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.400
 need root to work is a 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.100
 free application although it has 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.730
 some purchases within the application 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.989
 is an application with a weight of 2 with 5 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.840
 megas and a score and as we see here 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.420
 4.5 and has 100,000 downloads if we open 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.940
 the application we find these 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.910
 four options the first one is for 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.950
 record the second are the settings the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.360
 third is the gallery where we are 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.250
 they keep all the videos that we have 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.640
 recorded and the last one is the option to 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.440
 leave we start with the second 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.620
 here as you see the first thing we have 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.540
 are the control options we have the 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.670
 use magic button that is a button 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.619
 invisible that does everything according to 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.960
 Well, if we give it there, it tells us that it is a 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.729
 magic button to pause resume or 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.040
 stop recording that is not displayed 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.550
 on screen so you do not see the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.229
 time to record the video but they are one of 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.330
 the features tested what would 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.700
 to pay or donate as they say in this 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.680
 case the second option we have is 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.720
 the options to stop recording 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.119
 I see the magic button up 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.950
 I thought we were going to have a whole 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.300
 button visible on the screen while 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.190
 we recorded that that's annoying you're going to do 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.200
 a video but I realize at 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.390
 get in there we have there that you can 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.039
 understand from the notification show 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.570
 an intermittent red dot that is what 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.000
 I used to say that he looks there all the time 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.560
 stop with the counterpart is to say 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.229
 we lock the phone and it turns off the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.929
 recording and activate a time limit that 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.300
 for example you want to record a game 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.550
 of clash of times not what lasts three 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.410
 minutes then you say it only lasted 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.600
 four minutes recordings / that you 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.890
 you put your games is I do not know what and 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.520
 so you do not have to be aware of 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.830
 walk 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.630
 the recording although I see more comfortable to 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.910
 the nation because in the end with time 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.800
 limit there is always some fault that you do not 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.300
 it's time to talk and all 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.710
 feel that we have are the adjustments of 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.050
 video inside them we have the 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.210
 resolution the next is the bit rate 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.550
 then the automatic guidance so that 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.350
 for when we enter or in which 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.880
 turn the screen automatically on 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.010
 video I recorded with the screen rotated and not 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.660
 leave the edges on the 2 around the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.730
 last option has the video settings 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.470
 It is the timelapse that is the time lapse 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.630
 as you see here fast slow is for 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.210
 modify and put it to go double 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.340
 quick half elect or things like that for 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.720
 if you want to do a speed urano after 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.400
 that you can do with this 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.940
 application that comes pretty well 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.680
 if we keep going down we have the option of 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.260
 audio settings here we can enable 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.420
 the audio recording this is with the 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.400
 microphone since this captor us 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.890
 allows you to record the sound that comes from 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.870
 the application in question a little more 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.030
 below we have the information on 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.700
 put what I told them everything 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.410
 the prize nor all this we can put a 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.690
 text the logo but good if you 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.550
 We try to give you see more asks 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.020
 features but it is not a 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.580
 little bit below we have our touches 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.470
 and as you see what we have selected and 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.110
 now the touches are shown 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.900
 if I remove it, the touches are no longer displayed 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.430
 on screen and then show camera 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.890
 front this would be to record with the 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.110
 take forward and do the typical 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.780
 videos not in 2.0 with the camera and such 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.890
 but it is also a premium option a 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.420
 little bit below we have the 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.730
 timer with a countdown 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.740
 before starting the recording that 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.450
 also it comes in handy for when we 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.890
 to set the timer so that it 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.720
 finish like this we do not have to be 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.910
 pending when it starts and when 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.830
 it ends but that I really do not see it 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.540
 very useful since we can record what 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.880
 we do not want and stop recording what 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.170
 we really want and then the last 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.240
 option that we have here would be the 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.850
 exit directory 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.310
 and here we can choose in which folder 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.130
 we want our video to be recorded 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.260
 then we'll see when we give him here and 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.210
 right now I have none and now 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.680
 last let's do a little test 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.900
 of recording we give here the little button 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.459
 to record and as you can see it would start 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.579
 here to record we have up here 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.009
 recording controls 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:27.419
 we keep going past happening 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:29.009
 and let's leave it here we go down see here 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.460
 with all that recording we went down a 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.289
 little bit more and it pauses us to stop or 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.759
 draw the draw option is the 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.520
 premium option so we will not be able to 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:41.250
 draw nothing pause if we want 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.759
 make some cut between load of some 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.360
 application or something and then stop it 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.400
 let's stop 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.349
 and it goes up here as you see 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.240
 finished recording touch to open 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:55.960
 good is aggravated with the date and time and 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.729
 the seconds that has been recorded you 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.710
 we give 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.710
 we select with what we want to open it 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.580
 and there you see it as you see it also records the 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.580
 Audio 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.270
 when we passed 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.750
 you see 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.790
 and we 're going 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.790
 or draw the option 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.490
 cause 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.620
 we already have seen so let's 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.930
 remove it and good guys this has been the 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.150
 application that we bring today if it has 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.040
 liked we hope bust like and see you 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.390
 in another video with more and better 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.390
 goodbye applications
