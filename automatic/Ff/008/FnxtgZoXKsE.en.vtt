00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the green in black and then you can

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.630 
the green in black and then you can
actually<00:01:17.490> once<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.400> just

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
actually once you do that you can just

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:30.779 
actually once you do that you can just
pull<00:01:21.060> start<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.860> no<00:01:22.860> matter<00:01:23.040> what

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.719 

see<00:01:31.840> that's<00:01:32.840> how<00:01:33.259> you<00:01:33.289> do<00:01:33.859> it<00:01:34.009> if<00:01:34.310> you<00:01:34.520> don't

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
see that's how you do it if you don't

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.139 
see that's how you do it if you don't
need<00:01:34.850> your<00:01:35.000> electric<00:01:35.329> start<00:01:36.429> now<00:01:37.429> if<00:01:37.549> you<00:01:37.670> want

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
need your electric start now if you want

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:39.819

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
your electric start and your lights and

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.380 
your electric start and your lights and
stuff<00:01:40.069> because<00:01:40.280> once<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.609> cut<00:01:40.789> those<00:01:40.969> black

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
stuff because once you cut those black

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.309 
stuff because once you cut those black
cables<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:44.240> have<00:01:44.270> no<00:01:44.539> power<00:01:44.750> going<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.200> it

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
cables you have no power going to it

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.169 
cables you have no power going to it
then<00:01:45.799> you<00:01:46.459> won't<00:01:46.640> have<00:01:46.700> any<00:01:46.850> lights<00:01:49.090> what<00:01:50.090> you

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
cable I put a switch there so it's going

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.449 
cable I put a switch there so it's going
to<00:01:56.479> be<00:01:56.539> more<00:01:56.719> permanent<00:01:56.929> and<00:01:57.829> ran<00:01:58.039> this<00:01:58.250> up

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
to be more permanent and ran this up

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:00.669 
to be more permanent and ran this up
