00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
you do not know how to do that you go to

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.190 
you do not know how to do that you go to
end<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.480> point<00:02:40.720> or<00:02:40.989> he<00:02:41.380> point<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.959> what<00:02:43.959> you<00:02:44.080> do

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
is either going to be it should if you

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.890 
is either going to be it should if you
have<00:02:47.620> both<00:02:47.980> auxiliaries<00:02:48.760> then<00:02:49.480> you'll<00:02:49.750> have

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
have both auxiliaries then you'll have

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.140 
have both auxiliaries then you'll have
to<00:02:50.049> do<00:02:50.140> this<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.380> bulk<00:02:50.560> aux<00:02:50.769> abilities<00:02:51.160> but<00:02:51.940> as

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
to do this to bulk aux abilities but as

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.070 
to do this to bulk aux abilities but as
you<00:02:52.480> can<00:02:52.600> see<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:53.709> is<00:02:53.860> on<00:02:53.950> 100%<00:02:54.910> for<00:02:55.720> auxilary

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
you can see it is on 100% for auxilary

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.080 
you can see it is on 100% for auxilary
one<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.709> then<00:02:56.920> when<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.070> flip<00:02:57.400> my<00:02:57.430> gear<00:02:57.820> switch

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
one and then when I flip my gear switch

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.680 
one and then when I flip my gear switch
it<00:02:59.049> changes<00:02:59.470> over<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.799> the<00:02:59.890> other<00:03:00.010> side<00:03:00.310> and

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
it changes over to the other side and

to have a set for 0% and I go down one

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.770 
to have a set for 0% and I go down one
just<00:03:10.120> leave<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.570> 100%<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.380> then<00:03:11.680> 0%<00:03:12.370> again

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
just leave that 100% and then 0% again

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:35.990 

and<00:04:28.530> that's<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.860> initializing<00:04:31.220> now<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:35.000> come

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
and that's the initializing now I come

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:48.620 
and that's the initializing now I come
over<00:04:36.240> here<00:04:44.330> you<00:04:45.330> see<00:04:45.510> that<00:04:45.540> I<00:04:45.840> have<00:04:47.210> flaps<00:04:48.210> are

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
over here you see that I have flaps are

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.760 
over here you see that I have flaps are
up<00:04:49.610> now<00:04:50.610> when<00:04:50.760> I<00:04:50.790> go<00:04:51.030> over<00:04:51.300> here<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.840> I<00:04:52.410> flipped

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
up now when I go over here and I flipped

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.770 
up now when I go over here and I flipped
my<00:04:52.830> toggle<00:04:53.670> switch<00:04:54.260> they<00:04:55.260> only<00:04:55.410> go<00:04:55.650> down<00:04:56.780> I'd

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
my toggle switch they only go down I'd

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.160 
my toggle switch they only go down I'd
say<00:04:58.020> about<00:04:58.140> two<00:04:59.010> three<00:04:59.460> inches<00:04:59.990> that<00:05:00.990> is<00:05:01.050> a

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
say about two three inches that is a

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.890 
say about two three inches that is a
minimum<00:05:01.650> I've<00:05:01.830> gotten<00:05:02.280> them<00:05:02.430> and<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:03.690> notice

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
minimum I've gotten them and you notice

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.840 
minimum I've gotten them and you notice
that<00:05:03.990> they<00:05:04.110> go<00:05:04.230> pretty<00:05:04.410> fast<00:05:04.620> but<00:05:05.130> if<00:05:05.610> you<00:05:05.760> go

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
that they go pretty fast but if you go

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.870 
that they go pretty fast but if you go
to<00:05:05.940> a<00:05:06.120> heads<00:05:06.330> up<00:05:06.480> RC<00:05:06.990> calm<00:05:07.620> and<00:05:08.010> towards<00:05:08.760> the

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
bottom of their page you will see servo

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.070 
bottom of their page you will see servo
accessories<00:05:12.450> look<00:05:13.200> for<00:05:13.500> on<00:05:14.390> servo<00:05:15.390> rate

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
accessories look for on servo rate

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.080 
accessories look for on servo rate
adjuster<00:05:16.680> and<00:05:17.010> it'll<00:05:17.250> slow<00:05:17.430> it<00:05:17.550> down<00:05:17.580> so<00:05:17.910> okay

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
adjuster and it'll slow it down so okay

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.590 
adjuster and it'll slow it down so okay
so<00:05:18.300> it'll<00:05:18.900> do<00:05:19.020> it<00:05:19.140> nice<00:05:19.350> and<00:05:19.380> slow<00:05:20.210> but<00:05:21.210> then

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
so it'll do it nice and slow but then

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.840 
so it'll do it nice and slow but then
everything<00:05:21.900> else<00:05:22.200> and<00:05:22.710> since<00:05:23.580> I<00:05:23.670> have

retractable landing gear I don't have a
switch<00:05:29.730> for<00:05:29.940> that<00:05:29.970> so<00:05:30.690> I<00:05:30.720> said<00:05:31.020> it

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
switch for that so I said it

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.550 
switch for that so I said it
I<00:05:31.440> set<00:05:31.980> it<00:05:32.220> sorry<00:05:32.880> so<00:05:33.450> this<00:05:33.600> went<00:05:33.870> to<00:05:34.140> this<00:05:34.290> um
