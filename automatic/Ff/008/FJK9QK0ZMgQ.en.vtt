people<00:01:39.689> taken<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.409> routes<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.549> really

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
people taken the routes is is really

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.149 
people taken the routes is is really
important<00:01:42.720> because<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.590> understand<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
important because if you understand the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.800 
important because if you understand the
traffic<00:01:44.579> patterns<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.240> then<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.540> routes

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
traffic patterns and then the routes

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.230 
traffic patterns and then the routes
that<00:01:46.170> people<00:01:46.229> love<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.799> take<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.640> common

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
that people love to take the common

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.090 
that people love to take the common
areas<00:01:48.570> people<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> high<00:01:49.350> well<00:01:49.740> not<00:01:49.890> high

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
areas people like the high well not high

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.770 
areas people like the high well not high
but<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.490> common<00:01:50.850> areas<00:01:51.149> people<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.630> go

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
but the common areas people like to go

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.749 
but the common areas people like to go
to<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:52.590> example<00:01:52.680> these<00:01:53.070> two<00:01:53.220> buildings<00:01:53.460> right

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
to for example these two buildings right

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.940 
to for example these two buildings right
here<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:55.020> building<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.409> my<00:01:55.500> right<00:01:55.740> as

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
here that the building to my right as

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.760 
here that the building to my right as
well<00:01:56.189> these<00:01:56.820> are<00:01:56.880> are<00:01:57.689> pretty<00:01:58.049> common<00:01:58.380> honest

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
well these are are pretty common honest

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.920 
well these are are pretty common honest
Maps<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.159> if<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.369> stay<00:01:59.579> around<00:01:59.759> this<00:01:59.969> area<00:02:00.240> not

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
Maps so if you stay around this area not

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.569 
Maps so if you stay around this area not
even<00:02:01.229> standing<00:02:01.710> still<00:02:01.979> but<00:02:02.159> if<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.369> just

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579

paced<00:02:03.390> back<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.630> forth<00:02:03.780> go<00:02:04.320> on<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> far

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
paced back and forth go on to the far

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.800 
paced back and forth go on to the far
left<00:02:04.920> side<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:05.939> area<00:02:06.240> than<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.450> far<00:02:06.630> right

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
left side of this area than a far right

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.380 
left side of this area than a far right
side<00:02:07.049> by<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.560> building<00:02:07.979> you'll<00:02:08.459> find<00:02:08.789> you'll

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
side by this building you'll find you'll

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.609 
side by this building you'll find you'll
find<00:02:09.629> some<00:02:09.810> action<00:02:10.020> there's

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
find some action there's

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.839 
find some action there's
reason<00:02:10.860> why<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.009> shouldn't<00:02:11.340> finding<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
reason why you shouldn't finding the

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.640 
reason why you shouldn't finding the
action<00:02:12.209> unless<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.810> opposing<00:02:13.290> team<00:02:13.620> is

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
action unless the opposing team is

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.070 
action unless the opposing team is
hiding<00:02:14.220> which<00:02:14.819> which<00:02:15.120> happens<00:02:15.569> people<00:02:15.959> like

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
hiding which which happens people like

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.070 
hiding which which happens people like
to<00:02:16.200> hide<00:02:16.349> sometimes<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.870> will<00:02:18.870> find

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
to hide sometimes so you will find

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.690 
to hide sometimes so you will find
action<00:02:19.500> that's<00:02:19.650> what<00:02:19.890> what<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.250> learned<00:02:20.580> about

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
action that's what what I learned about

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.399 
action that's what what I learned about
this<00:02:20.909> map<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.450> traffic<00:02:21.840> patterns<00:02:22.200> and

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
this map and the traffic patterns and

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.210 
this map and the traffic patterns and
just<00:02:22.489> understanding<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.640> game<00:02:23.879> so<00:02:24.950> yeah<00:02:25.950> so

shotgun attachment or the the new tube

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.690 
shotgun attachment or the the new tube
attachment<00:02:46.260> then<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.040> fire<00:02:47.280> rate<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.549> this

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
attachment then the fire rate of this

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.729 
attachment then the fire rate of this
gun<00:02:47.849> will<00:02:48.060> increase<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:49.049> is<00:02:49.200> my<00:02:49.319> second

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
gun will increase so this is my second

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.380 
gun will increase so this is my second
game<00:02:49.890> with<00:02:50.069> it<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.760> could<00:02:51.209> feel<00:02:51.329> the

game with it and I could feel the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.460 
game with it and I could feel the
difference<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:54.120> reason<00:02:54.329> I'm<00:02:54.420> using<00:02:54.629> this<00:02:54.780> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
difference the reason I'm using this the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.780 
difference the reason I'm using this the
noob<00:02:55.709> tube<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.069> cuz<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.430> don't<00:02:56.489> have<00:02:56.670> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
noob tube is cuz I don't have the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.670 
noob tube is cuz I don't have the
shotgun<00:02:57.060> attachment<00:02:57.690> yet<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:58.140> believe<00:02:58.290> I

I didn't instantly run and get it like
my<00:05:02.120> teammate<00:05:02.479> did<00:05:02.719> if<00:05:02.960> I<00:05:03.770> wasn't<00:05:03.949> right<00:05:04.190> there

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430

my teammate did if I wasn't right there
there<00:05:05.030> was<00:05:05.180> there<00:05:05.599> was<00:05:05.750> be<00:05:06.199> a<00:05:06.229> high<00:05:06.500> chance

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
there was there was be a high chance

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.399 
there was there was be a high chance
that<00:05:07.159> he<00:05:07.280> would<00:05:07.400> have<00:05:07.490> died<00:05:07.639> so<00:05:08.120> you<00:05:08.870> know<00:05:08.960> it's

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
that he would have died so you know it's

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.010 
that he would have died so you know it's
pretty<00:05:09.590> simple<00:05:10.099> check<00:05:10.400> check<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.449> area<00:05:11.629> first

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
pretty simple check check the area first

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.110 
pretty simple check check the area first
before<00:05:12.229> we<00:05:12.379> get<00:05:12.440> a<00:05:12.500> dog<00:05:12.740> tag<00:05:13.099> or<00:05:13.460> unless<00:05:13.940> you

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
before we get a dog tag or unless you

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.180 
before we get a dog tag or unless you
see<00:05:14.270> your<00:05:14.449> majority<00:05:15.020> or<00:05:15.229> team<00:05:15.469> by<00:05:15.620> you<00:05:15.680> and

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
see your majority or team by you and

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.700 
see your majority or team by you and
it's<00:05:16.580> pretty<00:05:16.819> pretty<00:05:17.629> likely<00:05:17.900> that<00:05:18.229> the<00:05:18.440> the

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
it's pretty pretty likely that the the

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.499 
it's pretty pretty likely that the the
opposing<00:05:19.129> team<00:05:19.310> isn't<00:05:19.550> near<00:05:19.849> you<00:05:19.969> so<00:05:20.180> it's

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
opposing team isn't near you so it's

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.800 
opposing team isn't near you so it's
safe<00:05:20.719> to<00:05:20.900> get<00:05:20.990> that<00:05:21.169> dog<00:05:21.379> tag<00:05:22.000> so<00:05:23.000> yeah<00:05:23.150> get<00:05:23.750> a

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
safe to get that dog tag so yeah get a

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.170 
safe to get that dog tag so yeah get a
couple<00:05:24.110> kills<00:05:24.349> with<00:05:24.500> this<00:05:24.620> creeper<00:05:25.130> and<00:05:25.669> also
