here ok now painted the back of it and

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.200 
here ok now painted the back of it and
the<00:00:14.340> first<00:00:14.580> time<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:15.089> was<00:00:15.269> just<00:00:15.540> perfect<00:00:16.910> but<00:00:17.910> I

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
the first time it was just perfect but I

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.720 
the first time it was just perfect but I
put<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.510> clear<00:00:18.720> coats<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:20.810> let<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.990> dry

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
put the clear coats on and let that dry

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.410 
put the clear coats on and let that dry
and<00:00:23.730> then<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.590> actually<00:00:25.820> turned<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:27.000> over<00:00:27.119> like

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
and then I actually turned it over like

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.980 
and then I actually turned it over like
this<00:00:27.710> so<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.769> could<00:00:28.949> clear<00:00:29.160> coat<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.640> side<00:00:29.990> and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
this so I could clear coat this side and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.720 
this so I could clear coat this side and
then<00:00:31.859> clear<00:00:32.399> coated<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.759> side<00:00:33.000> let<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.360> dry<00:00:33.570> I

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
then clear coated this side let it dry I

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.069 
then clear coated this side let it dry I
started<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.850> turn<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.149> over<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.840> paint

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
started to turn it over and the paint

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.860 
started to turn it over and the paint
started<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.559> peel<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.309> bunch<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.579> spots<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.809> I

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870
