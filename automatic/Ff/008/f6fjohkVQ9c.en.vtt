do<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.350> today<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.710> probably<00:00:53.070> not<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.370> best

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
do this today is probably not the best

of the worms and compost out of my being

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:39.620 
of the worms and compost out of my being
and<00:01:19.430> basically<00:01:20.540> it<00:01:21.540> better<00:01:22.170> sets

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.190 

once<00:01:40.230> I<00:01:40.350> get<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.530> done<00:01:40.890> then<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.720> take<00:01:42.990> all

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
once I get that done then and take all

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.820 
once I get that done then and take all

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.510 
the hyung composted off the top and
it'll<00:01:47.040> go<00:01:47.159> back<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:49.110> be<00:01:49.979> mixed<00:01:50.310> into

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
it'll go back in here to be mixed into

it'll go back in here to be mixed into
the<00:01:50.640> new<00:01:50.760> compost<00:01:51.180> bin<00:01:52.580> okay<00:01:53.970> down<00:01:54.119> my

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
first run and you can see get nice nice

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.300 
first run and you can see get nice nice
rich

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.600 

more<00:02:01.850> poof<00:02:02.120> if<00:02:02.510> you<00:02:02.750> will<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:04.100> then<00:02:04.310> I<00:02:04.400> can

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
more poof if you will and then I can

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.940 
more poof if you will and then I can
gather<00:02:04.790> at<00:02:05.030> my<00:02:05.180> arms<00:02:05.510> put<00:02:06.350> them<00:02:06.440> back<00:02:06.590> in<00:02:06.800> the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
gather at my arms put them back in the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.719 
gather at my arms put them back in the
box<00:02:07.130> here<00:02:07.750> for<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.840> next<00:02:09.080> round

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
box here for the next round

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.259 
box here for the next round
and<00:02:12.129> pretty<00:02:13.129> much<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:15.470> shaker<00:02:15.709> I've<00:02:16.010> got<00:02:16.280> is

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
and pretty much the shaker I've got is

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.619 
and pretty much the shaker I've got is
not<00:02:17.690> small<00:02:18.049> enough<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.379> keep<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.650> worms<00:02:18.830> out

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
not small enough to keep the worms out

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.600 
not small enough to keep the worms out
but<00:02:20.629> at<00:02:21.080> least<00:02:21.290> we<00:02:21.530> separate<00:02:22.010> out<00:02:22.220> all<00:02:22.250> the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
but at least we separate out all the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.059 
but at least we separate out all the
uncommon

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
uncommon

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.600 
uncommon
and<00:02:25.069> then<00:02:26.030> having<00:02:26.420> this<00:02:26.720> little<00:02:27.110> box<00:02:27.290> here

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
and then having this little box here

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.479 
and then having this little box here
just<00:02:28.610> lets<00:02:28.819> me<00:02:28.879> gather<00:02:29.120> at<00:02:29.360> norms<00:02:30.099> and<00:02:31.099> put

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
just lets me gather at norms and put

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:32.500 
just lets me gather at norms and put
them<00:02:31.580> back<00:02:31.730> where<00:02:31.790> they<00:02:31.970> belong

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
them back where they belong

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.369 
them back where they belong
now<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.709> not<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.069> most<00:02:34.780> time<00:02:35.780> efficient

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
now this is not the most time efficient

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.890 
now this is not the most time efficient
way<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.010> do<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.540> but<00:02:38.540> again<00:02:39.110> I'm<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.829> small-scale

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
way to do it but again I'm a small-scale

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.729 
way to do it but again I'm a small-scale
composter<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.170> don't<00:02:42.620> do<00:02:42.769> a<00:02:42.799> lot<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.069> this<00:02:44.739> at

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
composter I don't do a lot of this at

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.780 
composter I don't do a lot of this at
least<00:02:45.799> not<00:02:46.040> right<00:02:46.190> now<00:02:46.569> and<00:02:47.569> so<00:02:48.519> for<00:02:49.519> me<00:02:49.640> this

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
least not right now and so for me this

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.150 
least not right now and so for me this
works<00:02:50.090> but<00:02:50.690> now<00:02:50.900> this<00:02:51.650> gives<00:02:51.890> me<00:02:52.040> the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
works but now this gives me the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.470 
works but now this gives me the
opportunity<00:02:52.579> to<00:02:52.609> get<00:02:52.760> through<00:02:52.940> this<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.299> can

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
opportunity to get through this I can

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.990 
opportunity to get through this I can
look<00:02:53.510> for<00:02:53.780> cocoons<00:02:54.640> make<00:02:55.640> sure<00:02:55.819> I<00:02:55.849> haven't

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
look for cocoons make sure I haven't

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.330 
look for cocoons make sure I haven't
missed<00:02:56.090> any<00:02:56.420> worms<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:57.739> all<00:02:57.950> of<00:02:58.069> this<00:02:58.160> would

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
missed any worms and all of this would

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.000 
missed any worms and all of this would
go<00:02:58.489> into<00:02:58.670> my<00:02:58.819> compost<00:02:59.390> bucket<00:02:59.859> where<00:03:00.859> I'll

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
go into my compost bucket where I'll

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.650 
go into my compost bucket where I'll
carry<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.430> out<00:03:01.549> and<00:03:01.760> then<00:03:02.030> I'll<00:03:02.150> mix<00:03:02.329> it<00:03:02.540> in

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
carry it out and then I'll mix it in

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.440 
carry it out and then I'll mix it in
with<00:03:02.780> Sol<00:03:03.079> and<00:03:03.379> I'll<00:03:04.190> make<00:03:04.340> pots<00:03:04.579> all<00:03:04.819> out<00:03:05.000> for

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
with Sol and I'll make pots all out for

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.559

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
little bit of odor to it which tells me

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.420 
little bit of odor to it which tells me
I<00:03:27.319> didn't<00:03:28.130> have<00:03:28.250> probably<00:03:28.609> enough<00:03:28.880> air<00:03:29.120> in<00:03:29.419> my

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430

some<00:04:46.300> folks<00:04:46.539> like<00:04:46.719> to<00:04:46.750> shred<00:04:46.960> there's<00:04:47.289> fine<00:04:47.620> I

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:48.719 
some folks like to shred there's fine I

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:51.899 
some folks like to shred there's fine I
feel<00:04:49.719> like<00:04:49.960> it<00:04:50.169> that<00:04:50.860> as<00:04:51.159> long<00:04:51.340> as<00:04:51.370> you<00:04:51.550> tear<00:04:51.789> it

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
feel like it that as long as you tear it

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:53.550 
feel like it that as long as you tear it
up<00:04:51.969> into<00:04:52.270> pieces<00:04:52.479> so<00:04:52.840> that<00:04:52.870> it<00:04:53.020> doesn't<00:04:53.379> clump

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
up into pieces so that it doesn't clump

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.010 
up into pieces so that it doesn't clump
together<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:54.279> mat<00:04:55.060> where<00:04:55.509> the<00:04:55.629> worms<00:04:55.810> would

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
together and mat where the worms would

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.230 
together and mat where the worms would
suffocate<00:04:56.669> it'll<00:04:57.669> be<00:04:57.759> fine

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
suffocate it'll be fine

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.170 
suffocate it'll be fine
you<00:04:58.360> wet<00:04:58.599> it<00:04:58.629> and<00:04:59.490> once<00:05:00.490> you've<00:05:00.669> wet<00:05:00.849> it<00:05:00.969> down

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
you wet it and once you've wet it down

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.350 
you wet it and once you've wet it down
then<00:05:01.389> you<00:05:01.479> drain<00:05:01.689> the<00:05:01.870> water<00:05:01.990> off<00:05:02.259> of<00:05:02.529> it<00:05:02.650> and

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
then you drain the water off of it and

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.219 
then you drain the water off of it and
you<00:05:04.360> just<00:05:04.389> kind<00:05:04.840> of<00:05:05.219> bring<00:05:06.219> it<00:05:06.460> out<00:05:06.900> so<00:05:07.900> there's

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
you just kind of bring it out so there's

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.679 
you just kind of bring it out so there's
not<00:05:08.379> any<00:05:08.439> standing<00:05:09.009> water<00:05:09.069> in<00:05:09.430> it<00:05:09.599> then<00:05:10.599> you

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:10.689 
not any standing water in it then you

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:14.339 
not any standing water in it then you
separate<00:05:11.080> it<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:12.699> then<00:05:13.029> to<00:05:13.330> this<00:05:13.569> I'll<00:05:14.080> add

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
separate it and then to this I'll add

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:19.469 
separate it and then to this I'll add
leaves<00:05:15.029> and<00:05:17.370> then<00:05:18.370> I'll<00:05:18.580> add<00:05:18.789> the<00:05:19.000> rest<00:05:19.210> of<00:05:19.360> my

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.550 
leaves and then I'll add the rest of my
own<00:05:19.840> compost<00:05:20.409> and<00:05:20.680> compost<00:05:20.740> and<00:05:21.400> my<00:05:21.550> warms<00:05:22.560> one

the setup on my box I'm using 18 gallon
Rubbermaid<00:05:28.599> totes<00:05:28.930> and<00:05:29.909> this<00:05:30.909> is<00:05:31.089> my<00:05:31.240> bottom<00:05:31.629> I

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
Rubbermaid totes and this is my bottom I

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:33.829 
Rubbermaid totes and this is my bottom I
tote<00:05:32.110> I<00:05:32.319> have<00:05:32.409> air<00:05:32.800> holes<00:05:32.979> drilled<00:05:33.279> around<00:05:33.550> it

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:33.839 
tote I have air holes drilled around it

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.149 
tote I have air holes drilled around it
and<00:05:34.839> then<00:05:34.990> I<00:05:35.050> have<00:05:35.199> blocks<00:05:35.469> in<00:05:35.680> the<00:05:35.740> bottom<00:05:36.039> of

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159 
and then I have blocks in the bottom of

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:37.619 
and then I have blocks in the bottom of
it<00:05:36.219> and<00:05:36.250> that's<00:05:36.460> to<00:05:36.580> hold<00:05:36.729> the<00:05:36.940> second<00:05:37.330> tote<00:05:37.479> up

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:37.629 
it and that's to hold the second tote up

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.079 
it and that's to hold the second tote up
off<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:37.960> bottom<00:05:38.219> to<00:05:39.219> allow<00:05:39.279> it<00:05:39.460> for<00:05:39.639> proper

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:40.089 
off the bottom to allow it for proper

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.640 
off the bottom to allow it for proper
drainage<00:05:41.009> and<00:05:42.009> I'll<00:05:42.129> put<00:05:42.430> the<00:05:42.550> second<00:05:42.940> tote<00:05:43.150> in

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
drainage and I'll put the second tote in

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.110 
drainage and I'll put the second tote in
insert<00:05:44.650> into<00:05:44.919> this<00:05:45.099> and<00:05:45.460> then<00:05:45.550> I<00:05:45.639> have<00:05:45.819> a<00:05:45.849> lid

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
insert into this and then I have a lid

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.540 
insert into this and then I have a lid
that<00:05:46.169> goes<00:05:47.169> on<00:05:47.379> top<00:05:47.589> of<00:05:47.740> it<00:05:47.800> really<00:05:48.039> is<00:05:48.190> just<00:05:48.310> a

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
that goes on top of it really is just a

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.029 
that goes on top of it really is just a
furnace<00:05:48.909> filter<00:05:49.539> but<00:05:50.469> it<00:05:50.500> blocks<00:05:50.710> out<00:05:51.009> the

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
furnace filter but it blocks out the

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.890 
furnace filter but it blocks out the
light<00:05:51.189> and<00:05:51.639> allows<00:05:52.270> plenty<00:05:52.569> of<00:05:52.779> air

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
light and allows plenty of air

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.230 
light and allows plenty of air
circulation<00:05:53.319> it<00:05:54.250> also<00:05:54.400> keeps<00:05:54.729> the<00:05:54.849> worms<00:05:55.029> in

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
circulation it also keeps the worms in

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.529 
circulation it also keeps the worms in
in<00:05:55.389> case<00:05:55.539> they<00:05:55.659> want<00:05:55.810> to<00:05:55.870> try<00:05:56.020> to<00:05:56.080> escape<00:05:57.539> okay

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
in case they want to try to escape okay

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.309 
in case they want to try to escape okay
so<00:05:58.599> now<00:05:58.900> I've<00:05:59.020> gone<00:05:59.219> mixed<00:06:00.219> in<00:06:00.569> small<00:06:01.569> leaves<00:06:01.839> a

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
so now I've gone mixed in small leaves a

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.379 
so now I've gone mixed in small leaves a
little<00:06:02.439> bit<00:06:02.589> of<00:06:02.680> grass<00:06:02.949> don't<00:06:03.819> use<00:06:04.089> a<00:06:04.120> lot<00:06:04.360> of

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
little bit of grass don't use a lot of

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.079 
little bit of grass don't use a lot of
green<00:06:04.659> grass<00:06:04.930> green<00:06:05.529> grass<00:06:06.000> clumps<00:06:07.000> together

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.089 
green grass green grass clumps together

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:10.559 
green grass green grass clumps together
it<00:06:07.419> gets<00:06:07.539> really<00:06:07.779> hot<00:06:08.110> and<00:06:08.939> becomes<00:06:09.939> anaerobic

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:10.569 
it gets really hot and becomes anaerobic

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:12.240 
it gets really hot and becomes anaerobic
really<00:06:10.779> fast<00:06:11.050> so<00:06:11.500> I<00:06:11.560> put<00:06:11.740> just<00:06:11.770> a<00:06:11.979> little<00:06:12.009> bit

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
really fast so I put just a little bit

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.560 
really fast so I put just a little bit
in<00:06:12.370> here<00:06:12.580> that<00:06:13.360> makes<00:06:13.539> the<00:06:13.810> leaves<00:06:13.990> in<00:06:14.759> with

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
in here that makes the leaves in with

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.780 
in here that makes the leaves in with
my<00:06:17.590> grocery<00:06:18.590> bags<00:06:18.970> now<00:06:19.970> I'm<00:06:20.300> gonna<00:06:20.450> add<00:06:20.660> the
