potatoes that I am using in the recipe

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.619 
potatoes that I am using in the recipe
are<00:01:01.500> non<00:01:01.739> starchy<00:01:02.070> potatoes<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.210> simple

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
are non starchy potatoes for the simple

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.539 
are non starchy potatoes for the simple
reason<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.650> caramelization<00:01:05.519> process

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
reason that the caramelization process

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.060 
reason that the caramelization process
in<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.659> potatoes<00:01:07.110> because<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> less

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
in the potatoes because of the less

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.340 
in the potatoes because of the less
content<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.729> starch<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.330> delayed<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
content of starch is delayed and the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.410 
content of starch is delayed and the
potatoes<00:01:10.830> when<00:01:11.159> frying<00:01:11.520> tend<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.939> become<00:01:12.060> nice

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
potatoes when frying tend to become nice

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.310 
potatoes when frying tend to become nice
and<00:01:12.450> crispy

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
and crispy

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.149 
and crispy
okay<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.790> we'll<00:01:15.450> grate<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.020> potatoes<00:01:16.500> make

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
