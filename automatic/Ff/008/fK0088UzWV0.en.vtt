those little springy tabs and it'll just
pop<00:01:24.549> right<00:01:24.789> out<00:01:24.999> you<00:01:25.329> got<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.479> play<00:01:25.689> with<00:01:25.719> it

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
pop right out you got to play with it

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.419 
pop right out you got to play with it
you<00:01:26.170> got<00:01:26.289> to<00:01:26.380> do<00:01:26.469> it<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.649> few<00:01:26.829> times<00:01:26.979> you'll<00:01:27.310> get

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
you got to do it a few times you'll get

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.010 
you got to do it a few times you'll get
good<00:01:27.640> at<00:01:27.789> it<00:01:27.820> it's<00:01:28.149> a<00:01:28.240> little<00:01:28.359> bit<00:01:28.570> awkward<00:01:28.719> in

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
good at it it's a little bit awkward in

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.480 
good at it it's a little bit awkward in
the<00:01:29.049> beginning<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.710> be<00:01:29.799> honest<00:01:30.130> sometimes

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.459 
the beginning to be honest sometimes
it's<00:01:30.700> still<00:01:30.880> awkward<00:01:31.179> for<00:01:31.450> me<00:01:31.479> but<00:01:32.140> it<00:01:32.259> works

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
it's still awkward for me but it works

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.819

so<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.429> get<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.789> insert<00:01:34.119> in<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.960> bottom<00:01:35.560> swing

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
so to get the insert in the bottom swing

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.429 
so to get the insert in the bottom swing
is<00:01:35.950> going<00:01:36.310> first<00:01:36.719> try<00:01:37.719> and<00:01:37.810> get<00:01:37.899> it<00:01:38.020> near<00:01:38.319> or

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
is going first try and get it near or

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.050 
is going first try and get it near or
over<00:01:38.710> that<00:01:38.859> nose<00:01:39.069> bridge<00:01:39.369> and<00:01:39.670> then<00:01:39.789> you<00:01:39.880> put<00:01:40.030> a

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
over that nose bridge and then you put a

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.690 
over that nose bridge and then you put a
little<00:01:40.179> bit<00:01:40.359> of<00:01:40.479> pressure<00:01:40.659> on<00:01:40.929> the<00:01:41.049> top<00:01:41.229> once

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
little bit of pressure on the top once

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.130
