now<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.060> pants<00:00:14.030> and<00:00:15.560> I'm<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.770> do<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
now the pants and I'm going to do the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.279 
now the pants and I'm going to do the
pants<00:00:17.340> on<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.490> inside<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.090> jacket<00:00:18.240> all<00:00:18.630> on

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
pants on the inside of the jacket all on

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.370 
pants on the inside of the jacket all on
the<00:00:19.380> same<00:00:19.530> smoother<00:00:19.920> group<00:00:20.689> and<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.109> reason

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
the same smoother group and the reason

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.179 
the same smoother group and the reason
is<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:23.009> don't<00:00:23.880> want<00:00:24.089> this<00:00:24.500> hard<00:00:25.500> line

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
is this I don't want this hard line

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.820 
is this I don't want this hard line
transition<00:00:29.630> to<00:00:30.630> appear<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.380> texturing

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
transition to appear in the texturing

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.830 
transition to appear in the texturing
and<00:00:31.949> you'll<00:00:32.790> see<00:00:33.000> what<00:00:33.150> I<00:00:33.210> mean<00:00:33.300> once<00:00:33.930> we

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
and you'll see what I mean once we

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.190 
and you'll see what I mean once we
unhide<00:00:36.840> all<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:38.010> pieces<00:00:38.580> of<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.880> model<00:00:42.200> so

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
unhide all the pieces of the model so

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:55.130 
unhide all the pieces of the model so
I'm<00:00:43.290> leaving<00:00:43.740> the<00:00:43.890> shoes<00:00:44.220> out

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.630 

alright<00:00:56.140> so<00:00:56.289> that<00:00:56.320> looks<00:00:56.590> good<00:00:56.800> and<00:00:57.160> I'll<00:00:57.460> set

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
alright so that looks good and I'll set

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.450 
alright so that looks good and I'll set
that<00:00:57.670> 24<00:01:00.149> hide<00:01:01.149> selected<00:01:03.180> select<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.360> shoes

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
that 24 hide selected select the shoes

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.399 
that 24 hide selected select the shoes
just<00:01:06.460> gotta<00:01:06.880> make<00:01:07.000> sure<00:01:07.060> that<00:01:07.570> I<00:01:09.000> grow<00:01:10.000> them

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
just gotta make sure that I grow them

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.120 
just gotta make sure that I grow them
should<00:01:11.409> I<00:01:11.440> grab<00:01:11.500> everything<00:01:11.979> and<00:01:13.950> I'll<00:01:14.950> set

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
should I grab everything and I'll set

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:31.360 
should I grab everything and I'll set
test<00:01:15.340> five<00:01:15.820> I<00:01:17.610> selected<00:01:21.360> coat

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.500 

bro<00:01:32.000> bro

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.200 

I'll<00:01:38.080> do<00:01:38.230> one<00:01:38.410> more<00:01:38.560> crow<00:01:39.840> there<00:01:40.840> we<00:01:40.930> go<00:01:42.210> set

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
I'll do one more crow there we go set

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:52.380 
I'll do one more crow there we go set
this<00:01:43.330> to<00:01:43.540> six<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.940> then<00:01:46.540> do<00:01:46.690> a<00:01:46.720> high<00:01:51.390> selected

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
this to six and then do a high selected

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.830 
this to six and then do a high selected
and<00:01:52.690> then<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:53.380> hands<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:58.240> make<00:01:58.390> sure<00:01:58.420> I<00:01:58.540> can

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
and then the hands just make sure I can

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.080 
and then the hands just make sure I can
check<00:01:59.050> that<00:01:59.550> hit<00:02:00.550> seven<00:02:02.670> all<00:02:03.670> right<00:02:03.760> so<00:02:03.970> now

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
check that hit seven all right so now

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.250 
check that hit seven all right so now
the<00:02:04.150> monocle<00:02:04.630> is<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.840> only<00:02:04.960> thing<00:02:05.140> that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
the monocle is the only thing that

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.070 
the monocle is the only thing that
doesn't<00:02:05.440> hit<00:02:06.250> unhide<00:02:06.670> all<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:09.750> then<00:02:10.750> the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
doesn't hit unhide all and then the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.440 
doesn't hit unhide all and then the
other<00:02:11.200> thing<00:02:11.260> I'll<00:02:11.530> do<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:15.090> take<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.120> render<00:02:16.420> of

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
other thing I'll do is take a render of

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.990 
other thing I'll do is take a render of
this<00:02:18.720> you'll<00:02:19.720> see<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.200> penguin<00:02:21.000> looks

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
this you'll see that the penguin looks

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.110 
this you'll see that the penguin looks
much<00:02:22.930> different<00:02:22.960> is<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:23.980> he<00:02:24.460> separated<00:02:24.940> by

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
much different is that he separated by

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.570 
much different is that he separated by
smoother<00:02:25.600> group<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:26.020> lights<00:02:26.650> affecting<00:02:27.190> the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
smoother group so lights affecting the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.670 
smoother group so lights affecting the
jacket<00:02:28.000> differently<00:02:28.480> than<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.200> pants<00:02:29.500> and

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
jacket differently than the pants and

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.590 
jacket differently than the pants and
the<00:02:29.740> inside<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.220> jacket<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.730> then<00:02:31.300> we're

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
the inside of the jacket and then we're

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.100 
the inside of the jacket and then we're
the<00:02:32.160> best<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.459> his<00:02:34.060> tie<00:02:34.300> would<00:02:34.360> go<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.959> its

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
the best and his tie would go in its

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.560 
the best and his tie would go in its
face<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.800> then<00:02:36.610> also<00:02:36.790> his<00:02:37.180> hat<00:02:39.240> all<00:02:40.240> right<00:02:40.330> so

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
face and then also his hat all right so

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.120 
face and then also his hat all right so
that's<00:02:40.750> that's<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.350> importance<00:02:41.950> of

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
that's that's the importance of

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.350 
that's that's the importance of
smoothing<00:02:42.700> groups<00:02:42.760> is<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.209> just<00:02:43.570> allows<00:02:44.560> us<00:02:44.590> to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
smoothing groups is it just allows us to

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.340 
smoothing groups is it just allows us to
separate<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.510> different<00:02:46.600> surfaces<00:02:47.170> without

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
separate the different surfaces without

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.199 
separate the different surfaces without
actually<00:02:47.830> applying<00:02:48.130> a<00:02:48.340> physical<00:02:48.730> texture<00:02:49.090> to

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
actually applying a physical texture to

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.510 
actually applying a physical texture to
them<00:02:49.330> but<00:02:49.810> then<00:02:49.930> also<00:02:50.110> when<00:02:50.350> we<00:02:50.470> do<00:02:51.130> apply<00:02:51.459> the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
them but then also when we do apply the

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.880 
them but then also when we do apply the
texture<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.660> there's<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.959> difference

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
texture is that there's a difference

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.330 
texture is that there's a difference
between<00:02:53.950> surfaces<00:02:54.760> oh<00:02:55.410> we<00:02:56.410> can<00:02:56.680> go<00:02:56.860> back<00:02:57.070> later

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
between surfaces oh we can go back later

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.509 
between surfaces oh we can go back later
on<00:02:57.610> in<00:02:57.820> Justin<00:02:58.150> smoother<00:02:58.450> groups<00:02:58.690> also<00:02:59.470> i<00:02:59.950> just

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
on in Justin smoother groups also i just

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.550 
on in Justin smoother groups also i just
i<00:03:00.970> get<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.630> smoother<00:03:01.870> groups<00:03:02.110> down<00:03:02.260> initially

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
i get the smoother groups down initially

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.009 
i get the smoother groups down initially
of<00:03:03.070> what<00:03:03.850> i<00:03:04.030> think<00:03:04.330> is<00:03:04.480> going<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.720> look<00:03:04.840> good

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
of what i think is going to look good

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.040 
of what i think is going to look good
and<00:03:05.340> then<00:03:06.340> if<00:03:06.489> I<00:03:06.640> need<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:06.910> later<00:03:07.480> on<00:03:07.660> I<00:03:07.690> make

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
and then if I need to later on I make

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.830 
and then if I need to later on I make
adjustments<00:03:08.769> so<00:03:09.340> even<00:03:09.880> with<00:03:10.030> things<00:03:10.330> like<00:03:10.450> box

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
adjustments so even with things like box

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.290 
adjustments so even with things like box
that<00:03:11.440> are<00:03:11.560> really<00:03:11.860> boxy<00:03:12.190> like<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.459> hands<00:03:12.850> is

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
that are really boxy like the hands is

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.090 
that are really boxy like the hands is
with<00:03:13.570> smoother<00:03:13.900> groups<00:03:14.140> they<00:03:14.350> look<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.769> lot

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
with smoother groups they look a lot

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.390 
with smoother groups they look a lot
cleaner<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.360> that's<00:03:17.200> again<00:03:17.650> one<00:03:17.830> of<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.010> main

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
cleaner and that's again one of the main

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.160 
cleaner and that's again one of the main
reasons<00:03:18.820> that<00:03:18.880> you<00:03:18.970> need<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.660> use<00:03:19.810> smoother

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
reasons that you need to use smoother

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.630 
reasons that you need to use smoother
groups<00:03:20.410> I<00:03:21.570> most<00:03:22.570> game<00:03:22.780> engines<00:03:23.140> now<00:03:23.620> do<00:03:24.250> handle

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
groups I most game engines now do handle

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.860 
groups I most game engines now do handle
smoother<00:03:24.940> groups<00:03:25.150> it's<00:03:25.360> not<00:03:25.510> like<00:03:25.690> in<00:03:25.840> the

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
smoother groups it's not like in the

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.380 
smoother groups it's not like in the
days<00:03:26.050> of<00:03:26.110> Dreamcast<00:03:26.769> where<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.790> didn't<00:03:28.150> have

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
days of Dreamcast where you didn't have

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.440 
days of Dreamcast where you didn't have
smoother<00:03:28.870> groups<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:30.130> here's<00:03:30.940> our<00:03:31.060> model

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
smoother groups so here's our model

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.009 
smoother groups so here's our model
again<00:03:32.170> we're<00:03:32.680> under<00:03:32.920> 500<00:03:33.519> triangles<00:03:34.360> that<00:03:34.480> was

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
again we're under 500 triangles that was

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.280 
again we're under 500 triangles that was
our<00:03:35.170> goal<00:03:35.410> for<00:03:35.800> this<00:03:36.070> oh<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:37.000> does<00:03:37.239> look<00:03:38.110> like

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
our goal for this oh it does look like

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.990 
our goal for this oh it does look like
the<00:03:38.440> penguin<00:03:38.620> I<00:03:38.980> mean<00:03:39.190> yeah<00:03:39.400> we<00:03:39.610> don't<00:03:39.790> have

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
the penguin I mean yeah we don't have

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.680 
the penguin I mean yeah we don't have
some<00:03:40.840> of<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.019> features<00:03:41.850> but<00:03:42.850> we<00:03:43.180> have<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.450> work

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
some of the features but we have to work

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.050 
some of the features but we have to work
within<00:03:43.959> our<00:03:44.170> limitations<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.070> that's<00:03:45.609> really

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
within our limitations and that's really

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.699 
within our limitations and that's really
the<00:03:46.180> objective<00:03:46.750> here<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:46.959> working<00:03:47.410> within<00:03:47.560> our

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
the objective here is working within our

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.759 
the objective here is working within our
limitations<00:03:48.519> so<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:49.209> we<00:03:49.329> can<00:03:49.590> texture<00:03:50.590> this

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
limitations so that we can texture this

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:51.180 
limitations so that we can texture this
and<00:03:50.950> make

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
and make

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.330 
and make
look<00:03:51.580> that<00:03:52.000> much<00:03:52.240> better<00:03:52.650> so<00:03:53.650> let's<00:03:53.830> save<00:03:54.130> this

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
look that much better so let's save this

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.750 
look that much better so let's save this
file<00:03:54.610> and<00:03:54.910> will<00:03:55.690> continue<00:03:56.140> with<00:03:56.760> unwrapping

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
file and will continue with unwrapping

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.580 
file and will continue with unwrapping
all<00:04:03.570> right<00:04:04.570> so<00:04:04.750> we're<00:04:04.840> going<00:04:05.020> to<00:04:05.080> actually<00:04:05.320> get

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
all right so we're going to actually get

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.460 
all right so we're going to actually get
ready<00:04:05.770> to<00:04:05.980> unwrap<00:04:06.490> the<00:04:06.910> character<00:04:07.750> of<00:04:07.930> the

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
ready to unwrap the character of the

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.050 
ready to unwrap the character of the
penguin<00:04:08.800> here<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:09.130> before<00:04:09.700> I<00:04:09.880> get<00:04:10.030> started

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
penguin here and before I get started

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.460 
penguin here and before I get started
there's<00:04:10.510> just<00:04:10.780> something<00:04:11.050> that<00:04:11.170> I<00:04:11.230> want<00:04:11.410> to

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
there's just something that I want to

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.790 
there's just something that I want to
fix<00:04:11.650> on<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:11.950> face<00:04:13.230> we<00:04:14.230> can<00:04:14.380> see<00:04:14.500> that<00:04:14.650> there's

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
fix on the face we can see that there's

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.320 
fix on the face we can see that there's
these<00:04:14.980> black<00:04:15.250> lines<00:04:15.520> here<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:15.880> this<00:04:16.269> is

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
these black lines here and this is

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:22.080 
these black lines here and this is
caused<00:04:17.170> because<00:04:17.530> of<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:21.160> triangle<00:04:21.700> isn't

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
caused because of the the triangle isn't

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.610 
caused because of the the triangle isn't
turned<00:04:22.420> the<00:04:22.510> right<00:04:22.630> way<00:04:22.690> so<00:04:23.290> I'm<00:04:23.350> going<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.530> go

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
turned the right way so I'm going to go

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.680 
turned the right way so I'm going to go
to<00:04:23.680> my<00:04:23.980> polygon<00:04:24.550> sub-object<00:04:24.730> mode<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.450> click

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
to my polygon sub-object mode and click

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.930 
to my polygon sub-object mode and click
on<00:04:25.930> turn<00:04:26.200> then<00:04:26.770> I<00:04:26.860> can<00:04:27.010> see<00:04:27.130> my<00:04:27.310> little

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
on turn then I can see my little

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.830 
on turn then I can see my little
triangles<00:04:28.690> here<00:04:28.810> i'll<00:04:29.230> just<00:04:29.470> change<00:04:29.650> that<00:04:29.770> and

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
triangles here i'll just change that and

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:40.860 
triangles here i'll just change that and
change<00:04:31.840> that<00:04:33.510> that<00:04:34.590> that<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:40.000> i'm<00:04:40.480> just<00:04:40.660> doing

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
change that that that and i'm just doing

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.310 
change that that that and i'm just doing
some<00:04:41.020> simple<00:04:41.170> turning<00:04:41.800> here<00:04:42.220> of<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:43.540> edges<00:04:43.870> so

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
some simple turning here of the edges so

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.460 
some simple turning here of the edges so
that<00:04:44.380> i<00:04:44.530> give<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.980> face<00:04:45.880> some<00:04:46.120> more

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
that i give the face some more

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.790 
that i give the face some more
definition<00:04:47.470> we<00:04:48.130> don't<00:04:48.280> run<00:04:48.460> into<00:04:48.490> that<00:04:48.820> issue

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
definition we don't run into that issue

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.980 
definition we don't run into that issue
where<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:52.230> the<00:04:53.230> face<00:04:53.440> looks<00:04:53.710> a<00:04:53.830> little<00:04:54.010> weird

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
where the the face looks a little weird

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.620 
where the the face looks a little weird
so<00:04:55.990> that<00:04:56.140> looks<00:04:56.290> better<00:04:56.620> I<00:04:57.240> can<00:04:58.240> try<00:04:58.360> to<00:04:58.390> turn

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
so that looks better I can try to turn

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:08.090 
so that looks better I can try to turn
other<00:04:58.870> right<00:04:59.050> edges<00:04:59.560> also<00:05:02.700> that<00:05:03.700> looks<00:05:03.910> better

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.730 

we<00:05:09.100> can<00:05:09.220> spend<00:05:09.460> a<00:05:09.760> lot<00:05:10.720> of<00:05:10.750> time<00:05:10.900> turning<00:05:11.350> edges

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
we can spend a lot of time turning edges

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.100 
we can spend a lot of time turning edges
but<00:05:11.950> I'm<00:05:12.220> just<00:05:12.760> turning<00:05:12.880> a<00:05:13.090> couple<00:05:15.210> to<00:05:16.210> just

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
but I'm just turning a couple to just

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.420 
but I'm just turning a couple to just
make<00:05:17.530> sure<00:05:17.710> I<00:05:17.740> get<00:05:17.919> the<00:05:19.530> the<00:05:20.530> shape<00:05:20.800> that<00:05:21.070> I

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
make sure I get the the shape that I

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.780 
make sure I get the the shape that I
want<00:05:22.230> all<00:05:23.230> right<00:05:23.320> so<00:05:23.500> that<00:05:23.680> should<00:05:24.190> be<00:05:24.310> it<00:05:24.490> for

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
want all right so that should be it for

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.770 
want all right so that should be it for
turning<00:05:25.510> so<00:05:25.660> I<00:05:25.690> can<00:05:25.840> turn<00:05:25.960> that<00:05:26.110> off<00:05:26.320> and<00:05:27.780> what

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
turning so I can turn that off and what

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.680 
turning so I can turn that off and what
I<00:05:28.810> want<00:05:28.990> to<00:05:29.080> do<00:05:29.230> here<00:05:29.590> is<00:05:29.650> I'm<00:05:30.610> gonna<00:05:30.820> go<00:05:31.419> and

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
I want to do here is I'm gonna go and

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.540 
I want to do here is I'm gonna go and
select<00:05:32.169> my<00:05:32.350> reference<00:05:32.710> art<00:05:32.890> so<00:05:33.190> in<00:05:33.400> my

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
select my reference art so in my

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.070 
select my reference art so in my
schematic<00:05:34.030> view<00:05:34.150> here<00:05:34.390> I'll<00:05:34.540> have<00:05:34.720> those<00:05:34.870> two

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
schematic view here I'll have those two

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.180 
schematic view here I'll have those two
selected<00:05:35.500> then<00:05:35.950> right<00:05:36.130> click<00:05:36.370> and<00:05:37.950> I<00:05:38.950> want<00:05:39.130> to

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
selected then right click and I want to

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.860 
selected then right click and I want to
do<00:05:39.340> a<00:05:39.660> high<00:05:40.660> selection<00:05:41.520> so<00:05:42.520> that<00:05:42.669> I<00:05:42.700> hide<00:05:43.090> those

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
do a high selection so that I hide those

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.270 
do a high selection so that I hide those
two<00:05:44.080> planes<00:05:44.320> so<00:05:44.470> that<00:05:44.590> I<00:05:44.620> can't<00:05:44.830> see<00:05:44.950> them<00:05:45.100> and

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
two planes so that I can't see them and

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.070 
two planes so that I can't see them and
I'm<00:05:45.370> just<00:05:45.580> seeing<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.510> the<00:05:46.750> penguin

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
I'm just seeing the the penguin

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.470 
I'm just seeing the the penguin
character
