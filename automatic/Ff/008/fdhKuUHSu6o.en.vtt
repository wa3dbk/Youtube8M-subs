00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.090
 hello in this tutorial let's see how 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.680
 make a decorative origami box 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.980
 to do it we are going to need 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.640
 three sheets of square paper you can use 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.600
 smooth or patterned sheets and a 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.600
 little bit of glue in bar 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.150
 let's take one of the leaves 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.039
 and we're going to double it in the form of 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.060
 triangle the procedure is the same 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:36.980
 for the three leaves 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.980
 first we folded into a triangle shape 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.199
 and now we're going to fold the two sides 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.060
 from the leaf up towards the tip 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:49.730
 of the triangle first from one side 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.960
 we mark all the folds 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.960
 after the other side 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.970
 we mark well 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.780
 and now let's take the tip of the 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.780
 triangle down and we fold 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.770
 we press well we dial 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.280
 and we reserve we will repeat the same 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.280
 with the other two sheets 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.140
 we finished with this one 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:44.580
 once we have the three folded sheets 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.580
 we will insert into each other 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.990
 note that on the sides 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.420
 on the web that quotes where we're going to 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.420
 place each of the leaves 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.710
 we match well 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.420
 until the force is a little 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.610
 and carefully insert it 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.010
 we already have the little box just miss 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.280
 and finish the bottom part so that it does not 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.100
 I leave you loose 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.520
 it is best to put some glue and 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.520
 paste it 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.350
 so what I 'm going to do is the sheet 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.060
 I will leave it with flowers 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.240
 in the top part and in the part of 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.240
 down 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.270
 and I'm going to put glue to go 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.930
 holding the flaps with care for 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.930
 that is not open to you 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.830
 with the glue and you are hitting each one 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.830
 of the leaves 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.270
 you are matching and sticking slowly 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.379
 and we have our little box 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.379
 ready 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.490
 see you in the next video bye bye
