 my diver because we will too 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.559
 drop down on bloc filled 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.929
 crustaceans of all kinds 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.339
 also shkolotoy full of wild 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:59.100
 the desire to write guides 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.100
 welcome to dota gentlemen drove 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.070
 remember the movie interstellar of course 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:14.500
 remember so here there are scientists even in black 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.440
 hole could find at least something that 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.720
 can not be said about his inventory even a pair 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.090
 Tungus there is nothing to talk about the very 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:28.030
 boots become the standard starting 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.950
 purchasing from schoolchildren apparently he did not 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.229
 go to the line for the first time without starting 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:45.580
 procurement good even thought better of it and decided 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:47.440
 buy as if he could buy 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.509
 something else but what really 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.830
 strange is what he says about 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.830
 rikimaru as a woman 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.359
 I honestly tried to see in this blue 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:06.789
 a pretty beardy face 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:09.310
 something feminine but all in vain you could 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.440
 at least to beat him from the back then 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.330
 to mention that you even 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.090
 passivka not pumped which gives 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.790
 increased damage from the back what is it 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.830
 triple skerry and although from under this 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.989
 you are so designed normal triple and not 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.150
 can be formed in principle by the way 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.819
 say that his enemies are fantastic 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.209
 donna means say nothing see 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.209
 yourself 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.720
 eye trains it is logical to assume that 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.730
 at least ursa has a feeling 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.100
 self-preservation but all he has 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.140
 these are two huge claws which 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.600
 makes him stand still and beat 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.760
 the one who is closer by itself in 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.140
 in the end he saw but about them 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.140
 deserves a separate video 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:14.920
 It is also worth noting their exceptional 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:17.560
 the reaction was necessary only for some reason I 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.660
 sure what you would have looked after seconds 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.080
 ten after Haza yuzat 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.080
 inviz 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.880
 moment of truth friends three charges on 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.310
 jump backwards 2 seconds to the point 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.050
 Lycanthrope Hepe words are put on the line 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.050
 so what will the rivers do 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.430
 What 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.800
 to the fact that enemies can be wards or 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.260
 for example, where u his life is clearly not 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.450
 cooked d and with what ult would do 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.670
 home is hardly familiar in such data 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.640
 public wards this phenomenon is extremely rare 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.799
 but extremely effective especially against 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.420
 such fools naively believing that 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.420
 inviz is imba and does not contort 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.210
 I think you understand that they have merged this 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.670
 skating rink wards of course also to blame and who 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.530
 yet so I will show you immediately 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.530
 why did my hair stand on end 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:52.170
 just to gentlemen this is our crypstat 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.360
 scale of the 7 creeps for 27 minutes 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.150
 farm speed equals one creeps 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.400
 almost four minutes say it 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.010
 the absolute edge of autism means not 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.500
 say nothing and of course i would 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.900
 I wanted to mention these two guys by 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.510
 appear to have decided that 1 aura 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:23.430
 vampirism find my will be little oh yes and 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:25.590
 another thing that he examined he did not 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.660
 crazy easy mental retardation 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.160
 total lack of imagination to speak 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.070
 from recent well 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.500
 saying forgiven idiot put like buddy
