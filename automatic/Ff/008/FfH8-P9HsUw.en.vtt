00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 let's see if they can be guess 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.649
 slightly bitter sweets flavored with 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.840
 lemon or hazelnut la 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.540
 consistency can be very soft or 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.389
 extremely crunchy they are great from 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.580
 pair with a good tea lend themselves 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.369
 also to the realization of more court or 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.920
 less elaborate they are prepared only with 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.810
 almond and sugar album 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.570
 then you guessed what I am 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.090
 speaking, yes, it is the macaroons that 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.009
 today we will prepare a soft variant 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.270
 not the crunchy one let's see how it is 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:40.350
 prepare to prepare about 35 40 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.780
 soft macaroons only needed 145 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.800
 grams of almonds or new where 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.739
 we will only use the album and then 135 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.590
 grams of granulated sugar and an aroma 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.170
 almond then to pulverize 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.469
 we have about 30 grams of sugar a 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.199
 veil 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.260
 in this recipe or deliberately omitted 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.149
 the use of bitter almonds because 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.850
 the latter contain a substance 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.840
 at half that when taken in 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.970
 excessive doses 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.310
 the potentially toxic junta therefore 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.850
 we avoid and use almonds 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.890
 we have finely ground lemons 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.470
 almonds together with granulated sugar 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.979
 and we poured it all into one 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.979
 bowl 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.960
 now we have also slipped away 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.689
 split the tuolo from the album and there 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.020
 it only affects the albumen and we go to 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:35.790
 pour it here without mount snow 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:41.150
 we mix a little and then we pour 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.150
 also the vial of almond aroma 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.820
 also goal is sufficient for this dose 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.610
 and mix until you get a nice one 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.980
 compact bollard 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.090
 we worked the mixture with the 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.360
 wooden spoon 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.080
 and now our amaretto cake 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:05.070
 has reached a good consistency 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:09.890
 we can now carry this pour 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:13.940
 a little icing sugar on tears like that 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.040
 and then we also think about our own 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.260
 compound we quickly roll the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.690
 stick so that it does not stick and 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:27.950
 to the hands so then we begin to 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.120
 pinch the roll obtained 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.840
 thus making balls 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.050
 here they are and these will be ours 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.290
 macaroons and now we'll also roll 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.250
 in icing sugar 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.170
 this result 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.010
 we proceed in this way up to 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.790
 run out of all the dough we have 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.980
 got about 45 small macaroons 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.420
 clearly if you want you can also do it 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.220
 a little bigger 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.920
 now we have to let them rest 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.600
 on the plate lined with paper from 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.360
 oven clearly for about 12 15 hours 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.940
 finally after 12 hours our macaroons 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.250
 they are ready to be cooked because 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.350
 the 12 hours of rest because in this 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.230
 so the ingredients are consolidated 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.310
 good and the macaroons dry up in 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.340
 surface 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.610
 so now we can bake at 170 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.040
 degrees for about 10 maximum 12 minutes 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.220
 clearly if you want to make macaroons 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.850
 Larger soft you will have to increase i 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.850
 cooking times 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.709
 and these are the soft macaroons 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.510
 proposed by ever just 3 nothing is there 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.550
 nice to feel a little messy 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.560
 rediscover you all will remain a 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.040
 open mouth tasting one of these 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.040
 pralines
