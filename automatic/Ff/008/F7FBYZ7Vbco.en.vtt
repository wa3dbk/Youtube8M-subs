00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.180
 newton and we're going back now 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.939
 finally with the video series 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:10.060
 tutorials on the s directly to the 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.770
 channel itaipu br is back today doing me 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.860
 I'm going to make the video for number 34 now. 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.960
 to continue the series as it has a lot 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.430
 time I do not do videos to the west 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.130
 in a long time - I think I've already lost 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.980
 how many have a good five months 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.410
 That way, it 's like you have so much time. 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.380
 so we will use the newest one now 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.060
 that hides that I chose it 4.5 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.879
 We'll use it, too. 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.409
 application for s6 that was released 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.870
 also has a few weeks 

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:39.909
 We'll start to see, too, and I'll go. 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.010
 tell you the news of the 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:44.289
 new new 4 inch iphone screen 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.850
 and what it entails at the time you 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.649
 will develop the application 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.839
 a lot will be much easier with 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.850
 the new fit they added that 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.190
 makes it easy to do the layout of the 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.440
 screen but to celebrate 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.379
 To go back this series, we'll go. 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.479
 start doing is the next do not know 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.899
 how many stable videos 45 even 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.850
 videos an app from start to finish 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.219
 right an application that will be more or 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.610
 less a game but it is not quite a game 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:15.130
 type because you'll see the truth 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.710
 let me show you here I have 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.090
 he ready then I'll show you 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.259
 as it was and then you have to 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.630
 A better notion of what we're going to 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:30.850
 develop open here with a simulator 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:34.570
 of the 6 is right here O is running the 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.250
 version 6.0 you see here until the ps book one 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.600
 new map and such 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.619
 and here is the back app and 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.090
 it rotates horizontally certain landscape 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.070
 application works the following has a 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.570
 slider here and up here saying which 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.119
 It's the number we 're going to have to 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.069
 hit that slider that depends on the 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.560
 people where we put people go 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.479
 earning points and will phase passing 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.310
 then luckily it gave the 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.179
 chance in the event of luck he asked to 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.280
 put a sim 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.610
 So I'll play here without bothering 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.100
 pet it will put the score and it will 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.890
 show the cni the score will skip phase 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.640
 now he has moved on to the next level 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.040
 now he has 99 good it's very easy this 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.810
 game but let's test more there now not 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.830
 I did, I did a little less then the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.940
 score 149 12 now it only gets a little bit 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.100
 more difficult 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.690
 149 points also means that I did 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:37.140
 well near almost 97 97 points it goes 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.420
 adding points here shows phase and if the 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.520
 people want to start it will come back to 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.920
 make 10 the score 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.110
 this focus button is a button that goes 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.180
 show more information on how to 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.130
 example show the game then by the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.180
 At first I was a bit lazy 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.769
 enter 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.019
 I put your left a standard text 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.630
 even when you put a test bill 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.700
 I have already seen a standard text in Latin so I 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.890
 I left it myself and if you want to go back, you 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.980
 close tight we will learn 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.900
 to use the slide night has answered but the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.420
 We will integrate the slider now 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.310
 random function generator control 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.209
 stage scoring 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.530
 here we will see some things one 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.769
 important thing of the alert that is the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.470
 following is notice that the random button 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.140
 in the case the opposition tries to hit it only 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.720
 changes after the squeeze ok we'll go 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.150
 learn to also deal with events that 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.950
 will happen after some alerts 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.959
 or things happened 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.060
 another thing that will also learn that 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.890
 it is very simple who is simpler 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.570
 even now with the new s60 iscold is 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.190
 screen transition and 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.019
 more than one screen until then we already 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.640
 had made an application with a screen 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.920
 We're going to put in a second that only 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.480
 to imitate a little more 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.000
 and another thing I think almost 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.130
 Nobody noticed that you let the 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.400
 scores here your restarting the game 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.010
 for example it is stop playing the slider 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.660
 notice the phase score slide 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.070
 they will change 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.980
 in the initial only they will change with 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.350
 effect of an effect that will be even 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.150
 with a gradient of what was before to 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.160
 score 9 to do new show 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.200
 put it back here for you to see 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.630
 so we will learn also had 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.390
 learn to make that effect also good 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.460
 is this video was a video piece 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.370
 right introductory is not for the first time 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.699
 work and world full of files 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.010
 you have to clean and then there and then 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.889
 is next video we will start 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.510
 make the right application and from there 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.280
 people going to do it will do 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.199
 application to the end and then in the 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.610
 days do not know lets get closer than 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.389
 I'll know exactly what we 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.130
 will do 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.530
 Thank you guys, thank you for watching. 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.690
 Our video now we will come back from 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.280
 once and for all with the series of s 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.840
 felipe will also come back with a series 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.060
 new and I do not know what it is or if it goes 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.919
 continue something he did not 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.790
 forget to write our next channel 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.080
 on twitter 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.080
 and thanks until the next
