00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.410
 have you been strong right now because 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.210
 it's true content on the back of 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.290
 mavs have marked the video sessions and we 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.450
 saw that especially the five in front 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.789
 was was pretty strong was really 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.650
 strong in conquest in touch balloons 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.080
 worn so here it was needed 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.779
 I think that if we were doing a 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.880
 big match as much but who can well 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.650
 started the team that is that the 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.350
 substitutes it's someone he 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.060
 had to make a big match that's true 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.060
 to be present at this compact city 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:40.280
 pink to watch we look at it but after 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.340
 as I told you earlier 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.130
 look look i take every game 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.829
 a parent is giving the sea copy 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.140
 after that it's true that this year we have 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.730
 much more the little 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.290
 do not try to ensure matches at the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.380
 house and do what we want to 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.700
 outside we really try to 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:07.920
 win outside for matches 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:11.030
 one by one starting today from 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.030
 lessons change tour 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.260
 quite yeah that's right it's great 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.390
 and that's what worries us 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.290
 also which allowed us to win 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.580
 also appear images com - as agent 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.400
 at home knowing that it's a strength 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.540
 a beautiful depth of soul 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.370
 this is it is rather positive for 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.010
 him they use it at my school 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.010
 sense seems pretty much take his 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.610
 work today 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.290
 which gives the tempo in these cases there I 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.660
 think it's a job be there there 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:56.120
 engages in lies not in mastering 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.090
 the experience that is that is strong with 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.280
 passed to masters 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.180
 his international experience but I 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.110
 especially think it's a job 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.790
 collective at work us open at 100% the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.570
 week we work a lot of serious 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:19.430
 and a disappointment 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:22.510
 beyond the score the way also the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.510
 carouges against a big score 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.950
 all the quality of the vocalcom team 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.040
 it's not things that obviously have 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.939
 and as he deserved also sanctioned 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:40.260
 I see how it works 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:47.709
 dear the plane is never very nice 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:53.130
 exactly how you talked it 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.410
 played every game as it comes 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.630
 but 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.370
 it is necessary to react it is looked towards 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.040
 learning better pro d2 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.720
 pro team d2 at fine beat the water 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.750
 today even though I think the 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.060
 score in the end it's a malice and we 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.210
 give up 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:18.050
 that's more you accept with his beard and 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.980
 back the hockey domination fault in 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.980
 first tonight is the state of mind 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.010
 I think we need to put the 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.410
 things there are things that one does not 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.640
 not master and first after we will be 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:37.790
 things said if ever there are any choices 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:40.430
 who was sending the yellow jersey express 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.370
 your mind is correct but it is 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.870
 important to react and especially better 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.870
 better understand matches 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.960
 you're worried all said it's 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.790
 learning us 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.810
 we are worried tonight because I am disappointed 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.510
 because there is a lot of time there 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.280
 will remain a potential player we have 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.750
 players who have potential 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.910
 we just have to get caught 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.800
 the mayonnaise we attack from the team 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.470
 politics it was 4 1 that is at the top 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.630
 of the Board 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.760
 of the pro d2 which has precisely a 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.270
 collective well in place the good benchmarks 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.830
 collective 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.890
 that's what's missing right now 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.380
 it's going to be very expensive in the future 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.970
 better understand margins 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.970
 and in what sense
