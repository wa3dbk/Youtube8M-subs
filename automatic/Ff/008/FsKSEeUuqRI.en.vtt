00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:11.640
 hello thank you for being in a new video 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.309
 of this channel we have an ombu singh of 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.070
 a cell phone that comes again from china 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.070
 and this time I bought it in ever beijing 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.419
 dot net or dotcom 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.319
 in the video of putting well the 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:28.079
 description and it is a record with 1 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:32.220
 gb of ram 8 gb of internal storage 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:35.489
 4.5 inch screen buy another 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.620
 thing also this is extra and good looks 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.480
 quite interesting is compact is 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.109
 as for people who do not like 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.629
 the cell phones so big and has good 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:49.230
 characteristics so let's uncover 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.199
 what the brand is the background here are you 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.660
 seeing I think there is a live on very well 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.660
 let's put it here here we have the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.930
 mobile 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.420
 the price is 89 dollars so 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.780
 It is also quite economical and how 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.660
 you see compact is not so big the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.970
 design is in plastic the camera is 5 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.369
 megapixels it seems to me right now we're going to 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.110
 see a little bit later we're going to 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.720
 take out the battery because it does not bring it 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.720
 put so we need to discover what 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.890
 more brings the box here brings inside 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.390
 small boxes 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.040
 for example here we have your usb cable and 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.190
 here is your battery we are going to put the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.290
 cable here we get your battery in this 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:40.170
 Occasion I bought it for free shipping 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:42.150
 and I took 34 business days to arrive well 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.160
 that you will imagine how desperate 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.750
 I was there so the cell phone will arrive 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.890
 but I have always said that the shipment 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.220
 free takes more than a month and a half 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.320
 almost so here we already have it what 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.630
 we connect you connect the battery is 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.280
 this curious this part I do not know if it 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:05.300
 get to see there is how you see has a 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.030
 Very strange texture not know what you need 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.739
 but well we have here the 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.390
 device 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.480
 now let's turn it on so that 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.319
 we can see and while it's going on we're going 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.879
 to see what else it brings 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.180
 here we put it in what is going on 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.880
 and let's see who in the other box 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.100
 comes 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.710
 that comes here is the adapter 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.110
 current unfortunately in this store 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.970
 they did not send us an adapter of this 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.060
 for our region there are other stores 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.500
 that if they send it this time, it's not like that 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.440
 that we will have to look for an adapter 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.940
 how much do we have the user manual and 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.240
 an additional mica 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.270
 that's why it's very tight and here 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.970
 is the additional mica to be able 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.370
 put on the cell phone so let's save 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.110
 all this again and lit the 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.000
 mobile 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.760
 and we will have to remove this mica 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.710
 because it has the brand here and it's not going to 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.010
 let's see so let's remove this 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.010
 mica 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.280
 but fortunately this was a mica 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:16.110
 over it still has another stuck 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.110
 so here we have the cell 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.300
 android 4.4 kitkat maybe a little bit the 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.030
 appearance changed it a little bit 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.850
 only but as you see here is 4.4 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.100
 points 2 kitkat and let's try it 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.780
 completely already in the review so it 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.020
 see very interesting the screen looks 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.000
 well it looks good quality and good this 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.670
 it's all for the moment wait for 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.320
