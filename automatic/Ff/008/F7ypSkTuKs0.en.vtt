got your power button that is also on
the<00:01:41.579> front<00:01:41.729> side<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.360> then<00:01:42.869> you've<00:01:43.290> got<00:01:43.409> your

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
the front side and then you've got your

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.929 
the front side and then you've got your
cameras<00:01:43.920> here<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> bit<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.850> a

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
cameras here this is a bit of a

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:45.920 
cameras here this is a bit of a
fingerprint<00:01:45.479> magnet

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
fingerprint magnet

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.380 
fingerprint magnet
you've<00:01:46.439> got<00:01:46.740> your<00:01:47.220> shoulder<00:01:47.939> buttons<00:01:48.210> up<00:01:48.360> here

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
on the inside not glossy so that

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.210 
on the inside not glossy so that
