00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
little cub washers as you can see you've

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.160 
little cub washers as you can see you've
got<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.120> little<00:02:58.300> spring<00:02:58.480> or<00:02:58.720> shoe<00:02:58.870> in<00:02:58.989> there

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
got a little spring or shoe in there

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.660 
got a little spring or shoe in there
which<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.590> but<00:02:59.769> probably<00:03:00.070> not<00:03:00.220> some<00:03:00.459> whose

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
which is but probably not some whose

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.509 
which is but probably not some whose
springiness<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:02.320> you<00:03:03.010> know<00:03:03.100> they<00:03:03.250> just<00:03:03.280> come

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
springiness and you know they just come

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.640 
springiness and you know they just come
loose<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.000> then<00:03:04.330> you<00:03:04.989> know<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.500> develop

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
loose and then you know you develop

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.720 
loose and then you know you develop
extra<00:03:06.430> raffles<00:03:06.850> so<00:03:07.920> today<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:09.190> thought<00:03:09.280> I'm<00:03:09.700> a

extra raffles so today I thought I'm a

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.550 
extra raffles so today I thought I'm a
stripper<00:03:10.030> snare<00:03:10.330> down<00:03:10.480> well<00:03:11.170> I'm<00:03:11.290> not<00:03:11.440> gonna

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
serviceable

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.400 
serviceable
so<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.340> non-permanent<00:03:19.030> thread<00:03:19.570> knock<00:03:19.780> so<00:03:20.260> it's

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
so a non-permanent thread knock so it's

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.600 
so a non-permanent thread knock so it's
kind<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.680> drama<00:03:20.860> thread<00:03:21.160> lock<00:03:21.340> on<00:03:21.519> each

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
kind of a drama thread lock on each

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.930 
kind of a drama thread lock on each
screw<00:03:21.940> screw<00:03:22.570> it<00:03:22.630> back<00:03:22.720> in<00:03:22.860> then<00:03:23.940> everything

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
screw screw it back in then everything

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.830 
screw screw it back in then everything
should<00:03:24.970> stay<00:03:25.300> tight

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
should stay tight

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.210 
should stay tight
second<00:03:26.350> thing<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.590> think<00:03:26.620> on<00:03:26.860> this<00:03:26.980> snare

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
second thing I think on this snare

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.949 
second thing I think on this snare
because<00:03:27.519> it<00:03:27.640> is<00:03:27.730> an<00:03:27.850> old<00:03:28.000> one<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.750> comes

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
because it is an old one and it comes

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.340 
because it is an old one and it comes
with<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.290> vintage<00:03:29.680> style<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:30.489> dampener

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
with the vintage style and dampener

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.780 
with the vintage style and dampener

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
great again but again as had this use is

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.730 
great again but again as had this use is

I do not rig shots and that's probably

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.140 
I do not rig shots and that's probably
what<00:03:51.780> causes<00:03:51.960> it

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
what causes it
