00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.970
 and this I am going to tell you is very 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.250
 unpleasant happened to me three days ago 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.930
 I was playing the handle without creeds that more 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.180
 late after revealing all the 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.739
 mysteries of the asÃ­n credos the video of 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.230
 the truth appeared a file called 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.269
 test subjects that shows a group 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.400
 of people who were subjected to 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.800
 the projects of abstergo among them 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.140
 desmond and another called subject 18 to 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.930
 Unlike others, subject 18 does not 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.120
 I had a picture there was nothing just a stain 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.699
 of blood and I assumed that it would surely be 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.309
 one habitable was definitely not a 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.799
 character who did not have a defined skin 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.559
 he owned textures he only had one venera 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.659
 pants and sneakers but I did not have 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.210
 face I said to myself I'm going to try it 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.310
 sure is good suddenly when 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.350
 pressed the x button in my story the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.990
 screen turns black and the face appears 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.820
 of the subject 18 or rather his head 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.799
 faceless suddenly the camera 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.710
 Very active playstation alone and take me out 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.020
 a photo I say yes and suddenly the subject 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.740
 18 had my face I did not care 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.479
 I moved 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.700
 I thought that game was more than 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.830
 I thought at last I could play like me 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.770
 same and I thought that you can almost 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.710
 all over the world other times the 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.600
 suddenly there were unlimited possibilities 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.940
 a sign appears on the screen that 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.220
 Harland said I grab the microphone and 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.650
 I speak suddenly and says processing voice 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.440
 then it says enter your name I put for 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.300
 the crater alone suddenly the subject 18 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.730
 he said in a serious voice I'm serious 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.070
 with a deep voice and he stared at me 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.610
 I was stunned, very stupid, I said my name 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.800
 true after 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.440
 at that moment a part appears that 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.960
 you say you're sure you want to play him 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.460
 I give if at that moment you see 18 in a 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.980
 room like that of desmond al 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.690
 principle in that does not appear desmond but 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.730
 I lived that bad and said my name and 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.340
 then a pause to take air scream 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.350
 we should get out of here and I followed it made me 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.060
 get into the animus where he took me to 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.190
 see a scene from the second war 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.320
 world of a man being dissected 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.330
 by some Nazi scientists I got excited 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.459
 see when seeing the other organs me 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.890
 they looked and said strange things in German 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.959
 one of them pulls out a knife and attacks me 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.030
 and the character dodges it by putting the 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.950
 hand in which the knife is stuck in 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.900
 that moment I felt a very strong pain 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.020
 in the right hand but I kept playing 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.420
 quiet after itil wakes me up and 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.459
 Desmond appears and kills him in a way 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.320
 very poor for assassin's believes he takes it out 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.360
 the inner jaw and he shoots it 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.760
 against the skull then he looks at me and gives me 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.430
 a blow and with this is world 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.769
 5 tomorrow I'm not feeling like I want 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.780
 find this this is what happened to me 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.780
