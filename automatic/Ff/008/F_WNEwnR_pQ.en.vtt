the<00:02:49.019> effect<00:02:59.329> alright<00:03:00.329> so<00:03:00.450> let's<00:03:00.600> take<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.780> look

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
the effect alright so let's take a look

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.130 
the effect alright so let's take a look
at<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.170> flanger<00:03:01.620> effect<00:03:01.910> let's<00:03:02.910> do<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> do<00:03:04.019> an

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
at a flanger effect let's do a do an

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:12.100 
at a flanger effect let's do a do an
eight<00:03:04.350> beat<00:03:04.560> one

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:27.170 

you<00:03:13.110> can<00:03:13.260> change<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.770> b-daman<00:03:14.190> again<00:03:26.180> that's

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
you can change the b-daman again that's

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.730 
you can change the b-daman again that's
the<00:03:27.390> filter<00:03:27.630> effect<00:03:27.840> let's<00:03:28.200> take<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.380> look<00:03:28.590> at<00:03:28.710> a

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
the filter effect let's take a look at a

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:42.320 
the filter effect let's take a look at a
phaser<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:39.180> phaser<00:03:39.920> it's<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.040> echo<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.640> echo

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
phaser the phaser it's the echo the echo

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.630 
phaser the phaser it's the echo the echo
is<00:03:42.810> post-fader<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:44.250> when<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:44.460> gauge<00:03:44.610> the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
is post-fader so when you gauge the

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.760 
is post-fader so when you gauge the
effect<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.270> drop<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.810> fader<00:03:45.960> the<00:03:46.200> tail<00:03:46.590> of

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
effect and drop the fader the tail of

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:59.660 
effect and drop the fader the tail of
the<00:03:46.890> echo<00:03:47.220> will<00:03:47.430> still<00:03:47.640> play<00:03:47.760> out<00:03:47.970> like<00:03:51.470> so<00:03:58.670> so

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
the echo will still play out like so so

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.280 
the echo will still play out like so so
that<00:03:59.730> is<00:03:59.850> the<00:04:00.240> echo<00:04:00.630> effect<00:04:00.660> let's<00:04:01.110> take<00:04:01.260> a

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
that is the echo effect let's take a

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.050 
that is the echo effect let's take a
look<00:04:01.470> at<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.710> robot<00:04:02.100> which<00:04:02.370> is<00:04:02.490> basically<00:04:02.940> a

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
look at the robot which is basically a

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.360 
look at the robot which is basically a
pitch<00:04:03.300> shift<00:04:03.570> effect<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.980> not<00:04:05.040> one<00:04:05.220> of<00:04:05.250> my

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
pitch shift effect and not one of my

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.330 
pitch shift effect and not one of my
favorite<00:04:05.700> lines<00:04:05.820> but<00:04:06.120> it's<00:04:06.270> still<00:04:06.450> there<00:04:07.340> so

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
favorite lines but it's still there so

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.490 
favorite lines but it's still there so
that<00:04:08.490> will<00:04:08.640> laugh<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:09.810> can<00:04:09.960> adjust<00:04:10.350> the

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
that will laugh and you can adjust the

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.730 
that will laugh and you can adjust the
amount<00:04:10.920> of<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.760> pitch<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:13.050> beat<00:04:13.350> lines<00:04:13.560> will

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
amount of the pitch the beat lines will

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:20.840 
amount of the pitch the beat lines will
jump<00:04:13.950> by<00:04:14.070> 20<00:04:14.400> percent<00:04:14.520> increments<00:04:19.549> and<00:04:20.549> one<00:04:20.760> of

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
jump by 20 percent increments and one of

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.909 
jump by 20 percent increments and one of
my<00:04:20.910> personal<00:04:21.090> favorites<00:04:21.600> is<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.959> reverb<00:04:22.380> let

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
my personal favorites is the reverb let

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:29.300 
my personal favorites is the reverb let
me<00:04:23.010> jump<00:04:23.220> back<00:04:23.430> in<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.640> track<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:23.940> little<00:04:24.060> bit

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.480 

Reverb<00:04:30.120> is<00:04:30.300> also<00:04:30.630> post-fader<00:04:31.170> so<00:04:31.500> if<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:31.710> got

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
Reverb is also post-fader so if you got

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.640 
Reverb is also post-fader so if you got
the<00:04:32.550> fader<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.090> tail<00:04:33.750> end<00:04:33.990> of<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.320> reverb

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
the fader the tail end of the reverb

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.000 
the fader the tail end of the reverb
will<00:04:34.860> play<00:04:35.040> out<00:04:39.440> so<00:04:40.440> that<00:04:40.560> is<00:04:40.650> some<00:04:40.800> of<00:04:40.919> the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
will play out so that is some of the

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.490 
will play out so that is some of the
hardware<00:04:41.280> effects<00:04:41.669> on<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.210> range<00:04:42.780> 68<00:04:43.290> you

would increase the cost of the mixer

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.430 
would increase the cost of the mixer
even<00:06:02.340> more<00:06:02.490> than<00:06:02.640> it<00:06:02.760> already<00:06:02.820> is<00:06:03.030> but<00:06:03.930> the

it<00:06:31.440> doesn't<00:06:31.710> really<00:06:31.800> control<00:06:32.100> the<00:06:32.220> wet/dry<00:06:32.520> on

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:32.700 
it doesn't really control the wet/dry on

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.980 
it doesn't really control the wet/dry on
the<00:06:32.850> effects<00:06:33.120> it<00:06:33.300> kind<00:06:33.600> of<00:06:33.630> sounds<00:06:33.870> like<00:06:33.900> the

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
the effects it kind of sounds like the

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.710 
the effects it kind of sounds like the
sound<00:06:34.320> level<00:06:34.590> because<00:06:35.550> since<00:06:35.760> you<00:06:35.970> have<00:06:36.150> dual

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
sound level because since you have dual

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.630 
sound level because since you have dual
USB<00:06:37.110> so<00:06:37.349> you<00:06:37.680> have<00:06:38.010> a<00:06:38.070> lot<00:06:38.190> of<00:06:38.280> channels<00:06:38.460> of

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
USB so you have a lot of channels of

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.780 
USB so you have a lot of channels of
audio<00:06:38.909> that<00:06:39.150> you<00:06:39.240> can<00:06:39.419> send<00:06:39.690> to<00:06:39.780> other

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
audio that you can send to other

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.280 
audio that you can send to other
programs<00:06:41.030> as<00:06:41.180> well<00:06:41.330> and<00:06:41.510> use<00:06:41.660> for<00:06:41.870> effect<00:06:42.110> so

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290 
programs as well and use for effect so

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.410 
programs as well and use for effect so
you<00:06:42.380> can<00:06:42.500> do<00:06:42.590> a<00:06:42.620> lot<00:06:42.800> of<00:06:42.940> routing<00:06:43.940> options<00:06:44.090> with

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.420 
you can do a lot of routing options with

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.760 
you can do a lot of routing options with
the<00:06:44.540> effects<00:06:44.780> as<00:06:44.900> well<00:06:45.050> which<00:06:45.200> I<00:06:45.380> haven't<00:06:45.680> even
