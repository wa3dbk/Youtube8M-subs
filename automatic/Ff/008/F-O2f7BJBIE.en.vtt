is<00:00:12.450> kind<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.929> traumatic<00:00:16.580> because<00:00:18.050> stories<00:00:19.050> no

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
is kind of traumatic because stories no

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.929 
is kind of traumatic because stories no
one<00:00:19.680> really<00:00:20.010> knows<00:00:20.220> what<00:00:20.520> she's<00:00:20.550> pregnant

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
with I mean it would be it would be a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:33.639 
with I mean it would be it would be a
very<00:00:25.410> strange<00:00:25.710> way<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:25.949> react<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.400> reality

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:44.869 

refusing<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.770> accept<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:36.770> but<00:00:38.210> my<00:00:39.210> wife<00:00:39.239> yes<00:00:43.879> I

want to do just a movie only where
baby's<00:01:18.810> next<00:01:19.110> because<00:01:19.530> they<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:20.460> really

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
baby's next because they it's really

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.060 
baby's next because they it's really
simple<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.439> don't<00:01:22.680> really<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.009> do

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
simple like you don't really have to do

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.490 
simple like you don't really have to do
anything<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.549> baby<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:24.060> dictators

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:02:20.120 

I<00:02:17.690> mean<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.840> think<00:02:18.900> if<00:02:19.170> he<00:02:19.290> even<00:02:19.530> used<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.920> free

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
I mean I think if he even used a free

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.510 
I mean I think if he even used a free
card

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
card

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.240 
card
I<00:02:20.610> mean<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.480> guilt<00:02:21.840> they'd<00:02:22.650> experience

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
I mean the guilt they'd experience

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.770 
I mean the guilt they'd experience
afterwards<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.820> mean<00:02:23.970> he<00:02:24.060> just<00:02:24.239> feels<00:02:24.420> guilty

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
afterwards I mean he just feels guilty

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.590 
afterwards I mean he just feels guilty
about<00:02:24.870> absolutely<00:02:25.350> everything<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.920> think<00:02:26.600> he

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
about absolutely everything I think he

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.320 
about absolutely everything I think he
probably<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:28.730> probably<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:29.910> even

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
probably just probably just even

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.300 
probably just probably just even
thinking<00:02:30.660> about<00:02:30.989> using<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.739> free<00:02:31.920> card<00:02:32.160> would

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
thinking about using the free card would

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.430 
thinking about using the free card would
probably<00:02:32.820> probably<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.440> spontaneously

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
probably probably just spontaneously

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.789 
probably probably just spontaneously
combust

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799

just<00:02:37.799> implode<00:02:41.450> huge<00:02:42.450> II<00:02:42.570> think<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.870> would<00:02:42.989> be
