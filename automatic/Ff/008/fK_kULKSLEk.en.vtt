00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.050 
okay so um if you don't know how to 180
you<00:00:32.680> need<00:00:33.130> to<00:00:33.250> learn<00:00:33.370> how<00:00:33.430> to<00:00:33.610> want<00:00:33.850> anything

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
you need to learn how to want anything

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.930 
you need to learn how to want anything
before<00:00:34.300> you<00:00:34.390> do<00:00:34.510> this<00:00:35.460> facing<00:00:36.460> stereotype

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
before you do this facing stereotype

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.450 
before you do this facing stereotype
because<00:00:37.870> that's<00:00:38.110> basically<00:00:38.410> what<00:00:39.309> it<00:00:39.340> is

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
because that's basically what it is

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.950 
because that's basically what it is
except<00:00:40.000> you're<00:00:40.090> learning<00:00:40.360> back<00:00:40.510> tire<00:00:40.720> and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
except you're learning back tire and

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
keep going for another 180 degrees so if

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.340 
keep going for another 180 degrees so if
you<00:00:45.489> have<00:00:45.790> him<00:00:45.970> if<00:00:46.480> you<00:00:46.600> don't<00:00:46.720> know<00:00:46.780> how<00:00:46.930> click

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
you have him if you don't know how click

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.689 
you have him if you don't know how click
there<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:47.970> you'll<00:00:48.970> know<00:00:49.390> how<00:00:50.280> from<00:00:51.280> my<00:00:51.400> video

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
there and you'll know how from my video

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:59.720 
there and you'll know how from my video

more<00:02:41.630> than<00:02:41.840> like<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:43.340> because<00:02:43.820> if<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:44.150> win

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
more than like that because if you win

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.949 
more than like that because if you win
more<00:02:45.140> than<00:02:45.280> halfway<00:02:46.280> it's<00:02:47.120> just<00:02:47.269> gonna<00:02:47.390> come

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
more than halfway it's just gonna come

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.960 
more than halfway it's just gonna come
out<00:02:48.080> from<00:02:48.230> under<00:02:48.320> you<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:49.459> you<00:02:49.550> just<00:02:49.700> want<00:02:49.910> to

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
out from under you so you just want to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.100 
out from under you so you just want to
like<00:02:50.709> just<00:02:51.709> just<00:02:52.519> enough<00:02:52.820> to<00:02:53.000> get<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.420> spin

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
like just just enough to get the spin

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.080 
like just just enough to get the spin
around<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.940> not<00:02:57.300> go<00:02:57.840> over<00:02:58.490> backwards<00:02:59.490> for<00:02:59.970> a

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
around and not go over backwards for a

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:08.840 
around and not go over backwards for a
hitter<00:03:03.650> but<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.040> mean<00:03:06.830> they're<00:03:07.830> a<00:03:08.130> little

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
hitter but so I mean they're a little

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.270 
hitter but so I mean they're a little
easy<00:03:09.090> once<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.510> get<00:03:09.690> use<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.260> them<00:03:10.380> but<00:03:10.620> yeah

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
easy once you get use of them but yeah

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.470 
easy once you get use of them but yeah
once<00:03:11.460> you<00:03:11.520> get<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.730> 180s<00:03:12.180> down<00:03:12.300> they're

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
once you get the 180s down they're

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.480 
once you get the 180s down they're
pretty<00:03:12.690> easy<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.110> lot<00:03:13.230> easier<00:03:13.470> if<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.340> can

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
pretty easy that a lot easier if you can

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:21.020 
pretty easy that a lot easier if you can
180<00:03:14.820> good<00:03:18.710> not<00:03:19.710> really<00:03:20.010> much<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.160> say<00:03:20.430> else<00:03:20.850> in
