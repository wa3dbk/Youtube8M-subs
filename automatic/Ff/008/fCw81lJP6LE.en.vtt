could<00:01:31.259> be<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> ammo<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.220> could<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
could be the ammo it could be a

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.160 
could be the ammo it could be a
multitude<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.390> things<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.869> are<00:01:33.960> causing

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
those situations maybe not being just

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.499 
those situations maybe not being just
the<00:01:41.610> AK<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.119> malfunctioning<00:01:42.360> itself<00:01:43.079> maybe

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
the AK it's malfunctioning itself maybe

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.710 
the AK it's malfunctioning itself maybe

almost completely full mag pouch holder
that's<00:04:52.530> what<00:04:52.680> it<00:04:52.740> looks<00:04:52.890> like<00:04:53.010> it's<00:04:53.220> pretty

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
that's what it looks like it's pretty

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.210 
that's what it looks like it's pretty
simple<00:04:54.230> it's<00:04:55.230> just<00:04:55.440> incorporating<00:04:55.980> that<00:04:56.010> into

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
simple it's just incorporating that into

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.190 
simple it's just incorporating that into
there<00:04:56.520> so<00:04:56.700> you're<00:04:56.970> not<00:04:57.090> changing<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.720> mag<00:04:57.960> out

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
there so you're not changing the mag out

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.440 
there so you're not changing the mag out
and<00:04:58.470> then<00:04:59.160> all<00:04:59.310> of<00:04:59.340> a<00:04:59.490> sudden<00:04:59.520> you're<00:05:00.270> actually

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
and then all of a sudden you're actually

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.820 
and then all of a sudden you're actually
putting<00:05:00.780> bad<00:05:01.680> ammo<00:05:02.190> or<00:05:02.810> not<00:05:03.810> bad<00:05:03.990> mo<00:05:04.170> but<00:05:04.440> ammo

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
putting bad ammo or not bad mo but ammo

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.260 
putting bad ammo or not bad mo but ammo
you're<00:05:05.220> jamming<00:05:05.610> it<00:05:05.670> up<00:05:05.760> even<00:05:06.000> more<00:05:06.120> because

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
you're jamming it up even more because

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.850 
you're jamming it up even more because
you're<00:05:06.480> throwing<00:05:06.810> ammo<00:05:07.080> and<00:05:07.290> you're<00:05:07.680> going<00:05:07.770> to

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
you're throwing ammo and you're going to

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.220 
you're throwing ammo and you're going to
run<00:05:08.040> the<00:05:08.190> bolt<00:05:08.370> again<00:05:08.540> and<00:05:09.540> then<00:05:10.020> you<00:05:10.110> can

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
run the bolt again and then you can

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.930 
run the bolt again and then you can
possibly<00:05:10.650> cause<00:05:11.130> yourself<00:05:11.400> to<00:05:11.610> have<00:05:11.790> even

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
possibly cause yourself to have even

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.420 
possibly cause yourself to have even
more<00:05:12.090> problems<00:05:12.560> instead<00:05:13.560> of<00:05:13.680> just<00:05:13.830> diagnosing

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
more problems instead of just diagnosing

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.850 
more problems instead of just diagnosing
fixing<00:05:14.820> it<00:05:14.940> on<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.480> spot<00:05:15.720> you're<00:05:16.620> going<00:05:16.740> to<00:05:16.800> be

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
fixing it on the spot you're going to be

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.190 
fixing it on the spot you're going to be
putting<00:05:17.010> bad<00:05:17.280> ammo<00:05:17.700> into<00:05:17.880> you<00:05:18.420> know<00:05:18.510> for<00:05:18.810> a<00:05:18.840> bad

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200
