00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.460
 I told you by starting journal 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.440
 our guest tonight and Michel Platini 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.000
 and yes it's kind of our 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.540
 end of year gift to all 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.280
 sports 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.450
 michel platini if ​​you are advertising if 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.519
 it's not for playing football but 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.150
 it is for you to rest I guess yes 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.340
 it is to find the atmosphere 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.840
 domestic 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.609
 it's been seven years since I left 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.350
 not throw I could not come back 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.090
 good it's good to go back into 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.670
 the atmosphere of seeing football friends again 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.199
 and all the friends in six months michel 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.699
 platini we want to ask you 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.929
 a lot of questions and actually 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.460
 we have not seen you for a long time 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.020
 but you are I think to stay Lorraine 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.079
 of heart first on the plane 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.640
 sporty you have arrived at saint-etienne 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.379
 after having known only one club in 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.140
 does nancy is what you found 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.210
 a lot of changes and which ones ben 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.170
 I think the only things round and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.329
 at the sporting level we have we have another 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.010
 dimension to saint-etienne that nancy he 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.780
 must recognize that we do not play 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.520
 we do not have the same ambitions 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.809
 we have to play against the title 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.370
 try to go further in 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.850
 european cup in the sawn guns 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.340
 bomb 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.270
 you have to see how it's going to be 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.909
 since it's difficult to have to 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.200
 play without stopping matches at the most 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.760
 high level that is to say that you 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.860
 expects everywhere in fact that this is to 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.299
 home or away and it takes 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.820
 to be always under pressure is what 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.280
 it asked you a big change 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.689
 on the mental plane 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.270
 no because already nancy I was when 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.520
 even waited a little everywhere 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.720
 the ace saint-etienne it's true we have 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.909
 plays very important matches all 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.710
 weeks m 2 times a week and lcd 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.000
 very difficult to always over motivated 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.530
 that's why we say bowman 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.030
 Saint-Etienne does some games at 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.950
 him but we are obliged because there is 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.450
 decompression is the goal of 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.930
 Saint-Etienne stopped playing the cup 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.490
 europe 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.890
 so we keep quiet a little 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.299
 during the league matches you 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.130
 have followed of course the crisis 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.400
 nancéienne although being in saint-etienne 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.530
 is that 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.420
 that touched you what is it that you 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.300
 the most marked the future of the club the future 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.730
 players where the quarrel between 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.020
 low leaders in the future of the club with 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.390
 the back of the players I think 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.800
 the chorus the leaders good I was 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.170
 very far I do not really know well 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.900
 what happened but I still 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.250
 people talk to me a lot about 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.510
 players and players are a little 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.240
 disturbed because they do not know what 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.800
 that will happen do not know who 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.020
 had to order they are not 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.100
 secure people around them and 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.900
 it's not very good to do their 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.940
 job 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.320
 last question saint-etienne in section 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.250
 of europe of course in quarter of 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.100
 final in the spring 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.720
 is it something that 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.459
 much motivates a player like you is 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.120
 what you live now for the 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.770
 European Cup 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.480
 outside the normal life of the club yes 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.400
 we came with finally we came with 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.500
 johnny rep french rank the team 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.730
 Saint-Etienne was important 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.410
 come in the quarterfinals because we 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.350
 would not understand why we would 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.820
 come is we are we are very proud and 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.440
 then we are a little sigh of relief 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.850
 when we arrive in the quarterfinals and 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.830
 now I think that all we are going 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.700
 take it'll be a little bit of a rab 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.440
 and we would be very proud if we 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.670
 could finally win a cup 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.090
 from Europe we feel that the first team 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.540
 in France but it's not done yet 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.060
 last question 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.380
 it becomes a soap opera you know that 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.940
 the Italian borders will open 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.750
 we periodically talk to you about 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.810
 the inter of milan 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.160
 is it still so serious 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.720
 ben the leaders of the inter Milan 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.590
 saw the leaders of saint-etienne 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.450
 at the beginning of the season and I do not have 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.040
 question for me to leave inter of 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.970
 Milan at the end of the season 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.459
 I still have a year and a half of contract 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.780
 after we'll see it will all depend on the 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.000
 proposals that will still be made to 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.190
 saint-etienne last word you have 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.630
 offered a gift for the Christmas of 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.160
 children are joy it's a gesture that the 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.810
 sportsmen have certainly appreciated 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.090
 do you think that athletes 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.610
 can be associated in this kind of 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.770
 campaign yes of course 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.390
 the proof is that good but the 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.270
 day mixes - players have made a 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.570
 very important match in dortmund 6 0 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.140
 miles 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.490
 the recipe to unicef ​​I believe it 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.380
 have to be supportive a little with the 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.110
 people who are very unhappy and 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.290
 especially children plus bomb at the 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.150
 Lorraine is a shame a very region 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.160
 affected by the economic problems and 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.600
 it would have to be in 81 sel and wants me 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.060
 wish it's going much better 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.500
 this is on seven michel platini that 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.020
 we will go to the next page of 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:17.230

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:21.370
 tonight at what accentuates longemer yesterday a 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:26.770
 not long it's four minutes 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:28.540
 what is waiting for everything including not transmitting 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.650
 me me I think it's good 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.130
 because we have my impulse 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:37.230
 sugar duck on the ski 1 is the 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.230
