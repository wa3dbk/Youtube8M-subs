think that everyone's competing for a
spot<00:02:01.090> everyone's<00:02:01.899> competing<00:02:02.289> and<00:02:02.679> beyond<00:02:03.250> the

that<00:03:20.440> they'll<00:03:21.130> accomplish<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:21.700> game<00:03:21.850> you're

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
that they'll accomplish the game you're

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.849 
that they'll accomplish the game you're
gonna<00:03:22.359> have<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.660> team<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:23.079> just<00:03:23.200> looks<00:03:23.739> to

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
gonna have the team that just looks to

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.770 
gonna have the team that just looks to
be<00:03:23.950> really<00:03:24.160> technical<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.819> play<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.329> keep

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
be really technical and play and keep

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.849 
be really technical and play and keep
the<00:03:25.870> ball<00:03:26.019> on<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.139> ground<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:26.530> then<00:03:26.620> we<00:03:26.739> have

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
the ball on the ground and then we have

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.470 
the ball on the ground and then we have
the<00:03:26.950> teams<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.310> have<00:03:27.549> a<00:03:27.579> fast<00:03:27.970> forward<00:03:28.389> or

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
the teams that have a fast forward or

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.449 
the teams that have a fast forward or
this<00:03:28.660> day<00:03:28.780> forward<00:03:29.109> and<00:03:29.410> they<00:03:29.500> look<00:03:30.069> to<00:03:30.190> put<00:03:30.370> it

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
this day forward and they look to put it

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.210 
this day forward and they look to put it
over<00:03:30.519> top<00:03:30.639> of

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
over top of

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.460 
over top of
so<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:31.460> think<00:03:31.580> directly<00:03:32.480> relates<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:33.080> it<00:03:33.200> can

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
so I think directly relates and it can

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.830 
so I think directly relates and it can
definitely<00:03:33.830> help<00:03:33.980> in<00:03:34.310> terms<00:03:34.610> of<00:03:34.910> seeing

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
definitely help in terms of seeing

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.540 
definitely help in terms of seeing
seeing<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.500> types<00:03:36.710> of<00:03:36.830> styles<00:03:36.980> that<00:03:37.280> you'll

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
seeing the types of styles that you'll

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.450 
seeing the types of styles that you'll
go<00:03:37.700> against<00:03:37.910> in<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:38.180> league
