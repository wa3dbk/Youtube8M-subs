00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.340
 hello friends with you evgeny trot 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.900
 and this is a special release announcement 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.199
 workshop which will be held in format 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.650
 live broadcast today at 7 o'clock on our 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.820
 channel steam ling industrial mincraft 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.720
 release will concern assembly 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.820
 terrafirmacraft 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.710
 and Greg those here so our joint 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.230
 assembly as you know we are very active 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.789
 working on it and in principle we are in this 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.529
 assembly 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.210
 real interested but home 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.520
 the challenge is what's needed 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.920
 make the gameplay complete 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.829
 so that you can go from the very beginning 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.659
 from the stone age of the firm's tyr and 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.370
 ending late 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.589
 advanced ceram greg texas all 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.019
 his cool wonderful but very 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.729
 complex sets of machines for this 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.889
 need of course to prepare 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.679
 the material base we need so that 

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:58.780
 there were resources we could work at all on 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:01.929
 in fact our work it is 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.750
 not only in resources we also worked 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:07.210
 over questions of unification over questions 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.650
 crafting and generating the world that's proper 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.330
 About the generation of the world I want in a nutshell 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.520
 now tell in order to have you 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.050
 extreme was great information to 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.150
 you could prepare to come and 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.880
 talk with you on this topic with us 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.930
 there will be such a round table in teamspeak 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.230
 conference we will invite 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.150
 various experts and communicate on all 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.850
 those issues that we need to resolve 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.500
 in order to get quality 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.010
 working terrafirmacraft grip tech 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.030
 assembly friends so when we talk about 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.110
 high shooting range 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.620
 even about the average shooting range Garka teka in the first 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.880
 queue of course these are questions on 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.010
 Aluminum friends we need to take somewhere 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.650
 aluminum and in order to solve this 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.460
 the task we add to the world of bauxite 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.020
 bauxite as you know they are used 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.820
 beauty in bauxite have dust from which 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.430
 after processing we can receive 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.480
 aluminum and how still extra when 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.530
 this moment is titanium 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.200
 we try to do everything as much as possible 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.030
 moments close to reality and we 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.789
 we will use the generation of the world 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.720
 Omsk terrafirmacraft will not 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.730
 according to the rules on 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.650
 they are closest to 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.450
 the world as we have in real nature 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.859
 there is 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.060
 bauxite will occur in limestone 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.639
 yes michi 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.549
 and conglomerate on the same principles as 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:31.239
 kaolinite is a cluster of medium and large 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.040
 size probably even large means 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.760
 the next important point when we say 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.779
 about titanium besides bauxite, we will add more 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:45.519
 also or a blowjob or a blowjob if 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:49.150
 correct or blowjob we will add 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:55.150
 in as now how correctly 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:58.450
 say as lived in granite theoreti 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.659
 and gabbro as a small lived here 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.290
 my example is just a facet of it i'm a breed 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:07.779
 granite terrafirmacraft ovsky here we have 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.840
 have or blowjob while we show here 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:12.579
 textures greg well i think that maybe 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.010
 we can work on textures 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.709
 this is a separate important task i hope 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.760
 that she is solved and so or blowjob we 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.819
 we will find the following in granite 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.159
 the breed over which we are now leading 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.709
 discussion is a source of tungsten 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.959
 tungsten is our sin and naturally 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.169
 it is needed and needed from us 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.889
 there are a choice of two options or a tank 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:40.450
 walls ore 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:43.180
 which is probably a little strange it 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.400
 actually pure tungsten here in the form 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.609
 ores that can be found in the world here we are 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.359
 think we want to do it and if so 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:55.889
 what kind of slave to wear 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:04:00.489
 option is so worth thanx to thank state 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:03.800
 this is more cunning thing tank state 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.989
 it is with us actually and 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:11.310
 tungsten with lithium here we are right now 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:13.560
 studying the situation in order to understand 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.139
 is it capable of in nature like 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.709
 the connection will appear if the date is where it is 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.690
 will appear and under what conditions 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.910
 the next moment which we will definitely be 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.669
 add this scheelite really acting 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.070
 the breed that is actually in the world 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.050
 she has a little different formula but 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.800
 the principle is the same there is also tungsten 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.950
 same calcium a little bit others 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.750
 index we do not know for what reason 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.760
 Greg is exactly such a formula here 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.200
 use but in a pinch we 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.260
 have the opportunity to contact him by 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.650
 mail and discuss with him the moment of nectar 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.570
 chemical formulas nobody form some 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.250
 compounds in general, we also scheelite 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.990
 will he be the source 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.090
 tungsten if we watch it now 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.750
 use we see that we yes we 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:04.410
 we can get out of it in an electro laser 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.490
 and tank walls and calcium what's fine what 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.530
 we need 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.669
 well and another important ore which 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.370
 which is strategically 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.370
 claimed in the later stages of the greek 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.070
 those of olivine which we have not yet 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.849
 decided in what form and where we will be 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.400
 insert 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.280
 the fact is that olivine was originally on 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.690
 actually in terrafirmacraft and was if 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.900
 we look now i'm at the gate 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.630
 levin we see now this is greg chekhovsky 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.520
 olivine and here it is friends olivine 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.700
 terrafirmacraft ovsky then he really 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.979
 in fact there was say so but in the last 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.770
 updates it cleaned up generating the world 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:46.440
 I do not even know for what reasons here 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.110
 I propose to discuss these points with you 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.660
 on our stream today at 7 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.940
 Moscow time , I also created 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.039
 special special post in our 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.169
 questions are devoted to the public 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:00.390
 preparing the game in industrial 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.880
 maykravt reference on 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.190
 This post is right in the video description. 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.450
 any constructive comments i ask 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:11.580
 namely to send to friends is a stream 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.460
 will be very specific this is exactly 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:18.450
 workshop format stream so we 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:21.960
 we will communicate exclusively on these topics 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:24.360
 on the themes of the game and the settings of terrafirmacraft 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.890
 garik those assemblies so is there any 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.540
 the topic is not very interesting to you then we 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.650
 a little we can not pay very much 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.030
 attention chat 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.370
 and first of all we will 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:36.810
 focused precisely on these tasks 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:39.300
 and so can credit the friends come 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.340
 public in the description I'll leave you now 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.480
 and the container will stream now 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.500
 all your suggestions have been created 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.570
 rationalization ideas the question is what 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.550
 It seems important to you to work on this 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.170
 assembly, too, write, we have already done 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.520
 great work on unification by 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.490
 configuring configs about this we too 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.590
 tell in general come invite 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.510
 let's all talk let's think 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.700
 how do we do this assembly together 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.530
 really high quality interesting and 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.750
 which is the most important playable so you 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:09.380
 see on stream 7 hours with you was 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.380
