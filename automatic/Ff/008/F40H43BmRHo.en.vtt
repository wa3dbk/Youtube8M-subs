of the most enjoyable trouble powers in
my<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.869> my<00:01:36.930> opinion<00:01:37.380> anyway<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:39.780> put<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
my in my opinion anyway you put the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.569 
my in my opinion anyway you put the
problem<00:01:40.320> with<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.560> obviously<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.220> harder

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
problem with it is obviously it's harder

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.700 
problem with it is obviously it's harder

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
swinging you have to try and like time

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.719 
swinging you have to try and like time
it<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.780> when<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.409> let<00:01:55.740> go<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
it so you when you let go of the the

it so you when you let go of the the
swing<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.360> actually<00:01:57.509> go<00:01:57.899> higher<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.200> then

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
swing you actually go higher and then

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.530 
swing you actually go higher and then
you<00:01:58.799> don't<00:01:59.549> have<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.759> keep<00:01:59.880> going<00:02:00.030> higher<00:02:00.240> like

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
you don't have to keep going higher like

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.760 
you don't have to keep going higher like
that<00:02:00.689> as<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.930> can<00:02:00.960> see<00:02:01.229> what<00:02:01.380> I'm<00:02:01.500> doing<00:02:01.530> now

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.260 
yes it's a bit tricky to get to the air
to<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.320> top<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.550> see<00:02:14.700> those<00:02:14.850> really

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
to the top like you can see those really

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.910 
to the top like you can see those really
tall<00:02:15.510> buildings<00:02:15.960> over<00:02:16.230> there<00:02:16.260> really<00:02:16.740> high

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
tall buildings over there really high

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.660 
tall buildings over there really high
and<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:18.300> could<00:02:18.930> get<00:02:19.110> there<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.920> just<00:02:20.250> tipped<00:02:20.520> me

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
and I could get there it just tipped me

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.760 
and I could get there it just tipped me
a<00:02:20.700> while<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.210> I'd<00:02:21.540> have<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.750> bit<00:02:21.960> of<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.140> hard

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
a while and I'd have a bit of a hard

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.540 
a while and I'd have a bit of a hard
time<00:02:22.890> getting<00:02:23.370> up<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.640> them<00:02:23.790> with<00:02:24.300> swinging

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
time getting up to them with swinging

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.340 
time getting up to them with swinging
but<00:02:26.550> it's<00:02:26.880> not<00:02:26.910> too<00:02:27.510> big<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.720> deal<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.200> know<00:02:28.290> you

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
but it's not too big a deal you know you

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.040 
but it's not too big a deal you know you
can<00:02:28.560> get<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.800> most<00:02:29.010> places<00:02:29.220> quite<00:02:29.880> easily<00:02:30.120> with

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
can get to most places quite easily with

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.800 
can get to most places quite easily with
it<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.640> as<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.730> can<00:02:32.880> see<00:02:32.910> i'm<00:02:33.180> actually<00:02:33.330> quite
