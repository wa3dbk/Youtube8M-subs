00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
months ago I was like team Xbox one I

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.530 
months ago I was like team Xbox one I
just<00:00:43.200> had<00:00:43.350> really<00:00:43.880> really<00:00:44.880> high<00:00:45.090> hopes<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
just had really really high hopes and

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.630 
just had really really high hopes and
expectations<00:00:45.870> for<00:00:46.380> Microsoft<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.040> the<00:00:47.160> xbox

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
expectations for Microsoft and the xbox

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.569 
expectations for Microsoft and the xbox
one<00:00:47.970> this<00:00:48.300> uh<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:49.340> generation<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.430> thought

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
one this uh this generation I thought

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.889 
one this uh this generation I thought
the<00:00:50.700> next<00:00:50.940> gen<00:00:51.120> was<00:00:51.239> going<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.450> be<00:00:51.540> a<00:00:51.570> lot

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the next gen was going to be a lot

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.840 
the next gen was going to be a lot
cooler<00:00:52.260> than<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.739> turned<00:00:52.920> out<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.489> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
cooler than it turned out to be and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.440 
cooler than it turned out to be and
honestly<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.020> was<00:00:55.110> just<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.320> huge<00:00:55.530> letdown<00:00:56.450> even

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
honestly it was just a huge letdown even

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.270 
honestly it was just a huge letdown even
the<00:00:57.540> ps4<00:00:57.780> if<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.110> had<00:00:58.200> a<00:00:58.260> ps4<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.770> think<00:00:59.130> that<00:00:59.250> I

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the ps4 if I had a ps4 I think that I

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.889 
the ps4 if I had a ps4 I think that I
would<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.700> considering<00:01:00.210> telling<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.690> as

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
would be considering telling that as

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.540 
would be considering telling that as
well<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.530> because<00:01:01.680> they're<00:01:01.950> both<00:01:02.160> too<00:01:02.340> just

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
well just because they're both too just

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.710 
well just because they're both too just
not<00:01:03.290> PC<00:01:04.290> level<00:01:04.800> they're<00:01:05.070> not<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.720> they're

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
not PC level they're not like they're

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.270 
not PC level they're not like they're
not<00:01:06.869> as<00:01:07.020> good<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:07.289> they<00:01:07.410> could<00:01:07.470> be<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.009> feel

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
not as good as they could be and I feel

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.180 
not as good as they could be and I feel
like<00:01:09.050> these<00:01:10.050> consoles<00:01:10.710> could<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:10.920> been<00:01:11.039> at<00:01:11.160> a

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
like these consoles could have been at a

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.410 
like these consoles could have been at a
couple<00:01:11.490> years<00:01:11.670> ago<00:01:11.789> and<00:01:12.090> they<00:01:12.149> definitely

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
couple years ago and they definitely

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.109 
couple years ago and they definitely
would<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.659> done<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> lot<00:01:13.110> better<00:01:14.030> so<00:01:15.030> I'm

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
