and<00:06:14.070> the<00:06:14.580> end<00:06:14.669> of<00:06:14.790> the<00:06:14.910> piston<00:06:15.240> gets<00:06:15.450> placed

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
and the end of the piston gets placed

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.530 
and the end of the piston gets placed
resting<00:06:16.260> in<00:06:16.350> the<00:06:16.470> pad<00:06:16.910> the<00:06:17.910> process<00:06:18.270> is<00:06:18.450> just

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
resting in the pad the process is just

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.060 
resting in the pad the process is just
repeated<00:06:19.050> at<00:06:19.169> the<00:06:19.260> rear<00:06:19.440> end<00:06:19.650> of<00:06:19.710> the<00:06:19.860> truck

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
repeated at the rear end of the truck

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.350 
repeated at the rear end of the truck
where<00:06:20.310> the<00:06:20.430> outrigger<00:06:20.730> beams<00:06:20.850> are<00:06:21.180> just

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
where the outrigger beams are just

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.270 
where the outrigger beams are just
pulled<00:06:21.600> out<00:06:21.780> and<00:06:22.020> again<00:06:22.710> the<00:06:22.830> piston<00:06:23.160> is

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
pulled out and again the piston is

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.180 
pulled out and again the piston is
placed<00:06:23.580> inside<00:06:23.820> the<00:06:24.150> supplied<00:06:24.510> pad<00:06:25.040> the<00:06:26.040> big

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
placed inside the supplied pad the big

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.770 
placed inside the supplied pad the big
power<00:06:26.400> finger<00:06:26.669> can<00:06:26.850> now<00:06:26.970> be<00:06:27.120> opened<00:06:27.419> up<00:06:27.570> and

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
power finger can now be opened up and

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.970 
power finger can now be opened up and
actually<00:06:27.900> that<00:06:28.140> was<00:06:28.230> quite<00:06:28.380> hard<00:06:28.440> to<00:06:28.830> do

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
actually that was quite hard to do

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.040 
actually that was quite hard to do
because<00:06:29.220> the<00:06:29.580> cylinders<00:06:30.180> are<00:06:30.210> very<00:06:30.480> stiff<00:06:30.840> on

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
because the cylinders are very stiff on

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.170 
because the cylinders are very stiff on
this<00:06:31.200> model<00:06:31.350> not<00:06:32.250> only<00:06:32.310> that<00:06:32.730> but<00:06:32.910> on<00:06:33.000> this

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
this model not only that but on this

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.730 
this model not only that but on this
model<00:06:33.360> the<00:06:33.600> attachment<00:06:34.080> of<00:06:34.140> the<00:06:34.260> crane<00:06:34.530> to<00:06:34.710> the

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
model the attachment of the crane to the

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.460 
model the attachment of the crane to the
truck<00:06:35.040> chassis<00:06:35.070> was<00:06:35.550> a<00:06:35.610> bit<00:06:35.820> loose<00:06:36.320> so<00:06:37.320> the

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
truck chassis was a bit loose so the

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.020 
truck chassis was a bit loose so the
screw<00:06:37.680> that<00:06:37.830> holds<00:06:37.890> them<00:06:38.280> together<00:06:38.460> had<00:06:38.820> to<00:06:38.940> be

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
screw that holds them together had to be

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.840 
screw that holds them together had to be
separately<00:06:39.419> tightened<00:06:39.900> up<00:06:40.460> once<00:06:41.460> the<00:06:41.669> loader

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
separately tightened up once the loader

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.940 
separately tightened up once the loader
crane<00:06:42.030> is<00:06:42.300> unfolded<00:06:42.990> then<00:06:43.230> the<00:06:43.350> rotation<00:06:43.680> is

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950 
crane is unfolded then the rotation is

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.370 
crane is unfolded then the rotation is
fairly<00:06:44.190> straightforward<00:06:44.960> one<00:06:45.960> thing<00:06:46.140> that<00:06:46.290> is

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
fairly straightforward one thing that is

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.630 
fairly straightforward one thing that is
very<00:06:46.440> nicely<00:06:46.800> engineered<00:06:47.070> is<00:06:47.490> the

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:47.640 
very nicely engineered is the

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.029 
very nicely engineered is the
telescoping<00:06:48.210> sections<00:06:48.710> they're<00:06:49.710> made<00:06:49.890> of

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 
telescoping sections they're made of

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:51.560 
telescoping sections they're made of
thin<00:06:50.250> wall<00:06:50.400> metal<00:06:50.729> and<00:06:51.000> they<00:06:51.090> slide<00:06:51.360> very

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
thin wall metal and they slide very

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.250 
thin wall metal and they slide very
nicely

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.260 
nicely

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.140 
nicely
if<00:06:52.920> you<00:06:53.100> set<00:06:53.280> the<00:06:53.370> whole<00:06:53.520> crane<00:06:53.730> up<00:06:53.880> you<00:06:54.000> get

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
if you set the whole crane up you get

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.670 
if you set the whole crane up you get
quite<00:06:54.330> a<00:06:54.360> large<00:06:54.690> model<00:06:55.050> so<00:06:55.200> let's<00:06:55.380> get<00:06:55.530> the

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
quite a large model so let's get the

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.190 
quite a large model so let's get the
measuring<00:06:55.950> tape<00:06:56.190> out<00:06:56.490> and<00:06:56.910> it's<00:06:57.630> nearly<00:06:57.900> 18

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.200 
measuring tape out and it's nearly 18

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.610 
measuring tape out and it's nearly 18
inches<00:06:58.590> or<00:06:58.800> 45<00:06:59.280> centimeters<00:07:00.230> the<00:07:01.230> boom<00:07:01.380> Rams

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
inches or 45 centimeters the boom Rams

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.290 
inches or 45 centimeters the boom Rams
on<00:07:01.830> the<00:07:01.920> model<00:07:02.130> are<00:07:02.280> very<00:07:02.490> stiff<00:07:02.820> but<00:07:03.060> here's<00:07:03.240> a

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
on the model are very stiff but here's a

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.030 
on the model are very stiff but here's a
real<00:07:03.540> test<00:07:03.840> because<00:07:04.020> that<00:07:04.380> tower<00:07:04.800> crane

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040 
real test because that tower crane

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.680 
real test because that tower crane
section<00:07:05.400> is<00:07:05.490> quite<00:07:05.670> heavy<00:07:06.090> and<00:07:06.360> it's<00:07:06.480> at<00:07:06.600> the

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.690 
section is quite heavy and it's at the

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.510 
section is quite heavy and it's at the
maximum<00:07:07.080> extension<00:07:07.440> but<00:07:07.980> you<00:07:08.040> can<00:07:08.190> see<00:07:08.370> it's

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
maximum extension but you can see it's

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.290 
maximum extension but you can see it's
slowly<00:07:08.850> bleeding<00:07:09.390> down<00:07:10.910> overall<00:07:11.910> this<00:07:12.090> is<00:07:12.150> a

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
slowly bleeding down overall this is a

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.180 
slowly bleeding down overall this is a
very<00:07:12.390> nice<00:07:12.750> truck<00:07:13.140> and<00:07:13.290> trailer<00:07:13.590> combination

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:14.190 
very nice truck and trailer combination

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.580 
very nice truck and trailer combination
it's<00:07:15.030> very<00:07:15.300> highly<00:07:15.570> detailed<00:07:15.810> and<00:07:16.290> a<00:07:16.380> little

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:16.590 
it's very highly detailed and a little

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.740 
it's very highly detailed and a little
bit<00:07:16.710> delicate<00:07:16.890> as<00:07:17.250> a<00:07:17.280> result<00:07:17.700> but<00:07:18.570> the

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
bit delicate as a result but the

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.630 
bit delicate as a result but the
functionality<00:07:19.170> is<00:07:19.500> good<00:07:19.770> and<00:07:20.040> it<00:07:20.190> looks<00:07:20.310> great

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:20.640 
functionality is good and it looks great

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.390 
functionality is good and it looks great
in<00:07:20.910> the<00:07:20.940> cars<00:07:21.240> of<00:07:21.510> grower<00:07:21.780> as<00:07:22.110> an<00:07:22.860> example<00:07:23.160> of<00:07:23.340> a

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 
in the cars of grower as an example of a

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.980 
in the cars of grower as an example of a
truck<00:07:23.580> and<00:07:23.730> trailer<00:07:23.850> combination<00:07:24.600> this<00:07:24.780> one

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:24.990 
truck and trailer combination this one

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.800
