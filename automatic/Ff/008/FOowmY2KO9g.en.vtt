00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
meet was like for you I loved the trip I

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.860 
meet was like for you I loved the trip I
think<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.850> great<00:00:38.940> experience<00:00:39.420> for

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
think it's a great experience for

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.200 
think it's a great experience for
youngers<00:00:40.700> particularly<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.820> age<00:00:41.969> group

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
youngers particularly the age group

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.900 
youngers particularly the age group
swimmers<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.840> think<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.950> allows<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
swimmers I think that it allows you to

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.299 
swimmers I think that it allows you to
adapt<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.329> other<00:00:45.570> surroundings<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:47.129> you're

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
adapt to other surroundings that you're

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.520 
adapt to other surroundings that you're
involved<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.450> come<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> future<00:00:49.020> I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
involved with to come in the future I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.500 
involved with to come in the future I
think<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.309> also<00:00:50.520> great<00:00:50.910> because<00:00:51.180> there's<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
think it's also great because there's a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.479 
think it's also great because there's a
ton<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:52.020> swimmers<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.100> fastest
