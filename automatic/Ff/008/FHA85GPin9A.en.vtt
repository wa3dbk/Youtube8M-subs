replace it and here's where I modified

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.410 
replace it and here's where I modified
the<00:01:53.700> very<00:01:53.910> first<00:01:54.210> thing<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:55.259> next<00:01:55.650> left<00:01:59.420> to

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the very first thing this next left to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.480 
the very first thing this next left to
the<00:02:01.259> way<00:02:01.380> drew<00:02:01.650> plays<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.070> which<00:02:02.190> is<00:02:02.310> really

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the way drew plays it which is really

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.490 
the way drew plays it which is really
the<00:02:02.790> smarter<00:02:03.119> way<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.270> play<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.630> if<00:02:03.810> he<00:02:04.200> does<00:02:04.380> an

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
the smarter way to play it if he does an

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.950 
the smarter way to play it if he does an
accented<00:02:05.160> left<00:02:05.790> hand<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.270> snare<00:02:06.360> okay<00:02:06.900> so

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
way I would definitely recommend it but

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.330 
way I would definitely recommend it but
if<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.620> want<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.830> learn<00:02:19.920> us<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.070> little<00:02:20.250> bit

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
if you want to learn us a little bit

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.370 
if you want to learn us a little bit

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
faster and get the same effects we can

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.170 
faster and get the same effects we can
do<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:22.739> take<00:02:22.860> your<00:02:23.010> right<00:02:23.070> hand<00:02:23.280> off<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180

hi-hat<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.810> go<00:02:25.530> ahead<00:02:25.680> an<00:02:25.890> accent<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.610> back

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
hi-hat and go ahead an accent that back

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.640 
hi-hat and go ahead an accent that back
beat<00:02:27.239> with<00:02:27.360> your<00:02:27.480> right<00:02:27.660> hand<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.080> there's<00:02:28.470> no

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
beat with your right hand and there's no

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.470 
beat with your right hand and there's no
ghost<00:02:28.920> note<00:02:29.070> with<00:02:29.190> your<00:02:29.280> left<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.760> little<00:02:29.940> bit

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
ghost note with your left a little bit

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.600 
ghost note with your left a little bit
it's<00:02:31.410> hard<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.680> say<00:02:31.830> that's<00:02:32.040> cheating<00:02:32.370> or<00:02:32.489> not

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
it's hard to say that's cheating or not

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.539 
it's hard to say that's cheating or not
but<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:36.540> once<00:02:36.930> we<00:02:37.050> get<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.230> far<00:02:37.650> that's

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
but so once we get that far that's

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:49.509 
but so once we get that far that's
followed<00:02:39.060> by<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.510> double<00:02:39.930> on<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.350> right<00:02:40.590> hand

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:05:55.690 

right<00:02:50.519> right<00:02:50.790> on<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.970> high<00:02:51.150> okay

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.040 

turn<00:05:56.700> it<00:05:56.820> around<00:05:56.910> here<00:05:57.360> and<00:05:57.389> just<00:05:57.660> go<00:05:57.810> back<00:05:58.020> to

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
turn it around here and just go back to

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.170 
turn it around here and just go back to
the<00:05:58.260> beginning<00:05:58.410> so<00:05:58.950> we<00:05:59.039> make<00:05:59.220> this<00:05:59.310> more<00:05:59.550> with

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
the beginning so we make this more with

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.730 
the beginning so we make this more with
sixteenth<00:06:00.660> note<00:06:00.840> than<00:06:01.169> a<00:06:01.200> thirty<00:06:01.410> second

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
sixteenth note than a thirty second

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.290 
sixteenth note than a thirty second
group<00:06:02.039> is<00:06:02.370> just<00:06:02.550> going<00:06:02.639> to<00:06:02.760> turn<00:06:02.970> over<00:06:03.120> a

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
group is just going to turn over a

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.070 
group is just going to turn over a
little<00:06:03.450> bit<00:06:03.539> faster

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
little bit faster

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.860 
little bit faster
so<00:06:04.380> how<00:06:05.370> I<00:06:05.400> turn<00:06:05.820> this<00:06:05.940> around<00:06:06.120> and<00:06:06.510> go<00:06:06.660> back

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
so how I turn this around and go back

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.770 
so how I turn this around and go back
into<00:06:07.110> our<00:06:07.260> beginning
