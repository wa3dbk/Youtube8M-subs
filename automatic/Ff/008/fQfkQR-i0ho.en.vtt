you might want to do is if you don't use

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
you might want to do is if you don't use
Java<00:01:08.670> all<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> time<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.780> might<00:01:09.900> want<00:01:09.960> to

Java all the time you might want to

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.679 
Java all the time you might want to
disable<00:01:10.439> Java<00:01:10.920> that's<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.970> big<00:01:12.150> area<00:01:12.630> for

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
disable Java that's a big area for

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.320 
disable Java that's a big area for
exploits<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.380> OS<00:01:13.590> 10<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.180> to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
use Java you can install like a second

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.719

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
something like that that you can use

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.609 
something like that that you can use
when<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.009> need<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.340> use<00:01:23.580> Java<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.780> web<00:01:24.930> so

when you need to use Java on the web so

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.840 
when you need to use Java on the web so

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
you have to do is uncheck Java and you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.460 
you have to do is uncheck Java and you
can<00:01:29.369> stop<00:01:29.729> Java<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.420> that'll<00:01:31.020> take<00:01:31.170> care<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
can stop Java and that'll take care of a

can stop Java and that'll take care of a
lot<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> exploits<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.729> might<00:01:32.880> run

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.179 
safe files after downloading so
basically<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.140> saying<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.680> if<00:01:40.860> you

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
basically this is saying that if you

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.399 
basically this is saying that if you
download<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> PDF<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:42.780> an<00:01:42.869> archive<00:01:43.229> or

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
download the PDF or an archive or

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.139 
download the PDF or an archive or
something<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.399> would<00:01:44.610> down<00:01:44.909> it

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
something like that it would down it

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.460 
something like that it would down it
would<00:01:45.270> open<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.600> right<00:01:45.840> after<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.140> download

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
would open it right after you download

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.069 
would open it right after you download
and<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:47.250> kind<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.700> allows<00:01:48.210> files<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:49.049> open

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
and this kind of allows files to open

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.990 
and this kind of allows files to open
automatically<00:01:49.920> without<00:01:50.070> your<00:01:50.369> approval<00:01:50.520> on

automatically without your approval on
your<00:01:51.030> system<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.570> if<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.689> uncheck<00:01:51.840> that

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
your system so if you uncheck that

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.109 
your system so if you uncheck that
you're<00:01:52.860> safe<00:01:53.130> there<00:01:53.399> now<00:01:53.670> another<00:01:53.850> thing<00:01:53.970> you

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
you're safe there now another thing you

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.999 
you're safe there now another thing you
can<00:01:54.210> do<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.630> black<00:01:54.930> flash<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.680> make<00:01:55.799> sure

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
can do is black flash to make sure

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.149 
can do is black flash to make sure
there's<00:01:56.490> no<00:01:56.670> exploits<00:01:57.149> with<00:01:57.450> flash<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:59.009> use

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
there's no exploits with flash and I use

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.459 
there's no exploits with flash and I use
a<00:01:59.189> flash<00:01:59.520> blocker<00:01:59.820> all<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> time<00:02:00.469> mostly

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
a flash blocker all the time mostly

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.780 
a flash blocker all the time mostly
because<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.770> speeds<00:02:02.009> up<00:02:02.130> browsing<00:02:02.579> but<00:02:02.700> it

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
because it speeds up browsing but it

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.060 
because it speeds up browsing but it
also<00:02:02.939> can<00:02:03.299> make<00:02:03.420> your<00:02:03.479> system<00:02:03.930> more<00:02:04.530> safe<00:02:04.829> too

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
will look a little bit different then it

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.990

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
once again but basically you should see

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939 
an option under general in this case I

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.999 
an option under general in this case I
have<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.180> go<00:03:27.239> on<00:03:27.329> an<00:03:27.419> advanced<00:03:28.019> but<00:03:28.650> to

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:29.009 
have to go on an advanced but to

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.280 
have to go on an advanced but to

automatically update safe downloads list

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.479 
automatically update safe downloads list
and<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.709> want<00:03:31.889> to<00:03:31.979> make<00:03:32.099> sure<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:32.310> is

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
and you want to make sure this is

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.860 
and you want to make sure this is
checked<00:03:32.519> because<00:03:33.120> what<00:03:33.389> it<00:03:33.479> does<00:03:33.599> is<00:03:33.750> it

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
checked because what it does is it

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.899 
checked because what it does is it
checks<00:03:34.079> daily<00:03:34.530> for<00:03:34.739> new<00:03:34.949> malware<00:03:35.159> definitions

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
checks daily for new malware definitions

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.149 
checks daily for new malware definitions
and<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.599> updates<00:03:36.750> those<00:03:37.199> for<00:03:37.500> your<00:03:37.620> system<00:03:37.979> to

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
and it updates those for your system to

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.679 
and it updates those for your system to
keep<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.609> safe<00:03:38.849> so<00:03:38.879> you<00:03:39.120> always<00:03:39.299> want<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.569> have

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 
keep you safe so you always want to have

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:41.089 
keep you safe so you always want to have
that<00:03:39.870> checked<00:03:40.169> now<00:03:40.500> another<00:03:40.709> thing<00:03:40.859> that

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
that checked now another thing that

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.710 
that checked now another thing that
sounds<00:03:41.430> pretty<00:03:41.579> obvious<00:03:42.030> but<00:03:42.180> might<00:03:42.389> not<00:03:42.419> be

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
sounds pretty obvious but might not be

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.210 
sounds pretty obvious but might not be
is<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.049> actually<00:03:43.199> make<00:03:43.500> sure<00:03:43.530> your<00:03:43.769> firewall

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
is to actually make sure your firewall

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.460 
is to actually make sure your firewall
is<00:03:44.370> set<00:03:44.879> up<00:03:44.970> properly<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.419> went<00:03:45.720> in<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.319> other

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
is set up properly I went in the other

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.499 
is set up properly I went in the other
day<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:46.889> I<00:03:46.979> looked<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.400> my<00:03:47.519> firewall<00:03:47.939> wasn't

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:48.509 
day and I looked and my firewall wasn't

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.080 
day and I looked and my firewall wasn't
on<00:03:48.629> so<00:03:49.409> you<00:03:50.189> know<00:03:50.280> that's<00:03:50.459> not<00:03:50.669> a<00:03:50.729> very<00:03:50.970> good

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
on so you know that's not a very good

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.849 
on so you know that's not a very good
idea<00:03:51.239> but<00:03:52.109> all<00:03:52.199> you<00:03:52.259> have<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.439> do<00:03:52.530> is<00:03:52.620> turn<00:03:52.799> on

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
idea but all you have to do is turn on

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.559 
idea but all you have to do is turn on
your<00:03:52.979> firewall<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.699> if<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.209> want<00:03:54.359> to<00:03:54.419> go<00:03:54.479> in

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
your firewall and if you want to go in

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.809 
your firewall and if you want to go in
front<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:54.900> all<00:03:55.019> options<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:56.009> can<00:03:56.189> see<00:03:56.430> all<00:03:56.639> the

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
front of all options you can see all the

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.849 
front of all options you can see all the
different<00:03:57.180> connections<00:03:57.689> that<00:03:57.930> are<00:03:58.560> allowed

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
different connections that are allowed

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.949 
different connections that are allowed
on<00:03:59.129> your<00:03:59.280> system<00:03:59.639> and<00:03:59.669> you<00:03:59.790> can<00:03:59.969> manage<00:04:00.629> those

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
on your system and you can manage those

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.149 
on your system and you can manage those
from<00:04:01.169> there<00:04:01.319> another<00:04:01.590> one<00:04:01.739> that<00:04:01.889> sounds

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
from there another one that sounds

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.649 
from there another one that sounds
obvious<00:04:02.310> but<00:04:02.639> can<00:04:02.790> really<00:04:02.879> help<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.329> to<00:04:03.509> make

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
obvious but can really help is to make

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.199 
obvious but can really help is to make
sure<00:04:03.689> that<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.109> download<00:04:04.469> apps<00:04:05.459> primarily

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
sure that you download apps primarily

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.149 
sure that you download apps primarily
from<00:04:06.419> the<00:04:06.509> Mac<00:04:06.689> App<00:04:06.930> Store<00:04:07.009> especially<00:04:08.009> if

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
from the Mac App Store especially if

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.349 
from the Mac App Store especially if
you're<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.370> little<00:04:08.489> bit<00:04:08.699> unsure<00:04:08.849> about<00:04:09.150> what

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
you're a little bit unsure about what

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.809 
you're a little bit unsure about what
you're<00:04:09.539> doing<00:04:09.780> in<00:04:10.199> regards<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.680> downloads<00:04:11.189> so

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
you're doing in regards to downloads so

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.580 
you're doing in regards to downloads so
by<00:04:12.359> downloading<00:04:12.930> stuff<00:04:13.109> from<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.409> Mac<00:04:13.560> App

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
by downloading stuff from the Mac App

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.409 
by downloading stuff from the Mac App
Store<00:04:13.829> you<00:04:14.549> can<00:04:14.579> be<00:04:14.729> pretty<00:04:14.909> sure<00:04:15.090> that<00:04:15.120> what

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
Store you can be pretty sure that what

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.240 
Store you can be pretty sure that what
you're<00:04:15.509> downloading<00:04:16.019> is<00:04:16.169> safe<00:04:16.500> because

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
you're downloading is safe because

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.860 
you're downloading is safe because
everything<00:04:17.759> has<00:04:17.909> to<00:04:18.060> go<00:04:18.150> through<00:04:18.329> Apple's<00:04:18.690> App

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
everything has to go through Apple's App

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.569 
everything has to go through Apple's App
Store<00:04:18.900> approval<00:04:19.469> process<00:04:19.919> another<00:04:20.340> nice

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
Store approval process another nice

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.800 
Store approval process another nice
thing<00:04:20.609> that<00:04:20.969> I<00:04:21.030> really<00:04:21.239> recommend<00:04:21.389> for

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
thing that I really recommend for

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.330 
thing that I really recommend for
privacy<00:04:22.199> is<00:04:22.440> downloading<00:04:22.949> a<00:04:22.979> Little<00:04:23.219> Snitch

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
privacy is downloading a Little Snitch

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.100 
privacy is downloading a Little Snitch
so<00:04:23.849> basically<00:04:24.180> what<00:04:24.360> it<00:04:24.479> does<00:04:24.510> is<00:04:24.719> every<00:04:24.960> time

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
so basically what it does is every time

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.080 
so basically what it does is every time
an<00:04:25.349> application<00:04:25.860> tries<00:04:26.130> to

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
an application tries to

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.409 
an application tries to
to<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.389> Internet<00:04:27.690> it'll<00:04:27.990> alert<00:04:28.320> you<00:04:28.560> and

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
to the Internet it'll alert you and

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.670 
to the Internet it'll alert you and
it'll<00:04:30.419> ask<00:04:30.630> you<00:04:30.870> if<00:04:30.990> you<00:04:31.080> really<00:04:31.320> want<00:04:31.470> to<00:04:31.590> do

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
it'll ask you if you really want to do

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.500 
it'll ask you if you really want to do
this<00:04:31.830> depending<00:04:32.669> on<00:04:32.760> what<00:04:32.910> your<00:04:33.000> settings<00:04:33.389> are

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
this depending on what your settings are

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.870 
this depending on what your settings are
of<00:04:33.630> course<00:04:33.810> so<00:04:34.530> this<00:04:34.860> can<00:04:35.070> help<00:04:35.190> with<00:04:35.280> getting

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
of course so this can help with getting

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.570 
of course so this can help with getting
rid<00:04:36.000> of<00:04:36.060> any<00:04:36.240> unwanted<00:04:36.600> connections<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:37.580> it's

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
rid of any unwanted connections and it's

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.640 
rid of any unwanted connections and it's
not<00:04:38.790> a<00:04:38.820> free<00:04:39.090> application<00:04:39.410> but<00:04:40.410> if<00:04:40.500> you're

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
not a free application but if you're

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.170 
not a free application but if you're
really<00:04:40.830> concerned<00:04:41.100> about<00:04:41.220> security<00:04:41.729> I'd<00:04:41.940> say

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
really concerned about security I'd say

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.700 
really concerned about security I'd say
it's<00:04:42.330> definitely<00:04:42.840> worth<00:04:42.960> it<00:04:43.139> I've<00:04:43.290> tried<00:04:43.350> it

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
it's definitely worth it I've tried it

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.200 
it's definitely worth it I've tried it
and<00:04:43.830> it's<00:04:44.040> really<00:04:44.190> helped<00:04:44.490> another<00:04:44.760> thing<00:04:45.030> if

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
and it's really helped another thing if

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.520 
and it's really helped another thing if
you<00:04:45.330> go<00:04:45.449> under<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.690> sharing<00:04:46.199> tab<00:04:46.350> in<00:04:46.500> system

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
you go under the sharing tab in system

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.409 
you go under the sharing tab in system
preferences<00:04:47.040> you<00:04:47.790> might<00:04:47.940> want<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.150> make<00:04:48.300> sure

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
preferences you might want to make sure

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.330 
preferences you might want to make sure
that<00:04:48.540> everything<00:04:49.020> under<00:04:49.199> here<00:04:49.380> that<00:04:49.410> you<00:04:50.040> can

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
that everything under here that you can

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.820 
that everything under here that you can
uncheck<00:04:50.850> is<00:04:51.060> unchecked<00:04:51.540> of<00:04:51.720> course<00:04:52.560> if<00:04:52.740> you

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
uncheck is unchecked of course if you

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.110 
uncheck is unchecked of course if you
use<00:04:53.040> something<00:04:53.340> like<00:04:53.460> screen<00:04:53.790> sharing<00:04:54.030> you

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
use something like screen sharing you

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.820 
use something like screen sharing you
won't<00:04:54.270> want<00:04:54.389> to<00:04:54.449> uncheck<00:04:54.570> it<00:04:54.870> but<00:04:55.500> anything

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
won't want to uncheck it but anything

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.710 
won't want to uncheck it but anything
that's<00:04:55.919> checked<00:04:56.370> that<00:04:56.550> you<00:04:56.669> don't<00:04:56.910> use<00:04:57.120> you

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
that's checked that you don't use you

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.060 
that's checked that you don't use you
can<00:04:57.870> uncheck<00:04:58.260> so<00:04:58.380> that<00:04:58.500> other<00:04:58.620> computers

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
can uncheck so that other computers

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.310 
can uncheck so that other computers
can't<00:04:59.310> connect<00:04:59.639> to<00:04:59.729> your<00:04:59.820> computer<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.419> share

like<00:05:05.490> that<00:05:05.729> now<00:05:06.090> last<00:05:06.330> but<00:05:06.450> not<00:05:06.600> least<00:05:06.840> you<00:05:07.020> can

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
like that now last but not least you can

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.469 
like that now last but not least you can
install<00:05:07.770> antivirus<00:05:08.130> and<00:05:08.639> the<00:05:08.700> reason<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:09.060> save

install antivirus and the reason I save
this<00:05:09.630> for<00:05:09.840> last<00:05:10.020> is<00:05:10.290> because<00:05:10.410> I<00:05:10.590> still<00:05:10.979> believe

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050
