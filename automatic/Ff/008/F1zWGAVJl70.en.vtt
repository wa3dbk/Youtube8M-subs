engaging<00:01:51.760> in<00:01:52.090> technology<00:01:52.720> transfer<00:01:52.900> work

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
engaging in technology transfer work

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.830 
engaging in technology transfer work
with<00:01:53.800> industry<00:01:54.190> so<00:01:54.670> we're<00:01:55.270> trying<00:01:55.480> new

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
with industry so we're trying new

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.450 
with industry so we're trying new
technologies<00:01:56.500> for<00:01:56.710> example<00:01:56.830> we<00:01:57.250> built

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
technologies for example we built

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.000 
technologies for example we built
Australia's<00:01:58.000> first<00:01:58.560> composite<00:01:59.560> passenger

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
Australia's first composite passenger

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.710 
Australia's first composite passenger
structure<00:02:00.460> from<00:02:00.610> a<00:02:00.760> low<00:02:00.880> curing<00:02:01.270> temperature

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
structure from a low curing temperature

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.050 
structure from a low curing temperature
carbon<00:02:02.110> fiber<00:02:02.410> and<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:03.250> do<00:02:03.430> that<00:02:03.610> we<00:02:03.760> have<00:02:03.940> to

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
carbon fiber and to do that we have to

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.730 
carbon fiber and to do that we have to
interact<00:02:04.510> with<00:02:04.570> people<00:02:04.960> like<00:02:05.050> Boeing<00:02:05.530> and

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
interact with people like Boeing and

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.460 
interact with people like Boeing and
General<00:02:06.250> Motors<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:06.880> help<00:02:07.630> us<00:02:07.780> understand<00:02:08.350> the

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
General Motors to help us understand the

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.919 
General Motors to help us understand the
technology<00:02:09.070> and<00:02:09.280> then<00:02:09.520> to<00:02:09.790> work<00:02:10.060> through<00:02:10.420> how

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
technology and then to work through how

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.240 
technology and then to work through how
that<00:02:10.960> may<00:02:11.290> apply<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.860> automotive
