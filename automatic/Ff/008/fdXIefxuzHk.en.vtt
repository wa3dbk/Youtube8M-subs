00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.319
 so I made a pattern for trousers 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:14.429
 Now I am explaining what sizes 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:16.320
 need to remove and how to build it and and so 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.690
 Pattern of pants you can take in 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.630
 online to see approximate 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.310
 form nothing here in principle difficult 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.189
 no, that is, you can even take this one 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.429
 pattern and just substitute sizes 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.669
 which we only need 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.440
 as if from this form I made 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.140
 slight change i mean i raised 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.079
 here is this line since it made it straight 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.390
 since this knitwear he stretches it 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.110
 Pattern made for fabric fabric 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.469
 It has this property as it were drag 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.230
 and therefore here this line is necessary 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.870
 must be strict enough and so on 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.090
 image and likeness I made a pattern 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.850
 that is, I got this here 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.910
 form and now i have made desalination what 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:09.299
 sizes we will need to be removed and how they are 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:11.670
 mark on this pattern and so what 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.060
 the sizes we need first we 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.830
 I will need a waist size pattern 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.990
 made on a child but with small 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.320
 adding i mean i already adding 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.720
 as if I will explain 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.689
 where what size is marked so volume 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.170
 waist 60 centimeters 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.200
 Naturally half is one leg from 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.420
 trousers half will be 30 that is I think that 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.360
 that's understandable further 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.909
 thigh volume 36 centimeters this is this 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.729
 line that is, you will need to measure your foot in 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.200
 the thickest and and parts that is the top 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.310
 I got 36 centimeters 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.280
 accordingly, this one 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.840
 a rectangle gives us a distance of 30 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.909
 cm 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.369
 you must be on the back a little bit 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.899
 more so like dad and u 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.000
 I will get this here 2 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.820
 size you are here two centimeters here 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.789
 four centimeters behind me will 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.239
 4 centimeters in front of 2 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.340
 centimeters here these lines 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:20.870
 build right 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:23.060
 we will need the length of the trousers then 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.760
 there you choose yourself I took 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.269
 as if with a large margin that is me 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.040
 length 80 centimeters and a single 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.019
 what is left here is to count these 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.480
 two sizes 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:38.959
 I took the size of the old that is put 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:43.160
 trousers and with that I measured this one 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:46.040
 the size that is the line here is the back 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.230
 and proceeding from it, that is, I have 24 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.220
 about a centimeter is obtained here 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.450
 23 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.370
 here you can count on a triangle 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.440
 as if quite a simple formula 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.870
 there is a sum of squares of the legs is equal 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.900
 squared hypotenuse i.e. approximate 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.030
 here is a triangle from this formula 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:09.349
 it turns out that this height is approximately 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.890
 23 centimeters can measure it on the side 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.079
 eye 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.610
 Again I say that because he's knitwear 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.720
 there may be a little 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.109
 error 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.670
 even up to two centimeters 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:23.959
 respectively from here this length I have 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.470
 it turns out here is a side height of 23 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:30.230
 centimeter and remaining length 57 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.340
 centimeters that is all that in 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.670
 principle need 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.190
 and below the width of the pants on 30 centimeters 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.940
 I took that is to have them 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.329
 wide enough here actually 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.510
 and now we are all on this cry 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.510
 to knit
