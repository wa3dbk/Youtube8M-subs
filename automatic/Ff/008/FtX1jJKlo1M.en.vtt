 hello sir cédric so today 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.790
 a very simple little recipe a little 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.830
 aperitif improvises we have pros but we 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.990
 do not have the mayo what do we do 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.890
 the plane for mayo we need a 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:26.089
 egg a little bit of salt of course 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.220
 mustard and oil so we have 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.919
 already took the bet off we know by the 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.480
 yellow white 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.620
 important thing we must all 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.059
 ingredients are at temperature 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.410
 ambient a misstep get them out of the fresh 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.470
 have to wait about ten minutes 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.420
 that all that warms no egg 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.800
 we take mustard cupboard I 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:51.380
 take roughly the equivalent of yellow 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:55.760
 Suede egg around a single 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.350
 little pinch of salt a little scene 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.840
 is a little pepper 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.640
 I take gray pepper like that 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.850
 made of pepper nuts we tend to see 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.470
 cases already too 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.780
 all this can be mixed with a 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.310
 fork or a fool is good for a 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.289
 practical question in equipping yourself with a 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:18.799
 little jogging a little faster and so 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.929
 we will incorporate line from this 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.189
 that there is more classic 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:26.450
 I put a little niche is 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.840
 as those see here and we start to 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.840
 mix 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.630
 we're waiting for him to look good 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.290
 do not hesitate to take aprons because 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.640
 that it squirts a little lille dairy 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:50.130
 a little bit 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.130

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.660
