00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
in terms of the team anymore he does

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.110 
in terms of the team anymore he does
decently<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.530> terms<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.860> tackling<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:50.760> you

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
decently in terms of tackling but as you

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.970 
decently in terms of tackling but as you
saw<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> last<00:00:51.570> episode<00:00:51.780> his<00:00:52.350> passing

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
saw in the last episode his passing

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.010

after<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.520> tackles<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.239> his<00:00:54.420> movement<00:00:54.899> after

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
after the tackles and his movement after

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.959 
after the tackles and his movement after
the<00:00:55.170> tackles<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.890> pretty<00:00:56.430> horrific

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
the tackles is pretty horrific

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.479
