test 10 doesn't look good at all from
your<00:04:59.500> Adam<00:05:01.770> you<00:05:02.770> see<00:05:02.980> here<00:05:03.310> it<00:05:03.700> looks<00:05:04.060> like<00:05:04.180> it

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
your Adam you see here it looks like it

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.560 
your Adam you see here it looks like it
really<00:05:04.540> took<00:05:04.810> a<00:05:04.990> good<00:05:05.380> chunk<00:05:05.440> out<00:05:05.980> of<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.160> eye

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
really took a good chunk out of the eye

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.270 
really took a good chunk out of the eye
you<00:05:07.570> can<00:05:08.320> see<00:05:08.530> that<00:05:08.650> there<00:05:08.860> didn't<00:05:09.160> actually

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
you can see that there didn't actually

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.820 
you can see that there didn't actually
go<00:05:09.520> through<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:09.970> but<00:05:10.750> I'd<00:05:11.200> say<00:05:11.440> that<00:05:11.650> that

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
go through it but I'd say that that

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.010 
go through it but I'd say that that
would<00:05:12.070> definitely<00:05:12.280> be<00:05:12.580> a<00:05:12.760> least<00:05:13.750> semi

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
would definitely be a least semi

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.170 
would definitely be a least semi
blinding<00:05:14.820> of<00:05:15.820> course<00:05:16.150> so<00:05:17.400> now<00:05:18.400> we'll<00:05:18.610> put<00:05:19.030> this

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
blinding of course so now we'll put this

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.910 
blinding of course so now we'll put this
say<00:05:19.420> my<00:05:19.630> back<00:05:19.840> in<00:05:20.080> but<00:05:20.290> we'll<00:05:20.410> try<00:05:20.590> it<00:05:20.680> with<00:05:20.890> the

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
say my back in but we'll try it with the

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:34.380 
say my back in but we'll try it with the
