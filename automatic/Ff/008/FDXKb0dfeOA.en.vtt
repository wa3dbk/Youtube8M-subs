00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.710 
okay
and<00:01:10.189> we<00:01:11.189> hold<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> thumb<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.630> index

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
and we hold with the thumb and the index

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.289 
and we hold with the thumb and the index
finger<00:01:13.080> we<00:01:13.710> cover<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.460> lines<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.119> way

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
finger we cover the lines so the way

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.210 
finger we cover the lines so the way
they<00:01:15.479> don't<00:01:15.659> see<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.080> bill<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.619> folded<00:01:17.070> in

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
they don't see that bill is folded in

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.990 
they don't see that bill is folded in
one<00:01:18.090> extra<00:01:18.390> time<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.890> once<00:01:20.130> once<00:01:20.549> they<00:01:20.700> fold

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
one extra time so once once they fold

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.700 
one extra time so once once they fold
their<00:01:21.060> billing<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> half<00:01:21.960> then<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.380> ask<00:01:22.530> them

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
their billing the half then we ask them

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.530 
their billing the half then we ask them
to<00:01:22.770> fold<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> bill<00:01:23.430> again<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> half<00:01:24.270> like

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
to fold the bill again in the half like

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.289 
to fold the bill again in the half like
this<00:01:24.570> like<00:01:25.049> we<00:01:25.290> shape<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.520> then<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.729> take<00:01:27.030> it

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
this like we shape and then we take it

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.550 
this like we shape and then we take it
and<00:01:27.479> place<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.530> $20<00:01:29.070> bill<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.790> top

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
and place it on the $20 bill on the top

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.190 
and place it on the $20 bill on the top
so<00:01:31.560> now<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.950> looks<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.960> top<00:01:34.170> of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
so now it looks like it's on the top of

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.249 
so now it looks like it's on the top of
20<00:01:34.590> dollar<00:01:34.770> bill<00:01:35.009> right<00:01:35.479> but<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.659> reality<00:01:36.840> it's

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
20 dollar bill right but in reality it's

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.690 
20 dollar bill right but in reality it's
not<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> top<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.420> slide<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
not on the top it's like we slide the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.520 
not on the top it's like we slide the
downside<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.729> five<00:01:42.119> dollar<00:01:42.360> bill<00:01:42.659> under<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
downside of five dollar bill under the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.550 
downside of five dollar bill under the
pocket<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.729> upper<00:01:45.000> side<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.270> covering<00:01:46.020> it

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
pocket and the upper side is covering it

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.490 
pocket and the upper side is covering it
so<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:47.250> creates<00:01:48.000> an<00:01:48.149> illusion<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:48.899> on

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
so it creates an illusion that it's on

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.539 
so it creates an illusion that it's on
the<00:01:49.740> top<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.100> 20<00:01:50.399> dollar<00:01:50.579> bill<00:01:50.850> right<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.619> we

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the top of 20 dollar bill right so we

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.310 
the top of 20 dollar bill right so we
can<00:01:53.700> show<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.060> also<00:01:54.390> from<00:01:54.630> behind<00:01:54.930> so

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
can show it also from behind so

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.230 
can show it also from behind so
I'm<00:01:56.470> covering<00:01:57.010> this<00:01:57.280> area<00:01:57.460> we<00:01:57.760> did<00:01:57.910> index

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
I'm covering this area we did index

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.070 
I'm covering this area we did index
