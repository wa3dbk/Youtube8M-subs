00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.609
 no 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.710
 nothing 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.070
 but 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.330
 it is 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.530
 no 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.190
 on the dark side of the caf 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.540
 I 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.300
 simply confirms how much 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.270
 to say like that I saw the guy I had 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.870
 and I saw my opponent was 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.030
 director 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:02.050
 I am confident what can I say 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.680
 trust makes seems a good start in 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.600
 half hue 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.360
 I wear my acceleration from to 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:19.390
 m never anyone came back on my 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:21.570
 experience I'm terrified dead of 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.570
 funk 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.549
 g 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:51.260
 prognosis in my opinion a living a dead 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.880
 but say so it depends so if vincent 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.040
 jump on yannick I give cheap of 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.890
 yannick but if yannick happens to get 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.040
 sneak and left no bin to 9 years 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.040
 luck 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.179
 Oh yes 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.030
 m 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.299
 I 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.040
 good 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.210
 and 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.780
 it is true 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.350
 listen thanks the revenues are that 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.749
 we are not quite 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.749
 about skull 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.790
 thereby 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.780
 it sounds better 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.270
 2 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.850

 of his sport and especially to have me 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:48.139
