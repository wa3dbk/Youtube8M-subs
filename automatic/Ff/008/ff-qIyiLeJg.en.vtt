00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
on I'm not just going to focus on the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.510 
on I'm not just going to focus on the
game<00:00:30.689> right<00:00:30.869> now<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.679> probe<00:00:32.009> coming<00:00:32.369> so

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
game right now and this probe coming so

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.970 
game right now and this probe coming so
already<00:00:32.730> here<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.329> base<00:00:33.600> I'm<00:00:34.140> probably

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
already here in the base I'm probably

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.650 
already here in the base I'm probably
gonna<00:00:35.160> put<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.520> pile<00:00:35.790> on<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.210> wonder<00:00:36.420> if<00:00:36.540> it's

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
gonna put on a pile on I wonder if it's

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.869 
gonna put on a pile on I wonder if it's
assume<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.370> probably<00:00:38.370> there's<00:00:38.579> only<00:00:38.670> two

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
assume you probably there's only two

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.880 
assume you probably there's only two
choices<00:00:39.059> basically<00:00:39.600> one<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> doog<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.620> rush

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
choices basically one is a doog a rush

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.030 
choices basically one is a doog a rush
and<00:00:41.070> two<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:42.290> cannon<00:00:43.290> rush<00:00:43.469> other<00:00:43.710> however

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
and two is the cannon rush other however

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.709 
and two is the cannon rush other however
I<00:00:44.190> mean<00:00:44.489> these<00:00:44.579> guys<00:00:44.640> are<00:00:44.969> pro<00:00:45.149> players<00:00:45.450> I

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
I mean these guys are pro players I

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.319 
I mean these guys are pro players I
don't<00:00:46.289> think<00:00:46.469> they're<00:00:46.559> gonna<00:00:46.649> go<00:00:47.399> cheezy<00:00:48.149> and

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
don't think they're gonna go cheezy and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.880 
don't think they're gonna go cheezy and
a<00:00:48.390> cannon<00:00:48.719> rush<00:00:48.930> chris<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.260> very<00:00:49.440> very<00:00:49.590> cheesy

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
a cannon rush chris is very very cheesy

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.910 
a cannon rush chris is very very cheesy
so<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.969> probably<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.390> going<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.690> as<00:00:51.870> well<00:00:52.140> two

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
so this probably is going on as well two

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.270 
so this probably is going on as well two
socks<00:00:53.610> basis<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.239> hear<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:55.379> boo<00:00:55.649> pilot<00:00:56.129> almost

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
socks basis I hear that boo pilot almost

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.740 
socks basis I hear that boo pilot almost
and<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.699> we'll<00:00:56.850> see<00:00:56.969> what<00:00:57.090> he<00:00:57.180> does<00:00:57.210> after<00:00:57.480> that

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
and so we'll see what he does after that

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.979 
and so we'll see what he does after that
pylon<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.699> not<00:00:59.699> pinning<00:00:59.910> domini<00:01:00.210> probes<00:01:00.449> as

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
pylon and not pinning domini probes as

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.280 
pylon and not pinning domini probes as
he<00:01:01.199> only<00:01:01.469> has<00:01:01.920> about<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.910> total<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.420> nine<00:01:03.449> probes

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
he only has about a total of nine probes

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.740 
he only has about a total of nine probes
so<00:01:05.040> nine<00:01:05.430> probes<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.240> number<00:01:06.450> right

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
so nine probes that is the number right

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.690 
so nine probes that is the number right
now<00:01:06.810> now<00:01:07.439> he's<00:01:07.740> actually<00:01:07.920> making<00:01:08.189> more<00:01:08.430> probes

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
now now he's actually making more probes

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.950 
now now he's actually making more probes
so<00:01:08.850> he's<00:01:09.119> going<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> make<00:01:09.390> more<00:01:09.510> probes<00:01:09.780> and

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
so he's going to make more probes and

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.810 
so he's going to make more probes and
this<00:01:10.530> guy<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.710> gonna<00:01:11.010> come<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.580> he's

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
this guy is gonna come in here and he's

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.250 
this guy is gonna come in here and he's
wondering<00:01:12.180> where<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.630> gained<00:01:13.110> weight

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
wondering where is that gained weight

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.140 
wondering where is that gained weight
and<00:01:13.439> where<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.740> pile<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.970> now<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
and where is that pile on but now the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.179 
and where is that pile on but now the
Gateway<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.720> actually<00:01:15.930> coming<00:01:15.990> inside<00:01:16.500> hot

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
Gateway it's actually coming inside hot

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.399 
Gateway it's actually coming inside hot
space<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.700> how<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:17.939> actually<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.659> bit<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
space so how can actually a bit of a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.140 
space so how can actually a bit of a
trouble<00:01:19.650> here<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.009> did<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.759> see<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.030> you

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
trouble here as I did you see that you

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.399 
trouble here as I did you see that you
see<00:01:21.180> what<00:01:21.390> he<00:01:21.450> did<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.659> he<00:01:21.810> actually<00:01:21.960> moved<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
see what he did it he actually moved the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.620 
see what he did it he actually moved the
probe<00:01:22.650> via<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.040> then<00:01:23.189> move<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.460> up<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:24.390> like

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
probe via and then move it up just like

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.120 
probe via and then move it up just like
he's<00:01:24.810> actually<00:01:24.960> scouting<00:01:25.530> from<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> bottom

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
he's actually scouting from the bottom

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.130 
he's actually scouting from the bottom
instead<00:01:26.369> coming<00:01:26.820> from<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> left<00:01:27.090> side<00:01:27.450> very

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
instead coming from the left side very

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.590 
instead coming from the left side very
very<00:01:28.320> sneaky<00:01:28.590> by<00:01:28.979> sock<00:01:29.250> here<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.360> probe

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
very sneaky by sock here so this probe

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.940 
very sneaky by sock here so this probe
didn't<00:01:30.900> see<00:01:31.049> anything<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.560> now<00:01:31.680> he<00:01:31.770> is

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
didn't see anything so now he is

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.289 
didn't see anything so now he is
actually<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.430> where<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.090> gateway

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
actually just like where is that gateway

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.700 
actually just like where is that gateway
and<00:01:33.509> I'm<00:01:33.630> sure<00:01:33.780> he's<00:01:34.079> really<00:01:34.380> worried<00:01:34.680> right

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
and I'm sure he's really worried right

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.530 
and I'm sure he's really worried right
now<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.280> now<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.670> never<00:01:35.970> gain<00:01:36.210> weight<00:01:36.329> going

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
now and now I never gain weight going

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.330 
now and now I never gain weight going
down<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:36.900> for<00:01:37.079> sock<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.799> two<00:01:38.009> guys<00:01:38.159> are<00:01:38.310> going

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
down here for sock so two guys are going

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.649 
down here for sock so two guys are going
to<00:01:38.520> go<00:01:38.579> up<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.850> two<00:01:39.030> guys<00:01:39.180> are<00:01:39.299> actually<00:01:39.420> going

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
to go up in two guys are actually going

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.080 
to go up in two guys are actually going
up<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.130> Hawk<00:01:41.130> as<00:01:41.369> well<00:01:41.549> however<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.939> don't

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
up for Hawk as well however I don't

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.219 
up for Hawk as well however I don't
think<00:01:42.210> these<00:01:42.450> two<00:01:42.600> kids<00:01:42.720> are<00:01:42.840> going<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.079> as

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
think these two kids are going to be as

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.350 
think these two kids are going to be as
fast<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.340> first<00:01:44.579> one<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.850> almost<00:01:45.119> done

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
fast as that first one is almost done

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.030 
fast as that first one is almost done
here<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.689> that's<00:01:45.810> not<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> no<00:01:46.380> doubt<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:46.860> only

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
here and that's not a no doubt it's only

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.289 
here and that's not a no doubt it's only
gets<00:01:47.159> trying<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.579> get<00:01:47.670> Colonel<00:01:47.850> booted<00:01:48.210> out

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
gets trying to get Colonel booted out

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.480 
gets trying to get Colonel booted out
here<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.740> there<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.009> that's<00:01:50.189> all<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.460> is

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
here and there it is that's all it is

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.270 
here and there it is that's all it is
going<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.729> come<00:01:50.850> out<00:01:50.880> very<00:01:51.210> very<00:01:51.360> soon<00:01:51.570> here

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
going to come out very very soon here

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.410 
going to come out very very soon here
and<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.490> probe<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.850> trying<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.240> stop

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
and that probe is trying to stop

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.609 
and that probe is trying to stop
whatever<00:01:54.659> if<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.290> as<00:01:55.409> much

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
whatever if you can and do as much

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.410 
whatever if you can and do as much
damage<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:57.090> these<00:01:57.240> guys

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
damage as you can and that these guys

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.660 
damage as you can and that these guys
actually<00:01:57.719> trying<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.320> another<00:01:59.189> found<00:01:59.460> going

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
actually trying to another found going

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.639 
actually trying to another found going
down<00:01:59.790> here<00:01:59.969> for<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> hug<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.469> could

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
down here for a hug and that this could

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.410 
down here for a hug and that this could
be<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.799> see<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.950> very<00:02:02.130> quick<00:02:02.579> game<00:02:02.820> here<00:02:03.000> because

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
be I see a very quick game here because

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.600 
be I see a very quick game here because
this<00:02:04.020> x<00:02:04.500> ella<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:04.920> all<00:02:05.100> right<00:02:05.130> now<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.490> then

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
this x ella it's all right now and then

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.980 
this x ella it's all right now and then
what<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.880> coming<00:02:06.119> out<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.540> gave<00:02:06.719> me<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
what is coming out and that gave me the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.029 
what is coming out and that gave me the
second<00:02:07.229> game<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.409> almost<00:02:07.530> finished<00:02:07.770> or<00:02:07.920> this

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
second game is almost finished or this

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.949 
second game is almost finished or this
guy<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.670> coming<00:02:09.060> here<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.360> what<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.780> he<00:02:09.840> going

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
guy is coming here and what is he going

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.240 
guy is coming here and what is he going
to<00:02:10.020> kill<00:02:10.170> he's<00:02:10.379> going<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.649> straight<00:02:11.009> for<00:02:11.190> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
to kill he's going to straight for the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.190 
to kill he's going to straight for the
probe<00:02:11.459> line<00:02:11.640> at<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.270> cell

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
probe line at the cell

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.360 
probe line at the cell
it's<00:02:13.379> almost<00:02:13.500> going<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.860> surround<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.250> there

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
it's almost going to surround it there

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.800 
it's almost going to surround it there
yet<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.849> need<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.090> run<00:02:15.270> out<00:02:15.390> up<00:02:15.480> there<00:02:15.569> we<00:02:15.720> go

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
yet you need to run out up there we go

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.869 
yet you need to run out up there we go
he<00:02:15.930> does<00:02:16.080> right<00:02:16.290> out<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.440> there<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.879> actually

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
he does right out of there and actually

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.880 
he does right out of there and actually
hockey<00:02:18.360> or<00:02:18.450> actually<00:02:18.720> microwave<00:02:19.620> one<00:02:19.769> of

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
hockey or actually microwave one of

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.320 
hockey or actually microwave one of
these<00:02:20.010> probes<00:02:20.280> but<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:21.030> Ellie<00:02:21.180> is

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
these probes but this is Ellie is

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.820 
these probes but this is Ellie is
actually<00:02:21.599> kind<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.780> get<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:21.989> trouble<00:02:22.290> but<00:02:22.470> this

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
actually kind of get in trouble but this

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.110 
actually kind of get in trouble but this
probably<00:02:23.129> doing<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.370> good<00:02:23.489> job<00:02:23.550> at<00:02:23.670> protecting

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
probably doing a good job at protecting

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.150 
probably doing a good job at protecting
the<00:02:24.450> zealot<00:02:24.720> but<00:02:25.110> now<00:02:25.230> there<00:02:25.440> are<00:02:25.470> two<00:02:25.560> women

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
the zealot but now there are two women

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.320 
the zealot but now there are two women
they<00:02:26.280> are<00:02:26.370> going<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.550> go<00:02:26.670> straight<00:02:26.970> for<00:02:27.180> this

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
they are going to go straight for this

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.449 
they are going to go straight for this
probe<00:02:27.540> line<00:02:27.750> here<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.739> one<00:02:28.920> cell<00:02:29.099> is<00:02:29.310> out

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
probe line here and that one cell is out

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.309 
probe line here and that one cell is out
for<00:02:29.610> hockey<00:02:29.940> or<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.120> very<00:02:30.300> intense<00:02:30.660> battle<00:02:31.019> in

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
for hockey or a very intense battle in

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.900 
for hockey or a very intense battle in
the<00:02:31.530> probe<00:02:31.739> line<00:02:31.920> but<00:02:32.280> right<00:02:32.430> now<00:02:32.550> this<00:02:32.730> has

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
the probe line but right now this has

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.390 
the probe line but right now this has
got<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.120> be<00:02:33.239> bad<00:02:33.480> for<00:02:33.690> hot<00:02:33.810> as<00:02:34.130> these<00:02:35.130> probes

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
got to be bad for hot as these probes

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.009 
got to be bad for hot as these probes
are<00:02:35.550> not<00:02:35.790> mining<00:02:36.330> as<00:02:36.450> much<00:02:36.690> as<00:02:36.810> they<00:02:36.989> should

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
are not mining as much as they should

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.339 
are not mining as much as they should
and<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:39.000> Sox<00:02:39.239> still<00:02:39.450> getting<00:02:39.750> more<00:02:39.959> zealots

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
and so Sox still getting more zealots

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.500 
and so Sox still getting more zealots
are<00:02:40.610> currently<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:41.849> no<00:02:41.970> he<00:02:42.120> does<00:02:42.239> have<00:02:42.390> one

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
are currently so no he does have one

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.330 
are currently so no he does have one
problem<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:43.049> thousands<00:02:43.319> attacking<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:44.220> he's

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
problem to thousands attacking and he's
