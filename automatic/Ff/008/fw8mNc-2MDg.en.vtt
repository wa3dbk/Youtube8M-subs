00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.170
 our bc is our apple device 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.780
 are connected to the same network and 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.430
 then with the reflector software that 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.890
 is free for seven days and which 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.900
 costs $ 13 in full version and well 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.300
 you will be able to have your screen 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.340
 iphone on your pc screen and why 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.720
 not filmed from above with for example 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.320
 camtasia as I am trying 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.870
 save 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.399
 so here you choose either for mac 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.780
 either for windows you download the 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.360
 trial version then you can 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.920
 buy it if you like it and then 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.750
 well I 'm going to launch my software 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.210
 so he's right here I'm going to throw him 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.129
 in the start menu like that and he 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.360
 there is no special interface we're going all 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.090
 just go on our device 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.920
 apple and we will click on airplay so 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.670
 not all devices are airplay 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.559
 but normally 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.660
 here you see my iphone screen so 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.789
 I have the iphone 5 which he understands 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.500
 airplay but for example for ipod 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.360
 first generation there first 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.460
 iphone i think the iphone 4 does it 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.649
 do not and well here's where I was 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.110
 in the control center I was clicking 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.789
 here and instead of ticking my iphone and 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.890
 I checked the name of my computer 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.780
 it must of course that the video mirroring 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.149
 be cochet just below that's you 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.280
 see here because if I remove it here 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.770
 we have nothing left so the jda reactivates and 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.100
 so here is it going to allow you to 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.080
 fly well 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.790
 your iphone with your finger and you 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.049
 can see on the screen the iphone is 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.610
 also on the pc screen 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.070
 so as I said you can 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.869
 always recorded with for example a 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.909
 capture software like hits under 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.340
 like tasiast or else well you 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.720
 smoke the screen just from the iphone like that 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.970
 you make videos on youtube without 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.680
 problem so here I hope this 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.670
 little trick you have enjoyed free 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.009
