00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.959 

you'll<00:00:55.469> see<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.829> all<00:00:55.980> these<00:00:56.160> three<00:00:56.520> notes<00:00:56.699> go

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
you'll see that all these three notes go

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.779 
you'll see that all these three notes go
together<00:00:57.329> well<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.280> you're<00:00:59.280> simply<00:00:59.579> going<00:00:59.730> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
together well and you're simply going to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.540 
together well and you're simply going to
slide<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.329> down<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.960> here<00:01:01.620> only<00:01:01.859> when<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.399> get

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
slide it down to here only when you get

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.369 
slide it down to here only when you get
to<00:01:02.699> here<00:01:03.000> you're<00:01:03.149> going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.449> lift<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.870> your

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
to here you're going to lift up your

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.670 
to here you're going to lift up your
third<00:01:04.890> finger<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:06.200> you're<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> pick<00:01:07.650> it

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
third finger and you're going to pick it

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.910 
third finger and you're going to pick it
like<00:01:08.100> this

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
like this

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.810 
like this

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.030

so<00:01:14.810> you<00:01:15.170> could<00:01:15.380> basically<00:01:15.560> going<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:15.950> be

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
so you could basically going to be

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.150 
so you could basically going to be
hitting<00:01:16.250> all<00:01:16.550> three<00:01:17.210> strings

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
hitting all three strings

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.810 
hitting all three strings
[Music]

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.320 

so<00:01:23.820> that's<00:01:24.000> basically<00:01:24.420> how<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.080> intro<00:01:25.680> goes

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
so that's basically how that intro goes

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.570 
so that's basically how that intro goes

[Music]

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.070 
[Music]
then<00:01:29.580> you<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.850> do<00:01:29.940> a<00:01:29.970> little<00:01:30.330> hammer<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.810> pull

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
then you can do a little hammer and pull

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.800 
then you can do a little hammer and pull
right<00:01:31.320> there<00:01:31.610> then<00:01:32.610> go<00:01:32.910> to<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.120> a<00:01:33.150> string

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.570 

with<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.960> first<00:01:38.320> and<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.650> second<00:01:39.040> finger<00:01:39.189> on

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
with the first and the second finger on

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.440 
with the first and the second finger on
the<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.970> string<00:01:40.119> first<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.080> second<00:01:41.439> fret<00:01:41.619> and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
the a string first and second fret and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.350 
the a string first and second fret and
from<00:01:43.450> here<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.990> can<00:01:44.200> simply<00:01:44.500> go<00:01:44.860> into<00:01:45.070> your<00:01:45.399> B

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
from here you can simply go into your B

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.960 
from here you can simply go into your B
chord

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.360 

so<00:01:50.660> putting<00:01:51.080> it<00:01:51.230> all<00:01:51.350> together<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:51.950> goes<00:01:52.100> like

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
so putting it all together it goes like

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:04.600 
so putting it all together it goes like
this<00:01:59.860> you<00:02:00.860> notice<00:02:01.220> then<00:02:01.460> I<00:02:01.580> did<00:02:03.220> and<00:02:04.220> we'll<00:02:04.460> go

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
this you notice then I did and we'll go

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.530 
this you notice then I did and we'll go
into<00:02:04.790> that<00:02:04.910> more<00:02:05.270> in<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:05.840> next<00:02:06.050> section
