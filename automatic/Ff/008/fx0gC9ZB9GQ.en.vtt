gallon<00:00:11.630> oceanic<00:00:12.630> bio<00:00:12.870> cube<00:00:13.910> you<00:00:14.910> could<00:00:15.059> tell

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
gallon oceanic bio cube you could tell

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.290 
gallon oceanic bio cube you could tell
the<00:00:15.540> back<00:00:15.750> top<00:00:16.590> cover<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.220> propped<00:00:17.730> up<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.150> can

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
the back top cover is propped up you can

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.849 
the back top cover is propped up you can
see<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.630> lights<00:00:18.869> they're<00:00:19.350> propped<00:00:19.650> up

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
see the lights they're propped up

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.580 
see the lights they're propped up
against<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> wall<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:21.150> as<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:22.050> move<00:00:22.289> in

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
against the wall and as we move in

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.679 
against the wall and as we move in
closer<00:00:24.230> this<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.289> inside<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.130> tank<00:00:26.660> you<00:00:27.660> have

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
closer this is inside the tank you have

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.849 
closer this is inside the tank you have
a<00:00:27.960> lower<00:00:28.640> intake<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.939> an<00:00:30.779> upper<00:00:31.170> intake<00:00:31.529> vent

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
a lower intake and an upper intake vent

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.130 
a lower intake and an upper intake vent
the<00:00:32.790> water<00:00:33.030> flows<00:00:33.480> through<00:00:33.870> these<00:00:34.500> two<00:00:35.030> vents

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
the water flows through these two vents

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.069 
the water flows through these two vents
it<00:00:37.140> goes<00:00:37.380> into<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.070> back<00:00:38.600> into<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.750> area

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
it goes into the back into this area

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.060 
it goes into the back into this area
back<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:41.239> then<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.450> goes<00:00:42.600> through<00:00:43.070> this

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
back here then it goes through this

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.990 
back here then it goes through this
physical<00:00:44.579> filter<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:47.000> a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
physical filter and this is just a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.470 
physical filter and this is just a
screen<00:00:48.719> with<00:00:48.930> some<00:00:48.960> activated<00:00:49.860> carbon<00:00:50.480> inside

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
screen with some activated carbon inside

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.110 
screen with some activated carbon inside
and<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.469> activated<00:00:53.160> carbon<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.760> want<00:00:53.969> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
and that activated carbon you want to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.959 
and that activated carbon you want to
replace<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.930> every<00:00:55.050> month<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.640> takes<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
replace it every month it just takes a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.639 
replace it every month it just takes a
yellow<00:00:57.180> tinge<00:00:57.570> out<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> water<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.500> make

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
yellow tinge out of the water to make

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.400 
yellow tinge out of the water to make
your<00:00:58.800> water<00:00:59.010> clearer<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.199> want<00:01:01.350> to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
your water clearer so you want to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.950 
your water clearer so you want to
replace<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.890> every<00:01:02.160> month<00:01:02.570> then<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.750> water

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
replace that every month then the water

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.539 
replace that every month then the water
flows<00:01:04.229> from<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.100> screen<00:01:05.430> into<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.689> area

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
flows from the screen into the area

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.179 
flows from the screen into the area
where<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> bio<00:01:08.939> balls<00:01:09.299> are<00:01:09.799> these<00:01:10.799> are<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
where the bio balls are these are the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.820 
where the bio balls are these are the
bio<00:01:11.369> balls<00:01:12.080> these<00:01:13.080> bio<00:01:13.470> balls<00:01:15.259> basically<00:01:16.259> just

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
bio balls these bio balls basically just

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.429 
bio balls these bio balls basically just
provides<00:01:17.250> your<00:01:17.549> tank<00:01:17.850> with<00:01:18.299> more<00:01:18.630> filtration

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
provides your tank with more filtration

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.609 
provides your tank with more filtration
surface<00:01:19.950> area<00:01:21.049> you'll<00:01:22.049> have<00:01:22.290> helpful

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
surface area you'll have helpful

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.550

bacteria<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.759> grow<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.299> these<00:01:24.540> they<00:01:25.320> work

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
bacteria that grow on these they work

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.280 
bacteria that grow on these they work
with<00:01:25.830> live<00:01:26.159> rock<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.880> help<00:01:27.090> filter<00:01:27.450> ammonia

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
with live rock to help filter ammonia

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.080 
with live rock to help filter ammonia
from<00:01:28.500> your<00:01:28.680> system<00:01:30.710> now<00:01:31.710> I'm<00:01:32.250> going<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.970> be

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
from your system now I'm going to be

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.039 
from your system now I'm going to be
using<00:01:33.479> live<00:01:34.470> rock<00:01:34.860> rubble<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.540> system

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
using live rock rubble in this system

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.410 
using live rock rubble in this system
because<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.009> find<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.549> little<00:01:39.030> bit<00:01:39.210> more

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
because I find it's a little bit more

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.679 
because I find it's a little bit more
efficient<00:01:40.020> at<00:01:40.200> filtering<00:01:40.799> however<00:01:41.759> bio<00:01:42.270> balls

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
efficient at filtering however bio balls

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.469 
efficient at filtering however bio balls
are<00:01:43.020> excellent<00:01:43.619> they<00:01:43.829> do<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.009> great<00:01:44.310> job<00:01:44.610> you

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
are excellent they do a great job you

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.469 
are excellent they do a great job you
might<00:01:45.630> want<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.990> clean<00:01:46.290> them<00:01:46.880> once<00:01:47.880> every<00:01:48.210> six

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
might want to clean them once every six

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.460 
might want to clean them once every six
months<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.049> put<00:01:50.009> them<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.909> salt<00:01:51.810> fresh<00:01:52.110> salt

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
months you put them in a salt fresh salt

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.969 
months you put them in a salt fresh salt
water<00:01:52.710> bath<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:54.119> shake<00:01:54.689> them<00:01:54.899> around<00:01:55.170> to

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
water bath and just shake them around to

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.399 
water bath and just shake them around to
get<00:01:56.159> rid<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.340> detritus<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.960> don't<00:01:58.140> want

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
get rid of detritus but you don't want

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.260 
get rid of detritus but you don't want
to<00:01:58.560> clean<00:01:59.219> them<00:01:59.369> with<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.579> brush<00:01:59.880> or<00:02:00.030> anything

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
to clean them with a brush or anything

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.700 
to clean them with a brush or anything
because<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.750> will<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:01.020> rid<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.500> good

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
because that will get rid of the good

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.679 
because that will get rid of the good
beneficial<00:02:02.250> bacteria<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.299> have<00:02:03.450> built

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
beneficial bacteria that you have built

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.859 
beneficial bacteria that you have built
up<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.860> vile<00:02:05.520> balls<00:02:05.880> these<00:02:06.180> are<00:02:06.360> great<00:02:06.630> you

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
up so vile balls these are great you

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.479 
up so vile balls these are great you
don't<00:02:07.259> want<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.439> clean<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.829> all<00:02:07.979> at<00:02:08.069> once<00:02:08.250> you

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
don't want to clean it all at once you

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.130 
don't want to clean it all at once you
want<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.789> clean<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.239> little<00:02:09.629> bit<00:02:09.840> at<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.110> time

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
want to clean it a little bit at a time

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.640 
want to clean it a little bit at a time
because<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.890> want<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.510> marine<00:02:12.510> environment

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
because you want the marine environment

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.110 
because you want the marine environment
you<00:02:13.860> want<00:02:14.099> just<00:02:14.310> want<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.549> make<00:02:14.700> small<00:02:15.090> changes

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
you want just want to make small changes

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.420 
you want just want to make small changes
to<00:02:15.599> it<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:15.989> maybe<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.290> handful<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.739> balls<00:02:17.069> at<00:02:17.310> a

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
to it so maybe a handful of balls at a

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.309 
to it so maybe a handful of balls at a
time<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.879> might<00:02:18.030> want<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.329> clean<00:02:18.599> it<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:18.930> you

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
time you might want to clean it and you

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.830 
time you might want to clean it and you
cleaned<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.650> over<00:02:19.950> time<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:21.360> then<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.629> water

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
cleaned it over time so then the water

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.170 
cleaned it over time so then the water
goes<00:02:22.290> through<00:02:22.349> these<00:02:23.310> bio<00:02:23.790> balls<00:02:26.180> goes

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
goes through these bio balls goes

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.119 
goes through these bio balls goes
through<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.510> area<00:02:27.840> here<00:02:30.500> where<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.680> can<00:02:31.859> see

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
through this area here where you can see

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.220 
through this area here where you can see
there<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.819> a<00:02:32.849> pump<00:02:33.209> at<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.569> bottom<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.019> water

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
there is a pump at the bottom a water

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.009 
there is a pump at the bottom a water
pump<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:36.480> goes<00:02:36.750> up<00:02:37.220> through<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.250> hose<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:39.840> is

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
pump it goes up through a hose this is

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.860 
pump it goes up through a hose this is
like<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> water<00:02:40.500> pump<00:02:40.799> impeller<00:02:41.159> and<00:02:41.599> it<00:02:42.599> gets

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
like a water pump impeller and it gets

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.339 
like a water pump impeller and it gets
sent<00:02:43.200> back<00:02:45.200> through<00:02:46.579> your<00:02:47.579> aquarium<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:49.290> you

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
sent back through your aquarium so you

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.530 
sent back through your aquarium so you
want<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.829> you<00:02:50.250> want<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.489> place<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.940> nozzle<00:02:51.389> on

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
want to you want to place the nozzle on

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.619 
want to you want to place the nozzle on
this<00:02:51.859> so<00:02:52.859> that<00:02:52.889> it<00:02:53.280> sends<00:02:53.879> the<00:02:54.030> water<00:02:54.150> from<00:02:54.510> the

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
this so that it sends the water from the

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.110 
this so that it sends the water from the
front<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.379> back<00:02:55.530> in<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.430> circular<00:02:56.670> motion

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
front to the back in a circular motion

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.869 
front to the back in a circular motion
and<00:02:57.599> that<00:02:58.590> should<00:02:58.829> be<00:02:58.950> healthy<00:02:59.159> for<00:02:59.760> your

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
and that should be healthy for your

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.390 
and that should be healthy for your
marine<00:03:00.209> environment<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.250> that's<00:03:02.250> the

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
marine environment and that's the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.720 
marine environment and that's the
filtration<00:03:03.000> system<00:03:03.420> for<00:03:04.109> a<00:03:04.170> 29<00:03:04.680> gallon<00:03:04.730> bio
