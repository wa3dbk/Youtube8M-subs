like<00:02:19.060> she<00:02:19.240> could<00:02:19.390> rock<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.570> won't<00:02:19.930> I<00:02:20.200> can't<00:02:20.920> and

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
like she could rock it won't I can't and

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.690 
like she could rock it won't I can't and
I<00:02:22.090> could<00:02:22.270> have<00:02:22.360> been<00:02:22.450> on<00:02:22.660> this<00:02:22.810> side<00:02:23.050> too<00:02:23.700> so

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
I could have been on this side too so

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.910 
I could have been on this side too so
that<00:02:24.910> just<00:02:24.940> puts<00:02:25.360> back<00:02:25.570> now<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.650> wig<00:02:26.890> was
