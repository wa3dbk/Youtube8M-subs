hey<00:00:09.059> guys<00:00:09.300> he<00:00:09.690> did<00:00:09.719> 51<00:00:10.290> here<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.740> just<00:00:10.769> came

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
hey guys he did 51 here and I just came

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.509 
hey guys he did 51 here and I just came
across<00:00:11.190> something<00:00:12.799> amazing<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:13.950> had<00:00:14.070> no<00:00:14.490> idea

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
across something amazing I had no idea

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.900 
across something amazing I had no idea
you<00:00:14.940> could<00:00:15.000> do<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.389> Minecraft<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.910> I'm

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
you could do this in Minecraft so I'm

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.290 
you could do this in Minecraft so I'm
digging<00:00:18.420> out<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:19.080> big<00:00:19.670> big<00:00:20.670> hole<00:00:20.939> right<00:00:21.119> and

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
digging out this big big hole right and

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.880 
digging out this big big hole right and
you<00:00:21.359> can<00:00:21.510> see<00:00:21.779> I've<00:00:21.930> got<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.289> beacon<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.710> there

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
you can see I've got a beacon in there

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.550 
you can see I've got a beacon in there
and<00:00:23.220> I've<00:00:24.000> got<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.480> set<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.900> haste<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.350> right

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
and I've got that set to haste to right

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.130 
and I've got that set to haste to right
now<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.730> expedite<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.390> digging<00:00:27.660> process

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
now just to expedite the digging process

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.780 
now just to expedite the digging process
and<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.920> helps<00:00:29.840> marginally<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.260> may<00:00:31.410> be

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
and it helps marginally it's may be

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.130 
and it helps marginally it's may be
things<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.969> ten<00:00:33.300> percent<00:00:33.480> increase<00:00:34.110> in

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
things like a ten percent increase in

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.470 
things like a ten percent increase in
digging<00:00:34.469> speed<00:00:34.829> or<00:00:34.950> 15<00:00:35.399> at<00:00:36.000> least<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.360> feels

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
digging speed or 15 at least it feels

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.510 
digging speed or 15 at least it feels
like<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:36.960> tidy<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.500> i've<00:00:38.219> been<00:00:38.340> using

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
like that is tidy and i've been using

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.090 
like that is tidy and i've been using

unbreaking 3 efficiency poor efficiency
for<00:00:41.430> pics<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.969> i<00:00:42.360> accidentally<00:00:42.840> grabbed<00:00:43.140> this

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
for pics and i accidentally grabbed this

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.190 
for pics and i accidentally grabbed this

efficiency 5 out of my enchanted chests

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.229 
efficiency 5 out of my enchanted chests
and<00:00:46.350> i've<00:00:47.039> been<00:00:47.160> working<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.640> kind<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
and i've been working and kind of on the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.729 
and i've been working and kind of on the
edges<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> circle<00:00:49.320> working<00:00:49.649> my<00:00:49.710> way

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
edges of the circle working my way

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.040 
edges of the circle working my way
inward<00:00:50.219> if<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.430> look<00:00:50.579> at<00:00:51.020> rei's<00:00:52.020> minimap

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
inward if you look at rei's minimap

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.720 
inward if you look at rei's minimap
there<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.890> can<00:00:53.039> see<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> right<00:00:53.460> side<00:00:53.670> of

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
there you can see on the right side of

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.520 
there you can see on the right side of
that<00:00:53.789> circle<00:00:54.180> I've<00:00:54.300> been<00:00:54.449> kind<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.930> cutting<00:00:55.260> in

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
that circle I've been kind of cutting in

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.270 
that circle I've been kind of cutting in
and<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:57.510> beacon<00:00:58.260> all<00:00:58.350> has<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> radius<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.949> 40

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and the beacon all has a radius of 40

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.209 
and the beacon all has a radius of 40
and<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.760> see<00:00:59.820> my<00:01:00.690> orders<00:01:01.500> @<00:01:01.590> z<00:01:01.859> axis

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
and so you can see my orders @ z axis

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.320 
and so you can see my orders @ z axis
I'm<00:01:02.430> at<00:01:02.609> nine<00:01:02.850> hundred<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.570> forty-<00:01:04.500> 940<00:01:05.330> and

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
I'm at nine hundred and forty- 940 and

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.830 
I'm at nine hundred and forty- 940 and
so<00:01:07.520> right<00:01:08.520> now<00:01:08.549> i'm<00:01:08.909> outside<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.330> range<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.720> my

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
so right now i'm outside the range of my

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.390 
so right now i'm outside the range of my
beacons<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.830> hey<00:01:11.130> should<00:01:11.460> go<00:01:12.450> down<00:01:12.780> and

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
beacons so I hey should go down and

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.640 
beacons so I hey should go down and
disappear<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.640> then<00:01:14.850> yup<00:01:15.119> gone<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:16.229> I've<00:01:16.560> been

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
disappear and then yup gone so I've been

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.800 
disappear and then yup gone so I've been
working<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.220> know<00:01:17.250> how<00:01:17.790> many<00:01:17.970> layers<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.509> and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
working you know how many layers in and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.719 
working you know how many layers in and
I<00:01:19.020> kind<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.650> dig<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.950> your<00:01:20.040> stone<00:01:20.310> whatever

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
I kind of dig in your stone whatever

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.429 
I kind of dig in your stone whatever
efficiency<00:01:21.270> five<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:22.520> once<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:23.759> into

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
efficiency five but once you get into

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.249 
efficiency five but once you get into
range<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.650> beacon<00:01:26.040> should<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.909> any<00:01:27.299> moment

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
range of the beacon should be any moment

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.910 
range of the beacon should be any moment
now<00:01:28.439> wait<00:01:29.400> yep<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.710> check<00:01:31.710> out<00:01:31.829> what

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
now wait yep there it is check out what

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.679 
now wait yep there it is check out what
happens<00:01:32.220> when<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.430> use<00:01:32.549> efficiency<00:01:33.000> 5<00:01:33.329> in

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
happens when you use efficiency 5 in

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:45.800 
happens when you use efficiency 5 in
haste<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.740> stone<00:01:35.100> uh<00:01:38.990> yeah<00:01:42.259> this<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:44.810> just

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
haste to on stone uh yeah this I just

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.370 
haste to on stone uh yeah this I just
poop<00:01:46.020> my<00:01:46.170> pants<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.369> too<00:01:47.880> cool<00:01:48.380> like

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
poop my pants that is too cool like

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.950 
poop my pants that is too cool like
that's<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.829> another<00:01:50.750> another<00:01:51.750> rack

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that's like another another rack

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.590 
that's like another another rack
efficiency<00:01:52.680> for<00:01:52.920> crap<00:01:53.850> going<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.299> right<00:01:54.540> there

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
efficiency for crap going on right there

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.590 
efficiency for crap going on right there
that's<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.880> say<00:01:56.880> no<00:01:57.149> fast<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.969> think<00:02:00.119> I'm

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
that's in say no fast so I think I'm

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.139 
that's in say no fast so I think I'm
going<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:00.930> spending<00:02:01.439> my<00:02:01.770> time<00:02:02.149> creating

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
going to be spending my time creating

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.380 
going to be spending my time creating
efficiency<00:02:03.810> five<00:02:04.020> picks<00:02:04.380> now<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.950> all<00:02:05.850> my<00:02:05.880> XP

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
efficiency five picks now and all my XP

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.309 
efficiency five picks now and all my XP
because<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.380> just<00:02:07.489> ridiculous<00:02:08.569> I<00:02:09.569> cannot

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
because that is just ridiculous I cannot

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.610 
because that is just ridiculous I cannot
even<00:02:10.910> like<00:02:11.910> oh<00:02:12.319> this

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
even like oh this

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.869 
even like oh this
this<00:02:13.830> project<00:02:14.310> ok<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.930> circle<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.879> 101

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
this project ok this this circle is 101

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.380 
this project ok this this circle is 101
x<00:02:18.030> 101<00:02:18.510> right<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:20.370> think<00:02:20.400> I'm<00:02:20.819> digging<00:02:21.180> down

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
x 101 right and I think I'm digging down

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.960 
x 101 right and I think I'm digging down
I've<00:02:21.989> already<00:02:22.230> gotten<00:02:22.500> just<00:02:22.980> below<00:02:23.250> layer<00:02:23.459> 60

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
I've already gotten just below layer 60

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.320 
I've already gotten just below layer 60
and<00:02:24.560> i'm<00:02:25.560> going<00:02:25.950> down<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.099> 20<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:26.819> that's<00:02:27.000> 40

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
and i'm going down to 20 so that's 40

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.619 
and i'm going down to 20 so that's 40
layers<00:02:27.540> this<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.319> going<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.680> go<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.670> quick<00:02:30.000> but

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
layers this is going to go so quick but
