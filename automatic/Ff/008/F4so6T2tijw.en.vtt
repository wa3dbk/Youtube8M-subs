 while talking some things about top 5 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.140
 For you, that's why I'm not the top-5. 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.700
 I 'm still changing textures then 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.619
 you can see in what an 'exchange 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.020
 of textures it took anyway so let's go 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.360
 guys the top 5 to 14 still at home in this 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.070
 Sunday that passed is yesterday was to hit 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.020
 being yesterday is because a 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.150
 unforeseen family interview besides 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.369
 unforeseen troy aikman then beyond 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.320
 staff there on the viola team who sent me 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.360
 an email sent many emails and talking 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.250
 over and also the staff tried quite a bit 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.200
 for me talking about then I decided to postpone 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.570
 the date of the top 5 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.700
 it speaks like so immediate to the top5 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.340
 face short guys basically Adada 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.470
 top-5 even though the beginning and scope 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.390
 for that you must have understood and I 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.520
 I'll postpone the date I 'm going to start 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.649
 series itself is you guys will have more time 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.890
 to record your play to do what 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.270
 you want to edit your shots of 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.490

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.409
 your video about your house move 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.670
 have sent a play that you think 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.730
 Not so cool. 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.590
 You may be in the case by sending 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.210
 the video with another move and such or 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.100
 sending multiple videos with multiple 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.790
 plays for you is more likely to 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.890
