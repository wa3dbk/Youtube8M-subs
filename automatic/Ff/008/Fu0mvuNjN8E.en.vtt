00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.630
 hi hello good morning friends of liu I had this time we will interview 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.319
 lionel messi considered by many as the best footballer in the world 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:13.980
 hello messi I imagine that you feel happy for having won for the first time 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.810
 next to the barsa the triplet my question is the following as you have done for 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.949
 Become a footballer like what you are now 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.589
 hi how about i just want to thank the referees because they were thanks to 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.300
 it that we get where we are good 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.119
 also to my classmates 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.270
 and about your question I got to where I am thanks to a lot of effort and 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.660
 dedication I had since I was little 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.540
 Fuck fuck if it's still small and you do not grow 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.820
 ch I mean when I was a kid from there was where I learned to play the 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.370
 ball and little by little I went out in grandoli a team from my neighborhood then I went to the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.320
 inferiors of the newell's old boys then the bastards of the river plate the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.999
 They rejected because of my size 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.419
 from there I decided to try or in Barcelona there in press to those of me 

00:00:59.419 --> 00:01:03.359
 category and older than me then I stayed there I spent all the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.640
 categories and I debuted for the first time in the fans in 2003 from there fly 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.950
 Anybody put in front of me as so good that I'm sorry I think it happens 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.740
 I must be more humble 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.900
 well you seem like a great person an example thank you 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.170
 and explain to me how is that 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.630
 of the help of the referees if that everyone knows what platoon what 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.190
 we are look i explain 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.360
 In the game against Chelsea, the referee did not see his checkpoint chelsea 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.060
 asked for four viable viability penalties that were rejected by the 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.170
 Norwegian referee thanks to that we could go straight to the final against the 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.630
 Manchester and an agent 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.509
 Baa, but what assholes you are, you fucking shit like that, you win 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.680
 Any good I just play the rest is the club's problem in 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.080
 yes I have nothing to do with corruption in football and 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.980
 do you think they can repeat the triplet 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.390
 the truth that the Peruvian of Alan did not already say a passion now will seem to us 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.710
 impossible because there will be the real Madrid and I think they will give us for ass 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.409
 look now before talking about madrid let's do the game of pin pon 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:11.560
 I say a name and you tell me what do you think if that 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.349
 they seem to you 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.390
 It's fine but no bullshit and there goes VICTOR VALENCIA read it heads is 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:23.040
 with the poetry carles puyol who cuts her hair touré yaya for that brings us 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.450
 you pite kush andrés iniesta a asshole that separates always injuring xavi 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.769
 Hernandez a good type master of the midfield 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.769
 my favorite if healing and movements 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.189
 and finally 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.599
 samuel fetus 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.479
 this one is a dumbass metheny bored birds 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:47.469
 it's good that he's gone and I hope he does not come back and now let's talk about the real 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:48.269
 Madrid 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.099
 Now, what do you think about seeing Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka in Real? 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.189
 Madrid 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.580
 Well, I think it's very good 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.740
 since I will finally have a tough competition I must always be excellent 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.950
 with good performances and I want to be like ronaldo Christian since it's my 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.109
 direct rival 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.529
 and about kaka is a great player many times he has left me as a child 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:13.899
 especially when we are faced with our selection every time 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:15.949
 it comes out winning 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:19.959
 I want to show you that I am better and I am doing it. You have not seen that there are 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.249
 golazos 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:25.779
 I think I should be more humble and about Argentina's team you think 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:27.199
 go to the world 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:30.579
 lately you have received many criticisms 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.229
 how do you take it 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:36.219
 well yes, whenever I play with my team I do the best I can 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.470
 sometimes the results are not given but you know asshole if this world is 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.029
 is without Argentina would not be global 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.319
 that's what the day said with a creation 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.529
 I take criticism very well it's always good to realize some mistakes 

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:53.059
 because nobody is perfect and enjoy access 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:56.099
 good messi to finish I want to ask you a question 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.489
 If you were with a ship in the middle of the high seas and you are drowning 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.359
 guardiola and diego armando maradona but only had you have capacity for two 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.089
 people you would save tuco 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:13.089
 what a difficult question to answer the truth that would save the 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.739
 two 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.379
 to guardiola with the condition that he do everything possible to win the ball 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:22.580
 gold and maradona to take me to the world jajajajajajajajajaja that asshole that I am 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.240
 he already answers you asshole 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.199
 good messi 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.310
 I thank you for this interview and I hope that Christian and Kaka break the 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:33.309
 meshes of valdés now blue and milk 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:36.610
