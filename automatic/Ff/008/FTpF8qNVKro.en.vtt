00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
gonna happen so I figured I was just

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.510 
gonna happen so I figured I was just
going<00:00:41.440> to<00:00:41.530> make<00:00:41.650> this<00:00:41.770> like<00:00:41.950> a<00:00:41.980> showcase<00:00:42.460> to

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520
