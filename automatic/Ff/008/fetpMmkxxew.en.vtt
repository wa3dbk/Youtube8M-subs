two videos we reviewed the 200 million
our<00:00:51.170> primes<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:51.620> then<00:00:51.830> we<00:00:51.950> also<00:00:52.129> went<00:00:52.370> into

our favorite lens was the 7200 2.8 l is
mark<00:01:03.079> 2<00:01:03.290> and<00:01:03.530> basically<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.220> non<00:01:04.369> is<00:01:04.759> version

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
mark 2 and basically the non is version

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.190 
mark 2 and basically the non is version
of<00:01:05.210> that<00:01:05.330> which<00:01:05.840> we're<00:01:05.960> going<00:01:06.050> to<00:01:06.140> be

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
of that which we're going to be

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.290 
of that which we're going to be
comparing<00:01:06.649> to<00:01:06.860> our<00:01:06.890> two<00:01:07.340> 200<00:01:08.030> millimeter

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300

comparing to our two 200 millimeter
Prime's<00:01:08.630> let's<00:01:09.080> go<00:01:09.229> ahead<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:09.500> start<00:01:09.710> from

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
Prime's let's go ahead and start from

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.530 
Prime's let's go ahead and start from
the<00:01:09.950> top<00:01:10.160> with<00:01:10.460> their<00:01:10.580> aesthetic<00:01:11.060> quality<00:01:11.420> and

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
the top with their aesthetic quality and

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.960 
the top with their aesthetic quality and
sharpness<00:01:11.810> at<00:01:12.229> their<00:01:12.590> respective<00:01:13.160> WOA<00:01:13.550> s<00:01:13.759> or

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
sharpness at their respective WOA s or

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.240 
sharpness at their respective WOA s or
wide<00:01:14.330> open<00:01:14.720> apertures<00:01:15.080> now<00:01:15.680> once<00:01:15.920> again<00:01:16.130> this

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
wide open apertures now once again this

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.219 
wide open apertures now once again this
is<00:01:16.399> a<00:01:16.430> visual<00:01:16.970> test<00:01:17.149> of<00:01:17.360> differences<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:17.869> not

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
is a visual test of differences and not

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.719 
is a visual test of differences and not
a<00:01:18.259> technical<00:01:18.830> test<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:19.340> we're<00:01:19.490> trying<00:01:19.610> to

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
a technical test so we're trying to

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:20.920 
a technical test so we're trying to
distinguish<00:01:20.060> differences<00:01:20.450> in<00:01:20.690> appearance

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
distinguish differences in appearance

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.690 
distinguish differences in appearance

course there was a bit of change in the
light<00:01:30.050> in<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.259> scene<00:01:30.590> basically<00:01:31.160> from<00:01:31.399> when

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
light in the scene basically from when

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.740 
light in the scene basically from when
the<00:01:31.670> shots<00:01:31.880> were<00:01:32.000> taken<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:32.390> let's<00:01:32.539> try<00:01:32.690> to

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
the shots were taken so let's try to

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.140 
the shots were taken so let's try to
ignore<00:01:33.229> that<00:01:33.560> fact<00:01:33.920> but<00:01:34.490> we<00:01:34.580> can<00:01:34.700> see<00:01:34.909> that<00:01:35.060> the

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
ignore that fact but we can see that the

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.560 
ignore that fact but we can see that the
200<00:01:35.630> f/2<00:01:36.110> at<00:01:36.350> its<00:01:36.560> WAFF<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.460> really<00:01:37.940> crushes

smooth bokeh and milkshake I'm kind of

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.039 
smooth bokeh and milkshake I'm kind of
getting<00:01:44.180> hungry<00:01:44.210> is<00:01:44.540> that<00:01:44.630> weird<00:01:44.780> I'm<00:01:44.930> going

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
getting hungry is that weird I'm going

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.660 
getting hungry is that weird I'm going
to<00:01:45.110> hunt<00:01:45.260> granite<00:01:45.500> but<00:01:46.100> compared<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:46.549> the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.340 
to hunt granite but compared to the
other<00:01:46.790> two<00:01:46.970> lenses<00:01:47.360> it's<00:01:47.600> very<00:01:47.960> easy<00:01:48.200> to

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
other two lenses it's very easy to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.050 
other two lenses it's very easy to
notice<00:01:48.530> it<00:01:48.830> also<00:01:48.979> has<00:01:49.189> a<00:01:49.220> significant<00:01:49.820> amount

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
notice it also has a significant amount

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.760 
notice it also has a significant amount
of<00:01:50.150> vignetting<00:01:50.540> as<00:01:50.720> well<00:01:50.930> to<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.290> look<00:01:51.500> which

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
of vignetting as well to the look which

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.620 
of vignetting as well to the look which
was<00:01:51.890> really<00:01:52.040> kind<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.340> in<00:01:52.850> my<00:01:53.060> opinion<00:01:53.390> for

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
was really kind of in my opinion for

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.600 
was really kind of in my opinion for
this<00:01:53.780> scene<00:01:54.049> it<00:01:54.200> really<00:01:54.380> adds<00:01:54.560> a<00:01:54.740> look<00:01:54.979> but

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
this scene it really adds a look but

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.910
