well<00:01:25.030> this<00:01:25.810> thing<00:01:26.049> right<00:01:26.260> here<00:01:26.290> is<00:01:26.590> you<00:01:26.680> can

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
well this thing right here is you can

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.609 
well this thing right here is you can
see<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.040> handle<00:01:27.430> slides<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:29.200> we'll<00:01:29.440> do<00:01:29.530> it

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
see the handle slides so we'll do it

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.770 
see the handle slides so we'll do it
kind<00:01:29.770> of<00:01:29.830> slow<00:01:29.890> here<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:31.119> hammer<00:01:31.360> slides

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
kind of slow here and the hammer slides

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.010 
kind of slow here and the hammer slides
down<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.440> handle<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:34.000> that<00:01:34.030> means<00:01:34.360> it<00:01:34.750> almost

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
down the handle so that means it almost

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.370 
down the handle so that means it almost
looks<00:01:35.320> like<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:36.460> hammer<00:01:36.640> gets<00:01:36.909> longer<00:01:37.360> so<00:01:38.350> I

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
looks like the hammer gets longer so I

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.039 
looks like the hammer gets longer so I
really<00:01:38.770> like<00:01:38.950> that<00:01:39.220> and<00:01:39.430> then<00:01:39.520> printing<00:01:40.049> as

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
really like that and then printing as

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.600 
really like that and then printing as
for<00:01:41.320> articulation<00:01:41.770> otherwise<00:01:42.159> it's<00:01:42.369> just<00:01:42.520> a

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
for articulation otherwise it's just a

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.160 
for articulation otherwise it's just a
cut<00:01:42.760> of<00:01:42.850> their<00:01:42.939> shoulder<00:01:43.240> cut<00:01:43.840> at<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:43.990> neck

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
cut of their shoulder cut at the neck

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.710
