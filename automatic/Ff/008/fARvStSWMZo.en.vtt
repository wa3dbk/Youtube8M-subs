00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.690
 waterfall which is part of unesco heritage 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.230
 and countries too which includes heritage 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.239
 UNESCO 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.120
 here we are out of the house now we will go 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.710
 just at the station 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.370
 Metro, we rather decided to take the bus 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.730
 and get to our steps it's there this 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.269
 luggage dancing where is the sky 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.219

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.170
 doedem direct train ride away from the two 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.540
 half an hour somewhere long enough 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.800
 we hope that we will remove a lot of different 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.860
 interesting videos 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.230
 Fiji 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.890
 these videos by the way we will shoot 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.600
 small minute 3 to 5 can be 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.140
 sure you already have a lot to feed 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.580
 I think 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.690
 interesting 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.760
 we definitely look there 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.980
 will like 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.770

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.690
 bus show you stop here we are 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.080
 have come almost to a halt he you 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.700
 you can see the stop itself just 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.690
 people so as not to disturb them we moved 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.060
 a little from there on 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.400
 playground for which I have already shot 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.360
 video you are probably in 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.770
 of the week 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.140
 which I shot 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.240
 here is here rocker show now how 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.539
 i look the part when i'm in 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.539
 really wanted such an adult uncle 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.450
 so it all looks about so i 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.640
 I sit rented nightly videos because 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.690
 usually nobody take me away 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.850
 now it turns out 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.820
 we will be on the bus soon 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.830

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.380
 3 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.260
 here we go together so she 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.310
 will actively help to show something 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.350
 maybe something to comment too 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.000
 I hope the weather will be interesting today 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.060
 also pretty cool though tomorrow 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.420
 like rain promise well here we will not 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.240
 then delaying this video will show you 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.750
 closer to the point 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.750
 so that you can see everything and 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.750
 headphones 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.630
 smart 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.069
 but 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.840
 like it's not real 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.620
 the hood 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.599
 it put a picture 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.090
 here 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.200
 Metro 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.650
 not on the square for how to call it not dnat 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.030
 like train 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.030
 and we will go already tonic 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.910
 bye red light as I said 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.180
 two o'clock somewhere maybe i will take off 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.100
 anything else from the train is true ours 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.770
 problem in the west charge the camera and on 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.360
 gradually discharged therefore it is necessary 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.430
 will find a place where you can be 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.200
 charge maybe some pazarro 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.200
 and where else so 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.010
 though 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.709
 people drove 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.400
 very much every second 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.489
 we go up the escalator to the station 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.069
 which is called Omsk clinic 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:17.540
 that is, quite a new station which 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:19.880
 made just when he built st3 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.520
 how do you know joe he opened the year 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.889
 back of everything so here everything looks 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:32.300
 New enough clean scoreboards 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:39.800
 podglyuchivaet on the camera so it looks 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:42.760
 the train station is not yet visible 15 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.760
 minutes they say you need 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:51.370
 well we will wait can see 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.620
 the card goes a lot of different very with a very 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.620
 long line but we're going over here to 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.260
 they called to the station's 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.180
 can see we are on 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:06.100
 say the 3rd century as i said sky 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:09.000
 three stations long enough 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.330
 you can already see the schedule 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.400
 when what goes 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.139
 hours for example 3 minutes 23 minutes 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.479
 also along the lines 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.530
 need to look at the colors it's me later 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.430
 somehow tell you how to use 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.680
 this thing 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.539
 for those who come to Japan for the first time 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.650
 can easily figure out enough 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:31.560
 just now you can collect 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.510
 sits in the samples so 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.150
 see you in the next video i 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.300
 necessarily lay still when we have the 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.220
 get there so wait for new videos 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.750
 be sure to subscribe to the channel 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.710

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.910
 until 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.910
 well, the most 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.870
