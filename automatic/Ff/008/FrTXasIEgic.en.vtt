Trevor<00:00:05.069> here<00:00:05.370> so<00:00:06.330> I'm<00:00:06.450> just<00:00:06.569> gonna<00:00:06.720> be<00:00:06.870> going

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
Trevor here so I'm just gonna be going

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.810 
Trevor here so I'm just gonna be going
through<00:00:07.290> all<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.799> locations<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.760> is

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
through all of the locations this is

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.549 
through all of the locations this is
just<00:00:09.090> footage<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.599> captured<00:00:09.809> because<00:00:10.469> I

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
just footage that I captured because I

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.310 
just footage that I captured because I
spent<00:00:11.179> some<00:00:12.179> time<00:00:12.210> playing<00:00:12.719> real<00:00:12.960> survivor

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
spent some time playing real survivor

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.740 
spent some time playing real survivor
mode<00:00:13.559> with<00:00:13.740> Chris<00:00:14.089> it'll<00:00:15.089> work<00:00:15.210> for<00:00:15.360> Jill<00:00:15.570> too

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
mode with Chris it'll work for Jill too

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.510 
mode with Chris it'll work for Jill too
so<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.379> doesn't<00:00:16.619> really<00:00:16.680> matter<00:00:16.890> in<00:00:17.190> fact<00:00:17.400> I

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
so it doesn't really matter in fact I

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.670 
so it doesn't really matter in fact I
think<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.850> find<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.300> harder<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:18.990> dodge<00:00:19.289> Lisa

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
think I find it harder to dodge Lisa

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.120 
think I find it harder to dodge Lisa
Trevor<00:00:19.949> with<00:00:20.880> Chris<00:00:21.119> anyway<00:00:21.830> it's<00:00:22.830> just<00:00:22.890> me

you<00:00:25.019> can't<00:00:25.260> really<00:00:25.650> move<00:00:26.090> away<00:00:27.090> you're<00:00:27.359> just

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
you can't really move away you're just

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.269 
you can't really move away you're just
gonna<00:00:27.630> have<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.869> hope<00:00:28.080> she<00:00:28.650> tries<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.859> hit<00:00:29.099> you

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
gonna have to hope she tries to hit you

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.220 
gonna have to hope she tries to hit you
and<00:00:29.550> she<00:00:29.640> doesn't<00:00:29.789> do<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.359> circling<00:00:30.929> attack

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
and she doesn't do that circling attack

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.120 
and she doesn't do that circling attack
like<00:00:31.800> that

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
like that

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.610 
like that
then<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:32.790> run<00:00:33.000> if<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.300> are<00:00:33.690> lucky<00:00:34.110> enough<00:00:34.140> to

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
then just run if you are lucky enough to

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.020 
then just run if you are lucky enough to
get<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:35.660> and<00:00:36.660> then<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:37.020> do<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.070> okay<00:00:38.940> and

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
get that and then just do that okay and

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.430 
get that and then just do that okay and
the<00:00:39.120> next<00:00:39.149> time<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.600> meter<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.200> mines

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
the next time you meter is in the mines

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.790 
the next time you meter is in the mines
or<00:00:40.820> whatever<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:41.969> is

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
or whatever this is

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.170 
or whatever this is
now<00:00:43.800> she'll<00:00:44.010> just<00:00:44.190> show<00:00:44.309> up<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.550> anywhere<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
now she'll just show up in anywhere and

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.870 
now she'll just show up in anywhere and
then<00:00:45.590> again<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.129> lot<00:00:47.430> easier<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.820> dodge

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.160 

okay<00:00:52.880> when<00:00:53.060> you<00:00:53.150> walk<00:00:53.330> out<00:00:53.510> again<00:00:53.750> she's<00:00:54.020> just

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
okay when you walk out again she's just

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.400 
okay when you walk out again she's just
gonna<00:00:54.260> appear<00:00:54.560> wherever<00:00:54.740> you<00:00:54.950> turned<00:00:56.140> yes<00:00:57.140> so

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
gonna appear wherever you turned yes so

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.590 
gonna appear wherever you turned yes so
yeah<00:00:58.160> you<00:00:58.430> just<00:00:58.640> repeat<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.060> same<00:00:59.210> thing<00:00:59.270> over

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
yeah you just repeat the same thing over

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.510 
yeah you just repeat the same thing over
and<00:00:59.690> over<00:00:59.810> it's<00:01:00.590> actually<00:01:00.890> very<00:01:01.040> easy<00:01:01.160> to

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
and over it's actually very easy to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.170 
and over it's actually very easy to
dodge<00:01:01.850> her<00:01:02.090> in<00:01:02.210> this<00:01:02.390> area<00:01:03.879> that's<00:01:04.879> all<00:01:05.030> you

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
dodge her in this area that's all you

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.340 
dodge her in this area that's all you
really<00:01:05.330> have<00:01:05.420> to<00:01:05.630> do<00:01:07.000> okay<00:01:08.020> anyway

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
really have to do okay anyway

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.920 
really have to do okay anyway
she<00:01:09.950> does<00:01:10.130> that<00:01:10.610> circling<00:01:11.150> attack<00:01:11.479> and<00:01:11.750> my

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
she does that circling attack and my

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.530 
she does that circling attack and my
honey<00:01:12.260> is<00:01:12.620> a<00:01:12.680> lot<00:01:13.100> worse<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:13.490> get<00:01:13.610> hit

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.800 

and<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:19.090> when<00:01:20.090> you're<00:01:20.210> trying<00:01:20.330> to<00:01:20.570> put<00:01:20.720> the

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
and so when you're trying to put the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.510 
and so when you're trying to put the
flamethrower<00:01:21.260> and<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:21.620> can<00:01:21.740> just<00:01:21.920> get<00:01:22.400> this

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
flamethrower and you can just get this

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.010 
flamethrower and you can just get this
maneuver<00:01:22.970> if<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:23.150> want<00:01:23.300> to<00:01:23.390> get<00:01:23.480> there<00:01:23.780> fast

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
maneuver if you want to get there fast

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.770 
maneuver if you want to get there fast
again<00:01:25.010> you<00:01:25.550> don't<00:01:25.670> really<00:01:26.030> have<00:01:26.330> to<00:01:26.540> do<00:01:26.630> this

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
again you don't really have to do this

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.170 
again you don't really have to do this
you<00:01:26.930> can<00:01:27.050> just<00:01:27.490> go<00:01:28.490> to<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.700> corner<00:01:28.940> that

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
you can just go to the corner that

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.730 
you can just go to the corner that
you're<00:01:29.270> not<00:01:29.420> gonna<00:01:29.570> go<00:01:29.780> to<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.440> then<00:01:30.590> just

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
you're not gonna go to and then just

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.590 
you're not gonna go to and then just
turn<00:01:30.890> around<00:01:31.010> and<00:01:31.190> just<00:01:31.640> go<00:01:31.730> around<00:01:31.910> her<00:01:32.210> and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
turn around and just go around her and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.020 
turn around and just go around her and
she'll<00:01:32.810> move<00:01:33.370> but<00:01:34.370> if<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.580> want<00:01:34.730> to<00:01:34.790> be<00:01:34.850> fancy

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
she'll move but if you want to be fancy

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.410 
she'll move but if you want to be fancy
like<00:01:35.390> this<00:01:35.570> just<00:01:35.870> do<00:01:35.990> what<00:01:36.110> I'm<00:01:36.200> doing<00:01:37.420> okay

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
now here's the part where it's a little

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.780

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
tricky yeah push the bottom one first

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.970 
tricky yeah push the bottom one first
and<00:01:44.720> it's<00:01:45.050> hard<00:01:45.260> to<00:01:45.380> do<00:01:45.500> anything<00:01:45.770> because

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980
