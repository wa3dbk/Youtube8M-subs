able to find any other videos on this so
I<00:00:10.650> figured<00:00:10.950> I'd<00:00:11.040> make<00:00:11.070> one<00:00:11.309> now<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.269> box<00:00:12.540> here

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
I figured I'd make one now this box here

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.629 
I figured I'd make one now this box here
it's<00:00:12.929> supposed<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.349> keep<00:00:13.500> track<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:14.130> our<00:00:14.370> nav

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
it's supposed to keep track of our nav

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.540 
it's supposed to keep track of our nav
card<00:00:15.030> slash<00:00:15.509> Easter<00:00:16.080> egg<00:00:16.199> progression<00:00:16.890> now<00:00:17.490> we

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
card slash Easter egg progression now we

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.689 
card slash Easter egg progression now we
notice<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.390> three<00:00:18.960> lights<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.859> top<00:00:20.130> or<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
notice the three lights on top or the

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.730 
notice the three lights on top or the
nav<00:00:20.880> cards<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.080> makes<00:00:22.320> perfect<00:00:22.380> sense

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
nav cards and this makes perfect sense

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.189 
nav cards and this makes perfect sense
because<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.310> have<00:00:23.580> my<00:00:23.730> die<00:00:23.789> rise<00:00:24.150> nav<00:00:24.420> card<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
because I have my die rise nav card and

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.960 
because I have my die rise nav card and
I<00:00:25.260> have<00:00:25.410> my<00:00:25.529> Buried<00:00:25.890> nav<00:00:26.070> card<00:00:26.369> both<00:00:26.580> put<00:00:26.849> in

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
I have my Buried nav card both put in

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.849 
I have my Buried nav card both put in
but<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.240> haven't<00:00:27.449> gone<00:00:27.720> back<00:00:27.779> yet<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.710> do

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
but I haven't gone back yet to do

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.640 
but I haven't gone back yet to do
transit<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:30.240> lights<00:00:30.510> turned<00:00:30.840> off<00:00:31.080> so

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
transit and that lights turned off so

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.840 
transit and that lights turned off so
okay<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.279> makes<00:00:32.489> sense

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
okay that makes sense

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.510 
okay that makes sense
and<00:00:33.000> then<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.840> was<00:00:34.110> looking<00:00:34.440> at<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> lights<00:00:34.950> on
