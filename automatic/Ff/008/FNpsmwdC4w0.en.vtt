is a game I think that it's more about
just<00:02:40.420> like<00:02:40.860> everyone<00:02:41.860> kind<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.160> like<00:02:42.280> being

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
here growing more than like being a

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.710 
here growing more than like being a
front-runner<00:02:45.490> why<00:02:46.120> do<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.300> think<00:02:46.360> you've
