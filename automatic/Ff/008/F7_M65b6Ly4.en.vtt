 cooking this dish to us 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.230
 will need the following ingredients 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:35.790
 colored milk or kefir 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:38.640

 cilantro 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.199
 start cooking shaded 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.320
 milk how to paint milk is on 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.480
 our site on the video called 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.409
 colored milk soup send 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:07.250
 cucumber that is pre- cleaned 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.250
 finely chopped 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:19.000
 you need to cut quite small 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:31.010
 smaller than for example on ordinary salad and 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:35.680
 so very little we send 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.680
 next proceed to cutting greens 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.140
 as I have already said, not much 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.490
 remained basil our twigs gru was 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:07.280

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.629
 water 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:41.849
 because thick enough with us if 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:47.189
 liquid kefir can not add water 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:50.629
 and also send as soup 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:52.819

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.609
