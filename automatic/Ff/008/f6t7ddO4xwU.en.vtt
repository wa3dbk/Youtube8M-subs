00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.020
 finally we go home has been a 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.800
 very long trip and I'm looking forward to seeing 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.960
 and others again 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.579
 I have started to prepare my report for 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.890
 Find more about the state of conflict 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.640
 in framework I think you will be surprised 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.640
 the results 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.230
 there is much more between them than 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.510
 he believed in magic and the threat that it is 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.239
 something very very real 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.160
 it is strong but not all the tribes of 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.519
 Beans are willing to join under their 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.519
 leadership 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.310
 some have left her to join 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.580
 session and a warrior whose speed and 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.380
 strength are legendary in these lands 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.240
 I can not prove it but I think he and 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.760
 Sandra could be a third force to 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.610
 keep in mind the ice guard is 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.870
 mysterious and is clearly isolated 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.870
 they have their own plans 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.619
 if frei york joins under the command of 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.229
 Sichuan and lisandra could be a 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.530
 real threat to magic or such 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.720
 time even for everyone to value 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.280
 what happens next could be the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.830
 spark that ignites the fires of the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.259
 war knowing what I know now 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.450
 I think I can say for sure that 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.450
 we will be watching the events
