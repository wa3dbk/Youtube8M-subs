00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.620
 as I missed I bring to 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.149
 new slow fight 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.470
 have you ever missed half of 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:09.900
 a tim fain because I did not even know 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.430
 where to look in slow faith we will analyze 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.809
 slow motion the best country team of 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.630
 division of honor so you do not miss 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.160
 not a single detail the play this week 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.320
 returns to destinations to the room but this 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.849
 once against being used in day 1 in a 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.290
 Game match draw that was decided 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.570
 for the salsa players in question 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.939
 seconds go with the play with actor 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.500
 20 and with the elusive fist and leaves the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.630
 danger zone we see how beta was 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.660
 in the lateral zone trying to find a 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.190
 point from where I can start again 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.929
 it is possible to take out the form of danger 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.760
 perfect in the turÃ³ but it is very 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:40.260
 exposed spine ends dead perfect 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.250
 field is still fighting a lot year that is 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.050
 just barack and that he will not be able to stand 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.879
 and let's get out of this court and neither 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.260
 will be when a dead person ends that 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.179
 double who who sees himself with actor well 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.999
 effected enters with all the damage and 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:52.109
 they finish with all the team of gÃ¼iza 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:53.550
 they have barely survived 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.230
 jimbo who had to leave quickly 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.329
 fleeing to the danger zone along with a 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.429
 disc that was not even in the area 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.190
 As I did not know either, we're going to 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:06.229
 see you again 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.229
 and many more things 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.410
 as usual, let's see the situation 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.270
 this time it will be a 4 against 4 line 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.370
 half since both me and here and 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.020
 they are out of the fight this is not a 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.820
 great sacrifice for salsa since although 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.200
 I was 17 while jodie that is one of 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.080
 the main tools of wizards 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.520
 that goes 417 yorick this TV 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.260
 we transport to defend but what 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.729
 will cancel quickly while you dial 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.020
 so he will do it later though 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.900
 neither they come to contribute anything 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.250
 to the fight said this we see as leasing 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.700
 jump in the middle to throw Oriana 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.470
 back and this is already an error because 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.119
 first because he does not have flash is 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.770
 say once between now he will not be able to 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.150
 leave what will mean the best of 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.520
 Oriana death cases for his 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.259
 second because his team is not close 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.280
 nor an aggressive position what indicates 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.920
 absolutely an excess of aggressiveness 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.780
 by third party leasing 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.979
 oriana if it has flash so why 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.330
 They left to go with their team once 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.460
 different enter inside with the kick 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.899
 will not admit going to your ball and it will be at your 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.710
 this one against Oriana but this one had already 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.360
 used flash 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.190
 so they will not be effective and also 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.720
 we see how to put meta-analysis 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.420
 Oriana move her ball to effect her 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.440
 shock wave over the rest of wizards 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.509
 taking advantage of that they are ahead and they 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.100
 position erroneously combine the wave 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.240
 of shock the last strip finishing 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.430
 conchera 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.410
 use your invoker tissues in that 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.000
 moment you were transported ok and cork and 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.950
 tried to kill nobody but that a 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.810
 good bubble got rid of this one though 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.220
 it looked like it was going to be saved by not 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.930
 too much in agreement so with his 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.880
 take care of this I get to end it 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.410
 you have already seen with a small error of 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.000
 communication can bring great 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.560
 consequences since the tie was broken 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.420
 in the game they took the tower of 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.980
 medium and the nation ' getting very 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.170
 ahead and finally taking this 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.940
 encounter do not miss the week that 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.680
 comes more division of rules played and 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.239
 especially more slow fight 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.500
 on the left you have the previous 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.209
 chapter of slow fight and to the right 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.069
 you have the party to which this belongs 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.790
 played and if you liked the video there 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.790
