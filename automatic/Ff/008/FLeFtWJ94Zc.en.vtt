00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
also added more output power and they

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.649 
also added more output power and they
have<00:03:38.739> increased<00:03:39.069> efficiency<00:03:39.969> of<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.269> vehicle

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659

as<00:03:40.810> well<00:03:41.019> so<00:03:41.799> I<00:03:41.829> think<00:03:41.950> for<00:03:42.310> 2016<00:03:43.030> actors<00:03:43.510> gonna

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:43.689 
as well so I think for 2016 actors gonna

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.270 
as well so I think for 2016 actors gonna
hit<00:03:43.900> it<00:03:43.989> really<00:03:44.260> hard<00:03:44.409> versus<00:03:45.099> all<00:03:45.250> the
