shoot and out the side of the bunker

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.930 
shoot and out the side of the bunker
with<00:00:54.969> and<00:00:55.589> I<00:00:56.589> can<00:00:57.069> see<00:00:57.249> pretty<00:00:57.429> much<00:00:57.639> perfectly

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940

full buy me the grades even upside down

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.730 
full buy me the grades even upside down
it'll<00:01:24.880> still<00:01:25.060> eat<00:01:25.330> at<00:01:25.450> least<00:01:25.570> 15<00:01:26.020> paintballs

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
it'll still eat at least 15 paintballs

pretty<00:01:30.640> hard<00:01:30.820> apparently<00:01:31.390> just<00:01:32.100> left<00:01:33.100> side

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
pretty hard apparently just left side

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.730 
pretty hard apparently just left side
like<00:01:33.400> that<00:01:33.480> right<00:01:34.480> sides<00:01:34.750> like<00:01:35.230> this<00:01:35.260> and

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
like that right sides like this and

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.740 
like that right sides like this and
another<00:01:36.520> cool<00:01:36.850> thing<00:01:36.880> about<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.330> work<00:01:37.480> debate

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
another cool thing about the work debate

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.290 
another cool thing about the work debate
is<00:01:37.900> over<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.260> top<00:01:38.610> what<00:01:39.610> time<00:01:39.820> you<00:01:39.940> can't<00:01:40.120> do

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
is over the top what time you can't do

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.020 
is over the top what time you can't do
that<00:01:40.540> a<00:01:40.990> little<00:01:41.740> bit<00:01:41.830> of<00:01:41.920> Intel<00:01:42.190> comes

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
that a little bit of Intel comes

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.820 
that a little bit of Intel comes
straight<00:01:43.270> up<00:01:43.420> it's<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:44.260> know<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.440> top<00:01:44.650> of

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
straight up it's you know the top of

you<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.230> might<00:01:46.410> go<00:01:46.500> around<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.800> front<00:01:46.950> I

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
you one might go around the front I

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.920 
you one might go around the front I
could<00:01:47.130> see<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.430> pro<00:01:47.580> class<00:01:52.550> right<00:01:53.750> on<00:01:54.750> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.199 
you right now
now<00:02:16.500> let's<00:02:16.680> go<00:02:16.830> see<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.070> vertical<00:02:17.280> feed<00:02:17.640> market

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.280 

this<00:02:21.209> is<00:02:21.270> not<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.630> car<00:02:21.870> through<00:02:22.020> nothing

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
this is not a car through nothing

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.380 
this is not a car through nothing
special<00:02:22.440> about<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:25.760> I'm<00:02:26.760> back<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:26.970> my<00:02:27.180> same

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
special about it so I'm back in my same

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.110 
special about it so I'm back in my same
spot<00:02:28.190> snapping<00:02:29.190> out<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.370> right<00:02:29.550> slides<00:02:29.850> I

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
spot snapping out the right slides I

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.510 
spot snapping out the right slides I
can't<00:02:30.600> do<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:30.990> because<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:32.040> hopper<00:02:32.340> comes

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
can't do this because the hopper comes

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.760 
can't do this because the hopper comes
way<00:02:32.700> out<00:02:32.850> here<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:33.990> got<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.230> keep<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.440> marker

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
way out here so I got to keep the marker

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.290 
way out here so I got to keep the marker
as<00:02:34.890> close<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.250> vertical<00:02:35.400> as<00:02:35.670> possible

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
as close to vertical as possible

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.530 
as close to vertical as possible
or<00:02:36.750> slightly<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.470> this<00:02:37.680> high<00:02:37.950> property<00:02:38.450> but<00:02:39.450> it

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
or slightly in this high property but it

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.060 
or slightly in this high property but it
makes<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.810> have<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.050> lean<00:02:40.260> out<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.470> lot<00:02:40.770> farther

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
makes I have to lean out a lot farther

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.760 
makes I have to lean out a lot farther
left<00:02:42.060> side<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.330> can't<00:02:42.690> do<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.959> that's<00:02:43.560> your

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
left side I can't do that that's your

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.240 
left side I can't do that that's your
bed<00:02:44.270> got<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.300> switch<00:02:45.570> hand<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.500> do<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.070> same

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
bed got a switch hand and do the same

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.870 
bed got a switch hand and do the same
thing<00:02:47.489> as<00:02:47.640> on<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.880> size<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:49.170> over<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.530> top

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
thing as on that size and over the top

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.430 
thing as on that size and over the top
it's<00:02:50.880> out<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.239> question<00:02:51.269> as<00:02:52.110> soon<00:02:52.230> as<00:02:52.380> you

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
it's out of the question as soon as you

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.000 
it's out of the question as soon as you
start<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.680> come<00:02:52.830> up

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
start to come up

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.640 
start to come up
Hopper's<00:02:53.760> exposed<00:02:54.180> much<00:02:54.750> faster<00:02:55.320> before<00:02:55.560> my

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
Hopper's exposed much faster before my

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.430 
Hopper's exposed much faster before my
head<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.550> if<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:56.760> turn<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:57.030> sideways<00:02:57.440> take

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
head is and if I turn it sideways take

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.310 
head is and if I turn it sideways take
it<00:02:58.560> one<00:02:59.040> two<00:02:59.430> maybe<00:02:59.670> three<00:03:00.000> shots<00:03:00.300> off<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:01.260> I

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
it one two maybe three shots off and I

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.140 
it one two maybe three shots off and I
got<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.530> come<00:03:01.650> break<00:03:01.799> down<00:03:01.980> it's<00:03:02.760> useless

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
got to come break down it's useless

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.740 
got to come break down it's useless
we're<00:03:04.080> on<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.260> time<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:04.590> I'm<00:03:04.709> talking<00:03:04.860> about

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.070 

so<00:03:09.750> right<00:03:09.990> start<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:11.520> clean<00:03:11.700> out<00:03:11.880> yeah<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:12.900> can

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
so right start to clean out yeah I can

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.840 
so right start to clean out yeah I can
hit<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.320> here<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.920> yeah<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.310> might<00:03:14.520> be<00:03:14.640> hard<00:03:14.820> to

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
hit to here and yeah I might be hard to

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.170 
hit to here and yeah I might be hard to
hit<00:03:15.090> but<00:03:15.750> it's<00:03:15.990> much<00:03:16.140> bigger<00:03:16.320> profile<00:03:17.180> left

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
hit but it's much bigger profile left
