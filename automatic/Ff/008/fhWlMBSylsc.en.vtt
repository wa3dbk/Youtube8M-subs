00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.930 
production in electronic music those
kick<00:00:49.170> sounds<00:00:49.469> you've<00:00:49.620> been<00:00:49.860> raving<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.520> they

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
kick sounds you've been raving on they

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.270 
kick sounds you've been raving on they
actually<00:00:51.449> consist<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.140> maybe<00:00:52.649> five<00:00:53.039> or<00:00:53.070> six

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
actually consist of maybe five or six

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.400 
actually consist of maybe five or six
different<00:00:53.699> layers<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:54.539> layer<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.170> top

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
different layers one layer for the top

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.040 
different layers one layer for the top
and<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> attack<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.520> even<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.510> layer<00:00:57.750> like

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
and for the attack and even a layer like

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.670 
and for the attack and even a layer like
a<00:00:58.289> sine<00:00:58.710> wave<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.370> bottom<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.750> that's

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
a sine wave for the bottom and so that's

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.130 
a sine wave for the bottom and so that's
why<00:01:01.980> today<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.180> live<00:01:03.359> stage<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.110> should

why today on the live stage you should
be<00:01:04.530> able<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.860> reproduce<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> same<00:01:06.780> now

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
be able to reproduce and do the same now

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
layering is all about now let me switch

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.450 
layering is all about now let me switch
off<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> tm-2<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> drum<00:01:14.189> sound

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
off the tm-2 and this is the drum sound

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.510 
off the tm-2 and this is the drum sound
I<00:01:14.640> will<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:15.000> using<00:01:15.210> from<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> td-30<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.070> kick

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
I will be using from the td-30 a kick

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.350 
I will be using from the td-30 a kick
sound<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.979> snare<00:01:19.979> sound

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
sound a snare sound

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.780 
sound a snare sound
and<00:01:21.450> I'm<00:01:22.260> actually<00:01:22.620> layering<00:01:23.370> a<00:01:23.520> tambourine

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and I'm actually layering a tambourine

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.990 
and I'm actually layering a tambourine
of<00:01:24.180> my<00:01:24.540> hire<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.530> top<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.890> my<00:01:26.070> hi-hat<00:01:26.340> sound<00:01:26.700> so

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
of my hire on top of my hi-hat sound so

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.540 
of my hire on top of my hi-hat sound so
that's<00:01:27.300> that<00:01:27.780> already<00:01:28.230> is<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:29.220> layer

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
that's that already is like a layer

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.020 
that's that already is like a layer
because<00:01:30.300> you<00:01:30.420> combine<00:01:30.840> two<00:01:30.990> different<00:01:31.110> sound

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
because you combine two different sound

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:40.820 
because you combine two different sound
one<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.180> one<00:01:34.110> made<00:01:34.320> another<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:39.260> okay<00:01:40.260> now

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
one we one made another so okay now

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.020 
one we one made another so okay now
let's<00:01:41.550> switch<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.390> tm-2<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.700> do<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.820> same

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
let's switch on the tm-2 and do the same

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.020 
let's switch on the tm-2 and do the same
thing<00:01:45.650> this<00:01:46.650> is<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.890> kick<00:01:47.160> only<00:01:47.370> coming<00:01:47.790> from

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
thing this is the kick only coming from

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.610 
thing this is the kick only coming from
tm-2<00:01:49.760> it's<00:01:50.760> like<00:01:50.940> a<00:01:50.970> fat<00:01:51.360> cake<00:01:51.600> which<00:01:51.870> enhances

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
tm-2 it's like a fat cake which enhances

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.770 
tm-2 it's like a fat cake which enhances
the<00:01:52.680> attack<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.729> more<00:01:54.060> ambient<00:01:54.450> sound

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the attack and the more ambient sound

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.740 
the attack and the more ambient sound
coming<00:01:55.110> from<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.530> TV<00:01:55.680> 30<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.550> this<00:01:56.760> is<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:57.180> tm2

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
coming from the TV 30 so this is the tm2

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.520 
coming from the TV 30 so this is the tm2
only<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:59.180> now<00:02:00.180> combined<00:02:00.690> with<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:01.020> td-30

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
only and now combined with the td-30

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.969 
only and now combined with the td-30
kick<00:02:03.470> again<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.590> td-30<00:02:05.130> cake<00:02:05.400> by<00:02:05.580> itself

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
kick again the td-30 cake by itself

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.960 
kick again the td-30 cake by itself
now<00:02:07.979> with<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> tm-2<00:02:08.790> underneath<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> little

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
now with the tm-2 underneath so a little

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.160 
now with the tm-2 underneath so a little
bit<00:02:12.150> more<00:02:12.209> button

natural triggering because it actually

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.770 
natural triggering because it actually
