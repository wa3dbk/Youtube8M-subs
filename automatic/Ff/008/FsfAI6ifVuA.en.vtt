it's a hollow but the lettering here is
also<00:04:11.890> like<00:04:12.489> silverish<00:04:13.300> which<00:04:13.690> I<00:04:14.050> don't<00:04:14.440> think

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
broken promise does that and this I

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.500 
broken promise does that and this I

either<00:04:22.990> broken<00:04:23.410> promise<00:04:23.800> or<00:04:23.889> willow<00:04:24.070> fire

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
either broken promise or willow fire

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.390
