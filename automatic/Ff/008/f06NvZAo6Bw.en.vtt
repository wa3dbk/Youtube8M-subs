00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
braids but I did it this way because I

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.529 
braids but I did it this way because I
like<00:01:11.649> my<00:01:11.799> hair<00:01:11.829> fool<00:01:12.310> and<00:01:12.609> not<00:01:13.119> only<00:01:13.240> that<00:01:13.359> I

like my hair fool and not only that I

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:14.999 
like my hair fool and not only that I
knew<00:01:13.780> would<00:01:13.990> probably<00:01:14.439> take<00:01:14.679> me<00:01:14.799> a<00:01:14.859> little

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
knew would probably take me a little

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.859 
knew would probably take me a little
longer<00:01:15.159> being<00:01:15.639> that<00:01:15.850> I<00:01:15.880> have<00:01:16.119> much<00:01:16.420> more<00:01:16.600> hair

longer being that I have much more hair

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.139 
longer being that I have much more hair

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
than many people so um and saying that I

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.139 
than many people so um and saying that I
decided<00:01:22.779> to<00:01:23.079> do<00:01:23.259> it<00:01:23.499> and<00:01:23.799> I<00:01:24.009> enjoyed<00:01:24.579> it<00:01:24.759> I<00:01:24.909> I

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
decided to do it and I enjoyed it I I

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.249 
decided to do it and I enjoyed it I I
like<00:01:25.539> how<00:01:26.139> it<00:01:26.319> looks<00:01:26.499> I<00:01:26.829> enjoy<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.869> fact<00:01:28.899> that

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
like how it looks I enjoy the fact that

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.749 
like how it looks I enjoy the fact that
I<00:01:29.350> don't<00:01:29.560> have<00:01:29.619> to<00:01:29.740> do<00:01:29.920> my<00:01:30.069> hair<00:01:30.569> but<00:01:31.569> my<00:01:31.869> scalp

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
I don't have to do my hair but my scalp

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.879 
I don't have to do my hair but my scalp
it's<00:01:33.759> not<00:01:33.969> because<00:01:34.299> of<00:01:34.329> the<00:01:34.539> hair<00:01:34.859> because<00:01:35.859> I

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:35.889 
it's not because of the hair because I

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:38.160 
it's not because of the hair because I
did<00:01:36.159> do<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.459> apple<00:01:36.759> cider<00:01:36.939> vinegar<00:01:37.029> thing<00:01:37.899> I

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
did do the apple cider vinegar thing I

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.160 
did do the apple cider vinegar thing I
soaked<00:01:38.590> all<00:01:38.859> the<00:01:39.130> hair<00:01:39.340> all<00:01:39.639> seven<00:01:40.450> packs<00:01:40.840> of

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
soaked all the hair all seven packs of

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.449 
soaked all the hair all seven packs of
hair<00:01:41.950> um<00:01:42.539> in<00:01:43.539> apple<00:01:44.139> cider<00:01:44.349> vinegar<00:01:44.439> for<00:01:44.979> 15<00:01:45.340> to

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459 
hair um in apple cider vinegar for 15 to

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:47.069 
hair um in apple cider vinegar for 15 to
20<00:01:45.579> minutes<00:01:45.759> so<00:01:46.149> it's<00:01:46.299> not<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.539> hair<00:01:46.929> that's

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
20 minutes so it's not the hair that's

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.199 
20 minutes so it's not the hair that's
causing<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.770> irritation<00:01:48.369> to<00:01:48.399> my<00:01:48.639> scalp<00:01:49.029> is

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:49.209 
causing the irritation to my scalp is

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.779 
causing the irritation to my scalp is
actually<00:01:49.779> the<00:01:49.929> fact<00:01:50.169> that<00:01:50.289> I<00:01:50.409> normally<00:01:50.590> wet<00:01:51.549> my

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
actually the fact that I normally wet my

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.370 
actually the fact that I normally wet my
hair<00:01:52.079> within<00:01:53.079> every<00:01:53.729> two<00:01:54.729> to<00:01:54.759> three<00:01:54.880> days<00:01:55.380> um

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
hair within every two to three days um

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.580 
hair within every two to three days um
and<00:01:56.619> I<00:01:57.340> I'm<00:01:57.849> just<00:01:58.389> my<00:01:58.599> scalp<00:01:58.929> is<00:01:59.020> just<00:01:59.229> so<00:01:59.380> used

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
and I I'm just my scalp is just so used

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.889 
and I I'm just my scalp is just so used
to<00:01:59.889> it<00:01:59.919> so<00:02:00.659> I've<00:02:01.659> decided<00:02:01.959> that<00:02:02.849> maybe<00:02:03.849> I<00:02:04.299> may

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
to it so I've decided that maybe I may

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.290 
to it so I've decided that maybe I may
try<00:02:05.259> this<00:02:05.319> um<00:02:06.599> in<00:02:07.599> the<00:02:08.380> wintertime<00:02:09.239> when<00:02:10.239> it's

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
try this um in the wintertime when it's

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.370 
try this um in the wintertime when it's
not<00:02:10.720> as<00:02:11.700> when<00:02:12.700> it's<00:02:12.849> not<00:02:13.000> as<00:02:13.300> high

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
not as when it's not as high

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.270 
not as when it's not as high
so<00:02:16.010> I'll<00:02:16.610> probably<00:02:17.000> enjoy<00:02:17.690> much<00:02:18.500> more<00:02:18.830> than<00:02:19.250> I

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
so I'll probably enjoy much more than I

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.870 
so I'll probably enjoy much more than I
do<00:02:19.460> now<00:02:19.820> it's<00:02:20.210> just<00:02:20.480> way<00:02:20.840> too<00:02:20.900> hot<00:02:21.260> for<00:02:21.290> me<00:02:21.650> and

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
do now it's just way too hot for me and

put them very close together that's the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.910 
put them very close together that's the
reason<00:03:36.950> why<00:03:37.060> you<00:03:38.060> can't<00:03:38.360> really<00:03:38.630> I<00:03:39.020> mean<00:03:39.620> it's

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
reason why you can't really I mean it's

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.070 
reason why you can't really I mean it's
just<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:40.940> can<00:03:41.120> see<00:03:41.270> the<00:03:41.390> braids<00:03:41.630> they're<00:03:41.870> very

just you can see the braids they're very

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.220

small I cornrowed the some front very

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.760 
small I cornrowed the some front very
close<00:03:45.530> together<00:03:45.770> so<00:03:46.600> that<00:03:47.600> it<00:03:47.930> can<00:03:48.170> be<00:03:48.320> pretty

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
close together so that it can be pretty

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.680 
close together so that it can be pretty
much<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.670> know<00:03:50.800> like<00:03:52.090> you<00:03:53.090> can't<00:03:53.360> really<00:03:53.570> see

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
down so I'm thinking to myself I could I

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.430 
down so I'm thinking to myself I could I
couldn't<00:06:10.789> have<00:06:10.880> possibly<00:06:11.030> thought<00:06:11.599> that<00:06:12.260> this

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
couldn't have possibly thought that this

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.790 
couldn't have possibly thought that this
was<00:06:12.650> going<00:06:12.800> to<00:06:12.860> be<00:06:12.919> a<00:06:13.010> quick<00:06:13.250> process<00:06:13.280> for<00:06:14.030> me

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
was going to be a quick process for me

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.500 
was going to be a quick process for me
but<00:06:15.800> I<00:06:15.830> thought<00:06:16.310> it<00:06:16.580> and<00:06:16.820> I<00:06:17.090> got<00:06:17.270> quite

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
but I thought it and I got quite
