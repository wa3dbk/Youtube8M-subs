just a completely different experience

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.889 
just a completely different experience
I'm<00:00:34.860> used<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.160> being<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> only<00:00:35.670> one<00:00:35.910> who<00:00:36.630> is

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
I'm used to being the only one who is

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.500 
I'm used to being the only one who is
ever<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.350> know<00:00:37.410> what<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.710> was<00:00:37.829> doing<00:00:37.920> so

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
ever going to know what I was doing so

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.750 
ever going to know what I was doing so
there's<00:00:39.510> definitely<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:40.469> sense<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.280> let's<00:00:41.520> not

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
there's definitely a sense of let's not

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.630 
there's definitely a sense of let's not
do<00:00:41.879> anything<00:00:41.940> really<00:00:42.480> stupid<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:44.010> almost

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
do anything really stupid and I almost

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.100 
do anything really stupid and I almost
did<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:44.910> there<00:00:45.270> are<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> few<00:00:45.539> hands<00:00:45.840> I'd<00:00:45.930> like

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
did that there are a few hands I'd like

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.170

to<00:00:46.260> play<00:00:46.559> over<00:00:46.860> again<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.610> guess<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.090> all

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
to play over again but I guess it all

to play over again but I guess it all
worked<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> end<00:00:48.719> yeah<00:00:50.149> you<00:00:51.149> had<00:00:51.300> white

the<00:00:54.690> table<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.829> chip<00:00:56.100> leader<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:57.149> really

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the table as the chip leader is really

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.229 
the table as the chip leader is really
when<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.440> lost<00:00:58.800> some<00:00:59.010> kind<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.309> chips<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.940> you

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
when you lost some kind of chips and you

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.680

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
almost ambiguous because it was such a

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
um but what was really just tough for me

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.350 
um but what was really just tough for me
to<00:01:16.500> deal<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.159> I'd<00:01:17.820> been<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> chip

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
to deal with is is I'd been a chip

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.670 
to deal with is is I'd been a chip
leader<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.840> long<00:01:19.049> I've<00:01:19.259> been<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.439> very

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
leader for so long I've been a very

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.520 
leader for so long I've been a very
aggressive<00:01:19.979> style<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.000> then<00:01:21.299> suddenly<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.960> had

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
aggressive style and then suddenly I had

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.289 
aggressive style and then suddenly I had
to<00:01:22.650> completely<00:01:23.130> shift<00:01:23.490> gears<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.000> play

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
to completely shift gears and play

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.990 
to completely shift gears and play
defense<00:01:24.750> that's<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:26.369> hadn't<00:01:26.729> done<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.880> in

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
defense that's I just hadn't done it in

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.200 
defense that's I just hadn't done it in
a<00:01:27.090> while<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.750> did<00:01:28.290> really<00:01:28.729> work<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.880> do<00:01:30.000> that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
a while so I did really work to do that
