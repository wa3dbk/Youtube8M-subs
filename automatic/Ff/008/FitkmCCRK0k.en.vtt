00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:12.569 
we're going to see her some tuna today
I've<00:01:09.999> got<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.390> searing<00:01:10.780> station<00:01:11.200> on<00:01:11.380> my<00:01:11.590> weber

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
I've got the searing station on my weber

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:14.639 
I've got the searing station on my weber
grill<00:01:12.909> going<00:01:13.299> it's<00:01:13.689> been<00:01:13.899> going<00:01:14.140> for<00:01:14.229> about<00:01:14.289> 10

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
grill going it's been going for about 10

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.340 
grill going it's been going for about 10
minutes<00:01:14.859> now<00:01:15.009> and<00:01:15.429> it<00:01:15.820> was<00:01:16.030> at<00:01:16.329> 600<00:01:17.079> degrees

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
minutes now and it was at 600 degrees

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.029 
minutes now and it was at 600 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:17.789> so<00:01:18.899> the<00:01:19.899> idea<00:01:20.200> behind<00:01:20.350> this<00:01:20.799> is

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
Fahrenheit so the idea behind this is

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.679 
Fahrenheit so the idea behind this is
just<00:01:21.399> to<00:01:21.490> take<00:01:21.700> a<00:01:22.619> tuna<00:01:23.619> steak<00:01:23.859> and<00:01:24.689> we're

just to take a tuna steak and we're
going<00:01:25.899> to<00:01:25.990> sear<00:01:26.319> it<00:01:26.350> for<00:01:26.469> about<00:01:26.799> a<00:01:27.189> minute<00:01:27.460> or

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
going to sear it for about a minute or

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.260
