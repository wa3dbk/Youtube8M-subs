happening now as you can see I took out
the<00:00:06.359> old<00:00:06.390> system<00:00:07.220> with<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.340> plenty<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.790> cables

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
the old system with the plenty of cables

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.360 
the old system with the plenty of cables
we<00:00:12.030> got<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.420> antenna<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.740> reverse

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
we got the antenna and the reverse

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:23.200 
we got the antenna and the reverse
camera<00:00:16.970> and<00:00:17.970> there<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> hell<00:00:20.279> harness<00:00:21.210> for

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
camera and there is a hell harness for

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.420 
camera and there is a hell harness for
connection<00:00:24.210> with<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.539> new<00:00:24.720> system<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.949> I

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
connection with the new system that I I

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.980 
connection with the new system that I I
used<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.990> old<00:00:28.140> system<00:00:28.320> as<00:00:28.619> well<00:00:29.990> this

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
used it on the old system as well this

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.650 
used it on the old system as well this
one<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:32.450> the<00:00:33.450> new<00:00:33.660> Union<00:00:34.170> G<00:00:34.829> 2<00:00:35.040> 2<00:00:35.190> 1<00:00:35.370> 6<00:00:35.670> as<00:00:36.210> you

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
one is the new Union G 2 2 1 6 as you

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.900 
one is the new Union G 2 2 1 6 as you
can<00:00:36.870> see<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.829> brand<00:00:38.370> new

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
can see is brand new

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.030 
can see is brand new
I<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:39.360> plugged<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.110> cables<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.829> they

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
I just plugged in the cables that they

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.700 
I just plugged in the cables that they
came<00:00:41.250> from<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.550> box<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.420> I'll<00:00:43.079> start<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.469> put

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
came from the box and I'll start to put

00:00:43.710 --> 00:01:04.229 
came from the box and I'll start to put
all<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.399> cables<00:00:44.850> one<00:00:45.120> by<00:00:45.360> one<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:46.430> let's<00:00:47.430> start

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.890 

so<00:01:04.839> first<00:01:05.320> of<00:01:05.590> all<00:01:05.740> let's<00:01:06.400> put<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:10.360> main

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
so first of all let's put the main

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:26.990 
so first of all let's put the main
cables

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.540 

as<00:01:27.540> everyone<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:28.470> they<00:01:28.800> fit<00:01:29.010> straight

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
as everyone can see they fit straight

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.960 
as everyone can see they fit straight
away<00:01:30.470> because<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.620> knew<00:01:31.770> what<00:01:31.980> kind<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.370> harness

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
away because I knew what kind of harness

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.560 
away because I knew what kind of harness
to<00:01:33.270> get<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:35.400> now<00:01:35.880> let's<00:01:36.150> see<00:01:36.240> what<00:01:36.390> we<00:01:36.540> have

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
to get and now let's see what we have

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:44.810 
to get and now let's see what we have
here<00:01:36.860> we<00:01:37.860> were<00:01:38.040> seeing<00:01:40.370> breaking<00:01:43.640> we<00:01:44.640> need

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
here we were seeing breaking we need

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.420 
here we were seeing breaking we need
just<00:01:45.090> reverse<00:01:45.690> in<00:01:45.960> for<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> camera<00:01:48.110> that<00:01:49.110> I

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
just reverse in for the camera that I

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.640 
just reverse in for the camera that I
take<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.710> put<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:54.020> with<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.170> camera

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
take it and I put it with the camera

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.500 
take it and I put it with the camera
power<00:01:58.790> the<00:02:00.080> camera<00:02:01.080> power<00:02:01.440> comes<00:02:01.860> from<00:02:02.010> the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
power the camera power comes from the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:10.460 
power the camera power comes from the
reverse<00:02:03.510> lights<00:02:08.600> so<00:02:09.600> we<00:02:09.630> just<00:02:09.960> put<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.230> for<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
reverse lights so we just put it for the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.610 
reverse lights so we just put it for the
moment<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:11.010> the<00:02:11.400> power<00:02:11.720> lets<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.930> here<00:02:13.200> let's

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
moment just the power lets in here let's

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.330 
moment just the power lets in here let's
look<00:02:13.860> for<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.160> cable<00:02:14.490> for<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:16.340> reverse

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
look for the cable for the reverse

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:25.460 
look for the cable for the reverse
camera<00:02:17.670> camera<00:02:18.420> as<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:20.040> one<00:02:23.900> next<00:02:24.900> this

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
camera camera as in this one next this

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.760 
camera camera as in this one next this
is<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:26.120> radio<00:02:27.120> antenna<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.930> goes<00:02:28.260> here<00:02:28.530> in

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
is the radio antenna that goes here in

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.400 
is the radio antenna that goes here in
the<00:02:28.890> back

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.230 

what's<00:02:33.040> next<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:36.100> we<00:02:36.280> put<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.610> cable<00:02:37.000> for<00:02:37.120> the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
what's next so we put the cable for the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.100 
what's next so we put the cable for the
camera<00:02:38.070> or<00:02:39.070> let's<00:02:39.520> connect<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:41.220> iPod<00:02:43.110> and

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
camera or let's connect the iPod and

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.420 
camera or let's connect the iPod and
iPhone<00:02:44.530> cable<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.840> right<00:02:47.170> here

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430

since that we got the radio it's first
time<00:03:33.840> when<00:03:33.959> I'm<00:03:34.050> using<00:03:34.200> this<00:03:34.470> unit<00:03:34.860> so<00:03:35.069> I<00:03:35.250> don't

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
time when I'm using this unit so I don't

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.150 
time when I'm using this unit so I don't
know<00:03:35.490> how<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:35.730> use<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.270> I<00:03:36.830> didn't<00:03:37.830> went<00:03:38.010> through

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
know how to use it I didn't went through

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.660 
know how to use it I didn't went through
the<00:03:38.280> menu<00:03:38.580> so<00:03:39.150> let's<00:03:39.569> see
