00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
noise quite a bit better shots from the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.639 
noise quite a bit better shots from the
mark<00:00:43.050> two<00:00:43.290> at<00:00:43.649> 6,400<00:00:44.489> ISO<00:00:45.300> were<00:00:45.809> comparable<00:00:46.379> to

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
mark two at 6,400 ISO were comparable to

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.529 
mark two at 6,400 ISO were comparable to
the<00:00:46.770> market<00:00:47.190> three<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.700> iso<00:00:49.070> 25600<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.270> is

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the market three at iso 25600 so that is

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.310 
the market three at iso 25600 so that is
a<00:00:51.570> huge<00:00:52.410> improvement<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.750> 25600<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.989> oh<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
a huge improvement so 25600 is oh that

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.700 
a huge improvement so 25600 is oh that
is<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.620> insane<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:57.000> will<00:00:57.180> also<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.809> 3.2

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
is just insane this will also have a 3.2

six<00:01:19.110> frames<00:01:19.350> per<00:01:19.619> second<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.670> thing<00:01:20.909> will

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
six frames per second so this thing will

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.840 
six frames per second so this thing will
sound<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.380> machine<00:01:22.710> gun<00:01:23.189> when<00:01:23.729> you're

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
going off on the shutter this can also

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.200 
going off on the shutter this can also
capture<00:01:26.900> h.264<00:01:27.900> footage<00:01:28.290> at<00:01:28.500> 1080p<00:01:29.369> 30<00:01:29.939> frames

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
capture h.264 footage at 1080p 30 frames

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.080 
capture h.264 footage at 1080p 30 frames
per<00:01:30.299> second<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.869> 720p<00:01:31.680> 60<00:01:32.250> frames<00:01:32.520> per<00:01:32.579> second

this<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.509> also<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.869> first<00:01:34.229> EOS<00:01:34.860> camera<00:01:35.159> to

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
this is also the first EOS camera to

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.789 
this is also the first EOS camera to
