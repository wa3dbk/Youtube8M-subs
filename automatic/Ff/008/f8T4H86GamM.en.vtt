00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
object that is shaped this particular

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.780 
object that is shaped this particular
piece<00:00:31.099> needs<00:00:31.849> a<00:00:32.270> section<00:00:33.230> of<00:00:33.350> piping<00:00:33.800> sewn<00:00:34.190> to

piece needs a section of piping sewn to

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.700 
piece needs a section of piping sewn to
this<00:00:34.940> point<00:00:35.269> here<00:00:35.750> before<00:00:36.739> I<00:00:36.769> start<00:00:37.190> sewing<00:00:37.519> it

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
this point here before I start sewing it

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.069 
this point here before I start sewing it
to<00:00:39.710> my<00:00:39.890> shaped<00:00:40.340> object<00:00:43.660> now<00:00:44.660> you'll<00:00:44.809> notice

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
to my shaped object now you'll notice

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.840 
to my shaped object now you'll notice
I'm<00:00:45.440> using<00:00:45.469> a<00:00:45.949> tunnel<00:00:46.370> foot<00:00:47.199> so<00:00:48.399> it's<00:00:49.399> allowing

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
I'm using a tunnel foot so it's allowing

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.139 
I'm using a tunnel foot so it's allowing
me<00:00:50.059> to<00:00:50.210> sew<00:00:51.109> the<00:00:51.320> piping<00:00:51.530> or<00:00:52.039> make<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.609> piping

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
me to sew the piping or make the piping

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:00.220 
me to sew the piping or make the piping
as<00:00:53.359> I<00:00:54.320> go<00:00:54.559> along<00:00:58.030> now<00:00:59.030> what<00:00:59.210> I'm<00:00:59.329> able<00:00:59.510> to<00:00:59.719> do<00:01:00.050> by

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
as I go along now what I'm able to do by

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.340 
as I go along now what I'm able to do by
doing<00:01:00.289> this<00:01:00.859> is<00:01:01.159> keep<00:01:01.609> I've<00:01:02.480> cut<00:01:02.749> my<00:01:02.899> piping

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
doing this is keep I've cut my piping

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.910 
doing this is keep I've cut my piping
just<00:01:03.649> the<00:01:03.769> right<00:01:03.949> size<00:01:04.280> my<00:01:04.970> piping<00:01:05.920> fabric

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
just the right size my piping fabric

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.880 
just the right size my piping fabric
just<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.400> right<00:01:07.580> size<00:01:07.990> so<00:01:08.990> that<00:01:09.200> when<00:01:09.380> I<00:01:09.410> fold

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
just the right size so that when I fold

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.150 
just the right size so that when I fold
it<00:01:10.160> around<00:01:10.370> my<00:01:11.150> piping<00:01:11.690> cord<00:01:12.040> it'll<00:01:13.040> actually

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
it around my piping cord it'll actually

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.850 
it around my piping cord it'll actually
give<00:01:13.550> me<00:01:13.790> a<00:01:14.000> perfect<00:01:14.720> seam<00:01:14.990> allowance<00:01:15.500> so<00:01:15.800> I'm

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
give me a perfect seam allowance so I'm

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.920 
give me a perfect seam allowance so I'm
keeping<00:01:16.310> my<00:01:16.430> piping<00:01:16.970> straight<00:01:17.420> out<00:01:17.660> in<00:01:17.900> front
