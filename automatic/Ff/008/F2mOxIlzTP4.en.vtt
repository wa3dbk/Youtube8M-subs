00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 welcome meet to today 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.920
 a new video and as you could 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.660
 see it in the title it's a 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.030
 james labyrinth video task 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.950
 do not I 'm going to talk to you a little bit about 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.900
 movie book but it might be a 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.429
 pretty short video because for everything 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.920
 tell you I do not necessarily have a lot of 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.900
 memories of the book so to make you 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.090
 a comparison books safe movies 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.560
 to be very complicated while waiting so 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.570
 I present you the book if you do not 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.460
 have not seen it yet so this is the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.050
 labyrinth the test the volume 1 of james 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.300
 published by the dash pocket youth 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.980
 this cover is a reissue of 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.710
 book to the three volumes have been reissued 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.899
 on the occasion of the film's 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.899
 previous cover was slightly 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.579
 not different either it's not a 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.809
 difference that we really see bambam 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.460
 in the eye but it's true that I 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.050
 still prefer this one so here's 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.180
 the movie is coming out today or at least the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.410
 day I'm posting the video no I got 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.140
 said that it would be a good idea to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.090
 celebrate the release of the film with a small 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.260
 video for the least of the book if you 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.579
 had been following me for a while at the same 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.620
 since a few weeks only 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.100
 you know that the book I'm not watching 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.890
 necessarily a more memorable memory than 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.110
 that when I read it I had rather 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.750
 liked but I was very frustrated 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.810
 by the end in hindsight I do not 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.950
 do not necessarily remember everything and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.930
 anyway I do not even remember 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.080
 necessarily m attached to the characters more 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.340
 that and especially again the end 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.600
 for me was too much driven by 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.350
 hair and it did not make me want 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.670
 to read more 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.470
 I thought it was a little bit 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.390
 arrived a little bit very 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.770
 weird rather poorly exploited and especially 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.390
 it made me think a bit about everything 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.799
 which is done today and I found 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.189
 that it was a shame to have to wear this 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.600
 element there at the heart of the story in 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.470
 finally turns it good I can not you 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.939
 really explain the story 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.740
 if you have not read it yet I will 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.320
 not spoil you but suddenly they are 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.000
 have mixed a few things in 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.939
 same time the labyrinth more 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.610
 thing and that's it for me the mix was 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.030
 not necessarily very good but it's true 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.680
 that the fact that I hear a lot 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.990
 talking about sam might have made you want 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.700
 to read it again from him 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.290
 give it a chance and read more 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.549
 unfortunately it did not happen I 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.299
 not have time to read it again before 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.890
 movie release 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.500
 and in addition I was invited to see him 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.640
 during an organized screening pocket 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.900
 youth because this year it's 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.190
 their 20 years so they do a little bit 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.390
 things big even though I suppose 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.280
 they go things big each 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.599
 year but hey it's a bit the only one 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.830
 year for the moment when I can see that 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.810
 and suddenly it so I was invited 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.489
 a projection that took place on the 6th 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.660
 October 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.060
 and besides the film is in French 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.319
 so how do you say that you just saw 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.910
 I was very skeptical that I 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.650
 said it was not passed 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.569
 since the book but not me 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.769
 necessarily more than that and then 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.080
 finally I must confess that I have 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.069
 been pleasantly surprised after seeing 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.660
 the film I still have the same problem 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.269
 regarding the end I have to you 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.830
 to say that it is by delivering film all this 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.750
 that you want and I find that it's 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.720
 quite poorly exploited even though in the movie 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.930
 I think we understand a whole 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.090
 little bit better than in the book but 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.680
 I found that the characters the seven 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.099
 hours was absolutely perfect in 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.110
 their role 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.549
 I had never seen dano brian because 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.489
 I will not watch will skate done that's true 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.680
 that finally had never been more 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.640
 the eye than that and I was impressed 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.670
 by his actor acting for the shot thanks 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.140
 to all these actors and thanks to the 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.579
 filming 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.709
 I must tell you that the film is 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.450
 really oppressive we really feel 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.400
 in a labyrinth so for once the 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.049
 day I saw I already felt not 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.920
 well so on leaving the room I 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.510
 thought I was going to faint but for the 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.410
 it was well done because 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.019
 I guess it's a little bit 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.220
 the effect he wanted to have 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.690
 after I can actually still a 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.190
 time not tell you about the comparison 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.890
 between the book and the movie because I have 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.329
 forgot the details but from what we 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.209
 told me from the people who read it 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.519
 recently the book and the film in 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.709
 rather important differences 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.420
 now what can I tell you 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.430
 with the eye of someone who's her 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.780
 a long time ago that does not necessarily make the 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.130
 movie less well if you see what I 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.329
 mean I find that the film in 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.260
 himself for someone for example 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.900
 did not read the book will be very 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.079
 a fact and for someone who read it and 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.340
 who is really very fond of the book bah 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.870
 I think it will still be good 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.319
 also finally I think we really 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:14.519
 this atmosphere a bit terrifying and at 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.810
 the survival times fine and that's a good 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.579
 movie and I think a good adaptation 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.919
 because for me who have not necessarily 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.959
 more hooked to the book I loved the 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.310
 movie somehow even though 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.500
 again I did not like the end 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.910
 but suddenly it really made me want 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.900
 to read more for power there is 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.210
 while the books did not have 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.430
 necessarily made me want the film gave me 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.470
 envy and I became more attached to 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.180
 characters with the movie so I you 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.580
 really advise to go there 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.500
 even though like me you may have had a 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.910
 mixed opinion about the book or if you 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.800
 loved it anyway i'm sure 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.050
 that you will see him I have a lot more 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.970
 enjoyed the film as the book on time 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.639
 of today but I really count the 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.440
 reread because maybe I 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.240
 did not necessarily have him when I was 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.590
 in the best of moods and blow 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.600
 maybe I've zapped some 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.789
 things here I do not know exactly 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.380
 why did not it really 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.389
 at the time why is it a bit more 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.710
 done now and actually I 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.789
 presumes answers are made 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.919
 in the following volumes 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.990
 so we'll see but it's true that 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.820
 any case for the film I recommend you 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.520
 to go see him because he's really 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.289
 very well done even in French I have not 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.820
 had too much trouble with them so that's 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.890
 still 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.420
 it's to tell you because as far as 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.550
 I 'm watching myself that movies 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.970
 the series in English if I can not 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.130
 avoid 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.600
 if they want to avoid I do not know anymore 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.780
 how do you say it's not serious but 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.760
 here after I was so focused 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.440
 on that oppressive side on this side 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.970
 labyrinth that I do not remember 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.920
 necessarily details like music 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.180
 or that stuff but I do not think so 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.070
 that it was a problem I think 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.990
 it was pretty well done by the way 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:48.420
 suppose the sound contributed to this 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.800
 feeling of oppression it was really 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.240
 terrifying in some way late 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.970
 I really felt like 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.410
 in the bilingual must avoid 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.030
 scared claws when they left the 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.350
 night in no no that's what 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.120
 about the movie was rather a 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.770
 success I will return to see him by 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.150
 against this time here you go 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.620
 for a delight shot I'm sorry this 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.910
 was not necessarily very popular or 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.740
 again I remember even more 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.030
 necessarily not book when a 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.440
 comparison I could not you 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.480
 do but I sincerely invite you to 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.310
 to go see the movie because it was not 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.380
 badly and it made me want to read the 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.260
 so what's the use sometimes 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.490
 to go see the adaptations and for 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.380
 celebrate it 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.690
 on the occasion of the projection they 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.760
 offered a goodie bag with the book 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.470
 gold I already have goodie bag and I already know 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.080
 book so I thought I was going 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.630
 make it win to someone so to one 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.130
 of you so I show you the rate 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.350
 de bach is like that so pocket 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.430
 youth with I do not know what is 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.040
 written behind is always going pocket 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.480
 youth and pocket youth website 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.640
 his weak to summon youth 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.010
 in the same sentence it does not matter and 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.290
 so here's the book it's the same as the 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.030
 mine simply the reissue so 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.320
 if you want to win seven copies 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.050
 and this little bag 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.520
 I invite you to like this video at 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.889
 to be subscribed to my 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.610
 youtube channel obviously and to leave 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:03.379
 a comment with the hashtag the 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.330
 labyrinth 

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:07.800
 finally too regional if you participate 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.360
 because I presume, though, that 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.389
 many of you already have it so I 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.960
 I'm sorry it happens a little late but 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:17.520
 good god did not have it before so here it is 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.900
 if you want to participate because 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.590
 that you are not obliged but if you 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.900
 want to participate 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.650
 add the hashtag labyrinth to the 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.889
 end of your comment 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:28.800
 like that I know you that you will be 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:30.419
 a participant if you still feel bad 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.889
 hard enough 

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:33.870
 so that's it for this video 

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:35.639
 I invite you all strongly to go 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.470
 see the movie I hope you like it 

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:39.419
 do not hesitate to give me your opinion on 

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.909
 the dense film that you've seen and at 

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:43.259
 give me your opinion on the series because 

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:45.509
 that it's true I know it anyway 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.949
 more people who loved it but I 

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:49.259
 will not be too much alone 

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:50.400
 to have been mixed not seen here 

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:53.389
 finds himself very quickly for a next 

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.389
 barrel video
