here is perhaps a farmer's field and
he's<00:00:22.130> got<00:00:22.279> some<00:00:22.430> crops<00:00:22.699> growing<00:00:23.000> in<00:00:23.119> it<00:00:23.210> what

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
he's got some crops growing in it what

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.919 
he's got some crops growing in it what
that<00:00:23.779> is<00:00:25.029> wheat<00:00:26.029> or<00:00:26.240> barley<00:00:26.269> doesn't<00:00:26.779> matter

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:26.929 
that is wheat or barley doesn't matter

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.099 
that is wheat or barley doesn't matter
and<00:00:27.260> we've<00:00:27.529> got<00:00:27.679> a<00:00:27.710> pond<00:00:27.980> nearby<00:00:28.250> or<00:00:28.519> a<00:00:28.550> stream

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
and we've got a pond nearby or a stream

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.040 
and we've got a pond nearby or a stream
and<00:00:30.109> we've<00:00:30.199> got<00:00:30.349> some<00:00:30.529> plants<00:00:30.830> in<00:00:31.070> there<00:00:32.050> weeds

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
and we've got some plants in there weeds

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.440 
and we've got some plants in there weeds
and<00:00:33.260> things<00:00:33.500> water<00:00:33.860> weeds<00:00:34.220> on<00:00:34.610> weed<00:00:34.879> and<00:00:35.210> maybe

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
and things water weeds on weed and maybe

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.660 
and things water weeds on weed and maybe
a<00:00:35.540> bit<00:00:35.629> balki<00:00:35.989> know<00:00:36.530> what<00:00:37.160> the<00:00:37.250> file<00:00:37.460> will<00:00:37.610> be

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
a bit balki know what the file will be

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.010 
a bit balki know what the file will be
doing<00:00:37.969> is<00:00:38.090> they'll<00:00:38.510> be<00:00:38.540> putting<00:00:38.780> fertilizer

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
doing is they'll be putting fertilizer

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.250 
doing is they'll be putting fertilizer
on<00:00:39.610> the<00:00:40.610> crop<00:00:40.820> now<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:41.570> problem<00:00:41.960> is<00:00:42.050> that

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
on the crop now the problem is that

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.380 
on the crop now the problem is that
fertilizer<00:00:42.800> well<00:00:43.670> let's<00:00:43.820> go<00:00:43.910> to<00:00:43.969> the<00:00:44.059> plants

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
fertilizer well let's go to the plants

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.450 
fertilizer well let's go to the plants
that<00:00:44.420> let<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:44.750> plants<00:00:45.050> grow<00:00:45.320> it<00:00:46.070> will<00:00:46.280> just

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
that let the plants grow it will just

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.950 
that let the plants grow it will just
make<00:00:46.610> these<00:00:46.820> plants<00:00:47.180> grow<00:00:47.239> make<00:00:47.539> any<00:00:47.690> plugs

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
make these plants grow make any plugs

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.229 
make these plants grow make any plugs
grow<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:48.469> if<00:00:48.559> any<00:00:48.680> of<00:00:48.800> that<00:00:48.949> fertilizer<00:00:49.760> ends

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
grow so if any of that fertilizer ends

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.470 
grow so if any of that fertilizer ends
up<00:00:50.329> in<00:00:50.449> the<00:00:50.539> water<00:00:51.610> then<00:00:52.610> any<00:00:52.760> plants<00:00:53.239> in<00:00:53.329> here

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
up in the water then any plants in here

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.689 
up in the water then any plants in here
will<00:00:53.690> also<00:00:54.109> gain<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:54.920> benefit<00:00:55.399> and<00:00:55.460> start

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
will also gain the benefit and start

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:56.889 
will also gain the benefit and start
growing<00:00:55.940> more<00:00:56.180> now<00:00:56.420> why<00:00:56.629> would<00:00:56.809> the

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
growing more now why would the

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.450 
growing more now why would the
fertilizer<00:00:57.320> go<00:00:57.530> in<00:00:57.590> there<00:00:57.800> well<00:00:58.190> it<00:00:58.309> gets

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
fertilizer go in there well it gets

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.420 
fertilizer go in there well it gets
washed<00:00:58.699> in<00:00:58.969> when<00:00:59.809> it<00:00:59.899> rains<00:01:00.199> or<00:01:00.590> eventually

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
washed in when it rains or eventually

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.160 
washed in when it rains or eventually
this<00:01:01.820> stuff<00:01:02.120> sucks<00:01:02.390> into<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:02.719> soil<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.109> it

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
this stuff sucks into the soil and it

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.630 
this stuff sucks into the soil and it
gets<00:01:03.379> its<00:01:03.559> way<00:01:03.710> into<00:01:03.800> the<00:01:03.920> waterways<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:04.430> the

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
gets its way into the waterways and the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.600 
gets its way into the waterways and the
rivers<00:01:04.910> and<00:01:05.059> so<00:01:05.180> on<00:01:05.320> now<00:01:06.320> as<00:01:07.070> soon<00:01:07.220> as<00:01:07.310> it's<00:01:07.460> in

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
rivers and so on now as soon as it's in

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.700 
rivers and so on now as soon as it's in
there<00:01:07.850> it's<00:01:08.480> going<00:01:08.690> to<00:01:08.750> do<00:01:08.840> its<00:01:08.960> job<00:01:09.140> oh<00:01:09.350> by<00:01:09.680> the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
there it's going to do its job oh by the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.380 
there it's going to do its job oh by the
way<00:01:09.830> it<00:01:09.950> should<00:01:10.010> actually<00:01:10.280> say<00:01:10.640> particularly

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
way it should actually say particularly

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.710 
way it should actually say particularly
the<00:01:11.690> problem<00:01:12.020> is<00:01:12.110> nitrates<00:01:12.770> here<00:01:13.220> and

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
the problem is nitrates here and

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.590 
the problem is nitrates here and
phosphates<00:01:14.800> groups<00:01:15.800> of<00:01:15.950> chemicals<00:01:16.600> commonly

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
phosphates groups of chemicals commonly

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.810 
phosphates groups of chemicals commonly
found<00:01:17.900> in<00:01:18.110> fertilizers<00:01:18.950> are<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.400> two<00:01:19.580> key

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
found in fertilizers are the two key

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.640 
found in fertilizers are the two key
ones<00:01:19.970> I<00:01:20.300> mention<00:01:21.230> this<00:01:21.320> because<00:01:21.380> you

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
ones I mention this because you

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.190 
ones I mention this because you
sometimes<00:01:21.860> get<00:01:22.390> these<00:01:23.390> in<00:01:23.570> other<00:01:23.690> chemicals

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
sometimes get these in other chemicals

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.870 
sometimes get these in other chemicals
as<00:01:24.350> well<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:24.770> things<00:01:24.950> like<00:01:25.040> wash<00:01:25.310> powders<00:01:25.700> and

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
as well so things like wash powders and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.180 
as well so things like wash powders and
things<00:01:25.940> contain<00:01:26.390> phosphates<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.140> they<00:01:28.010> also

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
things contain phosphates and they also

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.220 
things contain phosphates and they also
can<00:01:28.430> get<00:01:28.550> washing<00:01:28.790> anyone<00:01:29.180> let's<00:01:30.020> put<00:01:30.200> a

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
can get washing anyone let's put a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.610 
can get washing anyone let's put a
little<00:01:30.380> fish<00:01:30.680> in<00:01:30.830> here<00:01:31.010> why<00:01:31.250> not<00:01:32.500> that's<00:01:33.500> a

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
little fish in here why not that's a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.710 
little fish in here why not that's a
couple<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:33.980> them<00:01:34.210> and<00:01:35.210> they<00:01:35.330> are<00:01:35.360> happily

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
couple of them and they are happily

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.990 
couple of them and they are happily
swimming<00:01:36.170> along<00:01:36.380> doing<00:01:37.370> their<00:01:37.580> fishy<00:01:37.850> things

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
swimming along doing their fishy things

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.040 
swimming along doing their fishy things
and<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.920> fertilizer<00:01:40.400> will<00:01:40.610> make<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:41.050> the

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
and the fertilizer will make the the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.650 
and the fertilizer will make the the
plants<00:01:42.380> in<00:01:42.470> here<00:01:42.620> grow<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.670> what<00:01:44.180> we<00:01:44.300> get<00:01:44.510> is

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
plants in here grow so what we get is

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.580 
plants in here grow so what we get is
suddenly<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.350> lot<00:01:45.860> of<00:01:45.980> pond<00:01:46.880> weed<00:01:47.210> this<00:01:48.140> thick

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
suddenly a lot of pond weed this thick

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.160 
suddenly a lot of pond weed this thick
greenish<00:01:49.190> stuff<00:01:49.540> in<00:01:50.540> fact<00:01:50.750> these<00:01:50.870> are<00:01:50.990> called

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
greenish stuff in fact these are called

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.970 
greenish stuff in fact these are called
algal<00:01:51.650> blooms<00:01:52.040> when<00:01:52.670> algae<00:01:53.500> so<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.590> grow<00:01:54.740> very

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
algal blooms when algae so it grow very

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.620 
algal blooms when algae so it grow very
quickly<00:01:55.220> it's<00:01:55.460> called<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.670> bloom<00:01:55.940> you<00:01:56.510> get

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
quickly it's called the bloom you get

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.450 
quickly it's called the bloom you get
these<00:01:56.810> things<00:01:56.990> at<00:01:57.200> sea<00:01:57.470> as<00:01:57.590> well<00:01:57.830> and<00:01:57.980> they're

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
these things at sea as well and they're

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.440 
these things at sea as well and they're
huge<00:01:58.790> things<00:01:59.860> sudden<00:02:00.860> bursts<00:02:01.220> of<00:02:01.310> growth<00:02:01.670> and

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
huge things sudden bursts of growth and

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.450 
huge things sudden bursts of growth and
perhaps<00:02:02.780> or<00:02:02.930> other<00:02:03.470> plants<00:02:03.860> he'll<00:02:04.070> start

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
perhaps or other plants he'll start

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.370 
perhaps or other plants he'll start
growing<00:02:04.760> a<00:02:04.820> bit<00:02:04.940> well<00:02:05.120> now<00:02:05.870> it<00:02:06.080> there's

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
growing a bit well now it there's

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.660 
growing a bit well now it there's
nothing<00:02:06.650> toxic<00:02:07.130> here<00:02:07.220> this<00:02:07.340> is<00:02:07.430> where<00:02:07.580> the

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
nothing toxic here this is where the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.760 
nothing toxic here this is where the
mistake<00:02:07.790> comes<00:02:08.239> people<00:02:08.629> think<00:02:08.869> that<00:02:09.080> the

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
mistake comes people think that the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.370 
mistake comes people think that the
fertilizer<00:02:10.489> is<00:02:10.700> in<00:02:10.820> some<00:02:11.030> way<00:02:11.240> toxic<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.320> is

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
fertilizer is in some way toxic and is

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.410 
fertilizer is in some way toxic and is
damaging<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.370> life<00:02:13.550> in<00:02:13.790> here<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.030> is<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.300> all

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
damaging the life in here it is and all

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.300 
damaging the life in here it is and all
it's<00:02:14.570> doing<00:02:14.630> is<00:02:14.780> its<00:02:14.960> making

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
it's doing is its making

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.170 
it's doing is its making
one<00:02:15.490> scrub<00:02:16.000> now<00:02:16.810> of<00:02:16.959> course<00:02:17.760> big<00:02:18.760> natural

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
one scrub now of course big natural

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.309 
one scrub now of course big natural
things<00:02:19.420> these<00:02:19.690> plants<00:02:20.080> won't<00:02:20.230> grow<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:22.290> got<00:02:23.290> a

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
things these plants won't grow and got a

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.080 
things these plants won't grow and got a
life<00:02:23.560> cycle<00:02:23.770> then<00:02:24.010> they'll<00:02:24.160> die<00:02:24.370> now<00:02:24.880> when

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
life cycle then they'll die now when

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.910 
life cycle then they'll die now when
they<00:02:25.180> die<00:02:25.450> they<00:02:25.840> will<00:02:25.959> start<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.440> rot<00:02:26.650> and

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
they die they will start to rot and

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.800 
they die they will start to rot and
here's<00:02:27.760> where<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.000> problem<00:02:28.330> comes<00:02:28.480> because

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
here's where the problem comes because

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.210 
here's where the problem comes because
the<00:02:28.930> rotting<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.680> done<00:02:29.890> by<00:02:30.100> bacteria<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:32.220> the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
the rotting is done by bacteria and the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.770 
the rotting is done by bacteria and the
bacteria<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.850> course<00:02:34.060> when<00:02:34.270> we<00:02:34.600> talk<00:02:34.750> about

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
bacteria of course when we talk about

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.470 
bacteria of course when we talk about
rotting<00:02:35.380> things<00:02:35.650> it's<00:02:36.280> really<00:02:36.400> just<00:02:36.760> bacteria

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
rotting things it's really just bacteria

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.090 
rotting things it's really just bacteria
feeding<00:02:38.080> it's<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.440> that's<00:02:38.650> what<00:02:38.770> they<00:02:38.890> feed

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
feeding it's that that's what they feed

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.610 
feeding it's that that's what they feed
on<00:02:39.130> this<00:02:39.340> raw<00:02:39.520> material<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.620> bacteria

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
on this raw material and the bacteria

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.380 
on this raw material and the bacteria
will<00:02:42.280> be<00:02:42.400> respiring<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.880> respiration

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
will be respiring and the respiration

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.880 
will be respiring and the respiration
requires<00:02:46.600> oxygen<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.790> what<00:02:48.970> we've<00:02:49.090> got<00:02:49.239> now<00:02:49.450> is

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
requires oxygen so what we've got now is

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.440 
requires oxygen so what we've got now is
kind<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:50.950> waterway<00:02:51.580> that's<00:02:51.910> full<00:02:52.300> of<00:02:53.220> decaying

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
kind of waterway that's full of decaying

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.100 
kind of waterway that's full of decaying
dead<00:02:55.450> plant<00:02:55.840> material<00:02:57.540> all<00:02:58.540> chuck<00:02:58.900> in<00:02:59.080> the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
dead plant material all chuck in the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.440 
dead plant material all chuck in the
bottom<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.620> we've<00:03:00.430> got<00:03:00.550> all<00:03:00.670> these<00:03:00.790> bacteria

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
bottom and we've got all these bacteria

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.559 
bottom and we've got all these bacteria
in<00:03:01.480> here<00:03:01.780> that<00:03:02.380> are<00:03:02.500> using<00:03:02.860> up<00:03:03.010> all<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:04.450> oxygen

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
in here that are using up all the oxygen

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.500 
in here that are using up all the oxygen
and<00:03:05.700> that's<00:03:06.700> where<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.060> problem<00:03:07.360> comes

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
and that's where the problem comes

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.360 
and that's where the problem comes
there's<00:03:07.959> not<00:03:08.260> enough<00:03:08.440> oxygen<00:03:08.590> left<00:03:09.100> actually

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
there's not enough oxygen left actually

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.979 
there's not enough oxygen left actually
dissolved<00:03:10.030> in<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.209> water<00:03:10.390> so<00:03:11.290> our<00:03:11.500> pull<00:03:12.069> fish

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
dissolved in the water so our pull fish

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.680 
dissolved in the water so our pull fish
will<00:03:13.989> die<00:03:14.019> and<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:15.640> end<00:03:15.819> up<00:03:15.970> eventually<00:03:16.269> for

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
will die and you end up eventually for

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.660 
will die and you end up eventually for
you<00:03:16.780> you<00:03:17.019> don't<00:03:17.200> try<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.470> stop<00:03:18.069> this<00:03:18.280> with

appalling horrible water but certainly

not the kind of clean water that you

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.740 
not the kind of clean water that you

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
like so do be careful it's an easy trap

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.600 
like so do be careful it's an easy trap
to<00:03:37.930> fall<00:03:38.079> into<00:03:38.260> it's<00:03:39.130> not<00:03:39.489> that<00:03:39.730> the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
to fall into it's not that the

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.099 
to fall into it's not that the
fertilizer<00:03:42.610> in<00:03:42.730> some<00:03:42.940> way<00:03:43.090> kills<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.720> animals

fertilizer in some way kills the animals

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.470 
fertilizer in some way kills the animals
in<00:03:44.290> there<00:03:44.470> it's<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.400> bacteria<00:03:46.180> that<00:03:46.239> are

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
in there it's that the bacteria that are

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.940 
in there it's that the bacteria that are
decaying<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.959> plants<00:03:47.290> use<00:03:47.500> up<00:03:47.680> all<00:03:47.829> the
