the<00:00:12.840> recording<00:00:13.559> engineer<00:00:13.950> will<00:00:14.160> record<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
the recording engineer will record the

the recording engineer will record the
top<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.059> snare<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.599> bottom<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> snare

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
top of a snare and the bottom of a snare

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.519 
top of a snare and the bottom of a snare
and<00:00:16.680> our<00:00:16.800> tendency<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:18.029> just<00:00:18.720> pull<00:00:19.020> both

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
and our tendency is to just pull both

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.980 
and our tendency is to just pull both
snares<00:00:19.949> up<00:00:20.250> until<00:00:20.789> we<00:00:21.359> get<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> good<00:00:21.840> balance

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
snares up until we get a good balance

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.470 
snares up until we get a good balance
but<00:00:22.859> let<00:00:23.010> me<00:00:23.039> show<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.340> what<00:00:23.699> happens<00:00:24.150> more

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
but let me show you what happens more

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.150 
but let me show you what happens more
often<00:00:24.689> than<00:00:24.900> not<00:00:25.640> this<00:00:26.640> snare<00:00:27.000> drum<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:28.130> out<00:00:29.130> of

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
often than not this snare drum is out of

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.450 
often than not this snare drum is out of
line<00:00:29.960> if<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.109> look<00:00:31.349> close<00:00:31.830> enough<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.160> can

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
line if you look close enough you can

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.920 
line if you look close enough you can
see<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.030> top<00:00:33.300> snare<00:00:33.800> arrived<00:00:35.930> earlier

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
see that the top snare arrived earlier

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.380 
see that the top snare arrived earlier
than<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.649> bottom<00:00:37.800> snare<00:00:38.420> furthermore<00:00:39.420> I

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
than the bottom snare furthermore I

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.670 
than the bottom snare furthermore I
believe<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.570> be<00:00:42.600> out<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.840> phase<00:00:43.079> because

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
believe it to be out of phase because

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.270 
believe it to be out of phase because
the<00:00:43.950> first<00:00:44.760> impulse<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.450> down<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:47.039> top

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
the first impulse is down on the top

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.110 
the first impulse is down on the top
snare<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.850> up<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.110> bottom<00:00:49.770> snare<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:51.059> I'm

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
snare and up on the bottom snare so I'm

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.430 
snare and up on the bottom snare so I'm
going<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.360> show<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.570> how<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.780> correct<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
going to show you how to correct that

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
going to show you how to correct that
and<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.949> want<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.640> hear<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.940> difference<00:00:54.420> in

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and I want you to hear the difference in

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
okay so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.880 
okay so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.860> hit<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.400> button<00:01:29.790> or<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.380> key

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
going to hit the a button or the a key

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.030 
going to hit the a button or the a key
with<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.460> focus<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.560> it'll<00:01:34.710> slide

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
with this focus on so that it'll slide

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.130 
with this focus on so that it'll slide
left<00:01:35.400> because<00:01:35.790> right<00:01:36.000> now<00:01:36.030> its<00:01:36.420> consolidated

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
left because right now its consolidated

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.429 
left because right now its consolidated
to<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> far<00:01:38.579> left<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> session<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.409> we

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
to the far left of the session so we

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.740 
to the far left of the session so we
won't<00:01:40.710> be<00:01:40.829> able<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.040> slide<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.570> first

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
won't be able to slide it so the first

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.630 
won't be able to slide it so the first
thing<00:01:42.810> we're<00:01:43.049> going<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.710> going<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.399> pull

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
difference in the two snares this snare

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.210 
difference in the two snares this snare
here<00:02:31.000> seems<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.330> be<00:02:32.960> balanced<00:02:33.530> in<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.770> mix<00:02:33.980> it

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
here seems to be balanced in the mix it

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.220 
here seems to be balanced in the mix it
seems<00:02:34.460> to<00:02:34.610> find<00:02:34.850> a<00:02:35.000> good<00:02:35.180> place<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.630> lay<00:02:35.870> now

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
seems to find a good place to lay now

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:43.390 
seems to find a good place to lay now
this<00:02:36.380> is<00:02:36.440> with<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.890> untouched<00:02:37.490> snare<00:02:42.400> snare

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
this is with the untouched snare snare

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.940 
this is with the untouched snare snare
tends<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:44.120> sound<00:02:44.360> little<00:02:44.690> thin<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.410> wispy<00:02:45.590> and

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
tends to sound little thin and wispy and

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.010 
tends to sound little thin and wispy and
it's<00:02:46.100> because<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.580> bottom<00:02:46.790> snare<00:02:47.330> mic<00:02:47.750> is

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
it's because the bottom snare mic is

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.590 
it's because the bottom snare mic is
working<00:02:48.370> against<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.490> top<00:02:49.700> snare<00:02:50.060> mic<00:02:50.270> so

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
working against the top snare mic so

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.790 
working against the top snare mic so
listen<00:02:50.960> to<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:52.150> if<00:02:53.150> you'll<00:02:53.300> look<00:02:53.540> here<00:02:53.800> you'll
