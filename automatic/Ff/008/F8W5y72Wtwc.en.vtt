upside<00:01:13.190> down<00:01:13.340> again<00:01:13.510> this<00:01:14.510> one<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:14.870> can<00:01:14.990> see

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
upside down again this one you can see

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.840 
upside down again this one you can see
there<00:01:15.650> could<00:01:15.950> be<00:01:16.010> a<00:01:16.100> slight<00:01:16.430> issue<00:01:16.610> with

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
there could be a slight issue with

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.330 
there could be a slight issue with
pocket<00:01:17.390> sliding<00:01:17.870> depending<00:01:18.290> on<00:01:18.410> how<00:01:18.650> big<00:01:19.220> or

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
pocket sliding depending on how big or

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.890 
pocket sliding depending on how big or
small<00:01:19.400> your<00:01:19.730> pocket<00:01:20.030> so<00:01:20.150> with<00:01:20.330> that<00:01:20.450> spoiler

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
small your pocket so with that spoiler

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.260 
small your pocket so with that spoiler
but<00:01:21.890> then<00:01:22.040> I<00:01:22.160> guess<00:01:22.340> if<00:01:22.520> you<00:01:22.640> put<00:01:22.820> it<00:01:22.910> down<00:01:23.060> this

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
but then I guess if you put it down this

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.610 
but then I guess if you put it down this
way<00:01:23.420> first<00:01:23.720> then<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.260> won't<00:01:24.410> have<00:01:24.470> an

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
way first then you won't have an

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.380 
way first then you won't have an
addition<00:01:25.780> it's<00:01:26.780> kind<00:01:27.110> of<00:01:27.200> cool<00:01:27.320> this<00:01:27.470> one<00:01:27.710> it

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
addition it's kind of cool this one it

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.670 
addition it's kind of cool this one it
comes<00:01:29.390> with<00:01:29.540> your<00:01:29.660> little<00:01:30.020> Indy<00:01:30.320> car<00:01:30.530> which

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
to do with I think the way is supposed

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.139

car<00:02:38.939> and<00:02:39.939> you<00:02:40.030> also<00:02:40.239> get<00:02:40.629> a<00:02:40.930> couple<00:02:41.439> of<00:02:44.760> mmm

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
car and you also get a couple of mmm

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
car and you also get a couple of mmm
markers<00:02:46.890> so<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.219> could<00:02:48.370> choose<00:02:48.579> to<00:02:48.659> mark<00:02:49.659> your

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
markers so you could choose to mark your

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.140 
markers so you could choose to mark your
racetrack<00:02:50.319> Oh<00:02:52.799> more<00:02:53.799> likely<00:02:54.099> in<00:02:54.189> my<00:02:54.370> case<00:02:54.670> and

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
racetrack Oh more likely in my case and

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.030 
racetrack Oh more likely in my case and
given<00:02:55.989> this<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.200> crack<00:02:56.439> which<00:02:56.620> is<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.829> first

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
given this a crack which is the first

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.920 
given this a crack which is the first
thing<00:02:57.099> I<00:02:57.280> did<00:02:57.459> was<00:02:57.639> a<00:02:58.019> user<00:02:59.019> to<00:03:00.359> use<00:03:01.359> the<00:03:01.540> car<00:03:01.750> to

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
thing I did was a user to use the car to

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.129 
thing I did was a user to use the car to
knock<00:03:02.109> them<00:03:02.260> down<00:03:03.239> so<00:03:04.239> I<00:03:04.269> will<00:03:04.599> put<00:03:04.750> these<00:03:04.930> up

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
knock them down so I will put these up

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:11.399 
knock them down so I will put these up
here<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.970> can<00:03:10.090> see<00:03:10.239> here<00:03:10.450> we've<00:03:10.599> got<00:03:10.629> a<00:03:10.750> switch

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
here you can see here we've got a switch

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.580 
here you can see here we've got a switch
for<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:12.150> launcher<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.959> obviously<00:03:14.260> this<00:03:14.409> is

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
for the launcher and obviously this is

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.720 
for the launcher and obviously this is
where<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:14.859> keel<00:03:15.099> for<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.459> cow<00:03:15.639> would<00:03:15.700> go<00:03:16.000> in

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
where the keel for the cow would go in

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:26.190 
where the keel for the cow would go in
just<00:03:18.730> drop<00:03:19.209> them<00:03:19.359> in<00:03:20.909> sliding<00:03:21.909> back<00:03:24.329> is<00:03:25.329> ready

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
just drop them in sliding back is ready

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.039 
just drop them in sliding back is ready
to<00:03:26.379> rock<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:26.590> roll<00:03:28.680> has<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.709> small<00:03:30.719> and<00:03:31.719> here

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
to rock and roll has a small and here

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.780 
to rock and roll has a small and here
looked<00:03:32.260> after<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.680> have<00:03:32.889> a<00:03:32.919> feeling<00:03:33.340> this<00:03:33.430> is<00:03:33.609> so

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
looked after I have a feeling this is so

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
looked after I have a feeling this is so
you<00:03:33.849> can<00:03:34.030> kind<00:03:34.239> of<00:03:34.329> do<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:34.930> bit<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.409> this<00:03:36.540> or<00:03:37.540> even

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
you can kind of do a bit of this or even

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.909 
you can kind of do a bit of this or even
a<00:03:37.870> bit<00:03:37.989> of<00:03:38.109> this<00:03:38.230> depending<00:03:38.620> on<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.739> way

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:38.919 
a bit of this depending on the way

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.199 
a bit of this depending on the way
you're<00:03:39.069> under<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.340> gate<00:03:39.519> you<00:03:39.819> wanted<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.120> get

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
you're under the gate you wanted to get

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.170 
you're under the gate you wanted to get
some<00:03:40.419> jump<00:03:40.690> action<00:03:41.019> early

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
some jump action early

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:50.270 
some jump action early
and<00:03:43.400> it<00:03:44.400> works<00:03:44.790> very<00:03:45.599> well<00:03:48.890> see<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.069> just

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
and it works very well see that just

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:58.000 
and it works very well see that just
flew<00:03:50.519> into<00:03:50.970> my<00:03:51.209> hand<00:03:52.069> down<00:03:53.069> there

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.789 

now<00:03:58.489> would<00:03:59.349> write<00:04:00.349> to<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.099> other<00:04:01.280> set<00:04:01.640> up<00:04:01.790> I

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
now would write to the other set up I

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.589 
now would write to the other set up I
was<00:04:03.799> just<00:04:03.950> having<00:04:04.190> a<00:04:04.280> look<00:04:04.430> at<00:04:04.610> the<00:04:04.760> way<00:04:05.480> it

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
was just having a look at the way it

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.899 
was just having a look at the way it
kind<00:04:05.810> of<00:04:05.870> clips<00:04:06.140> in<00:04:06.349> and<00:04:07.159> it<00:04:07.459> seems<00:04:07.670> that

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
kind of clips in and it seems that

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:14.979 
kind of clips in and it seems that
there's<00:04:08.120> a<00:04:08.180> small<00:04:12.819> small<00:04:13.819> tab<00:04:14.360> just<00:04:14.690> on<00:04:14.900> the

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
there's a small small tab just on the

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.729 
there's a small small tab just on the
back<00:04:15.200> of<00:04:15.379> the<00:04:15.470> car<00:04:15.799> just<00:04:16.989> in<00:04:17.989> here<00:04:18.290> this<00:04:18.470> tab

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
back of the car just in here this tab

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.080 
back of the car just in here this tab
here

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.460 

to<00:04:21.600> manage<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:21.930> clip<00:04:22.410> into

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.190 

this<00:04:27.010> section<00:04:27.400> here<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:28.720> so<00:04:28.930> when<00:04:29.080> you

release<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.950> spring-loaded<00:04:30.850> mechanism

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
release it the spring-loaded mechanism

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.860 
release it the spring-loaded mechanism
here<00:04:31.690> it's<00:04:32.170> the<00:04:32.350> car<00:04:32.530> going<00:04:33.240> clever<00:04:34.240> but

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
here it's the car going clever but

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.160 
here it's the car going clever but
simple<00:04:36.090> just<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.210> way<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.360> like<00:04:37.630> my<00:04:37.690> choices

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.390 

a<00:05:21.160> little<00:05:22.150> bit<00:05:22.360> of<00:05:22.510> guidance<00:05:23.500> and<00:05:23.950> let's<00:05:24.190> see

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
a little bit of guidance and let's see

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.350 
a little bit of guidance and let's see
how<00:05:24.670> this<00:05:25.540> little<00:05:25.990> fella<00:05:26.230> flies<00:05:26.620> Shumway

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:38.950 

trying<00:05:31.360> trying<00:05:31.690> it<00:05:31.960> downward<00:05:32.380> angle

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.560 

not<00:05:39.560> too<00:05:39.770> shabby<00:05:39.979> at<00:05:40.160> all<00:05:40.400> he<00:05:40.699> made<00:05:40.970> it<00:05:41.000> mostly

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
not too shabby at all he made it mostly

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.540 
not too shabby at all he made it mostly
to<00:05:41.720> the<00:05:41.750> end<00:05:41.960> of<00:05:42.050> the<00:05:42.110> bench<00:05:42.259> there

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.279 

admittedly<00:05:47.330> though<00:05:47.539> he<00:05:47.720> did<00:05:47.900> spin<00:05:48.169> around

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
admittedly though he did spin around

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.409 
admittedly though he did spin around
back<00:05:48.710> first<00:05:49.479> let's<00:05:50.479> give<00:05:50.840> another<00:05:50.930> try<00:05:52.419> just

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
back first let's give another try just

00:05:53.419 --> 00:06:04.340 
back first let's give another try just
doing<00:05:53.720> it<00:05:53.810> flat<00:05:54.199> on<00:05:54.590> the<00:05:54.680> table<00:05:55.960> yeah<00:05:56.960> we<00:05:57.440> go

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.680 

slightly<00:06:05.070> furred<00:06:05.430> but<00:06:05.790> rather<00:06:06.420> cool

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
slightly furred but rather cool

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.280 
slightly furred but rather cool
nonetheless

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290
