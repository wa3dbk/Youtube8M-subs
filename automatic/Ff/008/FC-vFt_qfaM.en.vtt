00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
looks a lot clearer and I quite like the

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.270 
looks a lot clearer and I quite like the
sort<00:04:35.780> of<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:35.990> scruffiness<00:04:36.500> when<00:04:37.130> I<00:04:37.160> was

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
sort of the scruffiness when I was

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.970 
sort of the scruffiness when I was
playing<00:04:37.370> on<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.580> pc<00:04:37.790> but<00:04:38.600> it<00:04:39.530> just<00:04:39.740> seems<00:04:39.920> a

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
playing on the pc but it just seems a

00:04:39.980 --> 00:05:20.470 
playing on the pc but it just seems a
lot<00:04:40.100> richer<00:04:40.310> on<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:41.090> PSP<00:04:41.810> so<00:04:41.990> it's<00:04:42.350> quite<00:04:42.530> nice

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.120 

something<00:05:21.200> about<00:05:21.320> these<00:05:21.470> guys<00:05:21.680> creep<00:05:21.950> me<00:05:22.100> out

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
something about these guys creep me out

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:42.220 
something about these guys creep me out
I<00:05:22.460> think<00:05:22.820> it's<00:05:22.910> just<00:05:22.970> the<00:05:23.090> shape<00:05:23.300> of<00:05:23.480> them<00:05:23.660> but

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.570 

no<00:05:43.230> interest<00:05:43.500> another<00:05:43.740> person<00:05:44.130> is<00:05:44.280> you<00:05:44.400> come

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
no interest another person is you come

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.630 
no interest another person is you come
across<00:05:44.760> and<00:05:45.000> just<00:05:45.150> their<00:05:45.330> stances<00:05:45.840> as

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
across and just their stances as

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
across and just their stances as
obviously<00:05:47.640> they've<00:05:47.820> not<00:05:48.090> got<00:05:48.120> any<00:05:48.390> facial

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
obviously they've not got any facial

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.580 
obviously they've not got any facial
expressions<00:05:49.200> or<00:05:50.090> will<00:05:51.090> redeeming<00:05:52.020> features

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
expressions or will redeeming features

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.010 
expressions or will redeeming features
other<00:05:52.920> than<00:05:53.130> their<00:05:53.820> stances<00:05:54.270> and<00:05:54.450> their

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
other than their stances and their

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.210 
other than their stances and their
mannerisms<00:05:55.500> which<00:05:55.620> is<00:05:55.740> quite<00:05:55.890> cool<00:05:56.100> because

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
mannerisms which is quite cool because
