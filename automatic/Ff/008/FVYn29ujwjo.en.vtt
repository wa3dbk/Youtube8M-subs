could have been so amazing but it turned

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.479

mechs<00:03:37.540> but<00:03:37.989> no<00:03:38.109> this<00:03:38.470> is<00:03:38.620> not<00:03:38.769> next<00:03:39.130> but<00:03:39.400> it

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
mechs but no this is not next but it

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.550 
mechs but no this is not next but it
kind<00:03:39.940> of<00:03:40.150> I<00:03:40.359> guess<00:03:40.750> at<00:03:40.930> first<00:03:40.959> when<00:03:41.319> you<00:03:41.410> look

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
kind of I guess at first when you look

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.750 
kind of I guess at first when you look
at<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:41.859> can<00:03:42.010> kind<00:03:42.160> of<00:03:42.280> see<00:03:42.430> it's<00:03:42.549> mechs

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
at it you can kind of see it's mechs

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.250 
at it you can kind of see it's mechs
because<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:43.060> is<00:03:43.150> kind<00:03:43.389> of<00:03:43.420> like<00:03:43.540> Mega<00:03:43.750> Man<00:03:43.989> type

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
because it is kind of like Mega Man type

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.170 
because it is kind of like Mega Man type
bodysuits<00:03:44.889> that<00:03:45.100> they<00:03:45.250> like<00:03:45.819> you<00:03:46.150> know

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
bodysuits that they like you know

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.629 
bodysuits that they like you know
transform<00:03:46.810> into<00:03:47.019> it<00:03:47.440> stuff<00:03:47.680> but<00:03:48.190> it's<00:03:48.400> still

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
transform into it stuff but it's still

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.819 
transform into it stuff but it's still
like<00:03:48.910> that's<00:03:49.209> not<00:03:49.359> considered<00:03:49.690> mech<00:03:50.079> overall

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
like that's not considered mech overall

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.479 
like that's not considered mech overall
this<00:03:51.069> series<00:03:51.549> was<00:03:52.000> not<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.380> worst<00:03:53.739> of<00:03:54.250> the

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
this series was not the worst of the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
summer TV but also it just was such a

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.449 
summer TV but also it just was such a
letdown<00:03:58.180> because<00:03:58.720> I<00:03:59.349> saw<00:03:59.650> so<00:03:59.920> much<00:04:00.010> potential

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
letdown because I saw so much potential

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.210 
letdown because I saw so much potential
