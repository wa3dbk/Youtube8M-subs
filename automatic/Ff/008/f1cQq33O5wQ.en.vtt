00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello in this section i will 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.730
 give some small lessons for those 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.519
 who first came up to the piano to the piano and 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.460
 decided on it something since 2002 failed 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.609
 and therefore you are just reading and watching 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.189
 this video means so for a start we are with 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.449
 you will take four chords they 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.380
 will be with us in a certain 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.930
 sequences 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.939
 you will remember them and will play 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.869
 work out the correctness of their statement 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.969
 and they sound pretty nice not 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.680
 require harm no difficulty 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.899
 1 city is in C major house tracery 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.870
 triad triad that is just three 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:49.289
 sound and salt and they are located through 1 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.410
 Ie yes, but then it is located 2 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.200
 black keys on the left, then through nature and 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.420
 takes notes 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:01.000
 and through the format salt note 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.949
 we take this chord at the same time 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.460
 pressing all the fingers that we have 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.049
 participate in this chord at the same time 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.880
 immersing them in the keys to get 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:15.140
 smooth uniform sound 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.880
 that there was no such 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.540
 it will be no longer abortions too 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.450
 kind of and since you can take on 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.880
 different themes 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:32.440
 can take your city first here 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.580
 this is the first finger of the second and fourth 1 2 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.540
 4 hands a little smaller 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.780
 can take this chord first finger 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.240
 first finger third finger and 5 here 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.540
 So 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.380
 then took C major and Kurt then 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.689
 move we take a tomato city ​​then 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.530
 there are the same sounds 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.700
 expensive 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.700
 but volume 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:04.909
 then 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:08.080
 works far far major triad and 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.220
 but you are salt salt major triad and 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.180
 it turns out we have this among us 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.180
 pretty nice 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:26.090
 this is the first lesson on this us finished 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:28.159
 work out the correct statement here 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.219
 this triad now these triad 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:33.670
 and process the sequence thanks 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.670
