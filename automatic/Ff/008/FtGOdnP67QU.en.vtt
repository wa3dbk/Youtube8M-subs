opinion with the regular iphone team the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.560 
opinion with the regular iphone team the

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
icons are too big and i don't like the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.229 
icons are too big and i don't like the
shape<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.990> them<00:00:31.140> anyway<00:00:31.800> as<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.070> said<00:00:32.219> we<00:00:32.969> cost

99<00:00:33.600> cents<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.590> definitely<00:00:35.010> worth<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
99 cents it is definitely worth the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.670 
99 cents it is definitely worth the
price<00:00:35.880> heading<00:00:36.329> over<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.930> next<00:00:37.079> one<00:00:37.410> the
