00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:09.470
 and how about guys welcome another video 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:13.250
 of halloween and halloween time 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.950
 Halloween now because this the 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.499
 second version of pumpkins this is 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.419
 another way to draw pumpkins 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:22.669
 last year it was in person I told them that 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:24.230
 this in real time now here I am 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.270
 doing 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.759
 good for example here right now I'm 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.789
 watching in real time but later 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.260
 I'll do it a little faster good 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.129
 is not in real time this how 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.559
 accelerated by 20% or so is not so 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.140
 quick for you to see how I do 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.120
 this type of pumpkins the faces then 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.420
 this is a way of saying to do 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.190
 for our doors or whatever the 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.750
 who celebrates is this season 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.640
 For example, the Barcelona party 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.489
 costumes or something because there they can do 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.710
 because big pumpkin can grab 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:05.050
 with mold and they started hanging to put 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.050
 hang up like this for your costumes to make 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.250
 here is I am making the pumpkins 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.160
 a large one and a small one that has a 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.870
 witch's cap and to the right side in the 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.830
 part of top I'm doing what it is 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:26.120
 a bat like that is a bat 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.520
 batman batman 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.240
 it's your ordinary backpack that 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.240
 have to fly 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.159
 all this from the drawing and began to remark 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.140
 started to put in every day 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.810
 main as always in all 5 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.979
 always first I do the sketch to see 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.160
 how will the drawing be for 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.130
 visualize and then I take it out with a 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:58.100
 piece of pencil with a pencil post 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.600
 I take it out with a pencil and that's what I'm saying 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.670
 I make a pencil because it 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.400
 remarked with a pen like that and that's what 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.530
 more sad if I'm not remarking what 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.509
 the pumpkins and the bat is not 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.509
 Batman seriously and shut up 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.400
 Well this remark after all 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.220
 colored 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.580
 the drawing started coloring with orange 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.020
 Clear 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.900
 an orange almost yellow or orange but 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.520
 I leave the codes down there in the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.880
 description if you do not leave them because I 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.880
 gave roe 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.400
 with an orange color a little stronger 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.220
 for the shadows a yellow on the part 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.960
 of your right to do for 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.170
 make a stronger fool in light because 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.120
 the moon should be after you with 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.210
 the black then there we do the shadows and 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.819
 all of the big face the hat I'm going to 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.799
 draw with black colors 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.219
 but they left blank spaces for 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.799
 to be able to give space to the light this I'm going 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:09.189
 to do with a gray and then with a 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:12.519
 white to blur and that gives effect 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:16.660
 the belt is orange or more 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.300
 less more a little stronger 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.710
 and the metric the diver below 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.250
 to be the same color as the pumpkin 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.250
 big 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.480
 the center make yellow 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.640
 because it is yellow and it's good 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.750
 not always but because of the light shines and 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.190
 yellow color 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.760
 same as the face of a little girl 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.540
 and then he began to put all this what 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.540
 it's decades 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.120
 so that it looks like what the line is 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.160
 of everything already after color ends 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.530
 already started to do what that is the floor 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.150
 with a strong coffee and a light coffee 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.700
 and start making the shadows drawn to 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.160
 batman I say said the bat drew the 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.460
 bat 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.160
 and then always forget what is the 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:12.580
 part where the head is torn 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:17.660
 what is it to draw the moon the moon 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:21.380
 the bat 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.870
 and there begins to color what is it 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.820
 strongest in the sky with an orange 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.510
 strong with the same colors that says 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.910
 the pumpkin is amazing to see how 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.820
 use the year of the pumpkin and see 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.760
 how pumpkins stand out and do not 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.950
 they lose in the background is a way of 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.690
 do what 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.930
 I'm running a part of this the 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.930
 bat 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.770
 and then already in the back 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.660
 pumpkins or draw a trunk or a type 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.040
 of trick a branch to make it look like 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:59.410
 if it were a dry trunk there 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.730
 back and a mountain behind good I hope 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.400
