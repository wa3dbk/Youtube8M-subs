is to rate the touch a little bit less

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.679 
is to rate the touch a little bit less

really nice piano now I believe this
piano<00:05:57.370> excuse<00:05:57.759> me<00:05:57.879> a<00:05:57.909> second<00:05:58.349> yes<00:05:59.349> this<00:05:59.740> piano

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
piano excuse me a second yes this piano

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:05.760 
piano excuse me a second yes this piano
was<00:06:00.219> made<00:06:00.430> in<00:06:00.779> 1971<00:06:01.779> and<00:06:03.690> I<00:06:04.690> think<00:06:05.440> this<00:06:05.500> sends

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
was made in 1971 and I think this sends

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.360 
was made in 1971 and I think this sends
a<00:06:05.800> strong<00:06:06.069> message<00:06:06.129> out<00:06:06.699> there<00:06:06.759> to<00:06:07.150> people<00:06:07.509> who

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
a strong message out there to people who

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.890 
a strong message out there to people who
somehow<00:06:09.370> have<00:06:09.759> this<00:06:09.909> mistaken<00:06:10.449> notion<00:06:10.779> that

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
somehow have this mistaken notion that

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.649 
somehow have this mistaken notion that
pianos<00:06:11.259> are<00:06:11.440> old<00:06:11.680> when<00:06:12.639> they're<00:06:12.849> in<00:06:13.000> their<00:06:13.210> 20s

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:13.659 
pianos are old when they're in their 20s

that<00:06:38.080> seems<00:06:38.320> to<00:06:38.500> me<00:06:38.650> that<00:06:38.890> a<00:06:39.130> realistic

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
that seems to me that a realistic

that seems to me that a realistic
lifespan<00:06:40.540> for<00:06:40.780> a<00:06:40.870> piano<00:06:41.140> is<00:06:41.440> the<00:06:42.250> same<00:06:42.430> as<00:06:42.580> a

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610

70 to 80 years with the original parts
it's<00:06:47.710> not<00:06:47.860> unusual<00:06:48.150> it<00:06:49.150> doesn't<00:06:49.510> even<00:06:49.540> have<00:06:49.810> to

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
it's not unusual it doesn't even have to

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.360 
it's not unusual it doesn't even have to
be<00:06:49.990> able<00:06:50.140> to<00:06:50.290> piano<00:06:50.590> I've<00:06:50.830> seen<00:06:51.040> some<00:06:51.220> really

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
be able to piano I've seen some really

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.340 
be able to piano I've seen some really
cheap<00:06:51.700> nasty<00:06:51.970> pianos<00:06:52.540> that<00:06:52.780> could<00:06:52.900> go<00:06:53.020> on<00:06:53.200> that

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
cheap nasty pianos that could go on that

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.900 
cheap nasty pianos that could go on that

pianos<00:07:02.860> from<00:07:03.100> good<00:07:03.280> pianos<00:07:03.670> is<00:07:03.880> the<00:07:04.030> quality

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 
pianos from good pianos is the quality

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.170 
pianos from good pianos is the quality
of<00:07:04.480> the<00:07:04.660> design<00:07:04.780> not<00:07:05.290> the<00:07:05.760> durability<00:07:06.760> of<00:07:06.790> the

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 
of the design not the durability of the

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.440 
of the design not the durability of the
parts<00:07:07.920> so<00:07:08.920> here<00:07:09.280> we<00:07:09.370> have<00:07:09.400> a<00:07:09.520> piano<00:07:09.760> that's<00:07:10.000> 40

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:10.450

blemish free I'm not implying that this
is<00:07:41.470> unusual<00:07:41.620> here<00:07:42.310> but<00:07:42.460> this<00:07:42.580> is<00:07:42.760> just<00:07:42.790> one<00:07:43.090> of

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:44.500 
the better examples of what you can

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.240 
the better examples of what you can
expect<00:07:44.620> to<00:07:45.070> find<00:07:45.280> in<00:07:45.460> the<00:07:45.520> store<00:07:46.890> so<00:07:47.890> here<00:07:48.130> we

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:48.250 
expect to find in the store so here we

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.790 
expect to find in the store so here we
have<00:07:48.280> a<00:07:48.400> piano<00:07:48.670> that's<00:07:49.000> good<00:07:49.210> to<00:07:49.330> go<00:07:49.450> for

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 
have a piano that's good to go for

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.559 
have a piano that's good to go for
decades<00:07:50.800> more

00:07:51.559 --> 00:07:51.569 
decades more
