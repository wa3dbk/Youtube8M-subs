 tourism here and here and we burn at 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.689
 in the light of the day, here it falls from 0-4 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:26.910
 someone has an apple here he has an enemy 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.699
 the goiter hirobrin and edges serves a little later 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.260
 this zombie is 50 percent slower 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.840
 Player 2 Zombies This is a zombie miner 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.300

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.129
 get out of we won those four men 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.010
 that is, many of them fall out of them 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.129
 roars and something like that from him 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.500
 you can accidentally knock out some kind of well 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.800
 for example coal or iron or gold 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.550
 pick and generally everything is so iron and so here 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.770
 it fits as well as the sled itself 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:05.570

 It falls out of it's gold bullion this 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.700
 for his armor 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.369
 he obviously moves that is somewhere 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.930
 50 percent slower than the player himself 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.860
 here falls on the subject of it 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:47.630
 gold armor or tools gold 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:49.649
 here's a quarterback is a knight usually 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.600
 mail is a rare drop 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.590

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.440
 he is very very rare in this 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.430
 in general, the blocks of fire are such 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.370
 blocks of fire for someone to understand what 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.440
 it comes here this is the brother of the zombie night 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:44.290
 in which i tell you four following 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.290
 zombies are our zombies nda rf so why 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:55.750
 he speaks in daylight afterwards speed 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.850
 him as a player sometimes 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.860
 they hate it burn they all 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.350
 generally through it as what tag 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.180
 here he growls when struck how to perform yes 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.750
 and just growls to you very quickly 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.130
 so long it turns out there is no 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:16.000
 cleaning the weak 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.000
 the area is fast but weak that 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.010
 also there are or rare 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:56.330
 falls let's say this is the length of the gusta 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:58.370
 stick phyto and anti like a field 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.110
 a little bit i mean he is really a little bit 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.120
 stronger than a creeper but not so much that 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.860
 straight it should be noticeable right now 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.680
 I 'll tutor bend them to continue 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.210
 the next zombie is on zombie kiba they 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.790
 give a kind of understanding in the light of day 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.970
 falls out and again as well as rare 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.420
 drop it pistons and repeaters it giving 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.950
 rarely here well then we went to the most zombies 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.770
 this is our disco zombie 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.110
 and so drop out of it the music blocks well 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.720
 how do you hear the sound like that through her he 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.350
 burning full in the light of day before how you already 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.750
 understood fuh and what else happens out of it 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.680
 rare drop is not noteblocks but those 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.420
 blocks in which they become 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.250
 thrust plate and feature 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.580
 This mob is that we have only one 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.200
 heart damage that is how you understood it 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.140
 very easy to kill and pretty easy 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.110
 get these stuff music blocks 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.510
 any such is the bailiff 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.050
 to represent but we kill one zombie 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:01.220
 which pupils are killed so much cookies 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:03.050
 Here and we fall could it cool so 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.170
 as you have noticed now 1 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:11.420
 this is called a survivor well and we become 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:13.760
 so , and we left 1 1 zombies in one room 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.070
 and from and in general two years so 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.670
 the last zombie is a zombie dad for some reason 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:22.340
 keys 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:25.520
 he is very fast one by one did not fall 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.310
 in fact here it does not burn in the light 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.150
 day here he has an attack three times stronger 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.220
 than 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:36.020
 normal than ordinary zombie as lively 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.150
 than the usual zombies and 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.090
 leather or leather armor falls from it 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:48.980
 skin acquires naturally so now we 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:51.410
 quickly make there 70 and we will continue and 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.900
 the latter could today from this mod 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:57.470
 which gives us such wonderful 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:02.410
 zombie is a survivor like this 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:05.960

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:08.510
 dead like love their zombies here it is 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.970

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:29.870
 demonstrate how he does of course 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:34.190
 how does he even act like that? 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.550
