00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.810 

nice<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:03.530> don't<00:02:04.530> know<00:02:04.649> we<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:05.039> see<00:02:05.250> very<00:02:05.550> well

but<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.979> puppy<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.220> definitely<00:02:09.410> fogging<00:02:10.410> up

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.240 

guess<00:02:18.260> I<00:02:18.410> could<00:02:18.470> have<00:02:18.710> held<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.040> little

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
guess I could have held it a little

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.600 
guess I could have held it a little
further<00:02:19.490> back<00:02:19.760> from<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:20.060> dash<00:02:20.360> but<00:02:21.610> it's

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
further back from the dash but it's

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:34.250 
further back from the dash but it's
working

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.990 

like<00:02:34.740> it's<00:02:34.920> getting<00:02:35.190> all<00:02:35.310> sucked<00:02:35.640> through<00:02:35.850> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
like it's getting all sucked through the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.070 
like it's getting all sucked through the
vents<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.510> doing<00:02:37.440> what<00:02:37.530> it's<00:02:37.680> supposed<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:38.010> do

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080
