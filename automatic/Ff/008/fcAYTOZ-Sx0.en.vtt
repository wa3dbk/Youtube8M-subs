00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
know I'm not I don't go at this before

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.130 
know I'm not I don't go at this before
and<00:02:04.920> stuff<00:02:05.340> much<00:02:05.579> when<00:02:06.000> I'm<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.570> they<00:02:06.960> don't

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
and stuff much when I'm like they don't

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.859 
and stuff much when I'm like they don't
have<00:02:07.200> any<00:02:07.290> okay<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.129> anyway<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.239> found<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.750> how

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
have any okay so anyway I found the how

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.360 
have any okay so anyway I found the how
to<00:02:09.929> pencil<00:02:10.440> liner

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
to pencil liner

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.710 
to pencil liner
and<00:02:11.730> that's<00:02:11.879> why<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.060> thought<00:02:12.300> I'd<00:02:12.360> give<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.629> a

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
and that's why I thought I'd give it a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.839 
and that's why I thought I'd give it a
try<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:13.830> was<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.010> couple<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.370> days<00:02:14.519> ago<00:02:14.730> I

formula<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:01.379> you<00:03:01.769> can<00:03:01.920> sharpen<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.459> as<00:03:02.549> well

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
formula and you can sharpen it as well

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.670 
formula and you can sharpen it as well
the<00:03:03.269> good<00:03:03.450> thing<00:03:03.660> about<00:03:03.690> these<00:03:04.049> as<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.500> can

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
the good thing about these as you can

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.069 
the good thing about these as you can
still<00:03:04.890> sharpen<00:03:05.310> them<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:06.239> ten<00:03:06.510> just<00:03:06.930> be

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
still sharpen them the ten just be

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.509 
still sharpen them the ten just be
careful<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.680> shot<00:03:07.920> at<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.220> though<00:03:08.340> because

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
careful and a shot at it though because

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.640 
careful and a shot at it though because
whether<00:03:09.150> I'm<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.420> soft<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.049> live<00:03:10.140> more<00:03:10.410> than<00:03:10.440> a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
whether I'm a soft and live more than a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.860 
whether I'm a soft and live more than a
pencil<00:03:10.890> nib<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.849> kind<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.180> snap<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.510> off<00:03:12.629> and

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
pencil nib you kind of snap it off and

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.900 
pencil nib you kind of snap it off and
then<00:03:13.049> you<00:03:13.860> know<00:03:14.040> it's<00:03:14.190> no<00:03:14.340> fake<00:03:14.489> up<00:03:14.670> when<00:03:14.790> it's

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
then you know it's no fake up when it's

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.819 
then you know it's no fake up when it's
blunt<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.750> want<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:15.959> nice<00:03:16.049> and<00:03:16.109> sharp<00:03:16.440> if<00:03:16.739> you

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
blunt you want it nice and sharp if you

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.789 
blunt you want it nice and sharp if you
can't<00:03:17.040> help<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:18.359> that's<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.079> one<00:03:19.350> and

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
can't help it so that's that one and

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.270 
can't help it so that's that one and

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
I use this every tutorial you know I do

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.530 
I use this every tutorial you know I do
if<00:05:41.530> you<00:05:41.650> watch<00:05:41.830> this<00:05:42.730> is<00:05:42.850> just<00:05:43.120> your<00:05:43.240> kind<00:05:43.390> of

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
if you watch this is just your kind of

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.120 
if you watch this is just your kind of
all<00:05:43.690> wrong<00:05:43.870> whether<00:05:44.050> it's<00:05:44.230> a<00:05:44.320> Korean<00:05:44.560> formula

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
all wrong whether it's a Korean formula

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.000 
all wrong whether it's a Korean formula
and<00:05:45.700> I<00:05:45.940> think<00:05:46.210> that's<00:05:46.630> it<00:05:46.990> so<00:05:47.590> I'm<00:05:47.710> actually

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
and I think that's it so I'm actually

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.740 
and I think that's it so I'm actually
gonna<00:05:48.220> have<00:05:48.340> to<00:05:48.460> buy<00:05:48.580> more<00:05:48.820> that's<00:05:49.450> all<00:05:49.600> I've
