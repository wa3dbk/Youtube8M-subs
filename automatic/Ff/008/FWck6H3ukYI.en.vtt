00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
fue they didn't right okay so that's

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
fue they didn't right okay so that's
without<00:02:36.739> crouch<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:38.019> that's<00:02:39.019> we've<00:02:39.170> grouch

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
without crouch and that's we've grouch

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.339 
without crouch and that's we've grouch
it<00:02:40.610> takes<00:02:40.910> off<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.330> much<00:02:41.480> so<00:02:41.750> when<00:02:42.230> you're

jumping<00:02:42.680> up<00:02:42.799> these<00:02:42.920> hills<00:02:43.160> like<00:02:43.430> that<00:02:43.610> try<00:02:44.329> and

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
jumping up these hills like that try and

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.789 
jumping up these hills like that try and
keep<00:02:44.540> crouched<00:02:44.870> on<00:02:45.079> because<00:02:45.380> jumping

keep crouched on because jumping

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.740 
keep crouched on because jumping
increases<00:02:46.310> your<00:02:46.459> visibility<00:02:46.970> even<00:02:47.420> more<00:02:47.569> look
