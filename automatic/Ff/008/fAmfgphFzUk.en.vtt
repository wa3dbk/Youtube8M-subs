00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.670
 and motorcycles on our list this 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.630
 inimitable 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.630
 games 2 to two thousandths 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.779
 he is tired this is true 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:13.659
 dumbest motorcycles m and dvuhmesychnika has 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:15.799
 the same attitude to motorcycle racing 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.800
 and even fish 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.970
 I personally think that it is not for racing at all 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.650
 this is technological masturbation luck 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.929
 but two thousand turbines in the morning 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:26.970
 motorcycle engine year turbines rolls royce 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.840
 320 horsepower dry 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.110
 weight 0226 kilograms fuel tank at 30 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.620
 liters of diesel fuel 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.309
 kerosene aviation fuel 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.210
 almost everything that burns 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.990
 this amazing engine is sleeping right 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.520
 from a helicopter that means a motorcycle 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.670
 can drive at speeds of 400 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.600
 kilometers per hour 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.470
 the engine is able to raise the air 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.770
 helicopter bell sixties on 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.810
 board and complete set 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.980
 weapons and you know how many re-read two 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.630
 tons of 300 here is read relationship 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.390
 power chair 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.150
 then this term is almost four years and he 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
 in fact our test pilot 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.180
 itar tass when we talk about it a little 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.830
 whether not sounds made 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.400
 motorcycles you can learn the sound of sobbing 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.620
 price or ducati groups 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.880
 soft but the sound of 2010 is not comparable to them 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.460
 by car 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.840
 he will not go very nice when flying 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.270
 on jet plane only 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.860
 consumed question then only for gas whom 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.270
 64 you feel the powerful flame of aktobe 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.810
 no problem winning this dangerous attack 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.469
 but in this is his own charm Michael 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.350
 you will pass and think of environmentalists and yet I 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.840
 still alive 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.910
 why install a motorcycle 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.310
 helicopter engine and then 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.190
 try to drive through the streets man answer 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.080
 simple gas because it is real 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.060
 square 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.340
 having a speed of 400 kilometers an hour 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.920
 friend by the thousandth is included in the book 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.690
 Guinness World Records as the fastest 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.269
 motorcycles serial production but also 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.310
 The price is the highest and these motorcycles 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.840
 lately 185 thousand dollars he's not 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.879
 for the faint of heart but surely one must have 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.019
 tight wallet to deliver such 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.340
 strong purification of life with boiling water I 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.930
 I suppose that if you get the hand of them 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.379
 stamp and sell it would be 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.370
 the strongest drug world i personally 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.549
 not off and building block 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.069
 bad i'll show you something cool on it 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.989
 look at the rear lights 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.250
 plan I once waited at the junction 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.120
 traffic light and Nissan appears 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.540
 infiniti namely this guy liked 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.209
 to look at motorcycles 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.540
 begin to swear and he all look at it 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.719
 I think I need to go otherwise get stuck 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.319
 exhaust temperature I have signatures than 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.639
 degrees so looked at him like that 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.900
 about him the bank starts to melt out 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.309
 key centers 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:00.389
 when do I conjure a dress right away 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.499
 I rode in my day he did not even notice 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:05.019
 before you come home 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.620
 in march let him speed up to 400 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.249
 kilometers an hour but some kind of like 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:11.489
 speed if you can’t use it 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.419
 kind but then so this is not complete and 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.419
 motorcycle so uneasy and wonder 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.719
 wonders or not we want to find out 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.729
 to check the power of the motorcycle when 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:22.859
 speeding we set 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.379
 experiment at a military airfield ock 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.379
 1 rank louisiana 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.879
 our turbines are super motorcycle 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:36.820
 two thousandths 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.090
 will try to compete in 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.080
 jet fighter speeds 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.759
 el 39 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:44.849
 from the start the bike on the track is trying 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:45.499
 overtake 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:47.169
 low flying fast on 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.929
 plot of one thousand 600 meters of course I 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:52.199
 nervous bitter rider between your legs 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.019
 motorcycle rocket we have no racer stuntman 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.929
 james kane who agreed to this 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:59.629
 I am confident that we have enough power and 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.339
 torque to perform this 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:05.339
 tasks resign 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:11.249
 airplane pilot finally 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:13.749
 moves to a low altitude flight 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:15.779
 and who gives it to the last driver 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:18.779
 Kazan 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.830
 how do we certainly lift the plane 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.979
 no doubt how I told him to 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.430
 laid out completely 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.509
 but no need to restrain the car 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.119
 aircraft speed 275 kilometers per hour 

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:37.259
 the motorcycle starts moving when the distance 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.249
 between him and the plane will shrink to 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:42.249
 fifty meters 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.419
 racing only in acceleration 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.439
 foton motor 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:05.959
 finishes almost simultaneously and waits 5 

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:07.669
 official results 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.559
 defeated motorcycles 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:12.349
 defeated waterproof 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.080
 Thanks guys 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.650
 bimonthly overclocked to 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.539
 incredible speed of 350 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.670
 kilometers in 14 seconds 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.580
 and overtook the plane at a distance of twice 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.020
 exceeding the distance 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.020
 motorcycles 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:28.539
 and this his mom is one of the best 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.779
 motorcycles well, but someone said it once 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:33.569
 just put a plane on a motorcycle 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:35.589
 engines can overcome the barrier not 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:36.129
 It was 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.360
 Here only values ​​are not critical for me 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.819
 It has 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:40.610
 it's like a guy with a little 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.699
 member trying to prove something that is not in vain 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.569
 most of us didn't fly planes 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.840
 Varov 14 Kohl with Austrian order 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:50.479
 just landing school can scare up 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.229
 a pulp but still it's fun 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.330
 I think they need to give points for 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.029
 the fact that others considered it a deed 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.389
 once 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.969
 This is the first schools school opinion 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:00.439
 specialists divided 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:02.649
 and so two thousand nick and stuck on 

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:03.329
 fourth place
