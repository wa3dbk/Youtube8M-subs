00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
leave them the way they are so we're

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.750 
leave them the way they are so we're
going<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.740> hit<00:02:31.920> next<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:34.340> this<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.490> where<00:02:35.640> you

going to hit next and this is where you

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.190

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
would select it most likely it's going

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.130 
would select it most likely it's going

to do the auto detect it's going to tell

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.740 
to do the auto detect it's going to tell
you<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.750> it's<00:02:42.870> going<00:02:42.960> to<00:02:43.020> select<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.560> hit<00:02:43.860> next

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
you so it's going to select it hit next

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.630 
you so it's going to select it hit next
now<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.500> where<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.980> want<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.220> pick<00:02:47.430> your

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
now this is where you want to pick your

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.230 
now this is where you want to pick your
output<00:02:48.450> size<00:02:48.920> right<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.310> we're<00:02:50.850> going<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.030> keep

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
output size right so we're going to keep

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.320 
output size right so we're going to keep
our<00:02:51.450> output<00:02:51.870> size<00:02:52.080> at<00:02:52.380> 700<00:02:52.980> megabytes<00:02:53.330> then

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
our output size at 700 megabytes then

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.970 
our output size at 700 megabytes then
you're<00:02:54.480> going<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.630> want<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.900> hit<00:02:55.140> next<00:02:55.470> again

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.320 

now<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.580> is<00:02:59.730> going<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.940> take<00:03:00.060> some<00:03:00.120> time

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
now this is going to take some time

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.680 
now this is going to take some time
again<00:03:00.840> so<00:03:00.990> we're<00:03:01.110> going<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.290> pause<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.740> video

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
again depending on one's operating

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.120 
again depending on one's operating
system<00:03:05.580> this<00:03:05.940> can<00:03:06.150> take<00:03:06.360> anywhere<00:03:07.320> from<00:03:07.380> an

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
system this can take anywhere from an

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.660 
system this can take anywhere from an
hour<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.460> 23<00:03:09.390> hours<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.280> we're<00:03:11.280> just<00:03:11.310> going<00:03:11.580> to

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
let it kick off right now it says 40

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.140 
let it kick off right now it says 40
minutes<00:03:13.860> but<00:03:14.130> it's<00:03:14.370> going<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:14.640> do<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:14.940> about

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
so that's what for the seasons are so

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.640 
so that's what for the seasons are so
that's<00:04:59.820> something<00:05:00.150> nice<00:05:00.480> to<00:05:00.720> know<00:05:00.870> as<00:05:01.050> well<00:05:01.260> so

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
that's something nice to know as well so

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.610 
that's something nice to know as well so
and<00:05:01.980> it<00:05:02.430> as<00:05:02.850> well<00:05:03.150> when<00:05:04.110> you<00:05:04.200> go<00:05:04.320> into<00:05:04.470> your

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
and it as well when you go into your

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.320 
and it as well when you go into your
options<00:05:05.070> i<00:05:05.160> forgot<00:05:05.460> to<00:05:05.490> mention<00:05:05.640> this<00:05:06.090> before

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
options i forgot to mention this before

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.320 
options i forgot to mention this before
so<00:05:06.930> it's<00:05:07.080> probably<00:05:07.260> a<00:05:07.650> good<00:05:08.370> thing<00:05:09.150> to

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
so it's probably a good thing to

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.050 
so it's probably a good thing to
remember<00:05:09.800> before<00:05:10.800> you<00:05:11.040> convert<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.490> torrent

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
remember before you convert a torrent

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.650 
remember before you convert a torrent
you<00:05:12.900> gotta<00:05:13.050> subtitles<00:05:13.740> track<00:05:14.390> you<00:05:15.390> should

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
you gotta subtitles track you should

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.070 
you gotta subtitles track you should
really<00:05:16.550> select<00:05:17.550> none<00:05:17.820> I<00:05:18.120> should<00:05:18.930> have<00:05:19.020> done

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
really select none I should have done

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.170 
really select none I should have done
that<00:05:19.230> because<00:05:20.130> when<00:05:20.310> you<00:05:20.400> convert<00:05:20.580> it<00:05:20.880> the

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
that because when you convert it the

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.450 
that because when you convert it the
subtitles<00:05:21.900> will<00:05:22.110> be<00:05:22.260> hard-coded<00:05:22.890> into<00:05:23.220> the

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
subtitles will be hard-coded into the

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.510 
subtitles will be hard-coded into the
AVI<00:05:23.730> file<00:05:24.090> so<00:05:24.500> slick<00:05:25.500> none<00:05:25.740> before<00:05:26.130> you

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
AVI file so slick none before you

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.120 
AVI file so slick none before you
convert<00:05:26.940> your<00:05:27.470> your<00:05:28.820> DVD<00:05:29.820> to<00:05:30.030> avi<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:31.130> that's

convert your your DVD to avi and that's

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.270 
convert your your DVD to avi and that's
pretty<00:05:32.340> much<00:05:32.460> it<00:05:32.610> so<00:05:33.530> that's<00:05:34.530> how<00:05:34.740> you<00:05:34.800> convert

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
pretty much it so that's how you convert

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.090 
pretty much it so that's how you convert
DVD<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.240> avi<00:05:36.450> I<00:05:36.810> hope<00:05:37.200> you<00:05:37.320> enjoyed<00:05:37.620> it<00:05:37.650> if<00:05:37.830> you
