00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.629
 a greeting to all friends of 

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:13.049
 androidworld.it another focus on lg 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:15.719
 nexus 5 I want to focus on su 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.670
 then launch on a new launch of the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.279
 nexus 5 we don't know exactly yet 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.620
 how will the launch of the nexus in be 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.300
 general scusate nine launches the kat kit 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.610
 in general because google has specified 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.860
 that this launch that we see here is alone 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.480
 and only for nexus 5 so we have to 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.960
 wait for an update to find out 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.460
 since I have a nexus 4 but the nexus 4 that 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.120
 next I have already installed kitkat 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.280
 in the compiled version I show you 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.339
 this vodafone smart 4g which has a 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.940
 android stock lancer so we can 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:51.719
 make a comparison between the past and 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.039
 in short, the present or the future 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.799
 are the two block screens we start with 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.299
 here both have the camera that is 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:02.370
 access from left, however, in a kat kit 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.949
 there is this button to activate it 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.630
 both have google now which is activated 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.280
 From the bottom to the top 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.219
 here is a little circle that I have little 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.590
 black band here is this dart that 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:17.969
 however if pressed it does nothing at all 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.280
 exactly the button there are the widgets in 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:24.890
 both software with the difference 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.469
 that with the difference that in in android 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.740
 pin gelli are active by default on 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:36.689
 instead you have to activate jelly beans 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.929
 manually going safe because 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.850
 I would say quite obvious that obvious 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.789
 setting the screen lock for 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.829
 widget should be safe 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:51.210
 fear for your true safety 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:53.520
 widget skills and at this point we will have 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.320
 the same thing therefore we can also here 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.990
 scroll sideways and add 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.990
 widget we are there to show you how 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.609
 unlock unlock the same way 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.580
 after which we both have this ops 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:09.690
 now google fixed bar that is pitch 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.710
 on the top 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.870
 the aesthetics is slightly different 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.360
 the fonino to which it is full here is empty but 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.630
 in short, we are more or less the bar 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.200
 of notifications that bar of 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.010
 system bar notifications that is 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.400
 transparent kat kit 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.230
 it is instead black in jelly beans flowing 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.540
 laterally to the extreme left 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.250
 what we have here we have nothing 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.560
 let's scroll to the far left 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.660
 while here we have the same 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.320
 effect of movement by sliding towards 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.840
 right 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.500
 running to the left here we activate 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.810
 google now 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.770
 here we do not activate absolutely a beautiful 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.510
 I would say nothing is beautiful 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.360
 difference a huge second difference 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.070
 me the best thing because a good part 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.840
 some people have no idea what to do 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.270
 make this gesture google while 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.280
 instead they will discover in spite of themselves that 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.750
 on the far left is google 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.360
 now is a choice that I like that me 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.530
 I like it a lot I have to say but maybe 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.300
 may not arrive in all 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.110
 smartphone with those who do not know yet 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.540
 google is thinking we will let them know 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.010
 still if we enter the drawer of the 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.660
 applications this is called dro web 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.720
 for those who don't know what we have here 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.890
 meanwhile we have that the bar is continuing 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.230
 to remain transparent we have three 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.440
 dots to show us on which page 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.390
 we are and we no longer have this 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.100
 setting the widget with rate for the 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.330
 play store 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.190
 according to me the key of the taken the poor 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.390
 could still make sense to do 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.820
 understand where the users downloading 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.910
 applications but having gone to breed 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.250
 this bar here that is very clear 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.810
 it wasn't let's admit it wasn't but it is 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.960
 very beautifull 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.860
 this widget setting thing 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.800
 It happens 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:57.200
 we want to add widgets we hold 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.390
 pressed on the screen and on jelly beans 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.240
 we get the chance to change it 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.410
 background on kat kit 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.720
 we get the chance to change 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.310
 background to access the settings that 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.920
 attention are only those of google 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.470
 now it is not clear this thing and 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.210
 setting to add widgets to that 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.580
 it was a little clean and had 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.389
 this background ok my consideration 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.739
 however that 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.680
 I think you just need to keep in 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.599
 consideration is that the people of 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.729
 android is not just about geeks 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:29.759
 but it is also made up of people who do not have 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.409
 idea what happened to the widgets here 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:34.499
 willy-nilly aitchison ivano 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:36.479
 banged in the face by that voice ii e 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:37.860
 among other things you see it was passed to 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.749
 applications and widgets then finished le 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.759
 sooner or later applications would be noticed 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:43.889
 of these things if I pressed it came to me 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.569
 said that I have to keep pressed in short 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.879
 somehow I would have discovered the presence 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:50.969
 of the widgets here find out who i am 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:53.129
 widget can be a different undertaking 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:56.580
 because not everyone can guarantee it 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:59.520
 not everyone goes on holding and 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.080
 find out what is there you say yes but for 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.610
 change the background most but 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.219
 in the gallery and then sets as the background 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.050
 I can guarantee it 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:08.099
 I am in contact with many people who 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.169
 use android as you can 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.849
 imagine but I also think you do some 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.349
 a survey among your friends less 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.479
 nerd between some parent and him 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:17.400
 discover 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.139
 so the only way and hold here 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.749
 besides the fact that if yours 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.939
 full screen hold down want 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:26.610
 say press in this space vat here 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:28.069
 where you will fail here it is 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.240
 in short, there are good ones 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.490
 implementations has been somewhat refined 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.659
 the aesthetics according to me the big icons ok 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.389
 yes, indeed, that they really are 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:39.089
 big but I don't mind so much 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:41.370
 can make sense in the end the space is 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.930
 let's use it with nice icons if 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.509
 not that the icons are not even 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.710
 all the same this gd gp and bigger 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:49.169
 of that of google in short, there is still 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.810
 lots to do from google 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.370
 even if we put it this way if not 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.120
 according to their guidelines to those who owe them 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.860
 to follow therefore more or less I would say that here 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.629
 there is everything going from the notification bar 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.219
 excuse pitfalls leon attimo only for 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:06.930
 just remove the notifications from the bar 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:10.139
 notifications are almost identical 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.719
 if we press here we go well here 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.560
 we forced the battery but it is 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:15.750
 just this smartphone 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.699
 here the space that would have been 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.259
 empty here we have dedicated it to the geo 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:20.310
 localization in android ice cream 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.770
 sandwich 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.580
 also the settings buttons are 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.620
 obviously 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:31.110
 changed so these are the 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.599
 differences the angel novelties of 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.030
 android kit car i admit i was a 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:37.370
 pò critical but I like it better 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.930
 compared to the past 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:43.349
 we say that we are not yet right 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.090
 functionality because for us geeky 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:46.860
 we can only see the news 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.099
 positive while there are things 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.930
 as intuitive as saying how much 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:55.139
 as intuitive as an interface can be 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:58.530
 be simple to do advanced things and 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:00.629
 without knowing you are still there 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:04.800
 really work to do about it 

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:07.770
 for this focus on the android lancer 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.340
 gem and in particular of lg nexus 5 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:13.340
 all a greeting they gave leccisotti 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.340
