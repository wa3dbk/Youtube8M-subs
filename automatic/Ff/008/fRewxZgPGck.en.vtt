then<00:01:38.159> he<00:01:38.250> only<00:01:38.430> made<00:01:38.670> one<00:01:38.880> stalker<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.570> drop

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
then he only made one stalker and drop

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.840 
then he only made one stalker and drop
the<00:01:39.990> Stargate<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:40.799> he<00:01:41.159> does<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.369> again<00:01:41.610> I

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the Stargate if he does that again I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.429 
the Stargate if he does that again I
think<00:01:42.119> he's<00:01:42.390> going<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.810> trouble<00:01:43.049> again

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
think he's going to be in trouble again

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.499 
think he's going to be in trouble again
despite<00:01:43.920> showing<00:01:44.490> us<00:01:44.729> some<00:01:44.880> very<00:01:44.909> very<00:01:45.240> nice

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
despite showing us some very very nice

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.210 
despite showing us some very very nice
micro<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:45.990> your<00:01:46.110> planet<00:01:46.439> Earth<00:01:46.530> alright<00:01:47.009> well

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
micro on your planet Earth alright well

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.219 
micro on your planet Earth alright well
first<00:01:47.460> element<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:47.939> out<00:01:48.060> first<00:01:48.360> stalker<00:01:48.840> is

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
first element is out first stalker is

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.800 
first element is out first stalker is
popping<00:01:49.860> out<00:01:49.979> shortly<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.909> we<00:01:51.000> gotta<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
popping out shortly and we gotta and

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.260 
popping out shortly and we gotta and
actually<00:01:52.200> no<00:01:52.290> mothership<00:01:52.710> core<00:01:52.920> gonna<00:01:53.520> gym<00:01:53.790> we

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
actually no mothership core gonna gym we

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.600 
actually no mothership core gonna gym we
got<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> century<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.079> Alicia<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:56.159> now<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
got a century for Alicia and now a

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.130 
got a century for Alicia and now a
mothership<00:01:57.030> core<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.450> well<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> think<00:01:57.930> he's

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
mothership core as well so I think he's

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.780 
mothership core as well so I think he's
going<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.350> go<00:01:58.409> Stargate<00:01:58.829> man<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.640> actually

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
going to go Stargate man and I actually

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.910 
going to go Stargate man and I actually
think<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.240> Jim<00:02:00.600> might<00:02:01.380> be<00:02:01.560> able<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.740> get

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
think that Jim might be able to get

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.770 
think that Jim might be able to get
financed<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> high<00:02:02.700> ground<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:03.210> will

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
financed up on the high ground we will

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.450 
financed up on the high ground we will
see<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.170> two<00:02:04.290> additional<00:02:04.710> gates<00:02:04.920> are<00:02:05.100> down<00:02:05.130> so

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
see the two additional gates are down so

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.770 
see the two additional gates are down so
it<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.909> be<00:02:05.939> triggered<00:02:06.360> aggression

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
it is going to be triggered aggression

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.630 
it is going to be triggered aggression
he's<00:02:07.320> not<00:02:07.530> building<00:02:07.740> any<00:02:07.979> probes<00:02:08.250> right<00:02:08.459> now

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
he's not building any probes right now

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.669 
he's not building any probes right now
will<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.569> pro<00:02:09.720> be<00:02:09.869> able<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.140> get<00:02:10.259> off<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.500> room

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
will the pro be able to get off the room

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.960 
will the pro be able to get off the room
will<00:02:10.920> we<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.069> able<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.370> pilots<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
will we be able to get pilots of the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.620 
will we be able to get pilots of the
ramp

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
ramp

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.710 
ramp
that<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.470> big<00:02:13.620> question<00:02:13.650> right<00:02:14.100> now<00:02:14.130> but

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
that is the big question right now but

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.300 
that is the big question right now but
there<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> century<00:02:16.380> waiting<00:02:16.770> at<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.040> top<00:02:17.280> of

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
there is a century waiting at the top of

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.610 
there is a century waiting at the top of
that<00:02:17.730> ramp<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.390> as<00:02:18.510> long<00:02:18.720> as<00:02:18.990> Alicia<00:02:19.410> doesn't

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
that ramp so as long as Alicia doesn't

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.470 
that ramp so as long as Alicia doesn't
miss<00:02:19.860> his<00:02:19.890> force<00:02:20.310> fields<00:02:20.730> often<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.360> don't

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
miss his force fields often you don't

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.760 
miss his force fields often you don't
want<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.780> force<00:02:22.020> with<00:02:22.200> too<00:02:22.350> early<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.590> what

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
want to force with too early that what

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.260 
want to force with too early that what
is<00:02:22.860> promising<00:02:23.220> are<00:02:23.400> two<00:02:23.520> additional<00:02:23.610> stalkers

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
is promising are two additional stalkers

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.490 
is promising are two additional stalkers
he's<00:02:24.420> setting<00:02:24.690> out<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.810> mothership<00:02:25.230> core<00:02:25.410> is

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
he's setting out the mothership core is

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.720 
he's setting out the mothership core is
definitely<00:02:25.830> gonna<00:02:25.890> need<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.160> mothership<00:02:26.490> core

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
definitely gonna need a mothership core

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.940 
definitely gonna need a mothership core
to<00:02:26.850> defend<00:02:27.120> at<00:02:27.210> home<00:02:27.360> any<00:02:27.810> additional<00:02:28.200> dps<00:02:28.770> is

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
to defend at home any additional dps is

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.710 
to defend at home any additional dps is
going<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.220> be<00:02:29.340> super<00:02:29.640> super<00:02:30.150> important<00:02:30.600> right

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
going to be super super important right

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.870 
going to be super super important right
now<00:02:30.750> for<00:02:30.870> Alicia<00:02:31.380> will<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.220> probe<00:02:32.430> get<00:02:32.640> up<00:02:32.760> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
now for Alicia will the probe get up the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.310 
now for Alicia will the probe get up the
ramp<00:02:33.090> okay<00:02:33.660> he's<00:02:33.780> going<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.960> get<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.110> first

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
ramp okay he's going to get the first

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.960 
ramp okay he's going to get the first
part<00:02:34.470> there's<00:02:34.980> no<00:02:35.130> way<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.370> probe<00:02:35.580> gets<00:02:35.730> up

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
part there's no way that probe gets up

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.240 
part there's no way that probe gets up
as<00:02:36.210> as<00:02:36.840> Alicia<00:02:37.350> already<00:02:37.740> sees<00:02:38.010> what's

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
as as Alicia already sees what's

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.280 
as as Alicia already sees what's
happening<00:02:38.700> gonna<00:02:39.360> get<00:02:39.510> up<00:02:39.690> he's<00:02:39.990> going<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.230> be

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
happening gonna get up he's going to be

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.170 
happening gonna get up he's going to be
able<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.500> drop<00:02:40.650> nutrients<00:02:41.520> so<00:02:41.760> we<00:02:41.970> are<00:02:42.060> gonna

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
able to drop nutrients so we are gonna

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.570 
able to drop nutrients so we are gonna
have<00:02:42.300> extra<00:02:42.600> pylons<00:02:42.990> going<00:02:43.320> down<00:02:43.590> perhaps<00:02:44.460> a

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
have extra pylons going down perhaps a

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.070 
have extra pylons going down perhaps a
mistake<00:02:44.940> from<00:02:45.120> Alicia<00:02:45.390> not<00:02:45.630> force<00:02:45.870> feeding

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
mistake from Alicia not force feeding

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.280 
mistake from Alicia not force feeding
this<00:02:46.230> out<00:02:46.440> but<00:02:46.740> he<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.160> going<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.370> try<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:48.290> and

one zealot is through and pounding away
on<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.420> stalker<00:02:54.900> he<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.170> going<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.470> go<00:02:55.620> down
