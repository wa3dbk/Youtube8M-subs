we'd guide the player with texture with

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.669 
we'd guide the player with texture with
lighting<00:02:04.159> with<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.479> sound<00:02:06.500> we<00:02:07.500> obviously

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
lighting with a I sound we obviously

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.130 
lighting with a I sound we obviously
want<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> make<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.599> there<00:02:09.929> aren't

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
want to make it so that there aren't

to be modeled by an artist I mean

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.940 
to be modeled by an artist I mean
there's<00:02:18.690> someone<00:02:18.810> went<00:02:19.019> in<00:02:19.110> there<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.500> for

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
there's someone went in there and for

an<00:02:25.500> artist<00:02:25.739> there<00:02:25.950> someone<00:02:26.580> had<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.760> go

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
an artist there someone had to go

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.500 
an artist there someone had to go
through<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.180> make<00:02:27.299> all<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:29.239> what<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.269> like

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
through and make all that what I like

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.620 
through and make all that what I like

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
most about halo is that we don't build

really<00:02:53.459> is<00:02:53.610> all<00:02:53.910> about<00:02:54.239> when<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:54.840> happens<00:02:55.260> do

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
really is all about when this happens do

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.990 
really is all about when this happens do
this<00:02:55.680> when<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.190> other<00:02:56.340> thing<00:02:56.549> happens<00:02:56.849> do

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
this when this other thing happens do

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.069 
this when this other thing happens do
this<00:02:59.209> that's<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.360> lot<00:03:00.510> more<00:03:00.690> like<00:03:00.900> the

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
this that's a lot more like the

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.509 
this that's a lot more like the
designers<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.560> mean<00:03:01.769> an<00:03:01.980> artist

designers I mean an artist
step<00:03:02.849> in<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.180> just<00:03:03.390> deciding<00:03:03.900> we<00:03:04.410> have<00:03:04.560> all

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
step in is just deciding we have all

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.870 
step in is just deciding we have all
this<00:03:04.769> cool<00:03:04.950> technology<00:03:05.519> how<00:03:05.670> are<00:03:05.730> we<00:03:05.819> gonna

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
this cool technology how are we gonna

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.670 
this cool technology how are we gonna
use<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.359> and<00:03:06.690> how<00:03:07.079> are<00:03:07.139> you<00:03:07.200> gonna<00:03:07.319> create<00:03:07.530> this

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
use it and how are you gonna create this

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.949 
use it and how are you gonna create this
experience<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.489> that<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.389> player<00:03:09.660> can

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
experience that that the player can

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.970 
experience that that the player can
understand<00:03:10.500> you<00:03:10.980> know<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.130> that<00:03:12.060> when<00:03:12.980> you

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
understand you know that that when you

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.440 
understand you know that that when you
know<00:03:14.100> he<00:03:14.310> sees<00:03:14.549> a<00:03:14.579> certain<00:03:14.850> type<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.120> thing

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
know he sees a certain type of thing

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.430 
know he sees a certain type of thing
that<00:03:15.480> if<00:03:15.690> he<00:03:15.780> shoots<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.139> it's<00:03:16.260> going<00:03:16.380> to

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
that if he shoots that it's going to

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.809 
that if he shoots that it's going to
blow<00:03:16.680> up<00:03:16.799> in<00:03:16.920> this<00:03:17.010> we<00:03:17.130> go<00:03:17.220> destroy<00:03:17.609> it<00:03:17.730> and

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
blow up in this we go destroy it and

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.580 
blow up in this we go destroy it and
pass<00:03:18.000> through<00:03:18.299> it

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.570 

most<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.740> the<00:03:22.800> halo<00:03:22.980> world<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.430> not

most of the halo world is not

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.310 
most of the halo world is not
destructible<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.240> have<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.450> walk<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:24.690> fine

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
destructible you have to walk a fine

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.810 
destructible you have to walk a fine
line<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.800> deciding<00:03:26.190> what<00:03:26.370> things<00:03:26.610> are<00:03:26.700> gonna

line and deciding what things are gonna

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.070 
line and deciding what things are gonna
be<00:03:26.910> destructible<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.480> what's<00:03:27.720> gonna<00:03:27.840> match

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
be destructible and what's gonna match

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.480 
be destructible and what's gonna match
the<00:03:28.260> players<00:03:28.470> expectations<00:03:29.190> for<00:03:29.310> what's

destroyable when someone says hey the

whole world is destructible that's

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.520 
whole world is destructible that's
that's<00:03:33.120> great<00:03:33.360> we've<00:03:33.600> done<00:03:33.810> our<00:03:33.930> job<00:03:34.170> we've

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
that's great we've done our job we've

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.730 
that's great we've done our job we've
made<00:03:35.190> them<00:03:35.340> believe<00:03:35.490> that<00:03:39.350> so<00:03:40.350> that<00:03:40.500> kind<00:03:40.680> of

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
made them believe that so that kind of

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.920 
made them believe that so that kind of
thing<00:03:40.890> really<00:03:41.100> excites<00:03:41.459> me<00:03:41.550> is<00:03:42.060> being<00:03:42.600> able<00:03:42.780> to

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
thing really excites me is being able to

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.890 
thing really excites me is being able to
create<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.709> real<00:03:43.920> environment<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.690> not<00:03:45.690> take

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
create a real environment and not take

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.530 
create a real environment and not take
shortcuts<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.620> not<00:03:46.910> fake<00:03:47.910> things<00:03:48.240> and

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
shortcuts and not fake things and

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.670 
shortcuts and not fake things and
actually<00:03:48.690> just<00:03:48.990> get<00:03:49.200> in<00:03:49.320> there<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.560> really

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
actually just get in there and really

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.350 
actually just get in there and really
try<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:49.980> make<00:03:50.100> it<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.370> real<00:03:50.580> place<00:03:50.910> with<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.150> real

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
try to make it a real place with a real

00:03:51.360 --> 00:04:03.920 
try to make it a real place with a real
exciting<00:03:51.660> place<00:03:52.020> for<00:03:52.050> for<00:03:52.980> people<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.250> go<00:04:02.930> if

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
exciting place for for people to go if

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.090 
exciting place for for people to go if
you<00:04:04.050> can<00:04:04.170> set<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.410> up<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.709> each<00:04:04.890> new

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
you can set it up so that each new

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.620 
you can set it up so that each new
