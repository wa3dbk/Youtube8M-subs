weight shift and whenever the engine did

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.280 
weight shift and whenever the engine did
torque<00:01:23.159> over<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:24.509> would<00:01:24.600> cause<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.020> frame<00:01:25.259> to

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
all the way in flight here what you want

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.589 
all the way in flight here what you want
to<00:03:05.709> do<00:03:05.769> is<00:03:05.859> the<00:03:06.010> opposite<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:07.239> want<00:03:07.419> to<00:03:07.480> leave

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
to do is the opposite you want to leave

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:14.169 
reason being the length of that strap is

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.110 
reason being the length of that strap is
going<00:03:14.380> to<00:03:14.440> be<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.590> limiting<00:03:14.859> factor<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.970> how

going to be the limiting factor and how

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.960 
going to be the limiting factor and how

I'm

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
I'm

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.730 
I'm
here<00:03:28.520> that<00:03:29.300> allows<00:03:29.390> my<00:03:29.750> legs<00:03:30.020> more<00:03:30.260> freedom<00:03:30.620> of

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
movement cross over each other so I can

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.070 
movement cross over each other so I can

into my leg a little bit so that's a

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.930 
into my leg a little bit so that's a
little<00:04:18.140> more<00:04:18.260> comfortable<00:04:18.620> level<00:04:19.010> another

lift this up pull up those 2j bars are

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.850 
lift this up pull up those 2j bars are
no<00:04:32.419> longer<00:04:32.660> in<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:32.960> original<00:04:33.110> position<00:04:33.740> they

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
no longer in the original position they

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.900 
no longer in the original position they
were<00:04:33.919> on<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.220> frame<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:34.700> no<00:04:34.790> longer

more<00:04:37.669> the<00:04:38.390> reason<00:04:38.720> for<00:04:38.900> that<00:04:41.200> when<00:04:42.200> this<00:04:42.290> was

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
more the reason for that when this was

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.770 
more the reason for that when this was
in<00:04:42.560> its<00:04:42.680> up<00:04:42.800> position<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:44.240> angle<00:04:44.600> of<00:04:44.630> this

in its up position the angle of this
seat<00:04:45.080> board<00:04:46.270> would<00:04:47.270> be<00:04:47.390> higher<00:04:47.630> up<00:04:48.040> that<00:04:49.040> gave

seat board would be higher up that gave

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.310 
seat board would be higher up that gave
you<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.520> knees<00:04:49.760> in<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.060> chest<00:04:50.330> feeling<00:04:50.600> by
