now<00:00:04.620> let's<00:00:04.830> talk<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.100> little<00:00:05.220> bit<00:00:05.430> about<00:00:05.580> the

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
now let's talk a little bit about the

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.150 
now let's talk a little bit about the
move<00:00:06.270> scale<00:00:06.840> and<00:00:06.899> rotate<00:00:07.109> tools

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
move scale and rotate tools

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.420 
move scale and rotate tools
let's<00:00:08.760> get<00:00:08.940> an<00:00:09.059> object<00:00:09.269> in<00:00:09.660> here<00:00:12.980> we<00:00:13.980> have<00:00:14.250> if

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:14.430 
let's get an object in here we have if

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.790 
let's get an object in here we have if
we<00:00:14.550> just<00:00:14.790> hover<00:00:15.360> over<00:00:15.810> these<00:00:15.930> accesses<00:00:16.650> and

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
we just hover over these accesses and

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.710 
we just hover over these accesses and
you'll<00:00:16.920> notice<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.279> they<00:00:17.580> highlight<00:00:18.060> and

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
you'll notice that they highlight and

you'll notice that they highlight and
you<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:18.960> click<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.260> them<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.830> drag<00:00:20.100> them

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
you can click on them and drag them

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.930 
you can click on them and drag them
anywhere<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.080> would<00:00:22.140> like<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.130> notice

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
anywhere you would like to and notice

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.580 
anywhere you would like to and notice
the<00:00:24.180> number<00:00:24.780> in<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.020> middle<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.380> screen

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the number in the middle of the screen

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.029 
the number in the middle of the screen
on<00:00:26.400> or<00:00:26.880> should<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.270> say<00:00:27.680> wherever<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.740> start

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
dragging exactly the number you are

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.470 
dragging exactly the number you are
moving<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.669> notice<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.059> starts<00:00:33.239> from

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
moving it so so notice it starts from

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.840 
moving it so so notice it starts from
zero<00:00:33.930> every<00:00:34.559> time<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.829> start<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.250> click<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.670> a

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.059 
zero every time I start to click and a
it<00:00:36.120> actually<00:00:36.929> tells<00:00:37.199> you<00:00:37.350> how<00:00:37.440> many<00:00:37.620> units

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:38.069 
it actually tells you how many units

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:41.509 
it actually tells you how many units
you're<00:00:38.339> moving<00:00:39.079> within<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.199> viewport<00:00:40.519> along

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
you're moving within the viewport along

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:42.879 
you're moving within the viewport along
that<00:00:41.819> axis

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:42.889 
that axis

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:45.410 
that axis
notice<00:00:43.889> also<00:00:44.069> your<00:00:44.399> position<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.909> given<00:00:45.059> here

notice also your position is given here
in<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.659> coordinates<00:00:46.289> right<00:00:47.129> here<00:00:47.420> if<00:00:48.420> you'd

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:48.569 
in the coordinates right here if you'd

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:50.090 
in the coordinates right here if you'd
like<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.899> change<00:00:49.049> that<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.409> zero<00:00:49.679> you<00:00:49.829> can<00:00:49.920> just

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
like to change that to zero you can just

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.520 
like to change that to zero you can just
press<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.489> zero<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.089> front<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.389> there<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.749> each

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
press the zero in front of there in each

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.029 
press the zero in front of there in each
one<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.920> these<00:00:53.269> and<00:00:54.269> then<00:00:54.780> hit<00:00:54.989> enter<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.709> it

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
one of these and then hit enter and it

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.099 
one of these and then hit enter and it
will<00:00:56.129> automatically<00:00:56.670> go<00:00:56.850> right<00:00:57.120> back<00:00:57.389> to<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
will automatically go right back to the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.439 
will automatically go right back to the
origin<00:00:58.649> which<00:00:59.429> is<00:00:59.639> the<00:00:59.940> zero<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:01.139> every<00:01:01.559> axis

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
origin which is the zero on every axis

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.240 
origin which is the zero on every axis
and<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.690> also<00:01:03.869> adjust<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.320> size<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.920> here

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
and you can also adjust the size in here

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.320 
and you can also adjust the size in here
notice<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.299> doesn't<00:01:07.640> notice<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.730> changes<00:01:09.120> them

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
notice it doesn't notice it changes them

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.810 
notice it doesn't notice it changes them
all<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:10.530> reason<00:01:10.770> why<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:10.980> changes<00:01:11.370> them<00:01:11.580> all

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
all the reason why it changes them all

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.000 
all the reason why it changes them all
is<00:01:12.000> because<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:13.110> still<00:01:13.440> haven't<00:01:13.710> converted

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
is because we still haven't converted

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.720 
is because we still haven't converted
this<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.370> an<00:01:14.580> editable<00:01:14.730> object<00:01:16.580> when<00:01:17.580> you're

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
this to an editable object when you're

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.490 
this to an editable object when you're
stuck<00:01:18.320> within<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.950> confines<00:01:20.370> of<00:01:21.200> these<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
stuck within the confines of these and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.990 
stuck within the confines of these and
the<00:01:22.560> attributes<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.370> original<00:01:23.850> attributes

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
the attributes the original attributes

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.650 
the attributes the original attributes
that<00:01:24.510> go<00:01:24.570> along<00:01:25.440> with<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.920> cone<00:01:26.330> which<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.360> why

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
that go along with the cone which is why

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.990 
that go along with the cone which is why
they<00:01:27.840> still<00:01:28.140> exist

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
they still exist

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.580 
they still exist
so<00:01:30.000> we<00:01:30.120> can't<00:01:30.360> change<00:01:30.480> that<00:01:30.990> unless<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.410> make

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
so we can't change that unless we make

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.120 
so we can't change that unless we make
this<00:01:31.710> object<00:01:31.980> edible<00:01:33.200> now<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.470> we<00:01:34.620> change<00:01:34.830> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
this object edible now if we change the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.080 
this object edible now if we change the
size<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.670> something<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:37.110> apply<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:38.700> will<00:01:38.880> only

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
size of something and apply it will only

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.350 
size of something and apply it will only
apply<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.480> to<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.900> one<00:01:40.290> axis<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.360> not

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
apply it to that one axis and not

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.000 
apply it to that one axis and not
everything<00:01:43.790> so<00:01:44.840> we<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> little<00:01:46.290> funny

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
everything so we have a little funny

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.240 
everything so we have a little funny
kind<00:01:47.400> of<00:01:47.460> shape<00:01:47.760> there<00:01:48.230> yes<00:01:49.230> I<00:01:49.380> could<00:01:49.560> look

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
kind of shape there yes I could look

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.910 
kind of shape there yes I could look
like<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.670> go<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:50.940> a<00:01:51.060> look<00:01:51.930> like<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> piece<00:01:52.650> of<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
like and go on a look like a piece of a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.950 
like and go on a look like a piece of a
ring<00:01:53.190> or<00:01:53.370> something<00:01:53.580> no<00:01:54.300> it's<00:01:54.450> also<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.810> can

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
ring or something no it's also we can

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.780 
ring or something no it's also we can
make<00:01:55.440> a<00:01:55.470> shape<00:01:55.800> negative<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.520> if<00:01:56.610> we<00:01:56.700> apply

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
make a shape negative so if we apply

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.500 
make a shape negative so if we apply
that<00:01:57.290> we'll<00:01:58.290> get<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.650> inverse<00:01:59.460> on<00:01:59.700> on<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.330> y

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
that we'll get the inverse on on the y

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.360 
that we'll get the inverse on on the y
axis<00:02:00.540> now<00:02:03.440> we've<00:02:04.440> been<00:02:04.590> sizing<00:02:04.950> with<00:02:05.130> this

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
axis now we've been sizing with this

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.800 
axis now we've been sizing with this
with<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.700> coordinates<00:02:06.060> manager<00:02:06.510> what<00:02:06.690> you

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
with the coordinates manager what you

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.800 
with the coordinates manager what you
can<00:02:07.110> can<00:02:07.680> do<00:02:07.979> or<00:02:08.879> if<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.390> go<00:02:09.659> into

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
can can do or if you can just go into

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.190 
can can do or if you can just go into
the<00:02:09.929> scale<00:02:10.349> scale<00:02:11.250> tool<00:02:11.549> right<00:02:11.849> here<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:13.049> can

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
the scale scale tool right here you can

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.640 
the scale scale tool right here you can
click<00:02:13.319> on<00:02:13.469> this<00:02:13.590> axis<00:02:14.120> notice<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.420> doesn't

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
click on this axis notice it doesn't

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.750 
click on this axis notice it doesn't
doesn't

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760

change it doesn't go farther than the
bottom<00:02:18.799> there<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.189> you'd<00:02:19.970> have<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:21.310> use<00:02:22.310> the

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
bottom there so you'd have to use the

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.080 
bottom there so you'd have to use the
negative<00:02:22.909> and<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:24.189> then<00:02:25.189> then<00:02:25.849> you<00:02:26.060> have

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
negative and that then then you have

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.399

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
like to you can't go past an axis so if

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.140 
like to you can't go past an axis so if
you<00:02:33.920> go<00:02:34.159> so<00:02:34.400> far<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:35.299> stops<00:02:36.549> now<00:02:37.549> if<00:02:37.849> you<00:02:38.000> hold

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
you go so far it stops now if you hold

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.780

looking find it to that axis so garlis

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.330 
looking find it to that axis so garlis
and<00:04:24.199> whether<00:04:24.349> you<00:04:24.500> see<00:04:24.680> your<00:04:24.770> controls<00:04:25.130> if<00:04:25.250> you

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
and whether you see your controls if you

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.909 
and whether you see your controls if you
click<00:04:25.550> on<00:04:25.700> the<00:04:25.820> open<00:04:26.150> and<00:04:26.659> will<00:04:27.169> only<00:04:27.409> adjust

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
click on the open and will only adjust

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.589 
click on the open and will only adjust
the<00:04:28.159> x-axis

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
the x-axis

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.109 
the x-axis
and<00:04:30.139> notice<00:04:30.439> that<00:04:30.639> changes<00:04:31.639> for<00:04:31.789> every<00:04:31.939> tool

00:04:32.109 --> 00:04:32.119 
and notice that changes for every tool

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:33.820 
and notice that changes for every tool
so<00:04:32.240> if<00:04:32.330> you<00:04:32.389> go<00:04:32.509> back<00:04:32.629> to<00:04:32.749> the<00:04:32.809> move<00:04:32.990> tool<00:04:33.020> it

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
so if you go back to the move tool it

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.760 
so if you go back to the move tool it
has<00:04:34.460> all<00:04:34.729> the<00:04:34.849> accesses<00:04:35.240> available<00:04:35.869> so<00:04:36.589> these

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
has all the accesses available so these

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.699 
has all the accesses available so these
settings<00:04:37.309> are<00:04:37.369> actually<00:04:37.699> different<00:04:38.709> for

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:39.709 
settings are actually different for

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:41.709 
settings are actually different for
every<00:04:40.039> independent<00:04:40.399> tool<00:04:41.389> you<00:04:41.569> have

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:41.719 
every independent tool you have

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:45.279 
every independent tool you have
including<00:04:42.289> the<00:04:42.319> rotate<00:04:42.770> tool<00:04:43.659> which<00:04:44.659> works

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
including the rotate tool which works

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.399 
including the rotate tool which works
the<00:04:45.379> same<00:04:45.589> way<00:04:46.719> movement<00:04:47.719> like<00:04:47.779> this<00:04:48.020> except

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409 
the same way movement like this except

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.809 
the same way movement like this except
he'll<00:04:51.409> down<00:04:51.649> shift<00:04:52.129> notice<00:04:52.520> it's<00:04:52.729> only

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819 
he'll down shift notice it's only

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:57.699 
he'll down shift notice it's only
rotating<00:04:53.469> on<00:04:54.469> the<00:04:54.619> y-axis<00:04:56.080> so<00:04:57.080> there's<00:04:57.319> not

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:57.709 
rotating on the y-axis so there's not

00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:01.109 
rotating on the y-axis so there's not
not<00:04:58.099> really<00:04:58.429> a<00:04:58.459> whole<00:04:58.699> lot<00:04:58.909> that's<00:04:59.119> done<00:04:59.449> there

00:05:01.109 --> 00:05:01.119 
not really a whole lot that's done there

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:03.899 
not really a whole lot that's done there
unless<00:05:02.119> you<00:05:02.270> move<00:05:02.419> your<00:05:02.599> mouse<00:05:02.779> another<00:05:03.139> way

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
unless you move your mouse another way

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.059 
unless you move your mouse another way
then<00:05:04.909> you<00:05:05.149> can<00:05:05.330> get<00:05:05.839> all<00:05:06.199> kind<00:05:06.680> of<00:05:06.800> like<00:05:06.949> the

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:07.069 
then you can get all kind of like the

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.249 
then you can get all kind of like the
notice<00:05:07.339> again<00:05:07.999> in<00:05:08.509> your<00:05:08.659> coordinates<00:05:09.139> it

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
notice again in your coordinates it

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.070 
notice again in your coordinates it
tells<00:05:09.469> you<00:05:09.619> where<00:05:09.860> things<00:05:10.189> are<00:05:10.369> moving<00:05:11.080> so

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
tells you where things are moving so

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.480 
tells you where things are moving so
you're<00:05:12.229> not<00:05:12.319> just<00:05:12.559> moving<00:05:12.740> things<00:05:13.099> in<00:05:13.399> the

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
you're not just moving things in the

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.549 
you're not just moving things in the
dark<00:05:13.759> can<00:05:14.539> actually<00:05:14.839> know<00:05:15.020> where<00:05:15.349> are<00:05:15.439> you

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:15.559 
dark can actually know where are you

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:18.999 
dark can actually know where are you
moving<00:05:15.709> them<00:05:16.899> and<00:05:17.899> also<00:05:18.229> you<00:05:18.349> can<00:05:18.529> quantize

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 
moving them and also you can quantize

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.459 
moving them and also you can quantize
your<00:05:19.249> movements<00:05:19.899> now<00:05:20.899> you<00:05:20.990> can<00:05:21.139> move<00:05:21.289> the

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:21.469 
your movements now you can move the

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:24.719 
your movements now you can move the
mouse<00:05:21.619> left<00:05:22.009> to<00:05:22.069> right<00:05:22.479> or<00:05:23.479> up<00:05:23.539> and<00:05:23.990> down

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
mouse left to right or up and down

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.689 
mouse left to right or up and down
move<00:05:25.729> it<00:05:25.879> along<00:05:25.939> those<00:05:26.269> accesses<00:05:26.930> so<00:05:27.699> you

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
move it along those accesses so you

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:30.939 
move it along those accesses so you
notice<00:05:28.969> it<00:05:29.089> quantize<00:05:29.539> it<00:05:29.569> so<00:05:29.990> it<00:05:30.110> remains<00:05:30.709> it

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
notice it quantize it so it remains it

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.939 
notice it quantize it so it remains it
gets<00:05:31.610> angles<00:05:32.169> degrees<00:05:33.169> of<00:05:33.379> five

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
gets angles degrees of five

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:39.299 
gets angles degrees of five
yes<00:05:34.819> degrees<00:05:35.240> of<00:05:35.389> five<00:05:35.629> so<00:05:37.419> move<00:05:38.419> it<00:05:38.479> here

00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:39.309 
yes degrees of five so move it here

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:45.489 
yes degrees of five so move it here
intervals<00:05:40.309> of<00:05:40.459> ten<00:05:42.459> so<00:05:43.459> that's<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.659> move

00:05:45.489 --> 00:05:45.499 
intervals of ten so that's the move

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:48.459 
intervals of ten so that's the move
scale<00:05:45.800> and<00:05:45.860> rotate<00:05:46.069> tools<00:05:47.139> we<00:05:48.139> also<00:05:48.289> know

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:48.469 
scale and rotate tools we also know

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:50.439

for this is a strange button I generally

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:05.019 
for this is a strange button I generally
don't<00:06:01.249> use<00:06:01.399> this<00:06:02.529> doesn't<00:06:03.529> seem<00:06:04.339> to<00:06:04.490> do<00:06:04.699> a<00:06:04.729> lot

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:05.029 
don't use this doesn't seem to do a lot

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:08.350 
don't use this doesn't seem to do a lot
for<00:06:05.059> me<00:06:05.539> if<00:06:06.439> you<00:06:06.740> um<00:06:06.919> if<00:06:07.159> you<00:06:07.339> click<00:06:07.699> on<00:06:07.969> the

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
for me if you um if you click on the

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.389 
for me if you um if you click on the
open<00:06:08.749> start<00:06:09.379> moving<00:06:10.149> right<00:06:11.149> hold<00:06:11.360> on<00:06:11.419> I<00:06:11.539> think

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:12.399 
open start moving right hold on I think

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:14.469 
open start moving right hold on I think
all<00:06:13.399> right<00:06:13.490> let's<00:06:13.669> constrain<00:06:14.089> this<00:06:14.269> to<00:06:14.389> the

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
all right let's constrain this to the

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.299 
all right let's constrain this to the
y-axis<00:06:15.079> okay<00:06:15.379> if<00:06:15.499> we<00:06:15.589> click<00:06:15.829> and<00:06:15.949> drag<00:06:16.099> it

00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:16.309 
y-axis okay if we click and drag it

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:17.939 
y-axis okay if we click and drag it
constrains<00:06:16.639> it<00:06:16.819> to<00:06:16.909> the<00:06:16.969> y-axis<00:06:17.449> but<00:06:17.599> notice

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
constrains it to the y-axis but notice

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.909 
constrains it to the y-axis but notice
now<00:06:18.949> the<00:06:19.009> object<00:06:19.430> is<00:06:19.519> oriented<00:06:20.089> on<00:06:20.449> its<00:06:20.629> own

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
now the object is oriented on its own

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:26.350 
now the object is oriented on its own
y-axis<00:06:22.809> we<00:06:23.809> use<00:06:23.959> the<00:06:24.079> world<00:06:24.319> object<00:06:24.740> system<00:06:25.360> it

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
y-axis we use the world object system it

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.399 
y-axis we use the world object system it
goes<00:06:26.629> straight<00:06:26.899> up<00:06:27.259> the<00:06:27.589> world<00:06:27.979> I'm<00:06:28.279> the<00:06:28.939> world

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:29.409 
goes straight up the world I'm the world

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.589 
goes straight up the world I'm the world
y-axis<00:06:30.550> so<00:06:31.550> if<00:06:31.610> we<00:06:31.729> actually<00:06:31.879> middle<00:06:32.389> click

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 
y-axis so if we actually middle click

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:34.480 
y-axis so if we actually middle click
and<00:06:32.809> go<00:06:33.199> into<00:06:33.379> the<00:06:33.529> front<00:06:33.709> view<00:06:33.919> and<00:06:34.159> clicking

and go into the front view and clicking

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.879 
and go into the front view and clicking

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
back in the perspective view now just
