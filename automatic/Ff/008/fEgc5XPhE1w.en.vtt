00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.770 

in<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.230> tutorial<00:00:01.410> we<00:00:01.860> are<00:00:01.890> going<00:00:01.979> to<00:00:02.220> extract

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:02.780 
in this tutorial we are going to extract

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.840 
in this tutorial we are going to extract
precipitation<00:00:03.780> data<00:00:03.899> from<00:00:04.319> TRMM<00:00:04.950> website<00:00:05.370> and

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
precipitation data from TRMM website and

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.810 
precipitation data from TRMM website and
source<00:00:06.150> is<00:00:06.299> NASA<00:00:06.509> so<00:00:07.500> we<00:00:07.620> have<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.830> write<00:00:08.040> TRMM

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
source is NASA so we have to write TRMM

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.870 
source is NASA so we have to write TRMM
online<00:00:09.150> visualization<00:00:09.900> in<00:00:10.050> Google<00:00:10.700> it<00:00:11.700> will

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
online visualization in Google it will

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.090 
online visualization in Google it will
guide<00:00:12.030> us<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.420> website<00:00:15.230> just<00:00:16.230> we<00:00:16.830> have<00:00:16.920> to

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
guide us this website just we have to

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.480 
guide us this website just we have to
scroll<00:00:17.369> bit<00:00:17.609> lower<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.570> then<00:00:19.289> click<00:00:20.220> on<00:00:20.369> that

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
scroll bit lower and then click on that

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:30.290 
scroll bit lower and then click on that
link<00:00:24.680> there<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.430> called<00:00:27.119> Tova's<00:00:29.300> urmm

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
link there it is this called Tova's urmm

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.400 
link there it is this called Tova's urmm
online<00:00:30.570> visualization<00:00:31.910> so<00:00:33.170> focusing<00:00:34.170> only<00:00:34.290> on

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
online visualization so focusing only on

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.190 
online visualization so focusing only on
the<00:00:34.469> daily<00:00:34.860> time<00:00:35.190> step<00:00:35.780> so<00:00:36.780> let's<00:00:36.989> download

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the daily time step so let's download

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.619 
the daily time step so let's download
non<00:00:37.800> java<00:00:38.070> version<00:00:38.280> because<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:39.090> java

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
non java version because the java

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.470 
non java version because the java
version<00:00:39.840> might<00:00:40.200> need<00:00:40.469> some<00:00:41.360> installation<00:00:42.360> of

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
version might need some installation of

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.740 
version might need some installation of
some<00:00:42.840> plugin<00:00:43.230> installation<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:45.000> now<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.480> are

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
some plugin installation so now we are

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.750 
some plugin installation so now we are
here<00:00:46.230> where<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.309> extract

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
here where we going to extract

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.420 
here where we going to extract
information<00:00:47.969> from<00:00:48.300> Geneva<00:00:49.129> it's<00:00:50.129> located<00:00:50.340> on

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
information from Geneva it's located on

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.060 
information from Geneva it's located on
46.1<00:00:51.329> -<00:00:52.190> no<00:00:53.190> Tara<00:00:53.550> -<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.170> use<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> same<00:00:55.680> for

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
46.1 - no Tara - so we use the same for

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.950 
46.1 - no Tara - so we use the same for
this<00:00:56.129> outlet<00:00:56.489> because<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.750> have

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
this outlet because we are going to have

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.400 
this outlet because we are going to have
one<00:00:58.230> point<00:00:59.239> but<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.390> case<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.660> need<00:01:00.809> more<00:01:01.109> point

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
one point but in case we need more point

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.200 
one point but in case we need more point
then<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.160> use<00:01:02.520> more<00:01:03.500> wider<00:01:04.500> area

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
then we have to use more wider area

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.780 
then we have to use more wider area
north<00:01:06.210> south<00:01:06.420> east<00:01:06.720> west<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.880> there<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:10.790> have

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
north south east west and there we have

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.210 
north south east west and there we have
to<00:01:12.110> focus<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> timeline<00:01:13.710> where<00:01:13.950> we<00:01:14.100> are

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
to focus the timeline where we are

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.499 
to focus the timeline where we are
interested<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.299> let's<00:01:15.479> say<00:01:15.720> 2001<00:01:17.509> first

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
interested in so let's say 2001 first

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.570 
interested in so let's say 2001 first
January<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:20.360> we<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.930> end<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.200> with

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
January and we are going to end up with

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.840 
January and we are going to end up with
2010

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.929 

and<00:01:29.240> 30<00:01:30.110> cos<00:01:30.290> December

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.209 

after<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.929> can<00:01:37.079> go<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> scale<00:01:38.009> put<00:01:40.219> it

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
after that we can go for a scale put it

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.840 
after that we can go for a scale put it
actually<00:01:41.670> takes<00:01:41.880> some<00:01:41.939> time<00:01:42.240> based<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
actually takes some time based on the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.510 
actually takes some time based on the
amount<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.000> data<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.689> require<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:47.340> we

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
amount of data that we require that we

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.929 
amount of data that we require that we
asked<00:01:47.819> for<00:01:48.770> if<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:50.009> need<00:01:50.189> multiple<00:01:50.340> points

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
asked for if we need multiple points

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.139 
asked for if we need multiple points
that<00:01:51.209> it<00:01:51.329> takes<00:01:51.630> some<00:01:51.869> some<00:01:52.770> time<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:53.939> it's

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
that it takes some some time but if it's

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.249 
that it takes some some time but if it's
one<00:01:54.479> point<00:01:54.719> it<00:01:55.079> shouldn't<00:01:55.500> take<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.979> long<00:01:57.259> so

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
one point it shouldn't take that long so

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.740 
one point it shouldn't take that long so
five<00:01:58.920> six<00:01:59.189> seconds<00:01:59.640> or<00:01:59.759> maximum<00:02:00.179> ten<00:02:00.359> seconds

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
five six seconds or maximum ten seconds

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.229 
five six seconds or maximum ten seconds
it<00:02:00.810> takes<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:02.149> prepare<00:02:03.979> in<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.039> web<00:02:05.310> browser

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.449 

so<00:02:09.239> there<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:10.400> from<00:02:11.400> there<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:13.459> select

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
so there it is from there we can select

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.289 
so there it is from there we can select
all<00:02:14.610> those<00:02:14.730> data<00:02:14.970> control<00:02:15.299> a<00:02:15.470> control<00:02:16.470> C<00:02:16.680> and

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
all those data control a control C and

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.920 
all those data control a control C and
let's<00:02:18.299> put<00:02:18.599> it<00:02:18.720> somewhere<00:02:18.959> in<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.379> harddrive

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
let's put it somewhere in the harddrive

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.710 
let's put it somewhere in the harddrive
so<00:02:21.930> we<00:02:22.079> made<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> folder<00:02:22.709> TRMM<00:02:23.480> let's<00:02:24.480> make<00:02:24.690> a

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
so we made a folder TRMM let's make a

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:33.500 
so we made a folder TRMM let's make a
new<00:02:25.110> text<00:02:25.769> file<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.160> paste<00:02:26.489> it<00:02:26.670> over<00:02:26.760> there<00:02:32.510> so

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
new text file and paste it over there so

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.190 
new text file and paste it over there so
that's<00:02:33.750> how<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.019> data<00:02:34.470> looks<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:35.959> with<00:02:36.959> some

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
that's how the data looks like with some

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.800 
that's how the data looks like with some
header<00:02:37.879> and<00:02:38.879> the<00:02:39.030> missing<00:02:39.269> value<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.540> minus

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
header and the missing value is minus

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.330 
header and the missing value is minus
nineteen<00:02:41.780> 999.9<00:02:42.780> let's<00:02:43.739> remove<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.160> header

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
nineteen 999.9 let's remove the header

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.050 
nineteen 999.9 let's remove the header
and<00:02:44.810> open<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.959> in<00:02:45.989> Excel<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.889> filter<00:02:47.340> those

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
and open it in Excel to filter those

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:58.229 
and open it in Excel to filter those
gaps

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.929 

so<00:02:58.810> we<00:02:58.989> can<00:02:59.140> use<00:02:59.349> some<00:02:59.379> separator<00:03:02.189> :<00:03:03.189> and<00:03:03.430> some

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:03.939 
so we can use some separator : and some

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:10.589 
so we can use some separator : and some
space

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.140 

it<00:03:11.499> looks<00:03:11.739> like<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.459> so<00:03:12.730> maybe<00:03:12.879> you<00:03:13.030> can

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
it looks like that so maybe you can

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.229 
it looks like that so maybe you can
regenerate<00:03:13.900> another<00:03:14.469> time<00:03:15.400> series<00:03:15.819> to<00:03:16.810> plot

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
regenerate another time series to plot

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:25.099 
regenerate another time series to plot
and<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:20.200> see<00:03:20.409> how<00:03:20.530> does<00:03:20.829> how<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:21.370> looks<00:03:21.670> like

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:33.309 

now<00:03:26.109> we<00:03:26.230> can<00:03:26.409> plot<00:03:26.590> it

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.979 

let's<00:03:33.920> use<00:03:34.099> the<00:03:34.220> sky<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.489> talk<00:03:34.819> for<00:03:35.599> the<00:03:35.780> smooth

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
let's use the sky to talk for the smooth

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.110 
let's use the sky to talk for the smooth
time-series

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
time-series

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.929 
time-series
so<00:03:38.120> that's<00:03:38.329> how<00:03:38.420> it<00:03:38.569> looks<00:03:38.750> like<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:39.939> the

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:40.939 
so that's how it looks like so the

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.960 
so that's how it looks like so the
y-axis<00:03:41.390> is<00:03:41.540> representing<00:03:42.349> the<00:03:42.970> precipitation

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
y-axis is representing the precipitation

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.509 
y-axis is representing the precipitation
in<00:03:44.090> millimeter<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:45.200> x-axis<00:03:45.829> is<00:03:46.220> time

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
in millimeter and the x-axis is time

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.420 
in millimeter and the x-axis is time
line<00:03:47.150> so<00:03:48.049> we<00:03:48.200> extracted<00:03:48.620> ten<00:03:49.040> years<00:03:49.220> data

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
line so we extracted ten years data

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.830 
line so we extracted ten years data
daily<00:03:50.060> time<00:03:50.239> see<00:03:50.769> so<00:03:52.060> when<00:03:53.060> we<00:03:53.180> need<00:03:53.299> more

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
daily time see so when we need more

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.770 
daily time see so when we need more
points<00:03:54.170> more<00:03:54.680> wider<00:03:55.040> area<00:03:55.510> then<00:03:56.510> we<00:03:56.629> can

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
points more wider area then we can

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.349 
points more wider area then we can
enhance<00:03:57.140> it<00:03:57.349> in<00:03:57.680> that<00:03:58.489> case<00:03:58.760> we<00:03:58.940> have<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.180> write

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
enhance it in that case we have to write

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.339 
enhance it in that case we have to write
some<00:03:59.599> script<00:04:00.079> to<00:04:00.230> filter<00:04:00.680> those<00:04:00.890> data<00:04:02.349> so

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
some script to filter those data so

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.069 
some script to filter those data so
that's<00:04:03.590> how<00:04:03.769> we<00:04:03.829> can<00:04:04.129> get<00:04:04.310> data<00:04:04.760> from<00:04:05.060> here<00:04:05.840> mmm

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
that's how we can get data from here mmm

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.589 
that's how we can get data from here mmm
website<00:04:06.500> which<00:04:06.769> is<00:04:06.920> very<00:04:07.129> useful<00:04:07.609> for<00:04:07.640> doing

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599
