00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.570
 me and that went well 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.540
 there is a park for the fast goals of the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.540
 is epic or understood 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 only if others steal the same ideas 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.750
 all ideas claw 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.610
 right, there must always think that is 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:07.760
 your idea and female comcom of 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.760

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:20.960
 no a few now clothe the moths 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.200
 then load it over the way 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.360
 yes this is a self-shooter i have in 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.020
 my near 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.479
 So very close to me is running here 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:46.110
 in the circle what you should because of the city 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:52.619
 not what are not all 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.209
 I'm just wondering about that, too 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.819
 we have now we need now but 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:02:02.890
 change quickly so what we are on 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:05.900
 does not fail 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.710
 in the end is not good I think he 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.710
 now does not come up 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:26.990
 it destroys super 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:29.480
 I'm dead block 2 is a right one 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.780
 bad rhine was shocked 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.780
 blocked 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:44.209
 job blog political makes you so 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.760
 fast but we lose only completely 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.760
 scarce so everything is no problem 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.840
 red kempinger I think so too 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:04.080
 bad now again about the outside 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:04.080
 These glass parts brothers camping there 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:14.120
 Of course, very idea what is that too 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.780
 that israel or the income or 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.780
 flame 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.239
 not with the opponents I expand 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.239
 I do not understand it 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:42.410
 that's where we still want to be 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.340
 that was not good, I thought once 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:50.690
 that our team somehow has that 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:56.080
 Opponent our team is killing me husband 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.080
 he is habibi bible 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.360
 No 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.670
 there is shit in there 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.720
 on 1 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.720
 there is more, I know that 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:30.300
 no it was so obvious this one 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.420
 such people run my shake 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.420
 Skate with his head 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.690
 Maybe this and order is fooling 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.070
 is impossible 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.580
 that makes something strange in the kills 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.490
 Naviki the same and I do not do 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.550
 kills and surfaces almost not at all 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.140
 but only almost 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.070
 did not slow you down at all 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.950
 that's different 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.940
 oh yes and people you do not have me 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.160
 seen correctly 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:23.630
 I do not think so either 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:24.620
 right but what I right from us 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.220
 lose right after you have 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.220
 right 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:45.550
 that's okay i'll do any of that 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:51.220
 We want to do that to our team now 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:54.970
 yes here in a face very good very good 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.970
 about hacker of course 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:08.599
 not that I am new and get up again 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:12.629
 laughed my 16 interest rate 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:14.849
 but what should saviors be called none 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:16.289
 So we should go to the corner 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.979
 although I'm quite right there 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:23.909
 we posted microwaves 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:25.199
 bowl the damaging overlook there 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:27.560
 should be staff by the time of 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.560
 next time
