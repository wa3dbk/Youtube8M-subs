00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hey, people, how are you? I'm Luiz. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.250
 firefighter and today I do a boxing and what 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.360
 is it the harry potter video of the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.389
 book collection 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.250
 the backpackers guide of galaxies is has 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.619
 a lot of people I can not in this kind of 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.090
 video I've seen until we were one that is 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.970
 to make you jealous 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.519
 but there are many people who 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.710
 sometimes want to buy something and if a 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.210
 box and is not really knowing how that is the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.340
 boston and the collection 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.439
 efd in doubt so I decided to do 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.350
 start making these videos for less 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.260
 with the collections that buy what comes to 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.500
 be more than three books or the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.530
 borges for you to see how common it is 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.559
 are the books how is the collection and there 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.300
 can make their own decision 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.070
 example buy us a collection of harry 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.020
 white-coat potter 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.039
 I did not know how she was with him. 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.640
 foot behind 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.160
 until I saw a video of the girl and you 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.949
 panda girl people is showing the collection 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.260
 and then yes, I'm sure I wanted 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.720
 really buy that collection 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.540
 so I hope you like these videos 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.689
 and it's not going to be all the books that 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.990
 I will do that to a box and even 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.740
 because it would not make sense but 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.680
 least those who have more books are 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.290
 I think it's cool if you like a decision. 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.280
 My vision boats do not like to put 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.409
 in the comments 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.729
 this pressure that I bought from the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.450
 backpacker of galaxies 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.229
 I bought in the submarine that I paid 29 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.770
 real 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.079
 is the selection from 1990 to 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.119
 39 90 so I guess you can not go so far 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.170
 expensive even though books are books 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.509
 very small 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.220
 You can see that soon you took a 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.299
 very small package is a very 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.950
 great 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.360
 and I think it was well worth it and 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.850
 although it is an economic model think 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.009
 It was worth it even because I did not 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.200
 I'm not any series I just bought. 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.340
 to make myself know even if you 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:10.110
 to be interested in this collection 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.950
 link for the purchase of the books is there 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:18.810
 description 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:27.150
 the good environment is not the invoice already 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:29.700
 which is the first one is the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.310
 five books from the day's collection 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.069
 backpacker of galaxies 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.299
 you are I will be honest I think 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:45.239
 they are books - with the face much 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:47.880
 but had lots of people asking for 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.370
 So I draw the books so I 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.200
 I got curious 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.060
 well this here I do not know which is the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.000
 first I think it should be from here 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:03.720
 some years the smell of the same galaxies 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:06.480
 this is the cover is bright is it 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.799
 basically an economic model is like the 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.519
 most others 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:15.150
 only here the pages are not white 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.040
 are yellow pages that do not 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.450
 pages per month are yellow pages. 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.450
 those who are the most delicious to read 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.639
 Finally the first book he has 1 156 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.180
 pages 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:41.540
 I do not know if it will be the same amount 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.540
 of other books is normal as soon as 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.410
 finally it seems that the more resistant 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:56.250
 for who was curious convent 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:04:00.090
 conversations and the series, perhaps, I do not 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.480
 I know why you look at the books, the people are 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:07.200
 practically harmless this book here 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.230
 It's the same thing basically has 191 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.810
 pages 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.349
 the next book is even more thank you 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.349
 by the fish 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:24.460
 the attack is done with a ticket of simon 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.000
 fourth goal is 4 of the series continues 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.000
 galaxies 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:37.240
 so it's the same thing 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:47.290
 the fourth volume is 142 the issue of 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:05:01.390
 invoice archers that I say that I think 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:05:10.330
 that I see here a volume 3 of the series a 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:13.660
 life the universe and everything over 160 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.280
 pages and a volume 2 in the 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:24.570
 Teacher is the restaurant at the end of the day. 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:27.550
 very small book of the universe as 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:35.650
 already imagined that they were 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:38.370
 same goes there not so small so the 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:44.680
 end of the restaurant at the end of the universe 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:48.070
 here's another side you can see if you're 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.440
 a little kneaded here moment in the video 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:54.400
 harry potter that I had never used 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:59.200
 that's the same but I do not care about these 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:07.080
 things did not go to me, it's normal to fall into 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:12.190
 tissue paper or another paper book 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.870
 will not change the contents of the book anyway 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.960
 to read that was the money collection 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:20.610
 arrives to be sold in the details 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.960
 even was the same size 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.270
 I do not know if you can see if a mother is 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.480
 here underneath the retina on top is 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:32.080
 Anyway, he's smart, tired of the video. 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.450
 - It is and I intend to read the first volume 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.330
 in February after you finish reading 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.610
 the name of the wind or some other book that 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.200
 occurs at the front and if you want 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.550
 buy this connection 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.350
 she was watching a submarine to 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.610
 effect the event at least 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.040
 while they are varying greatly 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.500
 stuck but I do not think it will increase 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.670
 much more that aims to rescue talking 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.670
 here is more
