garden also one of the reasons we're
doing<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.009> on<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.250> video<00:02:11.489> is

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
doing this on the video is

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.580 
doing this on the video is
to<00:02:13.069> try<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.400> help<00:02:13.730> people<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.629> understand<00:02:15.470> that

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
what we're doing is it's not that

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.300 
what we're doing is it's not that
difficult<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:18.200> mean<00:02:18.319> it's<00:02:18.470> hard<00:02:18.680> work<00:02:18.920> in<00:02:19.190> the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
difficult I mean it's hard work in the

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.430 
difficult I mean it's hard work in the
beginning<00:02:19.700> but<00:02:20.360> it's<00:02:20.540> not<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.930> hard<00:02:21.200> to

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
beginning but it's not that hard to

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.550 
beginning but it's not that hard to
understand<00:02:22.239> it's<00:02:23.239> not<00:02:23.330> that<00:02:23.659> hard<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.989> do<00:02:24.260> and

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
understand it's not that hard to do and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.759 
understand it's not that hard to do and
the<00:02:25.340> other<00:02:25.459> thing<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:26.030> I'm<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:27.110> think<00:02:27.200> now

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
the other thing is I'm I think now

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.070 
the other thing is I'm I think now
though<00:02:28.280> I'm<00:02:28.459> 63<00:02:28.970> I<00:02:29.239> think<00:02:29.569> what<00:02:29.750> it'll<00:02:29.900> be<00:02:29.989> like

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
though I'm 63 I think what it'll be like

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.059 
though I'm 63 I think what it'll be like
when<00:02:30.319> I'm<00:02:30.680> of<00:02:31.160> 73<00:02:31.879> or<00:02:32.120> 83<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:33.530> when<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.709> watched

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
when I'm of 73 or 83 and when I watched

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.880 
when I'm of 73 or 83 and when I watched
the<00:02:34.459> Paul<00:02:34.730> with<00:02:35.720> his<00:02:35.900> videos<00:02:36.349> and<00:02:36.379> how<00:02:36.830> the

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
the Paul with his videos and how the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.100 
the Paul with his videos and how the
Lord<00:02:37.190> helped<00:02:37.489> him<00:02:37.610> in<00:02:37.760> Washington<00:02:38.360> I<00:02:38.450> realized

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
Lord helped him in Washington I realized

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.039 
Lord helped him in Washington I realized
that<00:02:39.950> here<00:02:40.400> here's<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.849> man<00:02:41.150> who's<00:02:41.360> so<00:02:41.540> crippled

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
he's still able to maintain a huge

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.390 
he's still able to maintain a huge
operation<00:02:52.579> with<00:02:52.609> only<00:02:53.180> Zuri<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:54.530> I'm

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
operation with only Zuri and I I'm

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400 
operation with only Zuri and I I'm
thinking<00:02:55.459> about<00:02:56.120> things<00:02:56.450> I'm<00:02:56.780> in<00:02:56.989> much<00:02:57.170> better

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
thinking about things I'm in much better

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.890 
thinking about things I'm in much better
health<00:02:57.799> at<00:02:58.250> least<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.700> am<00:02:58.849> for<00:02:59.090> now<00:02:59.209> but<00:02:59.480> I'm<00:02:59.599> I'm

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
health at least I am for now but I'm I'm

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.900 
health at least I am for now but I'm I'm
thinking<00:02:59.959> of<00:03:00.470> those<00:03:00.620> things<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.250> there<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:01.879> a

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
thinking of those things and there is a

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.020 
thinking of those things and there is a
lot<00:03:02.209> of<00:03:02.329> people<00:03:02.690> that<00:03:03.230> are<00:03:03.379> my<00:03:04.010> generation<00:03:04.760> and

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
lot of people that are my generation and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.210

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
so we'd like to start something in our

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.640 
so we'd like to start something in our
generation<00:03:07.730> that<00:03:08.540> it'll<00:03:08.870> pass<00:03:09.049> on<00:03:09.319> to<00:03:09.530> the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
generation that it'll pass on to the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.890 
generation that it'll pass on to the
next<00:03:09.890> generation<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:11.030> next<00:03:11.060> generation

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
pesticides herbicides the thing I like

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.610 
pesticides herbicides the thing I like
about<00:03:37.099> this<00:03:37.579> is<00:03:37.819> that<00:03:37.849> it's<00:03:38.209> self-sustaining

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
about this is that it's self-sustaining

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.339 
about this is that it's self-sustaining
so<00:03:40.400> if<00:03:40.639> our<00:03:40.790> power<00:03:41.030> grid<00:03:41.299> goes<00:03:41.480> down<00:03:41.510> you're

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
so if our power grid goes down you're

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.890 
so if our power grid goes down you're
still<00:03:42.739> doing<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.160> same<00:03:43.190> thing<00:03:43.430> yep<00:03:44.359> all<00:03:44.599> says

faster<00:04:37.069> than<00:04:37.490> porn<00:04:37.789> well<00:04:38.509> guess<00:04:38.689> what<00:04:38.990> that

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
faster than porn well guess what that

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.610 
faster than porn well guess what that
that<00:04:40.250> stuff<00:04:40.639> is<00:04:40.849> so<00:04:41.000> easy<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.599> grow<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:42.169> tilapia

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
that stuff is so easy to grow a tilapia

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.070 
that stuff is so easy to grow a tilapia
can<00:04:43.610> live<00:04:43.789> their<00:04:43.969> whole<00:04:44.000> life<00:04:44.330> it's<00:04:44.719> 40%

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
can live their whole life it's 40%

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.890 
can live their whole life it's 40%
