haven't<00:03:07.959> been<00:03:07.989> implemented<00:03:08.620> properly<00:03:08.770> armor

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
haven't been implemented properly armor

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.430 
haven't been implemented properly armor
abilities<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.450> fly<00:03:10.690> sound<00:03:11.020> like<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.140> great

abilities on the fly sound like a great

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.710 
abilities on the fly sound like a great
idea<00:03:11.470> some<00:03:12.010> thought<00:03:12.040> they<00:03:12.280> could<00:03:12.720> really

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
idea some thought they could really

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.150 
idea some thought they could really
improve<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.350> gameplay<00:03:14.709> but<00:03:14.770> haven't<00:03:15.130> been

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
improve the gameplay but haven't been

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.220

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
did annoy me was one of the main reasons

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.729 
did annoy me was one of the main reasons
for<00:03:21.040> stayed<00:03:21.340> away<00:03:21.520> from<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.850> game<00:03:22.260> but<00:03:23.260> hasn't

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
for stayed away from the game but hasn't

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:24.990 
for stayed away from the game but hasn't
been<00:03:23.800> implemented<00:03:24.130> properly<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.760> doesn't

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
been implemented properly it doesn't

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.430 
been implemented properly it doesn't
really<00:03:25.090> bother<00:03:25.180> me<00:03:25.450> now<00:03:25.630> just<00:03:26.170> hasn't<00:03:26.320> been

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
really bother me now just hasn't been

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.479 
really bother me now just hasn't been
implemented<00:03:26.860> one<00:03:27.220> properly<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:29.220> what<00:03:30.220> really

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
implemented one properly so what really

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:31.590 
implemented one properly so what really
does<00:03:30.640> need<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.820> be<00:03:30.910> done<00:03:31.090> in<00:03:31.209> this<00:03:31.299> platter

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
does need to be done in this platter

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.229 
does need to be done in this platter
this<00:03:32.049> update<00:03:32.310> now<00:03:33.310> first<00:03:33.580> thing<00:03:33.850> is<00:03:34.209> first

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
thing they need to get done because I

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.710 
thing they need to get done because I
feel<00:03:59.620> if<00:03:59.799> they<00:04:00.310> do<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.790> they<00:04:01.299> will<00:04:01.450> bring<00:04:01.600> a

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
feel if they do that they will bring a

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.920 
feel if they do that they will bring a
lot<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:01.900> players<00:04:02.170> back<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:03.660> though<00:04:04.660> there's

lot of players back and though there's

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.259 
lot of players back and though there's
still<00:04:05.080> probably<00:04:05.260> about<00:04:05.549> 150,000<00:04:06.549> to<00:04:06.610> 200,000

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269

there<00:05:32.199> so<00:05:33.199> what<00:05:33.379> do<00:05:33.500> what<00:05:33.800> should<00:05:33.949> they<00:05:34.039> do

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
there so what do what should they do

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.589 
there so what do what should they do
really<00:05:34.430> why<00:05:34.849> I<00:05:34.879> feel<00:05:35.060> they<00:05:35.150> should<00:05:35.180> do<00:05:35.449> is

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
really why I feel they should do is

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.629 
really why I feel they should do is
should<00:05:35.930> cut<00:05:36.229> down<00:05:36.440> the<00:05:36.710> time<00:05:36.919> limit<00:05:37.250> it<00:05:37.370> takes

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
should cut down the time limit it takes

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.700 
should cut down the time limit it takes
for<00:05:37.849> armor<00:05:38.090> lock<00:05:38.210> to<00:05:38.449> come<00:05:39.020> out<00:05:39.139> of<00:05:39.289> what<00:05:39.680> i

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
for armor lock to come out of what i

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.890 
for armor lock to come out of what i
mean<00:05:39.860> by<00:05:39.979> that<00:05:40.009> is<00:05:40.279> so<00:05:40.699> they<00:05:40.789> have<00:05:40.969> no<00:05:41.000> possible

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
mean by that is so they have no possible

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.930 
mean by that is so they have no possible
chance<00:05:42.169> of<00:05:42.680> actually<00:05:43.219> recovering<00:05:43.759> their

chance of actually recovering their
shields<00:05:44.240> water<00:05:44.389> in<00:05:44.509> it<00:05:44.630> i<00:05:44.779> think<00:05:45.139> that's<00:05:45.349> a

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
shields water in it i think that's a

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.529 
shields water in it i think that's a
pathetic<00:05:45.889> really<00:05:46.550> annoying<00:05:46.819> idea<00:05:47.210> the<00:05:47.360> fact

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
pathetic really annoying idea the fact

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.089 
pathetic really annoying idea the fact
that<00:05:47.599> they<00:05:48.139> can<00:05:48.319> go<00:05:48.440> into<00:05:48.680> some<00:05:48.860> again

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
that they can go into some again

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.890 
that they can go into some again

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
basically get a complete second chance

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.439 
basically get a complete second chance
in<00:05:51.740> a<00:05:51.830> way<00:05:51.979> it's<00:05:52.130> comparable<00:05:52.610> to<00:05:52.880> as<00:05:53.090> i<00:05:53.240> said
