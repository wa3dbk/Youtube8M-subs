impeded<00:00:57.020> his<00:00:57.050> path<00:00:57.740> to<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:58.010> back

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.920 

the<00:01:01.649> only<00:01:01.800> thing<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.070> can<00:01:02.309> say<00:01:02.579> well<00:01:03.000> that's

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the only thing you can say well that's

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.170 
the only thing you can say well that's
only<00:01:04.199> possible<00:01:04.890> option<00:01:05.550> but<00:01:05.729> let's<00:01:05.940> get

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
only possible option but let's get

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.969 
only possible option but let's get
another<00:01:06.390> look<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.930> can<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.350> we're<00:01:07.530> done<00:01:07.770> is

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
another look if we can see we're done is

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.950 
another look if we can see we're done is
in<00:01:08.159> relationship<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.000> line<00:01:14.510> there's<00:01:15.510> Adam

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
in relationship to the line there's Adam

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.410 
in relationship to the line there's Adam
I<00:01:16.250> think<00:01:17.250> because<00:01:17.640> they<00:01:17.759> had<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.940> move<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.150> his

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
I think because they had to move to his

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.180 
I think because they had to move to his
right<00:01:18.479> when<00:01:19.050> Tori<00:01:19.380> was<00:01:19.590> moving<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.040> his<00:01:20.130> right

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
right when Tori was moving to his right

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.999 
right when Tori was moving to his right
that's<00:01:20.670> why<00:01:21.020> darling<00:01:22.020> called<00:01:22.440> it<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.860> think

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
that's why darling called it but I think

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.760 
that's why darling called it but I think
Torii<00:01:23.970> Hunter<00:01:24.360> by<00:01:24.720> his<00:01:24.930> expression<00:01:25.500> will<00:01:25.590> tell

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
Torii Hunter by his expression will tell

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.850 
Torii Hunter by his expression will tell
you<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.979> he<00:01:26.070> got<00:01:26.220> away<00:01:26.460> with<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:26.850> there<00:01:27.860> sure

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
you that he got away with one there sure

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.670 
you that he got away with one there sure
he<00:01:28.950> did

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
he did

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.850 
he did
Charita<00:01:33.229> SPS

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:59.560 

SPS<00:01:37.730> it<00:01:38.000> is

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.020 

these<00:02:00.200> are<00:02:00.409> times<00:02:00.680> I<00:02:00.920> wish<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.250> could<00:02:01.430> cuss<00:02:04.030> well

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
these are times I wish I could cuss well

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.650 
these are times I wish I could cuss well
we'll<00:02:05.270> see<00:02:05.479> if<00:02:06.040> Hector<00:02:07.040> can<00:02:07.400> get<00:02:07.610> by<00:02:07.880> fielder

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
we'll see if Hector can get by fielder

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.660 
we'll see if Hector can get by fielder
and<00:02:08.959> that's<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.740> pretty<00:02:09.950> good<00:02:10.100> angle

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
and that's a pretty good angle

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.930 
and that's a pretty good angle
maybe<00:02:11.450> if<00:02:11.600> Adam<00:02:11.870> Dunn<00:02:12.050> goes<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.470> his<00:02:12.590> left

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
maybe if Adam Dunn goes to his left

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.760 
maybe if Adam Dunn goes to his left
instead<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:13.970> his<00:02:14.209> right<00:02:14.480> they<00:02:15.320> don't<00:02:15.440> get<00:02:15.650> the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
instead of his right they don't get the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.100 
instead of his right they don't get the
call<00:02:16.090> but<00:02:17.090> normally<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.540> don't<00:02:17.780> see<00:02:17.959> that

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
call but normally you don't see that

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.400 
call but normally you don't see that
call<00:02:18.440> with<00:02:18.709> no<00:02:18.860> contact
