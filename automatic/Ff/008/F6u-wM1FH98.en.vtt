are<00:02:21.120> we<00:02:21.240> tap<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.020> click<00:02:22.170> he's<00:02:22.290> now<00:02:22.440> off<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:23.700> if<00:02:24.270> I

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
are we tap to click he's now off so if I

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.390 
are we tap to click he's now off so if I
go<00:02:24.870> back<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.410> folders<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:25.980> example

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
go back to that folders in example

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.790 
go back to that folders in example
double<00:02:27.210> click<00:02:27.390> nothing's<00:02:27.810> happening<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.410> it's

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
double click nothing's happening so it's

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.030 
double click nothing's happening so it's
perfect<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:29.550> for<00:02:30.150> me<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.960> actually<00:02:31.080> turned<00:02:31.800> out

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
perfect so for me it actually turned out

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.100 
perfect so for me it actually turned out
that<00:02:32.280> uninstalled<00:02:33.090> in<00:02:33.240> all<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.540> updates<00:02:33.930> and

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
that uninstalled in all the updates and

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.300 
that uninstalled in all the updates and
everything<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.740> going<00:02:34.950> back<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.130> the

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
everything and going back to the

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.000 
everything and going back to the
original<00:02:35.700> driver<00:02:35.970> has<00:02:36.600> made<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:36.960> work<00:02:37.140> if<00:02:37.740> that

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
original driver has made it work if that

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.740 
original driver has made it work if that
hasn't<00:02:38.250> worked<00:02:38.490> for<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:38.880> then<00:02:39.390> I've<00:02:39.570> got<00:02:39.720> one

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
hasn't worked for you then I've got one

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.630 
hasn't worked for you then I've got one
last<00:02:40.050> tip<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.650> I'm<00:02:40.890> just<00:02:41.130> going<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.370> show<00:02:41.610> that

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
last tip and I'm just going to show that

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.480 
last tip and I'm just going to show that
to<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:42.000> now<00:02:42.590> ok<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:43.650> if<00:02:43.920> none<00:02:44.100> of<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.310> software

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
to you now ok so if none of the software

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.820 
to you now ok so if none of the software
methods<00:02:45.090> are<00:02:45.209> working<00:02:45.360> for<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.170> there's

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
methods are working for you and there's

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.050 
methods are working for you and there's
a<00:02:46.890> hardware<00:02:47.190> method<00:02:47.640> built<00:02:47.820> into<00:02:47.970> the

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
a hardware method built into the

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.910 
a hardware method built into the
keyboard<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.260> work<00:02:49.410> for<00:02:49.620> me<00:02:49.709> every

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
keyboard and this is work for me every

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.860 
keyboard and this is work for me every
time<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.550> hopefully<00:02:51.060> it'll<00:02:51.150> work<00:02:51.390> for<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.750> as

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
time so hopefully it'll work for you as

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.770 
time so hopefully it'll work for you as
well<00:02:52.130> at<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.250> minute<00:02:53.400> as<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.640> can<00:02:53.880> see<00:02:54.060> double

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
well at the minute as you can see double

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.780 
well at the minute as you can see double
tapping<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:55.230> opening<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.709> opening<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.430> folder

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
tapping is opening and opening a folder

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.580 
tapping is opening and opening a folder
and<00:02:56.910> that's<00:02:57.060> really<00:02:57.270> annoying<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:58.200> if<00:02:58.470> you

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
and that's really annoying but if you

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.229 
and that's really annoying but if you
hold<00:02:58.830> down<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.190> function<00:02:59.400> key<00:02:59.880> on<00:03:00.150> the

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
hold down the function key on the

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.560 
hold down the function key on the
keyboard<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:01.530> push<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.920> left<00:03:02.160> mouse<00:03:02.340> button

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
keyboard and push the left mouse button

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.220 
keyboard and push the left mouse button
now<00:03:03.570> when<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.350> double<00:03:05.160> tap<00:03:05.660> nothing<00:03:06.660> happens<00:03:07.140> so

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
now when I double tap nothing happens so

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.800 
now when I double tap nothing happens so
excellent<00:03:08.070> it's<00:03:08.280> disabled<00:03:08.850> it<00:03:08.940> basically<00:03:09.390> but

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
excellent it's disabled it basically but

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.330 
excellent it's disabled it basically but
the<00:03:09.870> drawback<00:03:10.140> with<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.739> if<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:11.010> turn<00:03:11.220> it

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
the drawback with that is if I turn it

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.130 
the drawback with that is if I turn it
off<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:12.239> now<00:03:12.360> I'll<00:03:12.480> turn<00:03:12.600> it<00:03:12.660> back<00:03:12.780> on<00:03:12.989> again

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
off and now I'll turn it back on again

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.180 
off and now I'll turn it back on again
and<00:03:13.530> then<00:03:14.520> I<00:03:14.610> double<00:03:14.970> tap<00:03:15.000> whoops<00:03:15.920> that's<00:03:16.920> it

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
and then I double tap whoops that's it

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.520 
and then I double tap whoops that's it
double<00:03:17.940> tap<00:03:18.120> then<00:03:18.330> it's<00:03:18.450> come<00:03:18.630> back<00:03:18.660> again<00:03:19.080> so

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
double tap then it's come back again so

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.280 
double tap then it's come back again so
same<00:03:20.010> deal<00:03:20.040> again<00:03:20.519> if<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.390> hold<00:03:21.570> then<00:03:21.750> function

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
same deal again if I hold then function

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.350 
same deal again if I hold then function
left<00:03:22.950> Mouse<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:24.680> try<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.830> again<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.360> it's

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
left Mouse and try that again and it's

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.660 
left Mouse and try that again and it's
gone<00:03:27.540> so<00:03:28.170> that's<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.830> method<00:03:29.190> works<00:03:29.340> for<00:03:29.519> me

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
gone so that's that method works for me

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.630 
gone so that's that method works for me
every<00:03:29.940> time<00:03:30.380> otherwise<00:03:31.380> turn<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.280> software

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
every time otherwise turn the software

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.130 
every time otherwise turn the software
methods<00:03:32.940> which<00:03:33.120> should<00:03:33.780> be<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.930> bit<00:03:34.110> more

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
methods which should be a bit more

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.800
