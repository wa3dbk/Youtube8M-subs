00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
that use four decks this is really the

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.620 
that use four decks this is really the
key<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.340> eyes<00:01:22.610> off<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.000> laptop<00:01:23.150> approach

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
key to the eyes off the laptop approach

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.900 
key to the eyes off the laptop approach
I<00:01:23.810> was<00:01:23.930> talking<00:01:24.260> about<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:25.640> vector

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
I was talking about and the vector

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.790 
I was talking about and the vector
waveform<00:01:26.330> is<00:01:26.510> very<00:01:26.840> detailed<00:01:27.260> so<00:01:27.440> I<00:01:27.470> can<00:01:27.680> get

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
waveform is very detailed so I can get

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.430 
waveform is very detailed so I can get
really<00:01:28.220> close<00:01:28.550> into<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:28.970> track<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.320> do<00:01:30.320> this

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
really close into the track and do this

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.650 
really close into the track and do this
right<00:01:30.620> from<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.860> controller<00:01:31.300> on<00:01:32.300> the<00:01:32.510> other

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
right from the controller on the other

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.020 
right from the controller on the other
side<00:01:32.840> I<00:01:33.020> can<00:01:33.050> change<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:34.130> BPM<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.730> the<00:01:34.820> track

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
side I can change the BPM of the track

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.360 
side I can change the BPM of the track
by<00:01:35.210> full<00:01:35.600> bpm<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.230> even<00:01:36.500> hundredths<00:01:36.830> of<00:01:36.920> a<00:01:37.010> BPM

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
by full bpm and even hundredths of a BPM

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.100 
by full bpm and even hundredths of a BPM
increments<00:01:37.760> so<00:01:37.940> manually<00:01:38.300> beat<00:01:38.600> matching<00:01:38.780> is

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
increments so manually beat matching is

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.050 
increments so manually beat matching is
still<00:01:39.410> a<00:01:39.440> possibility<00:01:39.650> and<00:01:40.340> one<00:01:40.940> of<00:01:41.000> my

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
still a possibility and one of my

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.970 
still a possibility and one of my
favorite<00:01:41.420> features<00:01:41.720> is<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.560> fact<00:01:42.800> that<00:01:42.860> you

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
favorite features is the fact that you

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.370 
favorite features is the fact that you
can<00:01:43.160> see<00:01:43.580> exactly<00:01:43.970> what<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.390> key<00:01:44.570> is<00:01:44.810> when<00:01:45.200> you

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
can see exactly what the key is when you

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.830 
can see exactly what the key is when you
activate<00:01:45.890> key<00:01:46.070> lock<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:46.940> I<00:01:46.970> can<00:01:47.330> have<00:01:47.600> two

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
activate key lock so I can have two

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.380 
activate key lock so I can have two
songs<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:48.530> key<00:01:49.040> match<00:01:49.220> very<00:01:49.580> easily<00:01:49.850> right<00:01:50.270> on

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
songs and key match very easily right on

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.580 
songs and key match very easily right on
the<00:01:50.480> SA<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:50.810> you<00:01:50.990> don't<00:01:51.140> have<00:01:51.260> to<00:01:51.320> get<00:01:51.470> that

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
the SA so you don't have to get that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.070 
the SA so you don't have to get that
other<00:01:51.740> program<00:01:52.220> exactly<00:01:53.180> it<00:01:53.450> sits<00:01:53.810> right

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
other program exactly it sits right

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.490 
other program exactly it sits right
there

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
there

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.190 
there
okay<00:01:54.860> on<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.490> screen<00:01:55.790> clearly<00:01:56.630> labeled<00:01:57.020> and

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
okay on the screen clearly labeled and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.680 
okay on the screen clearly labeled and
I'm<00:01:57.650> sure<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:58.190> this<00:01:58.280> is<00:01:58.460> gonna<00:01:58.640> give<00:01:59.360> DJ's

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
I'm sure that this is gonna give DJ's

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.960 
I'm sure that this is gonna give DJ's
more<00:02:00.140> possibilities<00:02:00.860> for<00:02:00.890> matching<00:02:01.520> keys<00:02:01.700> all

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
more possibilities for matching keys all

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.250 
more possibilities for matching keys all
right<00:02:02.120> I<00:02:02.240> also<00:02:02.390> noticed<00:02:02.840> that<00:02:02.900> when<00:02:03.140> you

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
right I also noticed that when you

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.410 
right I also noticed that when you
touched<00:02:03.560> on<00:02:03.890> some<00:02:04.430> of<00:02:04.520> these<00:02:04.580> knobs<00:02:04.850> something

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
touched on some of these knobs something

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.450 
touched on some of these knobs something
happened<00:02:05.870> yeah<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:06.500> we<00:02:06.590> couldn't<00:02:06.770> cram<00:02:07.040> all<00:02:07.280> of

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
happened yeah so we couldn't cram all of

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.369 
happened yeah so we couldn't cram all of
the<00:02:07.580> information<00:02:07.820> that<00:02:08.239> you<00:02:08.360> needed<00:02:08.599> on<00:02:08.869> this

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
the information that you needed on this

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.470 
the information that you needed on this
displays<00:02:09.800> themself<00:02:10.310> so<00:02:10.399> we<00:02:10.819> added<00:02:11.000> 30

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
displays themself so we added 30

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.599 
displays themself so we added 30
capacitive<00:02:12.200> knobs<00:02:12.409> /<00:02:12.799> faders<00:02:13.189> in<00:02:13.219> order<00:02:13.519> to

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:15.859 
compensate for example if I touch this

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.319 
compensate for example if I touch this
knob<00:02:16.040> right<00:02:16.069> here<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.730> can<00:02:16.879> see<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.239> the

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
knob right here you can see that the

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:17.840 
knob right here you can see that the

ducking so now if you see somebody doing
this<00:02:30.540> they're<00:02:30.810> not<00:02:30.840> always<00:02:31.110> faking<00:02:31.710> they're

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
this they're not always faking they're

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.490 
this they're not always faking they're
not<00:02:32.130> exactly<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.330> can<00:02:33.450> actually<00:02:33.600> tell<00:02:34.110> if

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
not exactly you can actually tell if

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.750 
not exactly you can actually tell if
they're<00:02:34.740> faking<00:02:35.040> or<00:02:35.160> not<00:02:35.280> because<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.640> can

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
they're faking or not because you can

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.370 
they're faking or not because you can
look<00:02:35.880> at<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.030> screens<00:02:36.360> if<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.960> have<00:02:37.140> that

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
look at the screens if you have that

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.560 
look at the screens if you have that
great<00:02:37.980> view<00:02:38.250> should<00:02:38.580> put<00:02:38.730> alright<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.360> then

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
great view should put alright and then

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.320 
great view should put alright and then

our equal amount of B jump sizes freeze
mode<00:03:03.660> is<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.900> performance<00:03:04.530> tool<00:03:04.740> that<00:03:04.890> we<00:03:04.980> took

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
mode is a performance tool that we took

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.060 
mode is a performance tool that we took
directly<00:03:05.580> from<00:03:05.700> Traktor<00:03:06.120> DJ<00:03:06.170> which<00:03:07.170> chops<00:03:07.800> up

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
directly from Traktor DJ which chops up

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.040 
directly from Traktor DJ which chops up
a<00:03:08.340> segment<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.030> track<00:03:09.270> and<00:03:09.510> eight<00:03:09.690> slices

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
a segment of the track and eight slices

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.470 
a segment of the track and eight slices
and<00:03:10.590> then<00:03:10.680> when<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:10.860> hit<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.130> pad<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:12.150> playhead

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
and then when I hit a pad the playhead

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.270 
and then when I hit a pad the playhead
will<00:03:12.630> immediately<00:03:12.900> move<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:14.010> number

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
will immediately move to the number

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.280 
will immediately move to the number
associated<00:03:14.640> with<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.120> slice<00:03:15.390> ok<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:15.960> then<00:03:16.200> you

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
associated with the slice ok so then you

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.960 
associated with the slice ok so then you
can<00:03:16.440> basically<00:03:16.800> play<00:03:17.280> your<00:03:17.430> own<00:03:17.520> beats<00:03:17.790> you

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
can basically play your own beats you

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.190 
can basically play your own beats you
can<00:03:18.090> have<00:03:18.300> kick<00:03:19.050> drum<00:03:19.320> here<00:03:19.680> snare<00:03:20.190> hi-hat

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
can have kick drum here snare hi-hat

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.050 
can have kick drum here snare hi-hat
whatever<00:03:22.200> some<00:03:22.530> vocals<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.160> then<00:03:23.580> just<00:03:23.820> chop

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
whatever some vocals and then just chop

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.610 
whatever some vocals and then just chop

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
with these knobs up here I can flip

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.950 
with these knobs up here I can flip
between<00:04:04.250> effects<00:04:05.250> ends<00:04:05.640> pitch<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.330> filter

between effects ends pitch and filter
control<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.740> then<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.400> don't<00:04:08.550> have<00:04:08.670> a

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
control and then you don't have a

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.520 
control and then you don't have a
platter<00:04:09.030> but<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:09.570> do<00:04:09.690> have<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.990> touch<00:04:10.140> strips

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530
