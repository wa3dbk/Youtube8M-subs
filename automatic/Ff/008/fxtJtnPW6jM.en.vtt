they're reviewing any ancient documents
about<00:00:17.410> the<00:00:17.470> darkness<00:00:17.859> so<00:00:18.369> they<00:00:18.490> can<00:00:18.670> study

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
about the darkness so they can study

as you are all aware the darkness is
spreading<00:00:33.410> quite<00:00:33.980> rapidly<00:00:34.460> and<00:00:34.850> so<00:00:35.600> we're<00:00:35.960> in

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
spreading quite rapidly and so we're in

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.400 
spreading quite rapidly and so we're in
a<00:00:36.200> most<00:00:36.410> difficult<00:00:36.739> position<00:00:37.989> but<00:00:38.989> we<00:00:39.140> can't

new books and research the sealed
grounds<00:01:10.360> we<00:01:11.360> must<00:01:11.720> understand<00:01:12.380> exactly<00:01:12.530> what

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
grounds we must understand exactly what

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.609 
grounds we must understand exactly what
this<00:01:13.429> darkness<00:01:13.789> is<00:01:14.210> all<00:01:14.750> we<00:01:14.990> know<00:01:15.200> is<00:01:15.440> that

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
this darkness is all we know is that

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.680 
this darkness is all we know is that
this<00:01:15.710> unknown<00:01:16.130> substance<00:01:16.759> engulfs<00:01:17.270> whatever

this unknown substance engulfs whatever
it<00:01:17.869> touches<00:01:18.289> but<00:01:18.800> all<00:01:19.009> our<00:01:19.039> research<00:01:19.670> will

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
it touches but all our research will

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.230 
it touches but all our research will
mean<00:01:20.090> nothing<00:01:20.360> without<00:01:20.720> action<00:01:22.240> general

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
mean nothing without action general

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.400 
mean nothing without action general
Logie<00:01:24.550> well<00:01:25.550> it's<00:01:25.880> just<00:01:26.000> how<00:01:26.479> can<00:01:26.539> we<00:01:26.899> study<00:01:27.200> it

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
Logie well it's just how can we study it

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.639 
Logie well it's just how can we study it
we<00:01:28.160> uh<00:01:28.190> we<00:01:29.149> can't<00:01:29.479> actually<00:01:29.720> get<00:01:30.140> close<00:01:30.350> enough

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
we uh we can't actually get close enough

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.320 
we uh we can't actually get close enough
to<00:01:30.770> get<00:01:30.860> a<00:01:30.920> sample<00:01:31.399> of<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.640> all<00:01:31.759> will<00:01:31.909> be<00:01:31.940> pulled

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
to get a sample of it all will be pulled

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.559 
to get a sample of it all will be pulled
inside<00:01:32.539> ourselves<00:01:32.929> sir<00:01:33.789> so<00:01:34.789> we<00:01:35.000> can<00:01:35.149> speculate

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
inside ourselves sir so we can speculate

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:37.839 
inside ourselves sir so we can speculate
about<00:01:35.869> what<00:01:36.229> it<00:01:36.349> is<00:01:36.500> but<00:01:36.830> that's<00:01:36.979> about<00:01:37.340> it

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
about what it is but that's about it

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:40.280 
about what it is but that's about it
I<00:01:37.959> understand

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
I understand

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.360 
I understand
d<00:01:40.410> of<00:01:40.590> how<00:01:40.830> we<00:01:41.010> can<00:01:41.160> collect<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.640> sample<00:01:43.370> now

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
d of how we can collect a sample now

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.800 
d of how we can collect a sample now
let's<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:45.090> moving

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
let's get moving

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:55.260 
let's get moving
we're<00:01:46.080> in<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.320> race<00:01:46.500> against<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:46.950> clock

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.700 

general

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.670 

excuse<00:02:03.710> me<00:02:03.890> general<00:02:04.870> yes<00:02:05.870> Schneider<00:02:06.230> what<00:02:06.620> do

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
excuse me general yes Schneider what do

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.070 
excuse me general yes Schneider what do
you<00:02:06.770> want<00:02:07.040> we<00:02:08.030> need<00:02:08.180> to<00:02:08.360> decide<00:02:08.660> what<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:08.930> do

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
you want we need to decide what to do

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.560 
you want we need to decide what to do
about<00:02:09.200> Andropov<00:02:09.920> sir<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.550> mean<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.180> can't<00:02:11.390> go<00:02:11.540> on

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
about Andropov sir I mean it can't go on

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.530 
about Andropov sir I mean it can't go on
like<00:02:11.720> this

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
like this

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.240 
like this
in<00:02:14.540> all<00:02:14.960> likelihood<00:02:14.990> he<00:02:15.830> was<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.130> one

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
in all likelihood he was the one

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.520 
in all likelihood he was the one
responsible<00:02:16.310> I<00:02:17.210> mean<00:02:17.780> he<00:02:17.930> had<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.110> be<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.410> one

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
responsible I mean he had to be the one

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.810 
responsible I mean he had to be the one
who<00:02:18.680> helped<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.040> girl<00:02:19.220> escaped<00:02:19.520> from<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
who helped the girl escaped from the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:27.440 
who helped the girl escaped from the
castle

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.369 

I<00:02:28.250> know<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.760> have<00:02:30.090> little<00:02:30.390> doubt<00:02:30.660> he<00:02:30.900> was<00:02:31.020> behind

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
I know I have little doubt he was behind

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.860 
I know I have little doubt he was behind
her<00:02:31.590> escape<00:02:32.040> what<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.610> knew<00:02:32.910> what<00:02:33.660> do<00:02:33.750> you

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
her escape what you knew what do you

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.570 
her escape what you knew what do you
suggest<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.470> do<00:02:34.530> my<00:02:34.830> hands<00:02:35.099> are<00:02:35.220> tied<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:37.580> need
