 community 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.070
 this is a special program in which 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.129
 we had gerardo reyero as a guest and 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.359
 Genaro VÃ¡zquez on September 6, 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.820
 2012 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:18.820
 here in digital media radio 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.850
 and also another one of the myths that of 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.480
 Suddenly there I found out that 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.340
 gerardo reyero and genaro vÃ¡zquez were 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.040
 bitter enemies because they give like 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.800
 they committed for the character never again 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.280
 this video we had never talked about 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.309
 not about this even if we follow each other 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.040
 seeing at work and in calls 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.620
 vegetable media radio is the anecdote of 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.110
 vote and if not ever in videos ever 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.940
 we have been very good friends always 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.800
 we have found ourselves out there 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.989
 we have seen with much affection with a lot 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.530
 with much appreciation with much admiration 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.320
 besides my part towards you you know it and 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.009
 if they had told me at that moment that 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.979
 that you were practically pulling from 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.690
 the series for that kind of nonsense 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:18.930
 believe me I would not have accepted me 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:21.960
 I would never have accepted the job 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.530
 how are these instances suddenly there in 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.530
 the companies 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:36.009
 but many times I say I would have 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.659
 done the same thing when they called me and I 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.250
 they called to be a character they told me 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.869
 hey well this did regularity no 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.950

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:48.820
 felling plant medium radio start same 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.649
 because they 're going to get me into trouble they're 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:57.240
 my friends in my way that one day that I 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:57.240
 go to dinner at home with you 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.690
 So, if I had done the same thing 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.390
 same if they call me to some work for 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.550
 fish fishing in the dubbing jargon 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.110
 means cover or take the character 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.830
 what the other florite was doing 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.590
 half a radio from some of my friends and 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.450
 no friends I always asked like this 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.310
 because I'm entering in the middle of the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.829
 series that happened is that you do not want it anymore 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.000
 do is they are charging a lot of good 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:36.430

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.450
 or not just unlocking you to nothing 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.670
 I have that in my case they did not tell me 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.270
 nothing only told me split the genre 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.730

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.080
 You can do it no longer to me. 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.120
 I even knew that it is more outside the 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.740
 country that has said being outside is 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.940
 out of the country and it's not going to be the 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:04.350
 character then someone has to 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.350
 do and this one 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.510
 even patti did not tell him the 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.510
 full story 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.430
 this is the story because the 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.180
 godmother and so the superior of me 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.700

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.090
 go to the total agreement no but if you say 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.530

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.660
 I was out of the country because it was fair 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.000

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.790

 Atlanta then there is fishing what is good 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.459
 because to me it would be that the way to me was 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.890
 what I handle, from the fact that you were 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.410
 outside the country and that they are going to 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.750

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:06.480
