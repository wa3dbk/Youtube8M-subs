we<00:03:27.329> develop<00:03:27.599> the<00:03:27.689> game<00:03:27.840> from<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.170> ground<00:03:28.439> of

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
we develop the game from the ground of

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.220 
we develop the game from the ground of
the<00:03:28.890> foundation<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:29.730> Fox<00:03:30.329> engine<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:30.719> a<00:03:30.750> big

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
the foundation and Fox engine is a big

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.759 
the foundation and Fox engine is a big
reason<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.799> that<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.879> how<00:03:33.810> big<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.379> a

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
reason of that so how big of a

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.500 
reason of that so how big of a
difference<00:03:34.920> do<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.400> think<00:03:35.670> current-gen

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
difference do you think current-gen

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.089 
difference do you think current-gen
versus<00:03:36.989> next-gen<00:03:37.560> when<00:03:37.709> it<00:03:37.799> comes<00:03:37.950> to

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
versus next-gen when it comes to

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.959 
versus next-gen when it comes to
graphics<00:03:39.170> pes2014<00:03:40.170> is<00:03:40.739> there<00:03:41.280> such<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.819> big

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:41.969 
graphics pes2014 is there such a big

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
they already are you know far behind I

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.990 
they already are you know far behind I
don't<00:04:16.289> think<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.650> gap<00:04:16.799> is<00:04:17.039> that<00:04:17.280> big<00:04:17.519> right

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
don't think the gap is that big right

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.729 
don't think the gap is that big right
now<00:04:18.030> there's<00:04:18.690> only<00:04:18.780> been<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:18.989> few<00:04:19.079> games<00:04:19.440> on

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
now there's only been a few games on

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.700 
now there's only been a few games on
next-gen<00:04:20.220> where<00:04:20.729> where<00:04:21.329> I've<00:04:21.449> been<00:04:21.570> like<00:04:21.780> that

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
next-gen where where I've been like that

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.409 
next-gen where where I've been like that
is<00:04:22.919> visually<00:04:23.160> impressive<00:04:23.580> or<00:04:24.030> it's<00:04:24.180> doing

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
is visually impressive or it's doing

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.570 
is visually impressive or it's doing
something<00:04:24.539> different<00:04:25.259> and<00:04:25.380> I<00:04:25.740> think<00:04:25.770> as<00:04:26.220> in<00:04:26.400> as

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
something different and I think as in as

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.930 
something different and I think as in as
in<00:04:27.240> whenever<00:04:28.229> there's<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.680> generation<00:04:29.639> shift

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
in whenever there's a generation shift

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.730 
in whenever there's a generation shift
there's<00:04:30.419> a<00:04:30.509> few<00:04:30.750> years<00:04:30.960> before<00:04:31.110> developers

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
there's a few years before developers

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.890 
there's a few years before developers
get<00:04:31.919> get<00:04:32.430> really<00:04:32.820> used<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.300> hardware<00:04:33.599> and

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
get get really used to the hardware and

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.719 
get get really used to the hardware and
start<00:04:34.080> training<00:04:34.470> our<00:04:34.620> really<00:04:34.919> good<00:04:34.949> stuff<00:04:35.340> and

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
start training our really good stuff and

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.300 
start training our really good stuff and
for<00:04:36.599> me<00:04:36.720> after<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.080> feel<00:04:37.409> that<00:04:37.560> that's<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.099> same

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
for me after I feel that that's the same

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.850 
for me after I feel that that's the same
I<00:04:38.690> don't<00:04:39.690> think<00:04:39.780> we're<00:04:40.169> gonna<00:04:40.229> suffer<00:04:40.680> I

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
I don't think we're gonna suffer I

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.070 
I don't think we're gonna suffer I
really<00:04:41.280> don't<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.639> I<00:04:42.000> think<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.570> big<00:04:42.780> you

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
really don't and I think the big you

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.540 
really don't and I think the big you
know<00:04:43.199> one<00:04:43.440> of<00:04:43.470> the<00:04:43.560> key<00:04:43.770> reasons<00:04:43.919> of<00:04:44.220> that<00:04:44.370> is

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
know one of the key reasons of that is

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.580 
know one of the key reasons of that is
the<00:04:44.820> are<00:04:44.970> in<00:04:45.270> focus<00:04:45.750> engine<00:04:46.110> is<00:04:46.229> the<00:04:46.349> fact<00:04:46.530> that

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
the are in focus engine is the fact that

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.950

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
which actually separates us from from

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.790 
which actually separates us from from
from<00:06:26.710> the<00:06:26.980> what<00:06:27.370> FIFA<00:06:27.610> does<00:06:27.940> ha<00:06:28.300> is<00:06:28.600> this<00:06:28.900> weird

happened this weekend and the small team

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.439 
happened this weekend and the small team
raising<00:06:52.570> the<00:06:52.690> game<00:06:52.870> the<00:06:53.110> crowd<00:06:53.350> roaring<00:06:53.890> the

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
and overcoming the well-known team

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.089 
and overcoming the well-known team
that's<00:06:57.270> very<00:06:57.449> hard<00:06:58.020> to<00:06:58.199> even<00:06:58.650> think<00:06:59.009> about

00:06:59.089 --> 00:06:59.099 
that's very hard to even think about

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:01.010 
that's very hard to even think about
playing<00:06:59.400> into<00:06:59.759> a<00:06:59.819> game<00:07:00.059> but<00:07:00.629> the<00:07:00.719> fact<00:07:00.930> that

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
playing into a game but the fact that

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.480 
playing into a game but the fact that
we're<00:07:01.259> thinking<00:07:01.439> about<00:07:01.740> those<00:07:02.039> things<00:07:02.279> and

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
we're thinking about those things and

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.480 
we're thinking about those things and
that's<00:07:02.699> opposed<00:07:02.999> to<00:07:03.150> what<00:07:03.330> what

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
that's opposed to what what

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.980 
that's opposed to what what
differentiates<00:07:05.490> us<00:07:05.849> from<00:07:05.969> EA<00:07:06.449> is<00:07:06.779> the

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:06.990 
differentiates us from EA is the

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.799 
differentiates us from EA is the
mentality<00:07:07.289> of<00:07:07.559> how<00:07:07.800> we<00:07:07.860> do<00:07:08.129> I<00:07:08.309> think<00:07:08.809> fevers
