00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.430
 hey people and today again with one 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.380
 new need for speed world car you 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.400
 more often with the new s-class vehicle 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.120
 and he already sees that is a new one 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.480
 koenigsegg and the koenigsegg ccxr 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:32.119
 edition that has just catch 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.500
 up here on the skates or none at all 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.050
 which made me a bit vulnerable 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.390
 usually to the ksk and so on 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.910
 a few at least three 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.910
 bad in it or not in it 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.970
 kit 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.320
 whether to go outside 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.210
 I never would not have gotten out of that 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.420
 white house is mine so I know what 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.250
 makes the men 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.410
 that had pretty much nothing 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.080
 in it for the share brand new song 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.030
 tyler give 1 4% share so and 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.490
 that's what it's called 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.400
 author that this car a lot of cars 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:27.950
 possibilities has that times a plus point 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:29.930
 is great for the car it has 773 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.910
 in the overall ranking in the 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.240
 top speed 768 in the 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:39.760
 Accusation 880 in handling 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.190
 673 so the daring look in any case 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.780
 klaus michael kÃ¼hne sec included 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.820
 usually this is carbon and 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.090
 far as I know now is a carbon 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.840
 edition the complete body 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:57.120
 it is made of carbon that mr is red 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:01.010
 Well, I do not think so 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:04.070
 but that is tomorrow 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.900
 they definitely cool and for that 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.420
 that somehow pretty much of the parts 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.520
 Now not so special part 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.630
 There are a lot of possibilities in it too 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.520
 allow 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.660
 make the case pretty fast 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.420
 the cost of 7930 led the cart 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.910
 Further bit high were so well 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.960
 we can compare it here 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.800
 compare compare 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.800
 the public 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.300
 the 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.330
 although it is so 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.330
 there is already 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.320
 In any case, that's definitely the case 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.340
 already something to it so the price is 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.750
 not too high will namely the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:18.100
 appointment procedure wants to give the best 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.100

 your price in any case yes for it 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.400

 one moment then we have 100 left 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.390
 subscribers speak what's more a 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:38.209
