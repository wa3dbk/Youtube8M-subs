00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.750 
too much this LP might sound like kind
of<00:03:34.569> a<00:03:34.659> mixed<00:03:34.900> bag<00:03:35.079> but<00:03:35.439> personally<00:03:36.010> for<00:03:36.040> me<00:03:36.430> the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
of a mixed bag but personally for me the

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.569 
of a mixed bag but personally for me the
guitar<00:03:37.239> tone<00:03:37.750> does<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.799> sound<00:03:39.010> of<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.310> drums

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
guitar tone does the sound of the drums

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.030 
guitar tone does the sound of the drums
and<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.909> vocals<00:03:40.389> are<00:03:40.689> enough<00:03:41.439> to<00:03:41.470> create<00:03:42.009> a

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
and the vocals are enough to create a

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.649 
and the vocals are enough to create a
common<00:03:42.519> thread<00:03:42.729> that<00:03:42.849> runs<00:03:42.909> throughout<00:03:43.479> all

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
common thread that runs throughout all

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.689 
common thread that runs throughout all
these<00:03:43.840> tracks<00:03:44.169> plus<00:03:44.769> I'm<00:03:45.009> sort<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.310> into<00:03:45.609> the

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:45.699 
these tracks plus I'm sort of into the

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.699 
these tracks plus I'm sort of into the
idea<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.209> this<00:03:46.329> depressing<00:03:46.870> cloud<00:03:47.379> that<00:03:47.620> the

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
idea that this depressing cloud that the

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.409 
idea that this depressing cloud that the
band<00:03:47.859> was<00:03:48.009> formed<00:03:48.340> under<00:03:48.729> on<00:03:49.030> their<00:03:49.180> debut

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
band was formed under on their debut

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.780 
band was formed under on their debut
album<00:03:49.629> is<00:03:50.079> dissipating<00:03:50.739> or<00:03:50.859> -<00:03:50.949> sort<00:03:51.129> of<00:03:51.189> moving

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
album is dissipating or - sort of moving

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.360 
album is dissipating or - sort of moving
away<00:03:52.030> a<00:03:52.180> little<00:03:52.419> bit<00:03:52.530> freeing<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.799> band<00:03:54.040> up<00:03:54.220> to

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
away a little bit freeing the band up to

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.640 
away a little bit freeing the band up to
explore<00:03:54.849> more<00:03:55.120> aggressive<00:03:55.870> material<00:03:56.409> because

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
explore more aggressive material because

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.199 
explore more aggressive material because
there<00:03:56.799> are<00:03:56.919> certainly<00:03:57.280> tracks<00:03:57.609> on<00:03:57.849> this<00:03:58.030> LP

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
there are certainly tracks on this LP

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.749 
there are certainly tracks on this LP
that<00:03:58.599> transition<00:03:59.139> from<00:03:59.290> these<00:03:59.439> slow<00:03:59.829> do<00:04:00.579> me

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:00.759 
that transition from these slow do me

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.280 
that transition from these slow do me
guitar<00:04:01.060> passages<00:04:01.659> to<00:04:01.810> something<00:04:02.139> more

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
guitar passages to something more

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.710 
guitar passages to something more
hardcore<00:04:02.709> and<00:04:03.099> overtly<00:04:03.430> aggressive<00:04:04.120> despite

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
hardcore and overtly aggressive despite

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.110 
hardcore and overtly aggressive despite
that<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:04.989> have<00:04:05.319> to<00:04:05.530> say<00:04:05.799> I<00:04:06.189> don't<00:04:06.879> think

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
that I have to say I don't think

Distortion and lyrically I'm catching a

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.620 
Distortion and lyrically I'm catching a
lot<00:04:38.480> of<00:04:38.540> the<00:04:38.690> same<00:04:39.190> loss<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.850> and<00:04:41.060> religious

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
lot of the same loss and and religious

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.170 
lot of the same loss and and religious
themes<00:04:41.960> that<00:04:42.740> I<00:04:42.800> was<00:04:43.130> hearing<00:04:43.400> on<00:04:43.640> a<00:04:43.940> fragile

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
themes that I was hearing on a fragile

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.630 
themes that I was hearing on a fragile
King<00:04:44.660> and<00:04:44.960> they<00:04:45.560> still<00:04:45.890> work<00:04:46.100> pretty<00:04:46.400> well

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
King and they still work pretty well

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.460 
King and they still work pretty well
here<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.300> title<00:04:47.510> track<00:04:47.870> is<00:04:47.900> another<00:04:48.290> example

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
here the title track is another example

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.770 
here the title track is another example
of<00:04:48.800> these<00:04:48.980> do<00:04:49.250> mere<00:04:49.430> flavours<00:04:49.970> executed<00:04:50.570> in<00:04:50.690> a

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
of these do mere flavours executed in a

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.660 
of these do mere flavours executed in a
really<00:04:51.020> great<00:04:51.170> way<00:04:51.260> and<00:04:51.830> from<00:04:52.130> here<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.550> just

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
really great way and from here it just

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.030 
really great way and from here it just
seems<00:04:52.910> that<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.150> band<00:04:53.330> gets<00:04:53.800> faster<00:04:54.800> and

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
seems that the band gets faster and

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.100 
seems that the band gets faster and
heavier<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:55.790> more<00:04:56.180> aggressive<00:04:56.750> but<00:04:56.900> it's<00:04:57.020> not

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
heavier and more aggressive but it's not

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.450 
heavier and more aggressive but it's not
like<00:04:57.260> the<00:04:57.380> band<00:04:57.530> is<00:04:57.620> playing<00:04:57.830> doom<00:04:58.100> and

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
like the band is playing doom and

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.460 
like the band is playing doom and
they're<00:04:59.000> playing<00:04:59.180> fast<00:04:59.540> paced<00:04:59.870> death<00:05:00.260> and

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
they're playing fast paced death and

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.530 
they're playing fast paced death and
roll<00:05:00.710> there's<00:05:01.400> a<00:05:01.490> bit<00:05:01.790> of<00:05:01.820> a<00:05:01.970> gradient<00:05:02.240> here

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
roll there's a bit of a gradient here

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.720 
roll there's a bit of a gradient here
and<00:05:02.990> on<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.200> most<00:05:03.380> intense<00:05:03.890> side<00:05:04.340> of<00:05:04.580> this

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730

aggressive songs can occasionally be a
little<00:05:09.650> hit<00:05:09.800> or<00:05:09.830> miss<00:05:09.950> like<00:05:10.700> the<00:05:10.850> hyper

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
when I mean really in reality it's all

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.740 
when I mean really in reality it's all
loud<00:05:48.590> as<00:05:48.920> hell<00:05:49.130> and<00:05:49.550> super<00:05:50.120> crimey<00:05:50.630> and

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
loud as hell and super crimey and

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.210 
loud as hell and super crimey and
aggressive<00:05:51.290> so<00:05:51.560> it's<00:05:51.740> not<00:05:51.890> like<00:05:52.040> the<00:05:52.190> the

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
aggressive so it's not like the the

aggressive so it's not like the the
change<00:05:52.700> is<00:05:52.850> that<00:05:53.000> great<00:05:53.330> there<00:05:53.720> are<00:05:53.750> some<00:05:54.050> more

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
change is that great there are some more

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.750
