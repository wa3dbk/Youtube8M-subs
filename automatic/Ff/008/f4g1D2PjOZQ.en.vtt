00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.529
 problematic is the question concerning 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.369
 few problematic grafts for the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.369
 simple fact that not 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.550
 if I'm not here 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:33.140
 news is great news from late 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.910
 even today I do n't like doing 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.190
 comparison what happens in the world 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.410
 why in the world and almonds run in 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.720
 absolutely different way ie the fact 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.780
 which for example the California grafts 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.110
 all sent on the text is a fact that 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.910
 it is not replicable from other parts than in 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.190
 somehow even the california is 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.199
 beginning to change by us pictures 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.840
 they always remain mental starts of 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:02.030
 there are landro bitter sweet here 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.739
 of schools of thought and above all 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.820
 of local traditions 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:11.149
 I will never say graft onto almond 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.670
 brown hurts but hardly to 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.120
 so important respect fortress 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.000
 there is 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.900
 of course there are local traditions 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.120
 which suggest almond almond 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.290
 bitter as a rootstock and I don't see the 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.690
 why we should not 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.460
 enhance this way also the 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.100
 bitter almond but it's not like they are there 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.050
 all these big differences are there 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.480
 the experiences of using books where 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.460
 I'm stopping them ok especially also in 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.220
 this area results experience of 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.990
 respect 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.060
 initially I also said this 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.890
 the other time initially there were all of them 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.980
 a series of perplexities according to the 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.740
 the fact that it is precisely a graft was created 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.510
 this discrepancy between the rootstock e 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.670
 the variety is there was more variety 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.830
 grown of the rootstock and it was feared 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.140
 that these plants could come down 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.180
 at the first wind in reality with 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.760
 impediment denounced us and plants 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.470
 they always remained standing 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.460
 we visited if I remember correctly 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.080
 installations on the gf of about twenty years 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.110
 perfectly productive and not me 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.500
 it appears that in other areas there have been 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.510
 sure to see one say something 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.830
 something will go wrong to see it though 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.010
 plants result with a type e 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.829
 especially on gf it goes into production 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:34.459
 a little earlier than the taste of 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:37.790
 song I am very hesitant inverter 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.250
 on the use of plum trees hang yourself because 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.650
 when they are perfectly similar go 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.000
 very well, however, they have been 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:50.540
 used on in facilities where there are 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.340
 own water stagnation problems 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.590
 because exhibits usually resist 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.629
 more to this critic but in reality i 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.060
 cussini because there are Spaniards 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.190
 I say because they have a parable of calais 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.590
 a root system is very superficial 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.349
 not superficial just flight traced 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.239
 with the clear shell to try to 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.459
 ferrara to make the collection to operate 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.769
 to harvest the plants is not hard 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:17.930
 very well above all there is not yet one 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:22.300
 consolidated a knowledge of 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.160
 what happens in the long run for 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.820
 see only for clinicians when 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.820
 I saw the duration as a beautiful legacy 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.820
 plant
