00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
a while and just this year I'm just

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.510 
a while and just this year I'm just

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
trying out some things thing out

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.080 
trying out some things thing out
different<00:00:21.270> rendering<00:00:21.720> techniques<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:23.090> had

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
different rendering techniques and had

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.170 
different rendering techniques and had
some<00:00:24.269> problems<00:00:24.539> with<00:00:24.570> audio<00:00:25.789> what<00:00:26.789> last<00:00:26.970> time

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
some problems with audio what last time

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.370 
some problems with audio what last time
I<00:00:27.240> recorded<00:00:27.599> tribe<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.109> thought<00:00:28.230> I'd<00:00:28.349> try

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
I recorded tribe so I thought I'd try

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.980 
I recorded tribe so I thought I'd try
and<00:00:28.650> sort<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.010> all<00:00:29.099> out<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.570> do<00:00:30.570> some<00:00:30.750> playing

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
and sort it all out and do some playing

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.269 
and sort it all out and do some playing
at<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.199> same<00:00:31.380> time<00:00:31.560> normally<00:00:32.009> I'd<00:00:32.099> probably

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
at the same time normally I'd probably

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.220 
at the same time normally I'd probably
be<00:00:32.489> playing<00:00:32.730> with<00:00:32.820> my<00:00:32.940> friends<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.390> I'm<00:00:33.570> not

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
be playing with my friends so I'm not

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.540

commentary<00:00:36.300> type<00:00:36.480> thing<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.410> I'll<00:00:37.469> probably

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
commentary type thing so I'll probably

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.350 
commentary type thing so I'll probably
just<00:00:37.770> be<00:00:37.950> concentrating<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.730> lot<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:39.030> this

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
games I've been playing so hopefully

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.240

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
out out out out out turrets turrets

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.869 
out out out out out turrets turrets
turrets<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.379> that's<00:02:22.830> mine<00:02:23.010> thank<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.430> so

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
turrets and that's mine thank you so

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.350 
turrets and that's mine thank you so
I've<00:02:24.000> got<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.209> reach<00:02:25.849> but<00:02:26.849> you<00:02:26.940> go<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.209> third

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
I've got the reach but you go that third

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.720 
I've got the reach but you go that third
perk<00:02:27.629> as<00:02:27.870> well<00:02:28.050> which<00:02:28.650> means<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.190> pick<00:02:29.580> up

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
perk as well which means that I pick up

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.880 
perk as well which means that I pick up
things<00:02:29.970> went<00:02:30.269> further<00:02:30.420> away<00:02:30.599> and<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.709> means

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
things went further away and that means

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.110 
things went further away and that means
i<00:02:31.950> can<00:02:32.069> pick<00:02:32.220> up<00:02:32.340> health<00:02:32.549> and<00:02:32.760> stuff<00:02:32.940> and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
i can pick up health and stuff and

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.789 
i can pick up health and stuff and
further<00:02:33.330> away<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:34.080> i<00:02:34.110> figured<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.440> in

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
further away so i figured that in

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.619 
further away so i figured that in
combination<00:02:35.129> with<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.670> whole<00:02:35.910> more<00:02:36.239> energy

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
combination with the whole more energy

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.420 
combination with the whole more energy
more<00:02:36.810> health<00:02:37.049> thing<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:37.530> also<00:02:38.099> because<00:02:38.340> i'm

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
more health thing and also because i'm

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.100 
more health thing and also because i'm
going<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.670> be<00:02:38.760> carrying<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.120> flag<00:02:39.239> lot<00:02:39.629> it

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
going to be carrying the flag lot it

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.300 
going to be carrying the flag lot it
means<00:02:40.319> because<00:02:40.709> obviously<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:41.099> can't

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
means because obviously you can't

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.250 
means because obviously you can't
regenerate<00:02:41.849> health<00:02:42.299> loyally<00:02:42.720> for<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.959> flag

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
regenerate health loyally for the flag

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.390 
regenerate health loyally for the flag
it<00:02:43.560> makes<00:02:44.519> sense<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:45.890> be<00:02:46.890> able<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.160> regenerate

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
it makes sense to be able to regenerate

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.530 
it makes sense to be able to regenerate
health<00:02:47.670> from<00:02:48.090> health<00:02:48.810> packs<00:02:49.049> and<00:02:49.380> stuff<00:02:50.540> i'm

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
health from health packs and stuff i'm

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.180 
health from health packs and stuff i'm
just<00:02:51.720> avoiding<00:02:51.900> people<00:02:52.440> at<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.739> moment<00:02:53.040> but<00:02:53.130> I
