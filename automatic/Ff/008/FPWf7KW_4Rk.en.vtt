00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.500
 very good let's see how we can 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.580
 use our iphone nano of sixth 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.419
 generation to record audios or in this 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:16.240
 case I would use to record podcast 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:19.660
 which is the same thing this is a nano ipod 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.700
 sixth generation worth is the little one the 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.130
 what can you use 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.290
 like a watch if you put it in a 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.930
 bracelet this is specifically from me 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.930
 girlfriend that's why it's pink those who grab 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.570
 this if we activate it 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.590
 as well, because if you do not see any 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.590
 no application to record 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.120
 you see there is no application now 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.719
 same to record I do not know if you can see it 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.510
 but good voice notes would not be like 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:58.210
 we can do to be able to use in 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.640
 this case the spots or any other 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.070
 headphones but good since I have this 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.700
 I'm going to use these to record a 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.790
 audio on the iphone nano well well a 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.990
 Once we connect this headphones 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.990
 to the jack 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:23.380
 automatically we would have to appear 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.380
 the icon this voice notes 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.700
 to see if it looks good there is 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.430
 then when this icon appears 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.619
 touching it we would see the notes of 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.270
 voice and directly we can record 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:42.700
 playing here here is recorded puts us that 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.350
 is recording we can pause in the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:51.410
 recording second three resume the and 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.260
 keep recording we can even block 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.330
 in the pocket where we want 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.140
 we unlock and keep recording as 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.910
 you can check and record quite well 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.810
 once we have it stopped we give it 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.119
 to stop 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:12.140
 it would save us we would give it here 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.980
 and here we would have our audio saved 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:20.600
 this audio if we wanted to upload it to 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.760
 explain for example or there's box or itunes 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.730
 As it does not have wifi this is because you have to 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.850
 connect it by usb to our computer 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.319
 to pass it let's do it now let's go 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.049
 to do a test 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.999
 we have this recording here what there is 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.560
 to do this we can unplug 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:38.750
 if we want 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.470
 what you have to do is move on to our 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.470
 computer 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.739
 and what you have to do is connect it 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.739
 by its cable 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.920
 we connect 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.380
 and you will see that it appears 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.590
 there the ipod icon if you look is 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.140
 even up to the same color 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.319
 ok then I'm going to leave it for 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.319
 here 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.640
 and I'm going to show you what would be 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:23.010
 would have to open this here the 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.010
 icon we double click on 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.420
 this window opens up depending on 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:33.490
 how we have it configured and what 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:37.090
 we have thus well but otherwise like this or that way 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:40.690
 let's say you have it that way here would be the 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.300
 folder of photos and here the folder 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.230
 of recordings that are the recordings 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:50.890
 what we have done with our iphone nano 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.330
 we would open and here we would have the audio 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.450
 that we just recorded right now of 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.720
 try simply dragging them to 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.440
 desk we would have it and we could 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.440
 hear it 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.330
 who is recording 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.170
 we can resume the one that keeps recording 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.170
 we can even block 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.320
 woman in the pocket where we want 

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.170
 we unlock 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.310
 keep recording as you can check and 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.100
 record pretty well once 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.729
 You see here you can put the name or 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.909
 what I wanted jce 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.510
 this we can close it even 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:38.150
 delete it 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.129
 and we're going to erase it will be deleted from our 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.959
 of our time not also 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.040
 and one thing that I have to do for 

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:48.520
 can it go up 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.520
 to explain is simply change this 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:58.740
 from here it is in m4a because you erase it 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:02.340
 you put mp3 enter and use mp3 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.310
 now it's changed now it's mp3 and this yes 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.340
 that accepts to explain to us to raise 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.130
 our audio there is worth it then that's how 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.030
 can you use your iphone nano for 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.120
 record a podcast 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.660
 and upload it explain a greeting and until the 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.660
 next video
