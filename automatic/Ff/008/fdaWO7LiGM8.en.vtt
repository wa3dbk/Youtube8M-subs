that<00:00:11.639> mean<00:00:11.940> President<00:00:12.870> Alan<00:00:13.290> Moore<00:00:13.500> explains

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
that mean President Alan Moore explains

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.050 
that mean President Alan Moore explains
next<00:00:14.880> our<00:00:15.809> focus<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.410> really<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.920> grow<00:00:17.279> tissue

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
next our focus is really to grow tissue

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.990 
next our focus is really to grow tissue
back<00:00:18.390> into<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.869> brain<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:20.160> any<00:00:20.490> disease

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
back into the brain and so any disease

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.290 
back into the brain and so any disease
in<00:00:21.240> which<00:00:21.449> you've<00:00:21.689> lost<00:00:22.050> brain<00:00:22.769> tissue<00:00:23.300> we

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
in which you've lost brain tissue we

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.300 
in which you've lost brain tissue we
activate<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.199> stem<00:00:25.439> cells<00:00:25.710> than<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.010> brain

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
activate the stem cells than the brain

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.910 
activate the stem cells than the brain
to<00:00:26.609> grow<00:00:26.820> tissue<00:00:27.090> back<00:00:27.359> again<00:00:27.660> we<00:00:28.470> don't<00:00:28.710> use

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
to grow tissue back again we don't use

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.830 
to grow tissue back again we don't use
stem<00:00:29.220> cells<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> confusing<00:00:30.689> thing

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
stem cells and this is a confusing thing

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.690 
stem cells and this is a confusing thing
with<00:00:31.170> our<00:00:31.289> company<00:00:31.740> we're<00:00:31.890> called<00:00:32.130> stem<00:00:32.430> cell

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
with our company we're called stem cell

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.299 
with our company we're called stem cell
therapeutics<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.780> fact<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.860> idea<00:00:35.250> is

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
therapeutics but in fact the idea is

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.400 
therapeutics but in fact the idea is
that<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.760> use<00:00:35.969> therapeutics<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.840> act<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
that we use therapeutics to act on the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.590 
that we use therapeutics to act on the
stem<00:00:37.649> cells<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.190> are<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.640> brain<00:00:38.879> so

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
stem cells that are in the brain so

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.840 
stem cells that are in the brain so
these<00:00:39.809> are<00:00:39.870> called<00:00:40.379> progenitor<00:00:41.309> cells<00:00:41.579> or

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
these are called progenitor cells or

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.700 
these are called progenitor cells or
precursor<00:00:42.510> cells<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.960> become<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.350> tissue

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
precursor cells that become the tissue

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.740 
precursor cells that become the tissue
there<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.850> know<00:00:44.969> there's<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.239> big<00:00:45.390> argument

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
there in you know there's a big argument

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.020 
there in you know there's a big argument
right<00:00:46.079> now<00:00:46.289> about<00:00:46.410> fetal<00:00:46.890> stem<00:00:47.250> cells<00:00:47.309> or<00:00:47.910> if

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
right now about fetal stem cells or if

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.639 
right now about fetal stem cells or if
you<00:00:48.149> stimulate<00:00:48.390> them<00:00:48.840> they<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.200> grow<00:00:49.379> into<00:00:49.559> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
you stimulate them they can grow into a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.619 
you stimulate them they can grow into a
big<00:00:49.950> toe<00:00:50.250> or<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> whole<00:00:50.760> person<00:00:51.030> or<00:00:51.329> whatever

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
big toe or a whole person or whatever

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.660 
big toe or a whole person or whatever
well<00:00:52.320> these<00:00:52.590> cells<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.160> are<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.460> brain

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
well these cells that are in the brain

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.580 
well these cells that are in the brain
just<00:00:53.940> grow<00:00:54.180> into<00:00:54.420> brain<00:00:54.660> tissue<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.170> adult

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
just grow into brain tissue that adult

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.160 
just grow into brain tissue that adult
stem<00:00:55.829> cells<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.059> use<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> regimen<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.899> two

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
stem cells so we use a regimen of two

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.760 
stem cells so we use a regimen of two
drugs<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:59.070> use<00:00:59.539> HCG<00:01:00.539> which<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.320> an<00:01:01.440> approved

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
drugs we use HCG which is an approved

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.080 
drugs we use HCG which is an approved
drug<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.370> poet<00:01:02.760> or<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.969> poet<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:04.019> actually

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
drug in a poet or a poet in to actually

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.460 
drug in a poet or a poet in to actually
stimulate<00:01:06.090> those<00:01:06.299> cells<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:07.110> make<00:01:07.320> them

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
stimulate those cells and then make them

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.969 
stimulate those cells and then make them
divided<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.100> become<00:01:08.610> new<00:01:09.360> brain<00:01:09.630> tissue

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
divided and become new brain tissue

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.710 
divided and become new brain tissue
we're<00:01:10.979> at<00:01:11.130> several<00:01:11.700> stages<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.330> development

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
we're at several stages of development

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.289 
we're at several stages of development
depending<00:01:13.320> upon<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.710> disorder<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.970> first

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
depending upon the disorder so the first

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.270 
depending upon the disorder so the first
one<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.600> we're<00:01:15.869> focused<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.470> stroke<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
one that we're focused on is stroke and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.490 
one that we're focused on is stroke and
this<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.939> where<00:01:18.119> people<00:01:18.540> usually<00:01:18.840> they've<00:01:19.290> had

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
this is where people usually they've had

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.320 
this is where people usually they've had
a<00:01:19.530> blood<00:01:19.860> clot<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.310> an<00:01:20.430> archery<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.210> the

a blood clot in an archery going to the
brain<00:01:21.600> or<00:01:21.840> they've<00:01:22.680> had<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> hemorrhagic

stroke<00:01:23.909> where<00:01:24.090> their<00:01:24.210> blood<00:01:24.390> vessels

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
stroke where their blood vessels

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.109 
stroke where their blood vessels
actually<00:01:25.170> burst<00:01:25.409> open<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.070> what<00:01:26.700> happens

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
actually burst open and what happens

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.149 
actually burst open and what happens
there<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.960> an<00:01:28.200> invite<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.040> your

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
do we have any bad side effects the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.910 
do we have any bad side effects the
answer<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.210> yes<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.600> works<00:01:54.869> no<00:01:55.560> they're<00:01:55.710> about

answer is yes it works no they're about
no<00:01:56.310> bad<00:01:56.490> side<00:01:56.790> effects<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.810> now<00:01:58.049> we're<00:01:58.200> in

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
no bad side effects so now we're in

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.580 
no bad side effects so now we're in
