00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.960
 We in Medellin invent ourselves in 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:46.570

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.790
 to the people we cheat ourselves 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.699

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.460
 came in a new sponsor who knows 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:58.570
 called pepsico pepsico was a 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.299
 multinational is the company the second 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:06.520

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:14.270
 because for everything we are doing 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.259
