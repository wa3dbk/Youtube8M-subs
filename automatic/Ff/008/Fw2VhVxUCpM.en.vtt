00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
animation tutorial I was supposed to

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.870 
animation tutorial I was supposed to
doing<00:00:13.590> two<00:00:13.860> programs<00:00:14.280> are<00:00:14.490> supposed<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.759> be

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
doing two programs are supposed to be

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.960 
doing two programs are supposed to be
doing<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.529> which<00:00:16.529> one<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.920> PI<00:00:17.520> game<00:00:17.730> hello

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
doing a which one is a PI game hello

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.939 
doing a which one is a PI game hello
world<00:00:18.210> program<00:00:18.390> which<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.869> basically<00:00:19.080> it's

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
world program which is basically it's

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.370 
world program which is basically it's
just<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.250> simple<00:00:20.580> graphic<00:00:21.029> which<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.109> can<00:00:22.230> make

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
just a simple graphic which you can make

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.120 
just a simple graphic which you can make
using<00:00:23.010> no<00:00:23.970> Python<00:00:24.830> but<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.949> made<00:00:26.099> a

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
using no Python but I made a

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.570 
using no Python but I made a
modification<00:00:26.400> when<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.880> was<00:00:26.970> recording<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.510> and

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
modification when I was recording it and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.229 
modification when I was recording it and
yet<00:00:29.580> Python<00:00:30.480> sputter<00:00:30.779> out<00:00:31.309> so<00:00:32.309> if<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.030> time

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
yet Python sputter out so if I have time

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.060 
yet Python sputter out so if I have time
I'll<00:00:33.600> at<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.440> end<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.680> tutorial

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
I'll at the end of the tutorial

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.979 
I'll at the end of the tutorial
I'll<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> little<00:00:36.390> tutorial<00:00:36.899> on

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
I'll going to do a little tutorial on

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.250 
I'll going to do a little tutorial on
debugging<00:00:37.440> see<00:00:38.219> if<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.460> get<00:00:38.579> working<00:00:39.260> so

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
debugging see if I can get working so

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.630 
debugging see if I can get working so
I'll<00:00:40.350> go<00:00:40.469> straight<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.890> program<00:00:41.219> and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
I'll go straight to the program and

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.450 
I'll go straight to the program and
basically<00:00:42.059> say<00:00:42.210> animation<00:00:43.050> stuff<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.460> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
basically say animation stuff like the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.170 
basically say animation stuff like the
screen<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.450> epic<00:00:46.730> you<00:00:47.730> know<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> one<00:00:48.030> where

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
screen so epic you know the one where

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.200 
screen so epic you know the one where
you<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:49.200> blocks<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.829> they<00:00:50.160> bounce<00:00:50.910> off<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
you have blocks and they bounce off the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.160 
you have blocks and they bounce off the
screen<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.289> something<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:55.110> a

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
screen and something like that so it's a

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.740 
screen and something like that so it's a
pretty<00:00:55.350> big<00:00:55.710> program<00:00:56.329> if<00:00:57.329> you're<00:00:57.480> going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.660> be

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
pretty big program if you're going to be

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.709 
pretty big program if you're going to be
doing<00:00:57.930> any<00:00:58.320> programming<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.600> now<00:01:00.600> if<00:01:00.660> you

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
doing any programming and now if you

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:08.000 
doing any programming and now if you
think<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.020> programming<00:01:06.200> yeah<00:01:07.229> do<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.650> expect

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
think in programming yeah do you expect

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.070 
think in programming yeah do you expect
a<00:01:08.220> lot<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.460> long<00:01:08.640> programs<00:01:09.119> for<00:01:09.450> own<00:01:09.630> such

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
a lot of long programs for own such

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
a lot of long programs for own such
small<00:01:12.439> programs

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.670 

yeah<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.700> I'm<00:01:20.700> Scott<00:01:21.000> for<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.150> structure

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
yeah so I'm Scott for the structure

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.649 
yeah so I'm Scott for the structure
Itzik<00:01:22.680> import<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.580> know<00:01:23.700> set<00:01:24.060> up<00:01:24.090> my<00:01:24.420> game

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
Itzik import you know set up my game

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.560 
Itzik import you know set up my game
you'll<00:01:25.350> need<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.620> PI<00:01:25.770> game<00:01:26.010> and<00:01:26.220> say<00:01:26.430> library<00:01:27.090> I

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.630 

forgot<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.750> do<00:01:31.050> that<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:32.310> I'll<00:01:32.460> set

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
forgot to do that one I and I'll set

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.430 
forgot to do that one I and I'll set
this<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:34.100> found<00:01:35.100> all<00:01:35.310> these<00:01:38.930> my<00:01:39.930> laptop's

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
where to go the new speed is a hundred

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.699 
where to go the new speed is a hundred
us<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> body<00:02:06.210> faster<00:02:06.770> still<00:02:07.770> an<00:02:07.890> hour<00:02:08.100> five

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
us a body faster still an hour five

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.570 
us a body faster still an hour five
setting<00:02:10.709> up<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.920> colors<00:02:11.900> yeah<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:14.190> set<00:02:14.550> the

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
setting up the colors yeah and set the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.210 
setting up the colors yeah and set the
block<00:02:14.880> structure<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:15.690> bu<00:02:16.320> one<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.800> one<00:02:16.980> block

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
block structure so bu one is one block

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.430 
block structure so bu one is one block
of<00:02:17.340> beauty<00:02:17.610> another<00:02:17.910> block<00:02:18.120> yeah<00:02:18.750> four<00:02:19.260> blocks

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
of beauty another block yeah four blocks

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.400 
of beauty another block yeah four blocks
then<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.519> have<00:02:20.700> here<00:02:20.970> their<00:02:21.720> parameters<00:02:21.989> so

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
then you have here their parameters so

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.280 
then you have here their parameters so
here<00:02:25.410> it's<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.680> rectangle<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.760> have<00:02:27.290> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
here it's a rectangle and you have the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.080 
here it's a rectangle and you have the
dimensions<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.280> have<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.519> color<00:02:29.760> and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
dimensions and you have the color and

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.340 
dimensions and you have the color and
then<00:02:30.239> you<00:02:30.330> have<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:31.650> direction<00:02:32.989> then<00:02:33.989> all

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
then you have the direction then all

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.370 
then you have the direction then all

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
it's not a very advanced program I think

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.490 
it's not a very advanced program I think
it's<00:07:02.039> pretty<00:07:02.220> good<00:07:02.430> you<00:07:03.330> know<00:07:03.360> if<00:07:04.229> you<00:07:04.350> get

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 
it's pretty good you know if you get

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.680 
it's pretty good you know if you get
into<00:07:04.680> Python<00:07:05.130> this<00:07:06.120> is<00:07:06.240> one<00:07:06.389> of<00:07:06.419> the<00:07:06.539> major

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.690 
into Python this is one of the major

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.310 
into Python this is one of the major
programs<00:07:07.229> you'll<00:07:08.190> make<00:07:09.020> so<00:07:10.020> if<00:07:10.080> you<00:07:10.199> are
