00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.500
 or the one they saw as a friend that is going to 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.000
 help teach us how to put a 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.500
 proper roadway 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.930
 to put a head of four to 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.060
 horse in the new houses we have two 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.000
 options 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.720
 do it through the hitch this 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.060
 through the first do through 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.599
 of the down payment that we have to do is 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.330
 hold the horse's head 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.500
 introduce the hat and finally pass 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.360
 above the ears 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.960
 then we have to look for the hitch and 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.530
 press it 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.309
 we can see that we already have 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.309
 all right 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.699
 Now let's do the other d 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.590
 and use of the function 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.120
 this is growing remove it and we see that it 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.829
 speak perfectly on the part of 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.030
 above this can be very good for 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.410
 horses that have problems with 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.110
 ears many horses that do not like 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.110
 therefore talk about putting the stops 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.920
 from block 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.920
 this will be the best way 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.240
 to do what we have to do 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.509
 we open this 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.189
 we introduce the nose first and 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.650
 then carefully and hand 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.050
 right 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.460
 we go behind the ears as 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.700
 we have seen we have not had any 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.700
 moment 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.170
 and only 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.640
 if we can see how the horse has 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.640
 left 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.190
 finally, it would only be necessary to place 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.930
 rope 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.970
 and we would have the horse ready to 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.350
 make the first 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.350
 Well I hope you liked it
