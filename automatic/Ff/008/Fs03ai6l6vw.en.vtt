00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.140
 look at me 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.140
 with the greenhouse effect and Spain 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.140
 the first thing we are going to do 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:41.260
 you are going to use two crystal goals 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.660
 the thermometer to measure the temperature 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.660
 it's interesting 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.010
 look first let's cover a 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.719
 delation 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.719
 and you're going to get me a thermos 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.570
 let's put another color 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.570
 and we're also going to put the term 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.960
 Now we can only wait 10 minutes 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.690
 and we're going to write down the data 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.690
 mother looking and has each one seems to me 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.610
 Yes, the time has come to see and see 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.090
 if it came out useful 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.619
 look at the goal where the plants are 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.369
 the temperature that marks the thermometer 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.690
 it's about 36 degrees 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.690
 then we will register it 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.010
 the bowl where there is no plant we see that the 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.690
 thermometer marks about 41 degrees 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.690
 approximately also 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.399
 I have no idea written unless you want 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.330
 that the reasons and of course yes 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.330
 come on let's go there let's go
