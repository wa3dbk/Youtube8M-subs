00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
season but as far as this is a team

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.020 
season but as far as this is a team
every<00:03:09.470> every<00:03:09.740> player<00:03:09.950> on<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.190> team<00:03:10.220> has<00:03:10.730> great

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030

think they'll be better when they get
them<00:03:37.430> when<00:03:37.610> we<00:03:37.850> play<00:03:38.000> them<00:03:38.030> tomorrow<00:03:38.480> with<00:03:38.630> the
