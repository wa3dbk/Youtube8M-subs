00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
so if you see that little indentation in

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.830 
so if you see that little indentation in
the<00:00:08.700> grass<00:00:08.910> that<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.510> where<00:00:09.809> my<00:00:09.929> boat<00:00:10.139> was<00:00:10.469> I

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
the grass that is where my boat was I

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.509 
the grass that is where my boat was I

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
pulled it up that high because we're

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.390 
pulled it up that high because we're
close<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:15.150> my<00:00:16.020> new<00:00:16.170> moon<00:00:16.410> which<00:00:16.770> means<00:00:17.010> spring

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
close to my new moon which means spring

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.080 
close to my new moon which means spring
tides<00:00:18.320> which<00:00:19.320> means<00:00:19.760> there's<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:21.240> lot<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.050> water

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
tides which means there's a lot of water

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.460 
tides which means there's a lot of water
that<00:00:24.090> comes<00:00:24.300> up<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.660> tides<00:00:24.869> get<00:00:25.109> much<00:00:25.260> higher

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
that comes up the tides get much higher

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.240 
that comes up the tides get much higher
I'm<00:00:25.740> much<00:00:25.920> lower<00:00:26.220> there's<00:00:28.099> more<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.189> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
I'm much lower there's more of a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.830 
I'm much lower there's more of a
disparity<00:00:29.580> between<00:00:29.760> height<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.570> can't

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
disparity between height so you can't

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.430 
disparity between height so you can't
really<00:00:31.019> judge<00:00:31.380> when<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.859> show<00:00:32.399> up<00:00:32.430> I'm<00:00:32.759> sure

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
a little bit above the low tide because

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.389 
a little bit above the low tide because
I<00:01:53.930> don't<00:01:54.930> want<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.140> track<00:01:55.320> my<00:01:55.500> boat<00:01:55.740> at<00:01:55.979> 4:00<00:01:56.250> in

I don't want to track my boat at 4:00 in
the<00:01:56.430> morning<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.570> think<00:01:57.810> I'm<00:01:57.869> about<00:01:58.020> an<00:01:58.670> hour

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
the morning so I think I'm about an hour

the morning so I think I'm about an hour
and<00:02:00.030> 20<00:02:00.299> minutes<00:02:00.570> after<00:02:00.750> absolute<00:02:01.320> low<00:02:01.500> which

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
and 20 minutes after absolute low which

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.440 
and 20 minutes after absolute low which
is<00:02:01.740> totally<00:02:02.250> fine<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:03.229> hopefully<00:02:04.229> going<00:02:04.500> to

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
is totally fine and hopefully going to

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.050 
is totally fine and hopefully going to
camp<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.990> spot<00:02:07.439> called<00:02:07.710> sand<00:02:08.129> spit<00:02:08.640> tonight

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
camp at a spot called sand spit tonight

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.259 
camp at a spot called sand spit tonight
because<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.619> sand<00:02:10.920> beach

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
because of the sand beach

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.920 
because of the sand beach
and<00:02:14.049> it<00:02:14.650> feels<00:02:14.860> like<00:02:15.010> there's<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.370> bit<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:16.299> a

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
and it feels like there's a bit of a

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.690 
and it feels like there's a bit of a
southern<00:02:17.200> we<00:02:17.290> win<00:02:17.530> today<00:02:17.829> so<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.129> might<00:02:18.370> be<00:02:18.579> able
