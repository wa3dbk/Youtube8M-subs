00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.290
 O 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.640
 Elton 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:35.149
 by lapse 76% chance day to target 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.820
 reckless 50% chance of failure and 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.140
 this is not an acceptable way to 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.820
 get to workout 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.210
 even the best players of the moment 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.610
 they make mistakes and they risk a lot 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.239
 after all are only human but 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.540
 If it were not for you, I will present the future. 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.390
 our krones taken from 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.030
 perfect decision guaranteed results 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.649
 this is what the people who is football 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.440
 forever changed the story before the 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.200
 starting but now he will overthrow the 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.300
 remember sp rock vote for flowers 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.070
 got into the head that pv is now 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.920
 being replaced 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.960
 who did not stop other on campus they put 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.510
 viton football I do not know if the camera 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.170
 this last time we will see Christian 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.050
 ronaldo 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.100
 the question now is whether this is the order in 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.100
 phenomenal football 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.670
 The owner of basketball is not what 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.830
 a ready to leave the fcp mall that the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.380
 football is an unpredictable business joel 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.090
 santana I know what you think 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.440
 happened with the selected leaves you want 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.660
 say what they are doing and where 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.640
 it is now who I am indeed 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.270
 improve and I'm nothing 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.270
 I mistake 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.250
 the manager knows this 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.270
 So let's guess the same thing in the week. 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.930
 past realizing that you do not 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.930
 permanent 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:32.819
 bye, bye, lake slaton hours 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.120
 lake ii happened because everyone 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.319
 here to prove they are wrong 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.319
 to save football 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.150
 I liked what you did in this place. 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.430
 game that we the hand is dying 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.269
 Tonys are breaking up with him. 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.190
 we must say that he is sorry but 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.690
 already endure these we want to end 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.209
 with the plans but they are invincible 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.849
 No one agrees that they agree. 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.269
 can be defeated but you 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.500
 can do today what all of you say 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.450
 together 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.599
 remember what makes you 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.450
 you better not be afraid to risk 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.670
 You play like it's a game. 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.430
 play like a nail you play 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.430
 risk everything to win everything 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:26.540
 there is no greater risk than playing without 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.250
 To risk is official the originals are of 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.230
 returns and bonus challenges for 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.080
 chocolates fruit is fine and that goes 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.860
 leave football forever 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.440
 the question is how has it been 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.120
 remade this is the stage of most 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.280
 of the planet the whole world is 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.600
 watching who scored first won 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.600
 second chance 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.040
 Leave me this beautiful 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.260
 ae 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:16.280
 there is no greater risk than playing without 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.280
 It was because this 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.060
 now I'm passing 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.870
 It's not that way, it's very easy. 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.870
 jaime rocha 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.979
