how many gallons have gone through it

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.989 
how many gallons have gone through it
and<00:00:33.179> you<00:00:33.269> set<00:00:33.510> how<00:00:34.260> many<00:00:34.320> gallons<00:00:35.719> your<00:00:37.999> resin

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:38.999 
and you set how many gallons your resin

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:41.810 
and you set how many gallons your resin
load<00:00:39.179> and<00:00:40.019> tank<00:00:40.800> before<00:00:41.039> it<00:00:41.249> needs<00:00:41.429> to<00:00:41.640> be

error or fudge factor and you set it

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.149 
error or fudge factor and you set it
there<00:00:47.359> at<00:00:48.359> that<00:00:48.539> dial<00:00:48.839> that's<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.620> now<00:00:49.739> rotates

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
there at that dial that's it now rotates

there at that dial that's it now rotates
through<00:00:50.399> takes<00:00:51.179> over<00:00:51.480> runs<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.929> reagent<00:00:52.260> cycle

through takes over runs a reagent cycle

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.979 
through takes over runs a reagent cycle
you<00:00:53.730> figure<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.239> fudge<00:00:54.390> factor<00:00:54.420> because<00:00:54.870> it

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
you figure the fudge factor because it

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.660 
you figure the fudge factor because it
then<00:00:55.079> run<00:00:55.319> in<00:00:55.499> the<00:00:55.890> regions<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.370> will<00:00:56.519> tell

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
then run in the regions like will tell

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.799 
then run in the regions like will tell
about<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.909> 2<00:00:57.059> a.m.

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
about the 2 a.m.

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.369 
about the 2 a.m.
so<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.440> trigger<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.829> go<00:00:58.949> off<00:00:59.210> yes<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:01.199> hit

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
so it's trigger to go off yes you hit

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.890 
so it's trigger to go off yes you hit
the<00:01:01.499> number<00:01:01.769> there<00:01:01.949> really<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:05.750> still<00:01:06.750> have

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the number there really so I still have

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.870 
the number there really so I still have
the<00:01:06.930> original<00:01:07.110> brine<00:01:07.680> tank<00:01:09.860> horses<00:01:10.880> still

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
the original brine tank horses still

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.290 
the original brine tank horses still
have<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.090> rainsoft<00:01:12.570> name<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.140> brine<00:01:13.380> tank

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
have the rainsoft name on the brine tank

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.300 
have the rainsoft name on the brine tank
but<00:01:15.300> you<00:01:15.420> got<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.720> replace<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:19.100> little<00:01:20.100> pick

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
through it together down there you leave

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.740 
through it together down there you leave
it<00:02:15.070> free<00:02:15.310> standing<00:02:15.670> up<00:02:15.760> here<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.270> seals

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
with a oh rain into the base my big deal

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.480 
with a oh rain into the base my big deal
so<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.890> got<00:02:24.670> some<00:02:24.880> test<00:02:25.180> strips<00:02:26.490> probably

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
so I got some test strips probably

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.370 
so I got some test strips probably
should<00:02:27.610> get<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.790> full-blown<00:02:28.630> kit<00:02:28.960> then<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.230> got

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
should get a full-blown kit then I got

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.930 
should get a full-blown kit then I got
some<00:02:29.590> test<00:02:29.830> strips<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.250> set<00:02:30.430> everything<00:02:30.820> on

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
some test strips and set everything on

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.160 
some test strips and set everything on
this<00:02:31.120> initially<00:02:31.690> according<00:02:32.080> the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
this initially according the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.240 
this initially according the
instructions<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:34.420> know<00:02:34.480> like<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.930> other

shake them up soft and water should have
more<00:02:51.580> bubbles<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:52.180> didn't<00:02:52.600> get<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:52.900> with<00:02:53.110> the

more bubbles I didn't get that with the

other resins
I<00:02:53.830> get<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.310> when<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.520> run<00:02:54.790> these<00:02:55.000> resins<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:55.950> it's

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
I get it when I run these resins so it's

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.620 
I get it when I run these resins so it's
encouraging<00:02:57.250> that<00:02:57.610> it<00:02:57.760> everything<00:02:58.420> just

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
encouraging that it everything just

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.470 
encouraging that it everything just
needed<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.020> happen<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.590> other<00:03:00.180> grain<00:03:01.180> soft

it<00:03:05.350> that<00:03:05.380> were<00:03:05.920> broken<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.820> we're<00:03:06.970> gonna

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
it that were broken that we're gonna

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.050 
it that were broken that we're gonna
need<00:03:07.270> repair<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.800> I<00:03:08.890> just<00:03:09.130> thought<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:10.030> know

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
need repair and I just thought you know

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.590 
need repair and I just thought you know
I<00:03:10.950> could<00:03:11.950> probably<00:03:12.100> go<00:03:12.550> to<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.970> dealer<00:03:13.330> and

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
I could probably go to the dealer and

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.380 
I could probably go to the dealer and
get<00:03:14.020> it<00:03:14.170> you're<00:03:14.800> probably<00:03:14.950> jb<00:03:15.610> weld<00:03:15.820> so<00:03:16.180> move

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
get it you're probably jb weld so move

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.640 
get it you're probably jb weld so move
it<00:03:16.540> back<00:03:16.720> together<00:03:17.130> or<00:03:18.130> find<00:03:18.400> it<00:03:18.580> wherever

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
it back together or find it wherever

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.420 
it back together or find it wherever
probably<00:03:20.650> could<00:03:20.770> have<00:03:20.860> fixed<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.280> head<00:03:22.170> but

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
probably could have fixed the head but

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.590 
probably could have fixed the head but
sort<00:03:24.430> of<00:03:24.550> when<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:24.910> many<00:03:25.120> things<00:03:25.360> start

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
sort of when that many things start

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.330 
sort of when that many things start
going<00:03:25.690> wrong<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:26.260> be<00:03:26.410> it's<00:03:26.560> just<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:26.890> sign<00:03:27.310> of

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
going wrong to be it's just a sign of

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.170 
going wrong to be it's just a sign of
things<00:03:27.520> to<00:03:27.850> come

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
things to come

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:35.240
