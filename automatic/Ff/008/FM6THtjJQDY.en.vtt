00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.330 
type of first team site and the youth
team<00:02:10.030> side<00:02:10.300> yeah<00:02:10.860> you've<00:02:11.860> played<00:02:12.040> for<00:02:12.250> the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
first team but obviously you still have

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.630 
first team but obviously you still have
to<00:02:13.959> be<00:02:14.080> in<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.620> side<00:02:14.860> there's<00:02:15.280> any<00:02:15.430> way<00:02:15.520> they

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
to be in that side there's any way they

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.220 
to be in that side there's any way they
haven't<00:02:15.819> gone<00:02:15.910> across<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.630> there<00:02:16.810> ever<00:02:17.050> a

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
haven't gone across and is there ever a

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.020 
haven't gone across and is there ever a
bit<00:02:17.380> of<00:02:17.440> banter<00:02:17.620> going<00:02:17.770> on<00:02:18.040> over<00:02:18.310> there<00:02:18.430> over

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
bit of banter going on over there over

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.090 
bit of banter going on over there over
the<00:02:19.120> divide<00:02:19.390> I<00:02:19.690> think<00:02:20.410> when<00:02:20.530> they<00:02:20.680> first<00:02:20.920> put

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
the divide I think when they first put

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.520 
the divide I think when they first put
the<00:02:21.310> divider<00:02:21.640> up<00:02:21.880> I<00:02:22.090> had<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.360> few<00:02:22.660> people<00:02:22.870> say<00:02:23.319> in

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
the divider up I had a few people say in

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.949 
the divider up I had a few people say in
our<00:02:23.739> what<00:02:24.370> side<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:24.850> gonna<00:02:25.060> eat<00:02:25.270> honey<00:02:25.540> and

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
our what side you gonna eat honey and

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.559 
our what side you gonna eat honey and
all<00:02:26.739> of<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:26.950> but<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.910> be<00:02:27.940> fair<00:02:28.209> there's<00:02:28.360> not

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
all of that but to be fair there's not

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.070 
all of that but to be fair there's not
really<00:02:28.720> anything<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.620> just<00:02:29.970> obviously

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
really anything to it I just obviously

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.080 
really anything to it I just obviously
the<00:02:32.080> twenty<00:02:32.440> ones<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.890> I've<00:02:33.489> grown<00:02:33.670> up<00:02:33.910> with

bit a uni will move the divide but it's
just<00:03:03.790> I<00:03:04.030> guess<00:03:04.510> when<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:04.989> do<00:03:05.170> make<00:03:05.380> that<00:03:05.650> jump

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
just I guess when you do make that jump

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.440 
just I guess when you do make that jump
in<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.069> first<00:03:06.280> team<00:03:06.459> then<00:03:06.610> that's<00:03:07.239> another

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
in the first team then that's another

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.030 
in the first team then that's another
thing<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:07.870> get<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.049> do<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.380> get<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.709> me<00:03:08.920> that

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
thing you get to do you get to me that

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.890 
thing you get to do you get to me that
jump<00:03:09.280> over<00:03:09.519> to<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.700> others<00:03:09.940> head<00:03:10.150> with<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
jump over to the others head with the

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:19.520 
jump over to the others head with the
word

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
it was a good experience but it was

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.820 
it was a good experience but it was
difficult<00:04:34.270> at<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.690> same<00:04:34.870> time<00:04:35.140> because<00:04:35.560> I

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
difficult at the same time because I

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.730 
difficult at the same time because I
didn't<00:04:36.700> get<00:04:36.790> much<00:04:36.940> game<00:04:37.210> time<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:38.410> it<00:04:38.650> was

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
didn't get much game time and it was

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.000 
didn't get much game time and it was
just<00:04:39.390> it<00:04:40.390> was<00:04:40.450> a<00:04:40.570> bit<00:04:40.750> frustrating<00:04:41.380> being

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
just it was a bit frustrating being

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.980 
just it was a bit frustrating being
there<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.490> getting<00:04:43.390> to<00:04:43.510> see<00:04:43.720> what<00:04:43.900> these

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
there and getting to see what these

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.840 
there and getting to see what these
games<00:04:44.229> take<00:04:44.560> place<00:04:44.800> but<00:04:45.070> not<00:04:45.310> being<00:04:45.490> able<00:04:45.669> to

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
games take place but not being able to

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.510 
games take place but not being able to
play<00:04:46.090> in<00:04:46.240> them<00:04:46.390> and<00:04:46.830> in<00:04:47.830> my<00:04:48.070> opinion<00:04:48.400> I<00:04:48.490> believe

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
play in them and in my opinion I believe

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.550 
play in them and in my opinion I believe
that<00:04:48.940> I<00:04:48.970> was<00:04:49.030> ready<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.360> play<00:04:49.600> but<00:04:49.990> it<00:04:50.320> might

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
that I was ready to play but it might

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.360 
that I was ready to play but it might
just<00:04:50.740> not<00:04:50.830> have<00:04:51.010> been<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.220> right<00:04:51.250> time

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
just not have been the right time

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.640 
just not have been the right time
because<00:04:51.820> we<00:04:52.270> at<00:04:52.720> first<00:04:53.050> were<00:04:53.169> on<00:04:53.320> a<00:04:53.350> winning

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
because we at first were on a winning

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.870 
because we at first were on a winning
streak<00:04:53.680> so<00:04:54.010> it's<00:04:54.130> hard<00:04:54.310> for<00:04:54.400> them<00:04:54.490> to<00:04:54.550> put<00:04:54.760> me

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
streak so it's hard for them to put me

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.070 
streak so it's hard for them to put me
in<00:04:54.970> a<00:04:55.030> team<00:04:55.180> then<00:04:55.419> we<00:04:55.570> went<00:04:55.660> on<00:04:55.810> a<00:04:55.840> losing

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
in a team then we went on a losing

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.469 
in a team then we went on a losing
streak<00:04:56.290> and<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:56.770> manager<00:04:57.729> was<00:04:57.880> nervous<00:04:58.330> he

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
streak and the manager was nervous he

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.210 
streak and the manager was nervous he
didn't<00:04:58.780> think<00:04:58.900> we<00:04:59.260> were<00:04:59.740> going<00:04:59.890> to<00:05:00.040> stay<00:05:00.190> up

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
didn't think we were going to stay up

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.020 
didn't think we were going to stay up
you<00:05:00.520> know<00:05:00.640> so<00:05:01.180> I<00:05:01.570> can't<00:05:02.080> I<00:05:02.260> can't<00:05:02.590> blame<00:05:03.030> the

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
you know so I can't I can't blame the

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.110 
you know so I can't I can't blame the
manager<00:05:04.360> for<00:05:04.540> that<00:05:04.690> at<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.260> time<00:05:05.470> but

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
manager for that at the time but

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.390 
manager for that at the time but
when<00:05:07.810> I<00:05:07.840> was<00:05:08.110> in<00:05:08.350> that<00:05:08.470> situation<00:05:08.620> I<00:05:09.010> just<00:05:09.040> felt

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
when I was in that situation I just felt

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.520 
when I was in that situation I just felt
a<00:05:09.460> bit<00:05:09.580> stressed<00:05:09.910> out<00:05:10.090> and<00:05:10.210> a<00:05:10.300> bit<00:05:10.480> just<00:05:11.320> to<00:05:11.410> be

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
anxious to get playing but it was also a

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.689 
anxious to get playing but it was also a
good<00:05:13.780> experience<00:05:14.260> because<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:15.280> level
