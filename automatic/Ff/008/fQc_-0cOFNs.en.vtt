it<00:00:00.149> was<00:00:00.240> just<00:00:00.390> about<00:00:00.570> one<00:00:00.780> or<00:00:00.870> two<00:00:01.020> frames<00:00:01.260> here

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
it was just about one or two frames here

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.290 
it was just about one or two frames here
and<00:00:01.680> there<00:00:01.800> in<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:01.979> end<00:00:02.100> wasn't<00:00:02.250> yeah<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.000> think

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
and there in the end wasn't yeah I think

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.079 
and there in the end wasn't yeah I think
at<00:00:04.170> five<00:00:04.440> three<00:00:04.710> it<00:00:04.830> was<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.430> really<00:00:05.819> good<00:00:05.910> lead

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
at five three it was a really good lead

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.660 
at five three it was a really good lead
to<00:00:06.210> have<00:00:06.830> yeah<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:07.859> thought<00:00:08.040> both<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.280> us<00:00:08.460> played

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
to have yeah I thought both of us played

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.370 
to have yeah I thought both of us played
quite<00:00:08.849> well<00:00:09.059> in<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.210> first<00:00:09.450> session<00:00:09.660> and

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
quite well in the first session and

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.549 
quite well in the first session and
today<00:00:11.190> I've<00:00:11.309> came<00:00:11.519> out<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.730> was<00:00:11.940> probably<00:00:12.090> just

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
today I've came out I was probably just

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.400 
today I've came out I was probably just
played<00:00:13.559> way<00:00:13.740> too<00:00:13.799> slow<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.519> feel<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.139> middle

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
played way too slow I feel in the middle

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.880 
played way too slow I feel in the middle
session<00:00:16.740> there<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.160> he<00:00:17.430> kind<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.650> they<00:00:19.650> didn't

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
session there and he kind of they didn't

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.010 
session there and he kind of they didn't
play<00:00:20.160> probably<00:00:20.910> as<00:00:20.970> well<00:00:21.119> against<00:00:21.750> Williams

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
play probably as well against Williams

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.830 
play probably as well against Williams
he<00:00:22.140> looked<00:00:22.320> as<00:00:22.529> good<00:00:23.210> and<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.510> know<00:00:24.600> sometimes

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
he looked as good and you know sometimes

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.330 
he looked as good and you know sometimes
that<00:00:25.109> can<00:00:25.230> be<00:00:25.350> hard<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.650> play<00:00:25.890> against<00:00:26.220> when

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
that can be hard to play against when

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.470 
that can be hard to play against when
you're<00:00:26.430> sitting<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:26.760> your<00:00:26.789> seat<00:00:27.060> for<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.269> couple

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
you're sitting in your seat for a couple

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.830 
you're sitting in your seat for a couple
of<00:00:27.570> frames<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.500> just<00:00:29.220> felt<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:30.000> just

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
of frames and I just felt that I just

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.450 
of frames and I just felt that I just
couldn't<00:00:31.140> get<00:00:31.230> going<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.650> played<00:00:32.219> way<00:00:32.399> too

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
couldn't get going and I played way too

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.250 
couldn't get going and I played way too
slow<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.850> really<00:00:33.210> sort<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.450> Bob<00:00:33.630> myself<00:00:34.020> down<00:00:34.230> I

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
slow I really sort of Bob myself down I

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.410 
slow I really sort of Bob myself down I
I<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:35.130> couldn't<00:00:35.489> get<00:00:35.550> any<00:00:35.700> rhythm<00:00:35.910> going<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
I just couldn't get any rhythm going and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.720 
I just couldn't get any rhythm going and
you<00:00:37.380> know<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.070> tonight<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.340> sort<00:00:38.700> of

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
you know and and tonight I sort of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.479 
you know and and tonight I sort of
started<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.149> similar<00:00:39.360> kind<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.840> way<00:00:40.219> it<00:00:41.219> wasn't

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
started a similar kind of way it wasn't

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.040 
started a similar kind of way it wasn't
until<00:00:41.730> sort<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.059> 12-egg<00:00:42.510> where<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.899> hit

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
until sort of 12-egg where just hit

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.930 
until sort of 12-egg where just hit
himself<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.590> got<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:44.340> play<00:00:44.610> quicker

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
himself I just got a just play quicker

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.369 
himself I just got a just play quicker
you<00:00:45.239> know<00:00:45.329> when<00:00:45.600> I'd<00:00:45.690> get<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> chance<00:00:45.960> play

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
you know when I'd get a chance play

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.290 
you know when I'd get a chance play
quicker<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.370> know<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.460> look<00:00:47.610> great<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.059> 12

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
quicker and you know I look great to 12

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.569 
quicker and you know I look great to 12
10<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.079> know<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> little<00:00:49.860> bit<00:00:50.010> stiff<00:00:50.219> click

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
10 and you know a little bit stiff click

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.069 
10 and you know a little bit stiff click
on<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.760> black<00:00:50.940> bear<00:00:51.149> position<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> next

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
on the black bear position on the next

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.740 
on the black bear position on the next
red<00:00:52.699> 1210<00:00:53.699> where<00:00:53.910> possibly<00:00:54.420> could<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.690> gone

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
red 1210 where possibly could have gone

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.709 
red 1210 where possibly could have gone
12<00:00:55.020> 11<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.610> yeah<00:00:56.610> but<00:00:56.820> I'll<00:00:57.149> probably<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.600> to

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
12 11 so yeah but I'll probably have to

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.599 
12 11 so yeah but I'll probably have to
put<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.079> down<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.770> know<00:00:58.859> Ronnie<00:00:59.129> he<00:00:59.370> he

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
put that down to you know Ronnie he he

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.660 
put that down to you know Ronnie he he
played<00:01:00.289> yeah<00:01:01.289> he<00:01:01.620> looks<00:01:01.800> really<00:01:02.010> good<00:01:02.219> during

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
played yeah he looks really good during

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.740 
played yeah he looks really good during
the<00:01:02.699> match<00:01:02.879> he<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:03.120> obviously<00:01:03.300> play<00:01:03.480> better

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the match he can obviously play better

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.410 
the match he can obviously play better
but<00:01:04.049> yeah<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.949> think<00:01:05.070> yeah<00:01:05.970> he's<00:01:06.060> definitely

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
but yeah I think yeah he's definitely

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.050 
but yeah I think yeah he's definitely
the<00:01:06.479> man<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.750> beat<00:01:06.900> now<00:01:07.110> yeah<00:01:07.860> 10<00:01:08.130> 8<00:01:08.280> as<00:01:08.460> well<00:01:08.729> I

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the man to beat now yeah 10 8 as well I

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.240 
the man to beat now yeah 10 8 as well I
mean<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> margins<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.200> these<00:01:10.350> games<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:11.070> so

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
mean the margins and these games are so

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.770 
mean the margins and these games are so
fine<00:01:11.520> are<00:01:11.729> they<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> break<00:01:12.630> of

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
fine are they you are in on the break of

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.230 
fine are they you are in on the break of
44<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.290> think<00:01:13.650> yeah<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.369> slightly<00:01:14.729> tricky

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
44 I think yeah it's slightly tricky

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.730 
44 I think yeah it's slightly tricky
black<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.720> was<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:15.900> its<00:01:16.049> spot<00:01:16.290> but<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.650> was

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
black and it was on its spot but it was

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.320 
black and it was on its spot but it was
miscible<00:01:17.159> under<00:01:17.340> pressure<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.820> then<00:01:17.909> you

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
miscible under pressure and then you

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.999 
miscible under pressure and then you
know<00:01:18.450> that's<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.780> difference<00:01:18.900> between<00:01:19.170> 10<00:01:19.770> 9

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
know that's the difference between 10 9

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.760 
know that's the difference between 10 9
and<00:01:20.220> 11<00:01:20.280> 8<00:01:20.640> yeah<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.869> was<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> prime<00:01:22.290> example<00:01:22.320> I

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
and 11 8 yeah that was a prime example I

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.109 
and 11 8 yeah that was a prime example I
just<00:01:22.920> took<00:01:23.040> too<00:01:23.220> long<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.759> know<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.909> knew

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
just took too long on it you know I knew

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.940 
just took too long on it you know I knew
what<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.330> shot<00:01:24.509> was<00:01:24.659> straightaway<00:01:25.170> but<00:01:25.229> you

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
what the shot was straightaway but you

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.660 
what the shot was straightaway but you
know<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.040> started<00:01:26.310> looking<00:01:26.549> at<00:01:26.610> different

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
know I started looking at different

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.550 
know I started looking at different
options<00:01:26.939> as<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> way<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> play<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.470> way

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
options as a way to play it and the way

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.710 
options as a way to play it and the way
I<00:01:28.590> played<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.009> was<00:01:29.130> was<00:01:29.640> probably<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:30.630> that

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
I played it was was probably one that

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.319 
I played it was was probably one that
I've<00:01:30.840> even<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.409> playing<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.329> just

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
I've even think of playing so just

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.819 
I've even think of playing so just
something<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.630> learn<00:01:33.720> from<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.380> know<00:01:34.500> just

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
something to learn from you know just

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.590 
something to learn from you know just
just<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.549> go<00:01:35.729> see<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> shot<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.329> got<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
just you go see the shot you just got to

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.910 
just you go see the shot you just got to
play<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.020> know<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.560> dawdle<00:01:37.770> around

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
play it you know if you dawdle around

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.010 
play it you know if you dawdle around
and<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.549> bog<00:01:39.210> yourself<00:01:39.509> down<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.930> know

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
and and bog yourself down you know

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.090 
and and bog yourself down you know
especially<00:01:40.200> against<00:01:40.590> running<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.040> you

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
especially against running you know you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.289 
especially against running you know you
don't<00:01:41.430> really<00:01:41.579> sort<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:41.970> too<00:01:42.150> many

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
don't really sort of get too many

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.670 
don't really sort of get too many
opportunities<00:01:42.540> together<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.170> get<00:01:43.259> back<00:01:43.439> into

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
opportunities together to get back into

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.100 
opportunities together to get back into
a<00:01:43.710> match<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.549> huge<00:01:44.909> mutual<00:01:45.420> respect<00:01:45.780> that's

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
a match this huge mutual respect that's

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.910 
a match this huge mutual respect that's
obvious

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
obvious

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.590 
obvious
O'Sullivan<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.670> thought<00:01:47.909> was<00:01:48.060> quite<00:01:48.180> sensitive

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
O'Sullivan I thought was quite sensitive

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.240 
O'Sullivan I thought was quite sensitive
in<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> first<00:01:49.079> session<00:01:49.320> he<00:01:49.500> was<00:01:49.649> very<00:01:49.890> aware

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
in the first session he was very aware

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.550 
in the first session he was very aware
of<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.729> threat<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.149> posed<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.259> guess<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
of the threat you posed and I guess the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.230 
of the threat you posed and I guess the
way<00:01:52.710> he<00:01:52.829> came<00:01:53.009> out<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.310> afternoon<00:01:53.820> all<00:01:54.000> guns

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
way he came out this afternoon all guns

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.359 
way he came out this afternoon all guns
blazing<00:01:54.810> he<00:01:54.899> kind<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.170> had<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.439> do<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.740> yeah

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
blazing he kind of had to do that yeah

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.249 
blazing he kind of had to do that yeah
he<00:01:56.520> played<00:01:56.700> quite<00:01:56.880> aggressive<00:01:57.270> today<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:58.079> guess

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
he played quite aggressive today I guess

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.179 
he played quite aggressive today I guess
that's<00:01:58.439> probably<00:01:58.590> what<00:01:58.799> caught<00:01:58.950> me<00:01:59.070> off<00:01:59.159> guard

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
that's probably what caught me off guard

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.639 
that's probably what caught me off guard
a<00:01:59.460> bit<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.640> think<00:01:59.840> yeah<00:02:00.840> when<00:02:00.990> he<00:02:01.049> does<00:02:01.229> play<00:02:01.439> me

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
a bit I think yeah when he does play me

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.050 
a bit I think yeah when he does play me
usually<00:02:01.890> he<00:02:02.130> does<00:02:02.310> sort<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.610> sit<00:02:02.729> back<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.909> he

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
usually he does sort of sit back and he

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.539 
usually he does sort of sit back and he
tries<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.270> play<00:02:03.540> really<00:02:03.689> good<00:02:03.780> safety<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.549> you

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
tries to play really good safety and you

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.770 
tries to play really good safety and you
know<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.820> was<00:02:05.969> sort<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.149> me<00:02:06.299> making<00:02:06.659> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
know it was sort of me making the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.779 
know it was sort of me making the
mistakes<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.590> leaving<00:02:07.890> him<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
mistakes and leaving him in in the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.999 
mistakes and leaving him in in the
afternoon<00:02:08.970> session<00:02:09.739> where<00:02:10.739> it's<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.890> other

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
afternoon session where it's the other

against<00:03:35.340> Ryan<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:36.209> think<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:39.109> yeah<00:03:40.109> I<00:03:40.470> think

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
against Ryan I think that yeah I think

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.530 
against Ryan I think that yeah I think
that<00:03:40.889> Matthew<00:03:41.190> will<00:03:41.310> have<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.209> go<00:03:42.299> on<00:03:42.329> with<00:03:42.510> it

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
that Matthew will have to go on with it

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.180 
that Matthew will have to go on with it
and<00:03:42.690> score<00:03:42.930> quickly<00:03:43.169> as<00:03:43.380> well<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.709> won't<00:03:44.010> be

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
and score quickly as well you won't be

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.559 
and score quickly as well you won't be
able<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.400> outplay<00:03:44.700> Ronnie<00:03:45.000> in<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.209> safety

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
able to outplay Ronnie in the safety

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.009 
able to outplay Ronnie in the safety
department<00:03:46.109> or<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:47.340> know<00:03:47.750> that's<00:03:48.750> probably

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
department or you know that's probably

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.509 
department or you know that's probably
my<00:03:49.169> only<00:03:49.290> fear<00:03:49.530> for<00:03:49.709> Matthews<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.400> if

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
my only fear for Matthews is that if

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:51.949 
my only fear for Matthews is that if
Ronnie<00:03:50.760> gets<00:03:51.000> off<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.299> good<00:03:51.419> start<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.870> just

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
Ronnie gets off to a good start and just

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.470 
Ronnie gets off to a good start and just
pulls<00:03:52.260> away<00:03:52.639> not<00:03:53.639> too<00:03:53.790> sure<00:03:53.940> if<00:03:54.030> Matthews<00:03:54.359> got

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
pulls away not too sure if Matthews got

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.770 
pulls away not too sure if Matthews got
the<00:03:54.599> game<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:55.019> sort<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.590> really<00:03:55.799> pull<00:03:56.069> him<00:03:56.190> back

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
the game to sort of really pull him back

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.750 
the game to sort of really pull him back
Matthews<00:03:57.780> more<00:03:58.019> of<00:03:58.109> a<00:03:58.230> more<00:03:59.010> tactical<00:03:59.370> player

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
Matthews more of a more tactical player

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.670 
Matthews more of a more tactical player
these<00:04:00.000> days<00:04:00.269> compared<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:00.989> how<00:04:01.169> he<00:04:01.230> was<00:04:01.440> sort

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680
