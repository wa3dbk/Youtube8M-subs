bit<00:00:34.559> easier<00:00:34.710> but<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.040> don't<00:00:35.280> know<00:00:35.520> if<00:00:35.670> I

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
bit easier but I don't know if I

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.330 
bit easier but I don't know if I
recommend<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.270> necessarily<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:38.129> need

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
recommend that necessarily you do need

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.610 
recommend that necessarily you do need
to<00:00:38.460> get<00:00:38.610> minimum<00:00:39.090> two<00:00:39.360> guys<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.290> section

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
to get minimum two guys in this section

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.650 
to get minimum two guys in this section
and<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.579> can<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> little<00:00:42.120> tricky<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.420> get

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
and it can be a little tricky to get

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.810 
and it can be a little tricky to get
them<00:00:42.960> both<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> water<00:00:43.800> because<00:00:44.129> sometimes

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
them both in the water because sometimes

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.310 
them both in the water because sometimes
you'll<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.329> one<00:00:45.629> enemy<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> water

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you'll just have one enemy in the water

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.350 
you'll just have one enemy in the water
and<00:00:46.500> other<00:00:46.620> times<00:00:46.920> your<00:00:47.370> ally<00:00:47.850> will<00:00:48.090> shoot

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and other times your ally will shoot

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.080 
and other times your ally will shoot
them<00:00:48.600> down<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.110> they'll<00:00:49.620> die<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:50.969> make

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
them down and they'll die so just make

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.580 
them down and they'll die so just make
sure<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.360> grab<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.570> whole<00:00:51.840> bunch<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.140> air<00:00:52.379> in
