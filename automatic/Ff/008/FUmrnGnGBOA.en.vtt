00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.369 
stretched beyond belief so I am back on
HCG<00:00:41.280> because<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.329> truly<00:00:42.510> believe<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.110> its

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
HCG because I truly believe in its

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.410 
HCG because I truly believe in its
success<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.789> ability<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.360> you

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
success and it's the ability that you

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.200 
success and it's the ability that you
could<00:00:45.600> lose<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:45.960> much<00:00:46.079> weight<00:00:46.140> using<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.850> i

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
could lose so much weight using it so i

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.060 
could lose so much weight using it so i
have<00:00:48.510> about<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.320> would<00:00:49.950> say<00:00:50.329> 55<00:00:51.329> pounds<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:53.039> I

the<00:00:55.440> help<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.680> HCG<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.640> would<00:00:56.789> be

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
the help of HCG that this would be

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.380 
the help of HCG that this would be
