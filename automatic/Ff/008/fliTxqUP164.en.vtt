I don't have the box anymore but this is
what<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.650> package<00:00:23.039> looks<00:00:23.070> like<00:00:24.320> it<00:00:25.320> says<00:00:25.529> Rit

dye on it it's kind of hard to see but I
ripped<00:00:29.369> off<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.730> side<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.150> probably

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
ripped off the side so you probably

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.780 
ripped off the side so you probably
can't<00:00:30.660> see<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.040> anyway<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.489> stuff

you<00:00:32.969> need<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.180> Dyer<00:00:33.540> wheels<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.590> comes<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
you need to Dyer wheels it comes in a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.819 
you need to Dyer wheels it comes in a
variety<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.579> colors<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.239> got<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:37.020> at<00:00:37.380> a

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
variety of colors I got this at a

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.080 
variety of colors I got this at a
hardware<00:00:38.670> store<00:00:39.020> which<00:00:40.020> i<00:00:40.559> think<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.520> under

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
hardware store which i think is under

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.770 
hardware store which i think is under
five<00:00:42.300> dollars

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
five dollars

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.690 
five dollars
but<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.590> should<00:00:43.800> be<00:00:43.950> able<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.190> buy<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.399> online

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
but you should be able to buy it online

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.139 
but you should be able to buy it online
my<00:00:45.480> suggestion<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:47.280> get<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
my suggestion is that you get like a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.940 
my suggestion is that you get like a
darker<00:00:48.570> color<00:00:48.809> because<00:00:49.320> sometimes<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
darker color because sometimes the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.709 
darker color because sometimes the
lighter<00:00:50.160> colors<00:00:50.579> don't<00:00:50.850> turn<00:00:51.210> out<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.539> well

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
lighter colors don't turn out as well

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.450 
lighter colors don't turn out as well
and<00:00:52.020> your<00:00:52.469> wheels<00:00:52.710> would<00:00:52.980> look<00:00:53.160> kind<00:00:53.370> of

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
and your wheels would look kind of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.119 
and your wheels would look kind of
begging<00:00:53.910> once<00:00:54.420> they're<00:00:54.719> like<00:00:55.170> all<00:00:55.410> colored<00:00:55.770> so

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
begging once they're like all colored so

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.599 
begging once they're like all colored so
go<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> darker<00:00:57.690> shade<00:00:58.020> if<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.129> want<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
go for a darker shade if you want the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.240 
go for a darker shade if you want the
colors<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.120> your<00:01:00.210> wheel<00:01:00.390> swaps<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.649> optional

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
colors of your wheel swaps is optional

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.650 
colors of your wheel swaps is optional
but<00:01:02.640> another<00:01:02.910> thing<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.270> might<00:01:03.420> want<00:01:03.600> to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
but another thing you might want to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.870 
but another thing you might want to
consider<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.290> having<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.220> little<00:01:05.489> strainer

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
consider is having a little strainer

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.140 
consider is having a little strainer
here<00:01:06.510> because<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:08.220> dye<00:01:08.520> your<00:01:08.670> wheels<00:01:08.909> you're

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
here because we dye your wheels you're

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.109 
here because we dye your wheels you're
gonna<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.600> them<00:01:09.750> inside<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.290> pot<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.119> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
gonna have them inside the pot and the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.000 
gonna have them inside the pot and the
strainer<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.720> basically<00:01:13.049> allows<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.650> to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
strainer just basically allows you to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070 
strainer just basically allows you to
have<00:01:14.520> something<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.240> monitor<00:01:15.780> where

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
have something to like monitor where

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.719 
have something to like monitor where
your<00:01:16.200> wheels<00:01:16.409> off<00:01:16.740> but<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.400> don't<00:01:17.549> have

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
your wheels off but if you don't have

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.950 
your wheels off but if you don't have
one<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.909> these<00:01:18.030> that's<00:01:18.240> completely<00:01:18.630> fine<00:01:18.900> you

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
one of these that's completely fine you

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.960 
one of these that's completely fine you
can<00:01:19.170> use<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.320> spoon<00:01:19.710> or<00:01:19.920> something<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.820> it's

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
can use a spoon or something but it's

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.130

your wheels obviously

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.630 
your wheels obviously
so<00:01:33.870> before<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.290> start<00:01:34.320> dyeing<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.130> wheels<00:01:35.340> we

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
so before we start dyeing the wheels we

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.390 
so before we start dyeing the wheels we
got<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.940> prepare<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.630> wheels<00:01:36.810> first<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:38.070> take

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
got to prepare the wheels first so take

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.700 
got to prepare the wheels first so take
them<00:01:38.520> off<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.850> your<00:01:39.030> axles<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.170> have<00:01:40.470> them

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
them off of your axles if you have them

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.940 
them off of your axles if you have them
on<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.950> truck<00:01:41.370> or<00:01:41.580> something<00:01:42.500> just<00:01:43.500> basically

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
on a truck or something just basically

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
take the bearings out this is what I do

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.970 
take the bearings out this is what I do
to<00:01:45.630> take<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> bearings<00:01:46.440> out<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.680> double

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
to take the bearings out of double

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:47.720 
to take the bearings out of double
bearing<00:01:47.250> wheels

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
bearing wheels

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.200 
bearing wheels
I<00:01:47.760> put<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> back<00:01:48.840> onto<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.010> axle<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.670> then

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
I put the back onto the axle and then

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.820 
I put the back onto the axle and then
what<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.510> is<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.870> kind<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.290> put<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.650> just

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
what I do is I kind of put it just

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.890 
what I do is I kind of put it just
barely<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.700> then<00:01:54.120> tilt<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> wheel<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
barely on and then tilt the wheel a

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.780 
barely on and then tilt the wheel a
little<00:01:55.080> bit<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:56.130> bearing<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.640> back

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
little bit so the bearing in the back

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.540 
little bit so the bearing in the back
comes<00:01:57.120> right<00:01:57.390> off<00:01:57.650> see<00:01:58.650> there's<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.220> bearing

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
comes right off see there's a bearing

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.130 
comes right off see there's a bearing
right<00:01:59.700> there<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.540> that's<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.810> back<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
right there and that's the back of the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.530 
right there and that's the back of the
wheel<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:04.010> then<00:02:05.010> for<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> front<00:02:05.670> bearing<00:02:06.210> so

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
wheel and then for the front bearing so

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.770 
wheel and then for the front bearing so
I<00:02:06.570> take<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.900> yellow<00:02:07.170> Tech<00:02:07.530> Deck<00:02:07.710> tool<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.690> put<00:02:09.690> it

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
I take a yellow Tech Deck tool I put it

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.040 
I take a yellow Tech Deck tool I put it
at<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.970> back<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.270> wheel<00:02:12.450> where<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.870> other

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
at the back of the wheel where the other

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.800 
at the back of the wheel where the other
bearing<00:02:13.500> used<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.860> be<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:15.060> when<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.330> put<00:02:15.630> the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
bearing used to be so when I put the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.660 
bearing used to be so when I put the
check<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.290> tool<00:02:16.530> in<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:16.950> can<00:02:17.130> basically<00:02:17.280> just

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
check that tool in I can basically just

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.010 
check that tool in I can basically just
push<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.300> bearing<00:02:18.600> out<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.959> front<00:02:19.820> so

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
push the bearing out of the front so

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.230 
push the bearing out of the front so
yeah<00:02:22.020> once<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.380> got<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.070> front<00:02:23.790> then

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
yeah once you got it to the front then

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.180 
yeah once you got it to the front then
you<00:02:24.270> just<00:02:24.540> push<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:24.930> right<00:02:25.080> out<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.590> might<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:26.160> a

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
you just push it right out it might be a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.410 
you just push it right out it might be a
little<00:02:26.340> hard<00:02:26.610> at<00:02:26.700> first<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:27.150> once<00:02:27.269> you

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
little hard at first but once you

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.600 
little hard at first but once you
practice<00:02:27.630> it's<00:02:28.080> totally<00:02:28.769> fine<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.010> yeah

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
practice it's totally fine so yeah

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.850 
practice it's totally fine so yeah
there's<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.000> bearing<00:02:30.269> right<00:02:30.420> there<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:30.900> I'm

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
there's the bearing right there and I'm

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.650 
there's the bearing right there and I'm
just<00:02:32.010> gonna<00:02:32.100> do<00:02:32.370> with<00:02:32.550> this<00:02:32.880> with<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.480> other

just gonna do with this with the other

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.690 
just gonna do with this with the other
wheels<00:02:33.930> then<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.769> will<00:02:34.980> set<00:02:35.220> up<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.430> camera

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
wheels then I will set up the camera

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.610 
wheels then I will set up the camera

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
and I have my candy wheels without

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.070 
and I have my candy wheels without
bearings<00:02:46.650> inside<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.950> strainer<00:02:48.960> but<00:02:49.960> then

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
bearings inside the strainer but then

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.530 
bearings inside the strainer but then
now<00:02:50.320> it'll<00:02:50.590> be<00:02:50.650> on<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.890> new<00:02:51.010> oops<00:02:51.280> no<00:02:52.120> we<00:02:52.390> gotta

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
now it'll be on the new oops no we gotta

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.150 
now it'll be on the new oops no we gotta
do<00:02:52.750> still<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.320> pan<00:02:53.500> up<00:02:53.650> with<00:02:53.830> water

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
do still the pan up with water

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.410 
do still the pan up with water
oh<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.370> don't<00:02:54.640> want<00:02:54.820> to<00:02:54.880> fill<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.120> up<00:02:55.210> all<00:02:55.390> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
oh you don't want to fill it up all the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.540 
oh you don't want to fill it up all the
way<00:02:55.510> because<00:02:55.840> your<00:02:56.290> wheels<00:02:56.560> are<00:02:56.950> not<00:02:57.220> going<00:02:57.490> to

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
way because your wheels are not going to

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.700 
way because your wheels are not going to
need<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.880> much<00:02:58.030> died<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.810> sit<00:02:59.020> in<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.500> what

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
need that much died to sit in so what

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.740 
need that much died to sit in so what
you're<00:02:59.860> going<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.010> do<00:03:00.160> is<00:03:00.580> basically<00:03:01.330> just

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
you're going to do is basically just

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.680 
you're going to do is basically just
fill<00:03:01.960> it<00:03:02.050> up<00:03:02.140> I'd<00:03:02.470> say<00:03:02.700> less<00:03:03.700> than<00:03:03.730> maybe<00:03:04.480> two

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
fill it up I'd say less than maybe two

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.380 
fill it up I'd say less than maybe two
cups<00:03:04.990> it's<00:03:05.920> really<00:03:06.130> not<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.490> much<00:03:06.670> water<00:03:07.090> so

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
cups it's really not that much water so

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.910 
cups it's really not that much water so
you<00:03:07.720> don't<00:03:07.900> need<00:03:07.960> to<00:03:08.050> worry<00:03:08.230> about<00:03:08.320> how<00:03:08.860> much

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
you don't need to worry about how much

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.470 
you don't need to worry about how much
water<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:09.520> how<00:03:09.640> much<00:03:09.700> dive<00:03:10.110> right<00:03:12.090> in<00:03:13.090> there

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
water and how much dive right in there

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.200 
water and how much dive right in there
I<00:03:13.680> turned<00:03:14.680> my<00:03:15.190> stove<00:03:15.940> on<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:18.130> now<00:03:18.730> what<00:03:18.970> we<00:03:19.090> got

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
I turned my stove on and now what we got

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.230 
I turned my stove on and now what we got
to<00:03:19.330> do<00:03:19.420> is<00:03:19.750> put<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.590> guy<00:03:20.800> inside<00:03:21.520> the<00:03:21.640> pot<00:03:21.820> keep

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
to do is put the guy inside the pot keep

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.970 
to do is put the guy inside the pot keep
in<00:03:22.390> mind<00:03:22.630> when<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:22.960> use<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.380> guy<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.800> don't

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
in mind when you use the guy you don't

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.370 
in mind when you use the guy you don't
need<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.880> use<00:03:25.060> as<00:03:25.420> much<00:03:25.630> as<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:25.960> don't<00:03:26.110> think

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
need to use as much as you don't think

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.460 
need to use as much as you don't think
it's<00:03:27.010> more<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.400> like<00:03:27.760> how<00:03:28.120> long<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.960> wheels<00:03:29.140> in

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
it's more of like how long the wheels in

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.230 
it's more of like how long the wheels in
that's<00:03:29.710> gonna<00:03:29.830> make<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.190> burger<00:03:30.460> it's<00:03:31.060> not

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
that's gonna make the burger it's not

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.330 
that's gonna make the burger it's not
necessarily<00:03:31.870> how<00:03:31.990> much<00:03:32.140> guys<00:03:32.410> put<00:03:35.340> color

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
necessarily how much guys put color

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.300 
necessarily how much guys put color
cloud<00:03:36.670> in<00:03:36.910> nano<00:03:37.270> it's<00:03:37.720> all<00:03:37.810> purple<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:39.250> I'm

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
cloud in nano it's all purple so I'm

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.740 
cloud in nano it's all purple so I'm
going<00:03:39.490> to<00:03:39.580> take<00:03:39.700> my<00:03:39.820> strainer<00:03:40.120> remove<00:03:40.540> the

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
going to take my strainer remove the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.810 
going to take my strainer remove the
wheels<00:03:40.960> just<00:03:41.590> so<00:03:41.740> I<00:03:41.800> can<00:03:41.980> mix<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.310> dye<00:03:42.460> around

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
wheels just so I can mix the dye around

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.300 
wheels just so I can mix the dye around
a<00:03:42.880> little<00:03:42.970> bit<00:03:43.210> so<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.510> guess<00:03:43.690> well<00:03:44.590> distributed

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
a little bit so I guess well distributed

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.290 
a little bit so I guess well distributed
throughout<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:45.790> pan<00:03:47.040> dark<00:03:48.040> rich<00:03:48.610> purple<00:03:49.180> in

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
throughout the pan dark rich purple in

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.930 
throughout the pan dark rich purple in
there<00:03:49.560> someone<00:03:50.560> thought<00:03:50.770> the<00:03:51.040> strainer<00:03:51.670> for

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
there someone thought the strainer for

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.570 
there someone thought the strainer for
my<00:03:52.690> wheel<00:03:52.900> then<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:54.010> then<00:03:54.730> just<00:03:55.200> go<00:03:56.200> ahead

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
my wheel then and then just go ahead

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.790 
my wheel then and then just go ahead
jump<00:03:57.580> wheels<00:03:57.880> it

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.200 

and<00:04:01.100> we're<00:04:01.340> just<00:04:01.400> gonna<00:04:01.580> wait<00:04:01.730> for<00:04:01.970> a<00:04:02.000> little

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
and we're just gonna wait for a little

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.370 
and we're just gonna wait for a little
bit<00:04:02.330> and<00:04:02.570> let<00:04:02.930> them<00:04:03.140> absorb<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.920> color<00:04:04.870> so<00:04:05.870> I

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
bit and let them absorb the color so I

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.980 
bit and let them absorb the color so I
only<00:04:07.070> play<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.370> waiting<00:04:07.580> game<00:04:07.840> you<00:04:08.840> don't

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
only play the waiting game you don't

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.540 
only play the waiting game you don't
