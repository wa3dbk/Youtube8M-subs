threaded<00:02:13.200> adapter<00:02:13.410> now<00:02:14.340> we<00:02:14.400> need<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.730> stretch

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
threaded adapter now we need to stretch

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.810

the<00:02:15.180> balloon<00:02:15.300> over<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.990> 2<00:02:16.170> inch<00:02:16.380> plug<00:02:16.710> this<00:02:17.640> is

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
the balloon over the 2 inch plug this is

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.130 
the balloon over the 2 inch plug this is
tricky<00:02:18.120> but<00:02:18.300> if<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.480> do<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:18.720> right<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.080> should

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
tricky but if you do it right it should

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.970 
tricky but if you do it right it should
look<00:02:19.380> something<00:02:19.620> like<00:02:19.740> this<00:02:20.010> now<00:02:21.560> just<00:02:22.560> press

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
look something like this now just press

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.220 
look something like this now just press
it<00:02:23.160> into<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.580> other<00:02:23.790> side<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.270> T<00:02:24.450> it's

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
it into the other side of the T it's

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.780 
it into the other side of the T it's
gonna<00:02:25.410> be<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.620> really<00:02:25.890> tight<00:02:26.100> fit<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:26.610> that's

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
gonna be a really tight fit but that's

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.420 
gonna be a really tight fit but that's
what<00:02:26.970> we<00:02:27.060> want<00:02:27.800> press<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:28.920> against<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.250> table

to<00:02:29.670> get<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.910> really<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.210> there<00:02:32.300> that's<00:02:33.300> good

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
to get it really in there that's good

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.910 
to get it really in there that's good
once<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.210> have<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.480> thing<00:02:36.660> built<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.770> gotta

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
once you have this thing built you gotta

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.740 
once you have this thing built you gotta
make<00:02:38.040> sure<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.400> front<00:02:38.640> piece<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.360> pushed

make sure that the front piece is pushed
in<00:02:39.990> just<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.650> right<00:02:40.800> amount<00:02:41.100> if<00:02:41.520> you<00:02:41.580> push<00:02:41.790> it

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
in just the right amount if you push it

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.850 
in just the right amount if you push it
in<00:02:42.000> too<00:02:42.180> far<00:02:42.210> they'll<00:02:43.050> press<00:02:43.350> against<00:02:43.740> that

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
in too far they'll press against that

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.710 
in too far they'll press against that
back<00:02:44.100> piece<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:45.120> air<00:02:45.240> won't<00:02:45.360> be<00:02:45.510> able<00:02:45.630> to

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
back piece and the air won't be able to

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.960 
back piece and the air won't be able to
flow<00:02:45.870> through<00:02:46.140> if<00:02:46.860> it's<00:02:47.070> not<00:02:47.250> pushing<00:02:47.550> enough

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
flow through if it's not pushing enough

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.820 
flow through if it's not pushing enough
the<00:02:48.570> air<00:02:48.690> will<00:02:48.840> just<00:02:48.990> flow<00:02:49.230> right<00:02:49.260> through<00:02:49.530> and

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
the air will just flow right through and

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.960 
the air will just flow right through and
out<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> barrel<00:02:50.280> without<00:02:50.370> making<00:02:50.790> any<00:02:50.940> noise

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
out the barrel without making any noise

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.760 
out the barrel without making any noise
you'll<00:02:51.780> know<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.020> have<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.320> right<00:02:52.440> because

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
you'll know you have it right because

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.820 
you'll know you have it right because
it'll<00:02:52.980> sound<00:02:53.100> something<00:02:53.220> like<00:02:53.490> this<00:02:57.830> really

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
it'll sound something like this really

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.220 
it'll sound something like this really
annoying<00:02:59.480> and<00:03:00.480> that's<00:03:00.780> what<00:03:00.900> we<00:03:00.990> want<00:03:01.170> for

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
annoying and that's what we want for

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.130 
annoying and that's what we want for
this<00:03:01.440> project<00:03:02.420> we're<00:03:03.420> gonna<00:03:03.480> use<00:03:03.720> this<00:03:03.870> ball

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
this project we're gonna use this ball

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.229 
this project we're gonna use this ball
valve<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.680> restrict<00:03:05.040> air<00:03:05.250> flow<00:03:05.520> so<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.060> want

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
valve to restrict air flow so you want

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.240 
valve to restrict air flow so you want
to<00:03:06.300> close<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.570> until<00:03:06.989> it's<00:03:07.140> just<00:03:07.200> barely<00:03:07.770> open

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
to close it until it's just barely open

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.490 
to close it until it's just barely open
like<00:03:08.400> this<00:03:08.580> we<00:03:09.360> can<00:03:09.480> adjust<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.900> later<00:03:10.050> but

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
like this we can adjust it later but

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.530 
like this we can adjust it later but
start<00:03:10.770> it<00:03:10.890> small<00:03:11.160> like<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.580> now<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.239> need<00:03:12.450> to

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
start it small like this now I need to

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.229 
start it small like this now I need to
make<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.720> 1<00:03:12.989> inch<00:03:13.140> thread<00:03:13.470> thread<00:03:13.830> adapter

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
make a 1 inch thread thread adapter

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.400 
make a 1 inch thread thread adapter
we'll<00:03:15.239> do<00:03:15.390> this<00:03:15.540> using<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.959> two<00:03:16.110> remaining

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
we'll do this using the two remaining

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.020 
we'll do this using the two remaining
adapters<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.160> small<00:03:17.400> 1<00:03:17.640> inch<00:03:17.790> piece<00:03:18.000> of

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
adapters and a small 1 inch piece of

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.830 
adapters and a small 1 inch piece of
pipe<00:03:18.330> just<00:03:19.320> glue<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.650> all<00:03:19.739> together<00:03:19.860> like<00:03:20.190> this

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
pipe just glue it all together like this

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.150 
pipe just glue it all together like this
when<00:03:21.840> it's<00:03:21.959> dry<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.230> can<00:03:22.500> thread<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:22.770> into<00:03:22.980> the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
when it's dry you can thread it into the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.870 
when it's dry you can thread it into the
ball<00:03:23.310> valve<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:24.000> doesn't<00:03:24.360> matter<00:03:24.510> which<00:03:24.750> side

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
ball valve it doesn't matter which side

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.400 
ball valve it doesn't matter which side
then<00:03:26.880> we<00:03:27.000> can<00:03:27.120> attach<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.570> ball<00:03:27.750> valve<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.290> the

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
then we can attach the ball valve to the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.720 
then we can attach the ball valve to the
middle<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.890> tee<00:03:29.130> this<00:03:29.760> will<00:03:29.970> be<00:03:30.060> our<00:03:30.180> input

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.390 

should<00:03:35.330> look<00:03:35.450> like<00:03:35.630> this<00:03:35.810> when<00:03:35.990> it's<00:03:36.110> done<00:03:39.400> now

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
should look like this when it's done now

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.040 
should look like this when it's done now
remove<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.880> cone<00:03:41.090> piece<00:03:41.420> from<00:03:41.600> your<00:03:41.690> clam

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
remove the cone piece from your clam

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.170 
remove the cone piece from your clam
plate<00:03:42.370> then<00:03:43.370> just<00:03:43.580> thread<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.760> onto<00:03:43.970> the

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
plate then just thread it onto the

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.480 
plate then just thread it onto the
barrel<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:45.319> threads<00:03:45.590> won't<00:03:45.800> match<00:03:45.980> perfectly

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
barrel the threads won't match perfectly

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.590 
barrel the threads won't match perfectly
but<00:03:46.760> it'll<00:03:46.940> be<00:03:47.030> good<00:03:47.150> enough<00:03:47.360> for<00:03:47.540> our

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
but it'll be good enough for our

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.530 
but it'll be good enough for our
purposes<00:03:47.720> now<00:03:48.880> we<00:03:49.880> need<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.150> add<00:03:50.240> the<00:03:50.360> pressure

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
purposes now we need to add the pressure

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.110 
purposes now we need to add the pressure
chamber<00:03:50.900> make<00:03:51.830> sure<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.100> use<00:03:52.250> some<00:03:52.430> gas<00:03:52.670> rated

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
attach both pieces together it should

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.120 
attach both pieces together it should
look<00:04:11.209> like<00:04:11.270> this<00:04:11.420> when<00:04:11.720> you're<00:04:11.840> done<00:04:12.130> it's

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
look like this when you're done it's

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.740 
look like this when you're done it's
pretty<00:04:13.430> wicked<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:14.269> pressure<00:04:14.480> chamber

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
pretty wicked the pressure chamber

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.810 
pretty wicked the pressure chamber
doesn't<00:04:15.110> have<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.440> be<00:04:15.530> this<00:04:15.680> big<00:04:16.010> but<00:04:16.579> I<00:04:16.609> had<00:04:16.790> it

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
doesn't have to be this big but I had it

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.940 
doesn't have to be this big but I had it
built<00:04:17.030> already

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
built already

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.039 
built already
now<00:04:18.950> only<00:04:19.070> three<00:04:19.370> 9-volt<00:04:19.820> batteries<00:04:20.299> hook

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
now only three 9-volt batteries hook

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.630 
now only three 9-volt batteries hook
them<00:04:21.169> up<00:04:21.230> in<00:04:21.380> series<00:04:21.799> like<00:04:22.010> this<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:22.460> that'll

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
them up in series like this and that'll

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.360 
them up in series like this and that'll
give<00:04:22.790> you<00:04:22.880> 27<00:04:23.510> volts<00:04:23.720> for<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.080> valve<00:04:24.370> now

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
give you 27 volts for the valve now

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.630 
give you 27 volts for the valve now
attach<00:04:25.669> your<00:04:25.820> bicycle<00:04:26.270> pump<00:04:27.340> give<00:04:28.340> it<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:28.460> few

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
attach your bicycle pump give it a few

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.240 
attach your bicycle pump give it a few
pumps<00:04:28.850> don't<00:04:29.570> overdo<00:04:29.960> it<00:04:29.990> at<00:04:30.169> first<00:04:30.410> now

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
pumps don't overdo it at first now

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.890 
pumps don't overdo it at first now
attach<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.640> batteries<00:04:32.240> to<00:04:32.419> the<00:04:32.540> solenoid

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
attach the batteries to the solenoid

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.580 
attach the batteries to the solenoid
valve<00:04:33.820> it<00:04:34.820> works<00:04:35.030> let's<00:04:36.020> try<00:04:36.200> it<00:04:36.260> again<00:04:36.350> with<00:04:36.470> a

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
valve it works let's try it again with a

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.890 
valve it works let's try it again with a
little<00:04:36.800> more<00:04:36.919> air<00:04:37.100> pressure<00:04:40.419> that<00:04:41.419> lasted<00:04:41.870> a

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
little more air pressure that lasted a

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.810 
little more air pressure that lasted a
little<00:04:41.990> bit<00:04:42.110> longer<00:04:42.200> that<00:04:42.650> time<00:04:42.860> now<00:04:43.610> let's

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
little bit longer that time now let's

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.100 
little bit longer that time now let's
hook<00:04:44.000> up<00:04:44.120> our<00:04:44.270> pressure<00:04:44.510> switch<00:04:44.840> from<00:04:45.020> the

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
hook up our pressure switch from the

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.890 
hook up our pressure switch from the
last<00:04:45.320> project<00:04:46.120> we'll<00:04:47.120> just<00:04:47.270> take<00:04:47.419> one<00:04:47.660> wire

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
last project we'll just take one wire

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.390 
last project we'll just take one wire
from<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.169> solenoid<00:04:48.410> valve<00:04:48.890> and<00:04:49.100> hook<00:04:49.190> it<00:04:49.310> up

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
from the solenoid valve and hook it up

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.930 
from the solenoid valve and hook it up
to<00:04:49.520> one<00:04:49.729> wire<00:04:49.940> from<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.360> switch<00:04:51.790> then<00:04:52.790> we'll

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
to one wire from the switch then we'll

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.490 
to one wire from the switch then we'll
take<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.240> other<00:04:53.270> solenoid<00:04:53.870> valve<00:04:54.080> wire<00:04:54.320> and

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
take the other solenoid valve wire and

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.570 
take the other solenoid valve wire and
hook<00:04:54.620> it<00:04:54.710> up<00:04:54.770> to<00:04:54.830> one<00:04:55.070> of<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.280> battery

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
hook it up to one of the battery

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.730 
hook it up to one of the battery
terminals<00:04:56.090> and<00:04:56.810> then<00:04:57.320> we'll<00:04:57.410> take<00:04:57.530> the<00:04:57.590> other

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
terminals and then we'll take the other

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.170 
terminals and then we'll take the other
switch<00:04:58.220> wire<00:04:58.430> and<00:04:58.640> hook<00:04:58.700> it<00:04:58.820> up<00:04:58.880> to<00:04:58.940> the<00:04:59.090> other

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
switch wire and hook it up to the other

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.360 
switch wire and hook it up to the other
battery<00:04:59.540> terminal<00:04:59.930> now<00:05:00.620> when<00:05:00.890> we<00:05:01.010> step<00:05:01.220> on<00:05:01.340> the

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
battery terminal now when we step on the

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:09.270 
battery terminal now when we step on the
switch<00:05:06.520> works<00:05:07.520> like<00:05:07.669> a<00:05:07.700> charm

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
switch works like a charm

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.120 
switch works like a charm
and<00:05:10.280> that's<00:05:10.430> it<00:05:10.870> doesn't<00:05:11.870> take<00:05:11.990> much<00:05:12.200> and<00:05:13.070> I

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
and that's it doesn't take much and I

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.740 
and that's it doesn't take much and I
have<00:05:13.220> your<00:05:13.340> really<00:05:13.460> loud<00:05:13.790> not<00:05:14.180> just<00:05:14.419> airplane
