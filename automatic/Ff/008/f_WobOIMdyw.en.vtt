tenortravels ohm and I was expecting the

not is 420 times optical zoom now just a
quick<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> setup<00:00:33.750> I'm<00:00:34.020> using<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.530> zoom<00:00:34.739> h1

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
quick on the setup I'm using the zoom h1

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.840 
quick on the setup I'm using the zoom h1
on<00:00:35.520> my<00:00:35.760> homemade<00:00:36.380> shock<00:00:37.380> mount<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.129> give

on my homemade shock mount just to give

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.459 
on my homemade shock mount just to give
you<00:00:38.969> an<00:00:39.090> idea<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.660> quality<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.170> we're

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
you an idea of the quality that we're

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.360 
you an idea of the quality that we're
getting<00:00:40.559> from<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.950> sound<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.879> zoom<00:00:42.420> h1

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.220 

so<00:00:48.370> I<00:00:48.670> just<00:00:49.060> quickly<00:00:49.210> run<00:00:49.480> few<00:00:49.720> through<00:00:50.110> the

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
so I just quickly run few through the

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.040 
so I just quickly run few through the
features<00:00:50.650> of<00:00:50.970> the<00:00:51.970> tea<00:00:52.840> said<00:00:53.080> 30<00:00:54.780> you've<00:00:55.780> got

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
features of the tea said 30 you've got

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.470 
features of the tea said 30 you've got
as<00:00:56.470> I<00:00:56.500> said<00:00:56.710> of<00:00:56.830> 20<00:00:57.100> times<00:00:57.250> optical<00:00:57.520> own<00:00:57.970> 14

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
as I said of 20 times optical own 14

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.240 
as I said of 20 times optical own 14
megapixels<00:00:59.400> the<00:01:00.400> focal<00:01:00.790> length<00:01:01.000> is<00:01:01.980> 24<00:01:02.980> meals

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
megapixels the focal length is 24 meals

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.460 
megapixels the focal length is 24 meals
so<00:01:03.489> that's<00:01:03.700> nice<00:01:04.150> and<00:01:04.390> wide<00:01:04.570> to<00:01:05.520> 480<00:01:07.229> mil<00:01:08.229> in

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
so that's nice and wide to 480 mil in

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.350 
so that's nice and wide to 480 mil in

we<00:01:27.670> have<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:29.020> normal<00:01:29.680> intelligent<00:01:30.340> auto<00:01:30.520> that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
we have the normal intelligent auto that

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.150 
we have the normal intelligent auto that
works<00:01:31.330> so<00:01:31.660> well<00:01:31.869> on<00:01:31.899> these<00:01:32.229> types<00:01:32.680> of<00:01:32.800> cameras

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
works so well on these types of cameras

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.740 
works so well on these types of cameras
but<00:01:33.310> you've<00:01:33.430> also<00:01:33.550> got<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:33.910> program<00:01:34.180> Aalto

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
but you've also got a program Aalto

Panasonic touch screen which works

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.139 
Panasonic touch screen which works
really<00:01:47.290> well<00:01:47.590> I've<00:01:47.770> used<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.940> touch

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
really well I've used the the touch

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.930 
really well I've used the the touch
screens<00:01:49.509> on<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:49.930> mirrorless<00:01:50.820> Panasonic<00:01:51.820> Sony

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
screens on the mirrorless Panasonic Sony

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.330 
screens on the mirrorless Panasonic Sony
yeah<00:01:52.540> they're<00:01:52.720> not<00:01:52.870> as<00:01:52.960> slick<00:01:53.229> as<00:01:53.260> and<00:01:53.860> I<00:01:53.979> find

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
yeah they're not as slick as and I find

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.490 
yeah they're not as slick as and I find
and<00:01:54.640> that<00:01:54.820> sort<00:01:55.210> of<00:01:55.240> sensitivity<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:56.020> it<00:01:56.350> is<00:01:56.470> a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
and that sort of sensitivity and it is a

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.440 
and that sort of sensitivity and it is a
bit<00:01:56.680> of<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.799> press<00:01:57.010> but<00:01:57.729> it<00:01:57.820> is<00:01:57.940> a<00:01:57.970> useful

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
bit of a press but it is a useful

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.850 
bit of a press but it is a useful
feature<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:58.930> it<00:01:59.020> does<00:01:59.170> work<00:01:59.440> so<00:02:00.510> that's<00:02:01.510> good

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
feature and it does work so that's good

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.260 
feature and it does work so that's good
there's<00:02:02.860> as<00:02:03.250> far<00:02:03.310> as<00:02:03.490> I<00:02:03.549> know<00:02:03.670> there's<00:02:03.820> no<00:02:03.970> raw

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
there's as far as I know there's no raw

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.420 
there's as far as I know there's no raw
so<00:02:04.780> it's<00:02:04.900> just<00:02:04.990> JPEGs<00:02:05.470> out<00:02:05.710> of<00:02:05.799> this<00:02:05.950> but<00:02:06.250> I

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
so it's just JPEGs out of this but I

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.009 
so it's just JPEGs out of this but I
don't<00:02:06.670> see<00:02:06.820> that's<00:02:06.970> a<00:02:07.119> problem<00:02:07.479> on<00:02:07.600> this<00:02:07.720> style

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
don't see that's a problem on this style

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.270 
don't see that's a problem on this style
of<00:02:08.110> camera<00:02:08.850> and<00:02:10.590> you've<00:02:11.590> got<00:02:11.920> things<00:02:12.100> like

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
of camera and you've got things like

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.170 
of camera and you've got things like
self<00:02:12.640> timer<00:02:13.239> it's<00:02:13.450> obviously<00:02:13.810> SD<00:02:14.200> card<00:02:15.180> it's

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
self timer it's obviously SD card it's

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.740 
self timer it's obviously SD card it's
got<00:02:16.810> some<00:02:17.200> high<00:02:17.530> speed<00:02:17.890> burst<00:02:18.220> functions<00:02:19.090> and

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
got some high speed burst functions and

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
touch screen all works really well the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.740 
touch screen all works really well the
touch<00:02:53.170> screen<00:02:53.410> focus<00:02:53.950> is<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:55.000> probably<00:02:55.599> the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
touch screen focus is is probably the

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.240 
touch screen focus is is probably the
best<00:02:55.959> feature<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.560> just<00:02:56.770> touch<00:02:56.980> where<00:02:57.190> you

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
best feature you just touch where you

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.800 
best feature you just touch where you
want<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.459> focus<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.300> can<00:02:58.450> either<00:02:58.540> have<00:02:58.780> it

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
want to focus and you can either have it

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.660 
want to focus and you can either have it
to<00:02:58.989> focus<00:02:59.349> or<00:02:59.500> actually<00:02:59.770> take<00:02:59.920> the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
to focus or actually take the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.310 
to focus or actually take the
and<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.120> works<00:03:01.330> really<00:03:01.660> well<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:01.930> that's

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
and that works really well so that's

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.370 
and that works really well so that's
good<00:03:03.090> with<00:03:04.090> regards<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.840> manual

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
good with regards to the the manual

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.020 
good with regards to the the manual
modes<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:05.950> like<00:03:06.070> the<00:03:06.190> aperture<00:03:06.490> priority<00:03:06.670> and

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
modes and like the aperture priority and

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.810 
modes and like the aperture priority and
shutter<00:03:07.270> priority<00:03:08.040> there<00:03:09.420> okay<00:03:10.470> but<00:03:11.470> you<00:03:12.460> do

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
shutter priority there okay but you do

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.260 
shutter priority there okay but you do
need<00:03:13.380> sort<00:03:14.380> of<00:03:14.440> you<00:03:14.650> there's<00:03:15.190> no<00:03:15.310> dials<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.180> I'm

need sort of you there's no dials so I'm
trying<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.540> say<00:03:16.660> so<00:03:16.720> normally<00:03:17.110> you'd<00:03:17.230> have<00:03:17.350> a

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
trying to say so normally you'd have a

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.690 
trying to say so normally you'd have a
thumb<00:03:17.650> wheel<00:03:17.860> or<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.070> dial<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:19.090> change<00:03:19.590> the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
thumb wheel or a dial to change the

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.080 
thumb wheel or a dial to change the
aperture<00:03:21.700> or<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.690> shutter<00:03:23.620> speed<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.370> it's

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
aperture or the shutter speed and it's

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.760 
aperture or the shutter speed and it's
not<00:03:26.040> instantly<00:03:27.060> sort<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.260> obvious<00:03:29.260> as<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.530> how

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
not instantly sort of obvious as to how

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.760 
not instantly sort of obvious as to how
you<00:03:29.830> actually<00:03:30.130> do<00:03:30.459> that<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:32.290> when<00:03:32.440> I<00:03:32.470> first

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770

it's not what I would call slick and
it's<00:04:22.120> not<00:04:22.270> something<00:04:22.479> you<00:04:22.600> will<00:04:22.750> be<00:04:22.870> able<00:04:22.930> to

it's not something you will be able to
use<00:04:23.290> quickly<00:04:23.979> but<00:04:24.580> if<00:04:24.729> you're<00:04:24.880> setting<00:04:25.210> up<00:04:25.300> a

you're on a tripod and you've got the

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.020 
you're on a tripod and you've got the

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
time to mess about with that it works

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.700 
time to mess about with that it works
and<00:04:31.450> it's<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:31.660> nice<00:04:31.810> feature<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.320> have<00:04:32.470> if<00:04:32.590> I'd

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
and it's a nice feature to have if I'd

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.800
