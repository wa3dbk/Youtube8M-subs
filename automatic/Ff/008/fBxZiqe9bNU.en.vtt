00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
app man you can find copper on the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.889 
app man you can find copper on the
ground<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.550> with<00:00:59.550> top<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.030> table<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.570> make

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
ground and with top of table you make

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.820 
ground and with top of table you make
most<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.890> machines<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.140> very<00:01:04.290> useful

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
most of the machines so it's very useful

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.039 
most of the machines so it's very useful
for<00:01:05.210> you<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:08.330> next<00:01:09.330> off<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:09.780> need<00:01:09.810> an

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
for you to have next off we need an

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.250 
for you to have next off we need an
empty<00:01:10.409> cell<00:01:10.680> for<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.909> generator<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
empty cell for the generator for the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.679 
empty cell for the generator for the
geothermal<00:01:14.130> generator<00:01:14.490> because<00:01:15.030> we<00:01:15.540> will<00:01:15.630> be

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
geothermal generator because we will be

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.190 
geothermal generator because we will be
running<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.290> lava<00:01:17.280> I'll<00:01:18.090> tell<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.780> why<00:01:18.930> but

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
running on lava I'll tell you why but

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.990 
running on lava I'll tell you why but
this<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.560> how<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.710> make<00:01:19.890> himself<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.729> have

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
this is how you make himself you have

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.050 
this is how you make himself you have
for<00:01:21.270> tin<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.650> get<00:01:22.770> eight<00:01:23.009> empty<00:01:23.490> shell<00:01:23.729> so

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
for tin and you get eight empty shell so

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.469 
for tin and you get eight empty shell so
that's<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.360> lot<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.900> think<00:01:24.930> king<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.950> very<00:01:26.479> is

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
that's a lot and I think king is very is

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.020 
that's a lot and I think king is very is
a<00:01:27.540> very<00:01:27.869> needed<00:01:28.380> resource<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.700> sort<00:01:29.939> of

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
a very needed resource in this sort of

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.450 
a very needed resource in this sort of
energy<00:01:30.479> formats<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.259> make<00:01:31.530> all<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.950> materials

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
energy formats to make all the materials

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.280 
energy formats to make all the materials
the<00:01:33.299> steps<00:01:33.689> how<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:33.990> make<00:01:34.439> um<00:01:34.740> empty<00:01:35.729> shells

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
the steps how to make um empty shells

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.120 
the steps how to make um empty shells
now<00:01:37.290> re<00:01:37.979> batteries<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:40.110> mini<00:01:40.350> 14<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:40.950> well

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
next we need a machine go for this we

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.469 
next we need a machine go for this we
need<00:02:01.409> refined<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.100> which<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.729> normal<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.270> and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
need refined on which is normal I and

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.260 
need refined on which is normal I and
just<00:02:03.659> snort<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.350> again<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.369> furnace<00:02:05.820> or<00:02:06.060> any

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
just snort it again in a furnace or any

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.919

it's<00:04:56.740> filling<00:04:57.280> up<00:04:57.370> the<00:04:57.520> backbox<00:04:57.850> pretty<00:04:58.510> mess

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
it's filling up the backbox pretty mess

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.020 
it's filling up the backbox pretty mess
early<00:04:59.830> so<00:05:00.160> i<00:05:00.190> think<00:05:00.310> what<00:05:00.610> i'm<00:05:00.700> going<00:05:00.820> to<00:05:00.880> do<00:05:01.000> is

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
early so i think what i'm going to do is

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.850 
early so i think what i'm going to do is
I'm<00:05:01.300> going<00:05:01.420> to<00:05:01.540> change<00:05:01.960> it<00:05:02.110> to<00:05:02.230> it<00:05:02.350> ms<00:05:02.950> e

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
I'm going to change it to it ms e

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.250 
I'm going to change it to it ms e
instead<00:05:08.640> if<00:05:09.640> I<00:05:09.820> just<00:05:10.030> do<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:10.450> so<00:05:11.020> I<00:05:11.080> don't

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
instead if I just do that so I don't

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.110 
instead if I just do that so I don't
want<00:05:11.380> to<00:05:11.470> waste<00:05:11.590> that<00:05:11.800> energy<00:05:12.010> so<00:05:12.730> just<00:05:12.970> going

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
want to waste that energy so just going

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:21.870 
want to waste that energy so just going
to<00:05:13.240> keep<00:05:13.420> on<00:05:13.830> coming<00:05:14.830> in
