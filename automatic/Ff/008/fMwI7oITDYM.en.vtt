you get this plastic like a jewel case
lightweight<00:01:22.009> plastic<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:24.380> way<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:24.590> get

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
lightweight plastic the way you get

lightweight plastic the way you get
these<00:01:24.979> are<00:01:25.280> is<00:01:25.490> you<00:01:25.789> then<00:01:25.970> slide<00:01:26.420> out<00:01:26.660> again

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429

pushing from one side pull out and also
plastic<00:01:32.509> sleeve<00:01:33.020> or<00:01:33.319> I<00:01:33.619> think<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:34.640> is<00:01:34.819> the

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
plastic sleeve or I think this is the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:42.660 
plastic sleeve or I think this is the
best<00:01:35.179> way<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:35.420> pack<00:01:35.869> a<00:01:36.140> model<00:01:36.530> locomotive

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.830 

let's<00:01:43.670> just<00:01:43.880> pull<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:44.210> up<00:01:44.329> and<00:01:44.539> there's

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
let's just pull it up and there's

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.539 
let's just pull it up and there's
theater<00:01:45.110> programming<00:01:45.740> over<00:01:45.979> there<00:01:46.159> over

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
theater programming over there over

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.990 
theater programming over there over
programming<00:01:47.119> from<00:01:47.649> so<00:01:48.649> then<00:01:48.799> you<00:01:48.950> get<00:01:49.100> that

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
programming from so then you get that

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.289 
programming from so then you get that
outer<00:01:50.719> sleeve<00:01:51.259> again<00:01:51.710> plus<00:01:52.399> the<00:01:52.579> Caucasian

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
outer sleeve again plus the Caucasian

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:02.440 
outer sleeve again plus the Caucasian
that<00:01:53.479> comes<00:01:53.719> on<00:01:53.869> that<00:01:54.020> side<00:02:01.149> these<00:02:02.149> are<00:02:02.210> just

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
that comes on that side these are just

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.100 
that comes on that side these are just
packed<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:02.929> the<00:02:02.960> ultimate<00:02:03.590> standards<00:02:04.280> I<00:02:04.429> think

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
packed to the ultimate standards I think

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.070 
packed to the ultimate standards I think
and<00:02:06.110> then<00:02:06.319> you<00:02:07.159> get<00:02:07.280> access<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:08.080> the

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
and then you get access to the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.369 
and then you get access to the
locomotive<00:02:09.410> whatnot<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.780> then<00:02:11.930> it's<00:02:12.080> just<00:02:12.200> a

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
locomotive whatnot and then it's just a

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.530 
locomotive whatnot and then it's just a
case<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:14.140> pulling<00:02:15.140> out<00:02:15.319> one<00:02:15.590> on<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.830> logs<00:02:16.099> and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
case of pulling out one on the logs and

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.350 
case of pulling out one on the logs and
lifting<00:02:17.540> up<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:19.430> then<00:02:19.489> you<00:02:19.790> get<00:02:19.910> all<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.209> rest

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
lifting up and then you get all the rest

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.559 
lifting up and then you get all the rest

go<00:03:16.820> for<00:03:16.850> about<00:03:17.150> 400<00:03:17.780> these<00:03:18.310> if<00:03:19.310> he<00:03:19.490> can<00:03:19.640> get<00:03:19.760> old

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
go for about 400 these if he can get old

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.460 
go for about 400 these if he can get old
of<00:03:20.120> them<00:03:20.240> and<00:03:20.510> what's<00:03:20.690> special<00:03:20.810> about<00:03:21.140> these

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
of them and what's special about these

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.710 
of them and what's special about these
particular<00:03:21.980> models<00:03:22.400> is<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:23.120> conf<00:03:23.360> actually

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
particular models is the conf actually

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.440 
particular models is the conf actually
fitting<00:03:24.020> with<00:03:24.200> a<00:03:24.230> sound<00:03:24.500> decoder<00:03:25.270> and<00:03:26.270> the

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
detailing on it it's really good it's

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.490 
detailing on it it's really good it's
got<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:30.580> illuminated<00:03:31.580> firebox<00:03:32.170> but<00:03:33.170> for<00:03:33.350> its

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
got a illuminated firebox but for its

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.470 
got a illuminated firebox but for its
age<00:03:33.620> when<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.310> came<00:03:34.490> out<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:35.000> think<00:03:35.120> it's

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
age when it came out I think it's

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.660 
age when it came out I think it's
probably<00:03:36.020> about<00:03:38.110> 2006<00:03:39.110> or<00:03:39.320> some<00:03:39.500> 7<00:03:40.070> model<00:03:40.460> I'm

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
probably about 2006 or some 7 model I'm

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.720 
probably about 2006 or some 7 model I'm
not<00:03:40.820> sure<00:03:41.060> exactly<00:03:41.450> what<00:03:41.660> day<00:03:41.960> is<00:03:42.730> what's

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
not sure exactly what day is what's

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.520 
not sure exactly what day is what's
special<00:03:44.000> about<00:03:44.210> this<00:03:44.540> particular<00:03:44.900> model<00:03:45.260> is

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
special about this particular model is

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.100 
special about this particular model is
it's<00:03:45.740> got<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.100> latest<00:03:46.630> technology<00:03:47.630> molds<00:03:47.930> ROM

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
it's got the latest technology molds ROM

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.510 
it's got the latest technology molds ROM
ball<00:03:48.350> which<00:03:48.560> is<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.770> maintenance-free

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
ball which is a maintenance-free

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.780 
ball which is a maintenance-free
brushless<00:03:50.330> motor<00:03:51.070> it's<00:03:52.070> once<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.460> think<00:03:52.640> it's

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
brushless motor it's once I think it's

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.500 
brushless motor it's once I think it's
21<00:03:53.300> Pole<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:55.430> that's<00:03:55.640> what<00:03:55.820> makes<00:03:56.060> its<00:03:56.270> path

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
21 Pole and that's what makes its path

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.660 
21 Pole and that's what makes its path
special<00:03:57.110> because<00:03:57.709> it<00:03:57.860> runs<00:03:58.690> per<00:03:59.690> that<00:04:00.020> way<00:04:00.230> and

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
special because it runs per that way and

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.390 
special because it runs per that way and
without<00:04:01.670> any<00:04:01.850> noise<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:03.220> basically<00:04:04.220> you

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
without any noise and basically you

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.350 
without any noise and basically you
don't<00:04:04.520> have<00:04:04.610> to<00:04:04.760> maintain<00:04:04.910> it

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
don't have to maintain it
