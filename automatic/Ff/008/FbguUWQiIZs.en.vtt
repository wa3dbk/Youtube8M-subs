00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
these scoops per hundred pounds of body

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.340 
these scoops per hundred pounds of body
weight<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.460> weigh<00:00:44.640> 180<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.750> take<00:00:45.930> one

like a like one of those packets you get
for<00:02:14.760> water<00:02:14.939> or<00:02:15.090> whatever<00:02:15.329> I<00:02:15.450> don't<00:02:15.629> know<00:02:15.769> but

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
for water or whatever I don't know but

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.020 
for water or whatever I don't know but
this<00:02:17.040> stuff<00:02:17.849> right<00:02:18.030> here<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:20.250> first<00:02:20.459> time<00:02:20.760> I

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
this stuff right here the first time I

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.610 
this stuff right here the first time I
took<00:02:21.329> it<00:02:21.659> I<00:02:21.750> could<00:02:22.049> really<00:02:22.260> tell<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
took it I could really tell the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.580 
took it I could really tell the
difference<00:02:22.650> like<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:24.510> nitric<00:02:24.900> oxide<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:26.430> for

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
difference like the nitric oxide is for

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.160 
difference like the nitric oxide is for
it<00:02:28.700> gets<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.879> nitric<00:02:30.180> oxide<00:02:30.540> into<00:02:30.720> your<00:02:30.900> blood

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
it gets the nitric oxide into your blood

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.750 
it gets the nitric oxide into your blood
so<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:31.980> engorges<00:02:32.519> your<00:02:33.030> your<00:02:33.709> blood

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
so that it engorges your your blood

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.399 
so that it engorges your your blood
through<00:02:35.760> your<00:02:35.849> veins<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.019> get<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> better

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
through your veins so you get a better

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.039 
through your veins so you get a better
pump<00:02:37.739> while<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.159> workout<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.819> I<00:02:39.750> could<00:02:39.930> I

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
pump while you workout and I could I

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.559 
pump while you workout and I could I
could<00:02:40.140> tell<00:02:40.560> big<00:02:41.310> time<00:02:41.579> with<00:02:42.239> this<00:02:42.269> white

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
could tell big time with this white

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.920 
could tell big time with this white
flood<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:44.069> worked<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.540> first<00:02:45.720> time

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
flood that it worked and the first time

or anything like that there's just
creatine<00:03:43.079> in<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:43.949> and<00:03:44.419> this<00:03:45.419> is<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.919> creatine

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
creatine in it and this is a creatine

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.860 
creatine in it and this is a creatine
hydrochloride<00:03:47.519> I<00:03:47.909> believe<00:03:48.299> that's<00:03:48.540> what<00:03:48.780> is

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
hydrochloride I believe that's what is

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.649 
hydrochloride I believe that's what is
called<00:03:49.340> which<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:50.489> different<00:03:50.760> than<00:03:51.000> creatine

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
called which is different than creatine

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.059 
called which is different than creatine
monohydrate<00:03:53.449> and<00:03:54.449> a<00:03:54.599> lot<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.750> people<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.799> big

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
monohydrate and a lot of people the big

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.559 
monohydrate and a lot of people the big
thing<00:03:56.099> about<00:03:56.370> creatine<00:03:56.699> monohydrate<00:03:56.940> was

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
thing about creatine monohydrate was

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.210 
thing about creatine monohydrate was
that<00:03:57.780> it<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:59.090> called<00:04:00.090> water<00:04:01.079> retention<00:04:01.440> which

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
that it a called water retention which

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.619 
that it a called water retention which
made<00:04:02.459> you<00:04:02.609> look<00:04:02.849> bigger<00:04:03.120> than<00:04:03.359> you<00:04:03.449> actually

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
made you look bigger than you actually

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.449 
made you look bigger than you actually
were<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:05.389> your<00:04:06.389> muscles<00:04:06.599> wouldn't<00:04:07.169> fill<00:04:08.040> firm

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
were and your muscles wouldn't fill firm

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.309 
were and your muscles wouldn't fill firm
it<00:04:08.760> feel<00:04:09.720> more<00:04:10.879> floppy<00:04:11.879> and<00:04:12.120> loose<00:04:12.569> like<00:04:12.930> fat

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
it feel more floppy and loose like fat

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.029 
it feel more floppy and loose like fat
but<00:04:13.739> it<00:04:13.829> is<00:04:13.919> water<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:15.440> this<00:04:16.440> doesn't<00:04:16.799> do<00:04:16.859> that

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
but it is water and this doesn't do that

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.890 
but it is water and this doesn't do that
and<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.909> has<00:04:19.639> like<00:04:20.639> I've<00:04:20.820> heard<00:04:21.000> people<00:04:21.209> like

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
and it has like I've heard people like

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.800 
and it has like I've heard people like
cramping<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:22.860> stuff<00:04:23.360> like<00:04:24.360> that<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.599> this

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
cramping and stuff like that and this

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.940 
cramping and stuff like that and this
isn't<00:04:25.139> supposed<00:04:25.289> to<00:04:27.080> know<00:04:28.080> this<00:04:28.680> isn't

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
isn't supposed to know this isn't

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.990 
isn't supposed to know this isn't
supposed<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.159> make<00:04:29.279> a<00:04:29.310> cramp<00:04:29.610> or<00:04:29.700> anything<00:04:29.909> of

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
supposed to make a cramp or anything of

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.800 
supposed to make a cramp or anything of
that<00:04:30.029> and<00:04:30.650> it<00:04:31.650> says<00:04:31.830> it's<00:04:31.979> 50<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.490> 59<00:04:33.150> times

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
that and it says it's 50 to 59 times

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.320 
that and it says it's 50 to 59 times
more<00:04:34.440> potent<00:04:34.979> than<00:04:35.510> standard<00:04:36.510> Cree<00:04:36.779> teens<00:04:37.250> so

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
more potent than standard Cree teens so

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.209 
more potent than standard Cree teens so
you<00:04:39.330> take<00:04:39.570> that<00:04:39.779> for<00:04:40.020> what<00:04:40.050> what<00:04:40.710> it's<00:04:40.830> worth<00:04:40.950> I

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:41.219 
you take that for what what it's worth I

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:46.070 
you take that for what what it's worth I
guess<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:44.400> stuff<00:04:44.669> is<00:04:44.849> as<00:04:45.330> proven<00:04:45.779> itself<00:04:45.990> to

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
guess the stuff is as proven itself to

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.570 
guess the stuff is as proven itself to
me<00:04:47.120> and<00:04:48.120> I<00:04:48.150> did<00:04:48.990> take<00:04:49.200> the<00:04:49.320> pills<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.889> capsules

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
me and I did take the pills the capsules

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.000 
me and I did take the pills the capsules
because<00:04:50.669> I<00:04:50.849> got<00:04:51.000> a<00:04:51.029> couple<00:04:51.300> free<00:04:51.539> samples<00:04:51.979> so<00:04:52.979> I

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
because I got a couple free samples so I

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.620 
because I got a couple free samples so I
would<00:04:53.219> take<00:04:53.370> one<00:04:53.610> of<00:04:53.700> these<00:04:53.789> capsules<00:04:54.240> before

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
would take one of these capsules before

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.230 
would take one of these capsules before
I<00:04:54.659> worked<00:04:54.930> out<00:04:57.050> with<00:04:58.050> my<00:04:58.550> with<00:04:59.550> this<00:04:59.820> at<00:05:00.120> the

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
I worked out with my with this at the

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.820 
I worked out with my with this at the
same<00:05:00.419> time<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:01.820> because<00:05:02.820> it<00:05:03.510> does<00:05:03.719> say<00:05:04.050> for

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
same time and because it does say for

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.760 
same time and because it does say for
normal<00:05:05.190> workouts<00:05:05.550> take<00:05:05.820> 100<00:05:06.330> or<00:05:06.900> take<00:05:07.529> one

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
normal workouts take 100 or take one

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.129 
normal workouts take 100 or take one
scoop<00:05:07.950> per<00:05:08.070> hundred<00:05:08.520> pounds<00:05:08.700> of<00:05:08.760> body<00:05:08.940> weight

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
scoop per hundred pounds of body weight

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.899 
scoop per hundred pounds of body weight
but<00:05:10.139> for<00:05:10.320> intense<00:05:10.740> workout<00:05:11.190> so<00:05:11.430> you<00:05:11.520> take<00:05:11.700> one

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
but for intense workout so you take one

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:13.219 
but for intense workout so you take one
to<00:05:12.060> two<00:05:12.090> scoops<00:05:12.539> per<00:05:12.659> outer<00:05:12.840> pounds<00:05:13.050> of<00:05:13.139> body

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
to two scoops per outer pounds of body

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.550 
to two scoops per outer pounds of body
weight<00:05:13.490> but<00:05:14.490> I<00:05:14.760> only<00:05:15.419> weigh<00:05:15.570> 140<00:05:16.139> pounds<00:05:16.440> right

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
weight but I only weigh 140 pounds right

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.519 
weight but I only weigh 140 pounds right
now<00:05:16.620> so<00:05:17.070> I<00:05:17.539> don't<00:05:18.539> think<00:05:18.719> I<00:05:18.779> need<00:05:18.840> two<00:05:19.200> scoops

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
now so I don't think I need two scoops

capsules instead of taking the powder

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.140
