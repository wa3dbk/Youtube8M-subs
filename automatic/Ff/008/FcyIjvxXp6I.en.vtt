backward-compatible with ps2 and PS 1
games<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.310> then<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:23.760> have<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.180> PlayStation<00:00:24.720> 4

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
games and then we have the PlayStation 4

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.500 
games and then we have the PlayStation 4
that's<00:00:25.380> $400<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:27.240> not

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.450 
backward-compatible at all the internal
specs<00:00:30.210> are<00:00:30.570> very<00:00:30.900> different<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.529> I'll<00:00:32.130> talk

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
specs are very different and I'll talk

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.860 
specs are very different and I'll talk
about<00:00:32.489> those<00:00:32.850> more<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.270> second<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:33.719> let's

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
about those more in a second but let's

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.049 
about those more in a second but let's
talk<00:00:34.050> about<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.410> externals<00:00:35.010> first<00:00:35.309> as<00:00:35.820> you

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
talk about the externals first as you

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.420 
talk about the externals first as you
can<00:00:36.239> see<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.719> external<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.590> ps3<00:00:38.399> is

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
can see the external of the ps3 is

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.180 
can see the external of the ps3 is
rounded<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.510> we<00:00:40.320> also<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.129> little

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
rounded and we also have this little

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.709 
rounded and we also have this little
door<00:00:41.640> here<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.030> I'll<00:00:42.120> show<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.300> what's<00:00:42.570> in

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
door here and I'll show you what's in

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.200 
door here and I'll show you what's in
there<00:00:42.870> after<00:00:43.050> but<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.040> original<00:00:44.280> ps3<00:00:45.059> is

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
there after but the original ps3 is

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.680 
there after but the original ps3 is
extremely<00:00:45.960> heavy<00:00:46.170> its<00:00:46.770> all-in-one<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.730> is

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
extremely heavy its all-in-one and is

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.819 
extremely heavy its all-in-one and is
very<00:00:49.379> very<00:00:49.829> big<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.730> stands<00:00:51.239> up<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.350> and

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
very very big it stands up like this and

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.330 
very very big it stands up like this and
you<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.640> see<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.539> stands<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:55.050> as<00:00:55.289> does<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
you can see this stands up as does the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.389 
you can see this stands up as does the
ps4<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.230> right<00:00:58.410> here<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
ps4 and you can see right here that the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.900 
ps4 and you can see right here that the
thickness<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.180> quite<00:01:00.510> different<00:01:00.989> we<00:01:01.500> have

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
thickness is quite different we have

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.270 
thickness is quite different we have
internal<00:01:02.910> power<00:01:02.940> supplies<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.600> both<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.350> we

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
internal power supplies in both and we

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.190 
internal power supplies in both and we
have<00:01:05.460> similar<00:01:05.909> comic<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> connections<00:01:07.049> on

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
have similar comic the connections on

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.870 
have similar comic the connections on
the<00:01:07.229> back<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:07.830> let's<00:01:08.040> take<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.280> look<00:01:08.580> at<00:01:08.729> these

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the back but let's take a look at these

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.859 
the back but let's take a look at these
so<00:01:09.570> here<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.260> ps3<00:01:10.830> next<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> ps4<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
so here is the ps3 next to the ps4 the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.990 
so here is the ps3 next to the ps4 the
ps3<00:01:13.500> has<00:01:13.890> an<00:01:14.490> HDMI<00:01:15.119> out<00:01:15.360> an<00:01:15.920> Ethernet<00:01:16.920> port

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
ps3 has an HDMI out an Ethernet port

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.749 
ps3 has an HDMI out an Ethernet port
optical<00:01:18.000> out<00:01:18.150> an<00:01:18.780> AV<00:01:19.200> multi-out<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.040> then<00:01:20.640> our

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
optical out an AV multi-out and then our

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.030 
optical out an AV multi-out and then our
AC<00:01:20.970> power<00:01:21.240> plug<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.140> changed<00:01:22.680> over<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
AC power plug this changed over the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.760 
AC power plug this changed over the
years<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> similar<00:01:24.210> style<00:01:24.540> as<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.810> ps4<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
years to a similar style as the ps4 and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.020 
years to a similar style as the ps4 and
then<00:01:26.400> we<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:26.700> an<00:01:26.820> optical<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.560> HDMI<00:01:28.560> out

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
then we have an optical out HDMI out

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.550 
then we have an optical out HDMI out
Ethernet<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.200> camera

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
Ethernet and this is for the camera

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.380 
Ethernet and this is for the camera
input<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.700> see<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> difference

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
input so you can see the difference

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.690 
input so you can see the difference
right<00:01:33.479> there<00:01:33.810> very<00:01:34.140> different<00:01:34.619> style<00:01:34.890> much

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
right there very different style much

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.160 
right there very different style much
nicer<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.450> ps4<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:38.520> ps3<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.210> extremely

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
nicer with the ps4 the ps3 is extremely

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.620 
nicer with the ps4 the ps3 is extremely
heavy<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:41.189> much<00:01:41.640> much<00:01:41.909> heavier<00:01:42.150> than<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
heavy it's much much heavier than the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.139 
heavy it's much much heavier than the
ps4<00:01:42.840> if<00:01:43.649> we<00:01:43.770> move<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.310> side<00:01:44.549> here<00:01:44.939> you

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
ps4 if we move it to the side here you

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.749 
ps4 if we move it to the side here you
can<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.350> really<00:01:46.799> how<00:01:46.979> these<00:01:47.220> sit<00:01:47.579> as

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
can see this is really how these sit as

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.149 
can see this is really how these sit as
far<00:01:47.790> as<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.299> Front's<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.780> them<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.950> can

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
far as the Front's of them so you can

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.539 
far as the Front's of them so you can
see<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.520> side<00:01:51.680> vents<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.860> ps3

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
see the side vents on the ps3

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.760 
see the side vents on the ps3
there's<00:01:54.119> some<00:01:54.299> vents<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.750> ps4<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.500> not<00:01:55.649> as

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
there's some vents on the ps4 but not as

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.709 
there's some vents on the ps4 but not as
many<00:01:55.969> on<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.329> Front's<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.020> ps4<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:59.490> the

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
many on the Front's of the ps4 and the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.459 
many on the Front's of the ps4 and the
ps3<00:02:01.189> we<00:02:02.189> have<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> very<00:02:02.700> big<00:02:02.939> difference<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
ps3 we have a very big difference on the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.859 
ps3 we have a very big difference on the
ps3<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.460> four<00:02:05.850> USB<00:02:06.240> outs<00:02:07.079> or<00:02:07.649> USB<00:02:08.280> ports

things that you're probably familiar
with<00:02:20.210> on<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.960> ps4<00:02:22.260> we<00:02:22.650> have<00:02:22.800> two<00:02:23.070> USB<00:02:23.250> ports

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
with on the ps4 we have two USB ports

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.780 
with on the ps4 we have two USB ports
and<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.360> blu-ray<00:02:24.540> drive<00:02:27.530> on<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.770> side<00:02:29.010> pretty

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
and a blu-ray drive on this side pretty

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.460 
and a blu-ray drive on this side pretty
much<00:02:29.970> nothing<00:02:30.240> but<00:02:30.570> we<00:02:30.660> have<00:02:30.810> access<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.380> the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
much nothing but we have access to the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.500 
much nothing but we have access to the
hard<00:02:31.650> drive<00:02:31.800> then<00:02:32.640> on<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.880> bottoms<00:02:33.210> we<00:02:33.360> have

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
hard drive then on the bottoms we have

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.710 
hard drive then on the bottoms we have
four<00:02:33.750> feet<00:02:33.960> here<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.470> then<00:02:35.010> on<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.250> ps4<00:02:35.720> same

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
four feet here and then on the ps4 same

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.280 
four feet here and then on the ps4 same
idea

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
idea

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.930 
idea
Oh<00:02:37.320> internally<00:02:38.010> we<00:02:38.130> both<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.550> impressive

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
Oh internally we both have impressive

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.300 
Oh internally we both have impressive
specs<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.690> original<00:02:40.260> ps3<00:02:40.770> has<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> Cell

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
specs the original ps3 has a Cell

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.330 
specs the original ps3 has a Cell
processor<00:02:41.570> it's<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:42.690> PowerPC<00:02:43.440> processor

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
processor it's a PowerPC processor

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.390 
processor it's a PowerPC processor
similar<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.810> was<00:02:45.959> in<00:02:46.170> max<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.920> old

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
similar to that that was in max of old

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.080 
similar to that that was in max of old
and<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.420> does<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.810> Xbox<00:02:49.200> 360<00:02:50.040> similar<00:02:50.880> as<00:02:51.030> far

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
and so does the Xbox 360 similar as far

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.000 
and so does the Xbox 360 similar as far
as<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.420> goes<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:52.020> ps3<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.680> Cell

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
as that goes but the ps3 is a Cell

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.600 
as that goes but the ps3 is a Cell
processor<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:54.209> has<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.450> seven<00:02:54.870> core<00:02:55.370> SPU's<00:02:56.370> or

eight gigs of RAM it's really very
impressive<00:03:06.570> internally<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.709> is<00:03:08.550> really

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
impressive internally and is really

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.540 
impressive internally and is really
really<00:03:09.209> nice<00:03:09.660> now<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.350> can<00:03:10.680> remove<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.340> hard

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
really nice now you can remove the hard

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.180 
really nice now you can remove the hard
drive<00:03:11.760> out<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.180> ps4<00:03:12.480> we<00:03:13.380> just<00:03:13.620> slide<00:03:13.950> this

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
drive out of the ps4 we just slide this

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.870 
drive out of the ps4 we just slide this
off<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:15.650> this<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:16.860> fingerprint<00:03:17.370> magnet<00:03:17.610> as

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
off and this is a fingerprint magnet as

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.810 
off and this is a fingerprint magnet as
well<00:03:18.060> slide<00:03:18.810> this<00:03:19.019> off<00:03:19.260> it's<00:03:19.620> one<00:03:19.920> screw<00:03:20.310> hard

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
well slide this off it's one screw hard

well slide this off it's one screw hard
drive<00:03:21.090> pops<00:03:21.390> out<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:21.930> can<00:03:22.110> swap<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.380> out

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
drive pops out and you can swap it out

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.860 
drive pops out and you can swap it out
for<00:03:22.890> something<00:03:23.190> larger<00:03:23.340> then<00:03:24.330> you<00:03:24.480> just<00:03:24.690> put

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
for something larger then you just put

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.050 
for something larger then you just put
this<00:03:24.989> back<00:03:25.200> in<00:03:25.410> place<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:29.010> click<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:29.760> back<00:03:29.880> in

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
this back in place and click it back in

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.570 
this back in place and click it back in
place<00:03:30.299> really<00:03:30.630> simple<00:03:31.140> really<00:03:31.920> nice<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.430> this

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
place really simple really nice and this

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.580 
place really simple really nice and this
is<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.790> much<00:03:33.150> more<00:03:33.420> sleek<00:03:33.840> looking<00:03:34.230> piece<00:03:34.440> of

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
is a much more sleek looking piece of

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.860 
is a much more sleek looking piece of
hardware<00:03:34.980> so<00:03:35.910> that's<00:03:36.090> pretty<00:03:36.420> much<00:03:36.510> hit

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
hardware so that's pretty much hit

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.220 
hardware so that's pretty much hit
between<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.350> original<00:03:37.830> this<00:03:38.070> is<00:03:38.280> gigantic

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
between the original this is gigantic

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.650 
between the original this is gigantic
uses<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.260> lot<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.530> power<00:03:40.860> also<00:03:41.250> but<00:03:42.180> both<00:03:42.390> were

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
uses a lot of power also but both were

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.990 
uses a lot of power also but both were
really<00:03:43.019> great<00:03:43.260> machines<00:03:43.650> so<00:03:44.310> far<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.730> ps4

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
really great machines so far the ps4

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.430 
really great machines so far the ps4
doesn't<00:03:45.360> have<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.540> ton<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.810> games<00:03:46.049> but<00:03:46.320> it's

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
doesn't have a ton of games but it's

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.560
