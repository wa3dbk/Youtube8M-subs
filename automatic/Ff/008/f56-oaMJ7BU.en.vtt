00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.250
 and right now we have an area 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:14.639
 very loving because we are creating this 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:19.320
 much and in the end we do not exploit 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:23.779
 the opportunity looking today we did 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:28.220
 a great reaction immediately 2 0 and then 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.990
 we had to keep the ball running better 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.620
 as disturbing successes matches 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.969
 we took to play football 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.610
 a corner goal in my opinion in this 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.190
 we still have to miss Naples 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.440
 more aggressive more careful in phase 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:53.239
 defensive because it is not possible that 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:56.070
 they create so much and then we lose points 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.520
 in this door the worst start in the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.649
 last four seasons for this 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.350
 napoli's what that is missing is you 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:09.920
 broke something 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:14.180
 a team and coach no no then I say 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.600
 to all that the coach and on staff you have to 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.700
 rest assured because we are the 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.820
 team that goes down we have to 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.520
 improve the coach and I'm on staff 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.330
 doing like we did last year 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.340
 well last then i was not for nothing 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.479
 they have made a team that is 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.550
 well in the locker room then this already me 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.780
 I close you sure that we don't have 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.319
 problems 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.429
 the mister is working is helping 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:49.640
 then every day we come down 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:54.369
 in the field to prove no 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.840
 so for me it remains mixed out why 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:02.080
 we are the culprit 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:05.270
 in the end therefore as said 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.110
 offensively we are creating so much 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.810
 pity that we are not in defense 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.820
 still managed to improve from the field 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.370
 among the whistles of the bihar public 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.070
 supported right at the end he whistled 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.120
 a little and what you perceive in the environment 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.120
 you with the public 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:33.130
 this is fixed then 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.950
 we are like with them and they are like 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:41.230
 with us we all win together for everyone 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.300
 together how this way I can say that 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.570
 we must all be united and where 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.959
 we can help because now 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.600
 important that we will all come out together in 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:58.400
 this moment because the team can 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.830
 do well though as mentioned if we do 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.180
 well even on defense so 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.180
 we can do great things
