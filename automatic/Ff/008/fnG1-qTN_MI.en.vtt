works because you have that's cool okay
so<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.250> have<00:00:11.639> this<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.240> came<00:00:12.509> all<00:00:12.900> together<00:00:13.139> we

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
so I have this this came all together we

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.609 
so I have this this came all together we
have<00:00:14.250> an<00:00:14.460> i<00:00:14.580> if<00:00:14.880> there<00:00:15.059> was<00:00:15.240> no<00:00:15.509> lens<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:16.260> front

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
have an i if there was no lens in front

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.160 
have an i if there was no lens in front
then<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.550> lens<00:00:17.880> would<00:00:18.119> go<00:00:18.300> here<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.930> there

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
then the lens would go here and there

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.750 
then the lens would go here and there
would<00:00:19.320> be<00:00:19.350> no<00:00:19.590> focusing<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.430> I'd<00:00:20.520> have<00:00:20.730> a

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
would be no focusing and I'd have a

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.000 
would be no focusing and I'd have a
choppin<00:00:21.210> really<00:00:21.660> difficult<00:00:22.140> time<00:00:22.350> seeing

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
choppin really difficult time seeing

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.140 
choppin really difficult time seeing
anything<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:24.150> if<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:25.160> the<00:00:26.160> correct<00:00:26.580> lens

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
anything but if I have the correct lens

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.150 
anything but if I have the correct lens
then<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.300> focuses<00:00:30.900> quite<00:00:31.170> nicely<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.949> back

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
then it focuses quite nicely on the back

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.900 
then it focuses quite nicely on the back
of<00:00:32.460> my<00:00:32.940> eyeball<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.200> see<00:00:34.410> quite<00:00:34.649> well

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
of my eyeball and I can see quite well

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.660 
of my eyeball and I can see quite well
if<00:00:35.910> my<00:00:36.210> eyeball<00:00:36.750> isn't<00:00:37.260> perfect<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.489> fact

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
if my eyeball isn't perfect and in fact

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.790 
if my eyeball isn't perfect and in fact
I'm<00:00:38.969> pretty<00:00:39.300> old<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.230> not<00:00:40.440> perfect<00:00:47.780> then

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
I'm pretty old so it's not perfect then

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.540 
I'm pretty old so it's not perfect then
for<00:00:49.800> instance<00:00:50.449> maybe<00:00:51.449> Michael<00:00:52.110> my<00:00:52.590> eyes<00:00:52.829> focus

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
for instance maybe Michael my eyes focus

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.930 
for instance maybe Michael my eyes focus
the<00:00:54.000> light<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.390> little<00:00:54.690> bit<00:00:54.809> too<00:00:55.289> soon<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.940> then

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the light a little bit too soon and then

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.880 
the light a little bit too soon and then
what<00:00:57.180> do<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.360> need<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.780> need<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:58.020> corrective<00:00:58.620> lens

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
what do I need I need a corrective lens

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.880 
what do I need I need a corrective lens
so<00:00:59.789> if<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.030> take<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.449> right<00:01:00.660> corrective<00:01:01.320> lens<00:01:01.559> I

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
so if I take the right corrective lens I

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.910 
so if I take the right corrective lens I
can<00:01:02.370> put<00:01:02.579> glasses<00:01:03.239> out<00:01:03.420> here<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.080> then

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
can put glasses out here and then

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.260 
can put glasses out here and then
that's<00:01:06.730> changes<00:01:07.570> it<00:01:07.720> so<00:01:07.930> that<00:01:08.110> now<00:01:08.290> I<00:01:08.320> have<00:01:08.710> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
that's changes it so that now I have the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.990 
that's changes it so that now I have the
the<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:11.110> light<00:01:11.320> all<00:01:11.560> focusing<00:01:12.460> on<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.700> back

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
the the light all focusing on the back

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.630 
the the light all focusing on the back
of<00:01:13.210> my<00:01:13.360> eyeball<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:14.170> can<00:01:14.410> see<00:01:14.620> nicely<00:01:14.920> and<00:01:15.520> I

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
of my eyeball and I can see nicely and I

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.240 
of my eyeball and I can see nicely and I
do<00:01:15.700> it<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:17.650> I<00:01:17.680> can<00:01:17.980> do<00:01:18.100> it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
do it so I can do it

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.270 
do it so I can do it
with<00:01:18.520> that<00:01:18.729> one<00:01:19.150> or<00:01:19.390> if<00:01:19.900> I<00:01:20.050> have<00:01:20.290> a<00:01:20.500> different

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.600 

different<00:01:24.280> eyes<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:25.630> one<00:01:25.869> in<00:01:25.990> particular

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
different eyes this one in particular

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.330 
different eyes this one in particular
focuses<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.640> little<00:01:27.970> bit<00:01:28.119> too<00:01:28.330> far<00:01:29.010> so<00:01:30.010> I<00:01:30.040> need<00:01:30.310> a

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
focuses a little bit too far so I need a

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:41.070 
focuses a little bit too far so I need a
different<00:01:30.640> kind<00:01:31.030> of<00:01:39.570> try<00:01:40.570> putting<00:01:40.930> the
