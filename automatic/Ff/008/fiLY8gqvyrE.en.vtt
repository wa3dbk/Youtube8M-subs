00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.359
 the Apollo and welcome to another video review on the Ekici 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:18.039
 Today, let's take a look at how easy it is to check 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.599
 Give up Ecstasy this is more with the does the C class does and l what it does 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.400
 wants different HTC Peep keyboards so there 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.950
 so want us so that by looking at an e-mail Canes him 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.270
 deleted 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.360
 and percent try to write a message I want to 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.360
 I am sorry but not always met exactly it is reasonably 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.350
 Hard to hold the device without wobbling into the camera 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.230
 then to watch that ZDF 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.560
 Per cent that the camera is right to and is and that you then as well 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.489
 Device review can because it is then hidden under camera 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.530
 who so that you can poison the letters as well 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.900
 unfortunately a few 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.420
 spelling mistake 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.880
 It does not really happen otherwise because you can really relatively easy 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.810
 and well after Lite Maxis sees this going off give it a go 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.330
 of course in the high view but of course also in landscape mode without 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.049
 issues 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.150
 with sadness I have a little bit bigger keyboard 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.719
 but just test it 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:21.779
 if that's the message to us with percentages Biden, that's what we do 

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:23.520
 because that works as usual 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.090
 very fast and I can be so easy and fast 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.640
 enter my messages 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.060
 as I said here 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.810
 is that a typing is not quite easy wealth on the tripod and rarely the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.100
 Screens only 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.790
 can pull over the screen of my camera 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.870
 and thus 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.560
 me a few times 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.230
 deepened when I've deepened now times 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.280
 I can with the tractor before I do not know if you ever go is quite good 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.440
 Anyone can take the place in the governing one that I mistype myself 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.009
 have 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.909
 and just with back 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.730
 correct the mistake 4 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.900
 also in cream or USD you can also type i in landscape mode so now this is 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.250
 cult already corrected or even the 2c him too 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.250
 Darcy 7 is easy 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:13.169
 You then have three different keyboards to choose from 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:17.469
 simply switching with the recruitment consultants can speak four keyboard 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:23.619
 we have the telephone keypad we know from normal phones 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:29.249
 where you call me 10% new posts than on 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 0 the night inside 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.670
 and Jamie can be here too so war you 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.959
 twice on the 1 I get a b 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.269
 Here I am deepened again is so Rita 4 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.950
 but that is not a mistake and I already saw him like something in the back 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:46.099
 comic cities with the judges "The hook child so he still undertook with the 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.719
 Model compact QWERTZ mode so that have died on almost every 2 where and 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:52.489
 if I have the second letter and waves 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.439
 neither do I just have two Vatican we have their contributions 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.569
 set keyboard to me, for example, that press every time he gives his tone 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.090
 while typing is Rehrener some feedback can be on the easiest kick the 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:04.879
 is quite good he realizes you have tilted 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.639
 and you can also qualify the keyboard what you know done 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.189
 where to go 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.189
 then you also have to the user's dictionary 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.359
 where you can do your own Bertin 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.489
 and of course you would also have the opportunity to ADTECH predictions 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.649
 I did not do what I did not do as I hope in Swiss German 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:25.550
 screams and Dakar can Dictionary is present from David c 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.820
 That's why I'll just let this write for me for myself 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.040
 Percent introduction to the keyboard II there would be otherwise in others 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.889
 Race video of us can still quietly look at the project Ghanzi 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.119
 as described by HTC 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.269
 Of course you can aesthetize in portrait and landscape mode like I do here 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.799
 Show it once and that can be thank you for looking
