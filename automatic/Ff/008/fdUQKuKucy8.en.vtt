00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.120
 as a child I did not join any link 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.799
 with the world of medicine, a lot happened 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.720
 time with my father who had a 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.810
 textile production factory and that 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.289
 always told me susana worked with 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.630
 passion 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.029
 it was when he got seriously ill 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.430
 and I was 17 years old that I became interested in 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.530
 the medicine 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.310
 dermatology is a very specialty 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.810
 difficult very complex and very unknown 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.310
 during the residency of patients 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.930
 with advanced melanoma and I went into 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.750
 contact with the harshness of this 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.520
 devastating disease a new world is 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.200
 opened for me when my teacher gave me 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.809
 the first dermatoscope and encouraged me to 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.340
 use it I realized that the 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.320
 early diagnosis of the 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.320
 Melanoma would save lives 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.079
 I can not say what is more important to me 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.659
 daily practice if the training the 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.399
 research or clinical practice the 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.229
 training in early diagnosis of 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.939
 new generations of dermatologists but 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.560
 also from other doctors is 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.689
 really very important 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.490
 in terms of research what it captures 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.590
 my interest at this moment are the 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.600
 genetic factors that modify both 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.600
 risk as the evolution of melanoma 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.680
 I love working with young people 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.090
 biologists geneticists researchers 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.560
 computer because this is the way of 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.840
 involve new generations of 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.270
 researchers and this is the path of 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.159
 translational research so that 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.860
 innovations in research and innovation 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.330
 be effective in a short time for 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.330
 improve the health of our population 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.910
 as a dermatologist my utopia is to think that 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.440
 in the near future 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.440
 nobody is going to die that melanoma 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.830
 I travel all over the world to form 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.020
 dermatologists and other physicians in 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.820
 dermatoscopy because I'm convinced 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.740
 that the most effective way to decrease the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.810
 Melanoma mortality is through 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.150
 early diagnosis that should be 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.800
 accessible around the world and involve 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.800
 all health sectors 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.380
 I have a reputation for being hardworking and is 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.080
 I really work a lot but also 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.790
 I need to disconnect so being a 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.790
 very active person I recover my 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.439
 balance doing exercise 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.840
 and with my daughter at the time she studies 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:30.670
 design I have also rediscovered life 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.670
 cultural of Barcelona that I love 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.830
 for me it is surprising that the skin is 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.390
 a great unknown allows us 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.190
 interact with others and their 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.380
 integrity is essential for our 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.880
 self-esteem because there are patients who 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.590
 they observe that something is not going well in 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.550
 their skin and are unable to go to 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.319
 ask for help is about fear panic 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.330
 denial of reality does not stop 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.190
 surprise me and at the same time it's a stimulus 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.730
 I continue to keep working so that 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.730
 this change
