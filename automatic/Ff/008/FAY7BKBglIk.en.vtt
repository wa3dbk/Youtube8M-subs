00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:08.849
 hello my regular package has arrived 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.210
 from China was but surprisingly just 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:17.779
 miserable 12 days for that thank you very much 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:21.689
 the seller that here should be 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:24.859
 universal motorcycle speedometer 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.380
 speedometer digital speedometer with and 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:33.199
 monochrome display 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.199
 let's see what yes how 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:01.530
 I have been looking for him for a long time internally but with us 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.899
 I decided to order this time there because speed 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.720
 surprised parcel so came quickly 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.840
 I really asked the seller 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.369
 that the parcel is fast and it is not strong 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.369
 set off very quickly 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.880
 on the track I'm looking for of course no killed for 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.880
 what else is possible 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:57.170
 packaged perfectly together the whole I inspected 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.130
 I think here it is all we have left plans 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.130
 strong whole 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.910
 Here it looks like this to see she does not 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:35.880
 super 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:39.120
 on a sad little bit so near the field we 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:45.260
 got ignition instead of dashboard 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:56.460
 the panels for me are shock 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:03:05.580
 it's super damping denounced the 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:13.410
 what I wanted a bummer on the track did not break 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:35.100
 looked so kit these details of color 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:43.950
 a little bit different of course gorgeous 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:47.070
 chic so they got it all 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.840
 that I should have been a little sorry 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.120
 Of course that did not get the dashboard 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.570
 but I think it still affects us 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.340
 the instrument will arrive 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.340
 Thank you all.
