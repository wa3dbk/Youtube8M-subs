00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.570

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.210

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.969

 worn and totally tattered so that 

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:10.590
 Totale contrary to our cases 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.009
 which we value on high quality 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.749
 lay material and slim design 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.240
 I got them out anyway and 

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:20.069
 laid on the table because what me 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.249
 Maybe we should notice ours 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:25.529
 Accountants do not stand out but in 

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:27.359
 the moment where I mean in mine 

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:29.520
 purse my wallet on mine 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:32.369
 covers lie kuntzl the tax adviser the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.869
 forehead and say and advise of them 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.859
 but I already have a suitable one there 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.759
 set expected 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.689
 they have nothing of cover up there 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.659
 the decision stuck 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:48.400
 i need a riot purse 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:50.920
 small slender plain kawalek 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.560
 at our on our next visit 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.410
 in my factory I mean that 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.940
 develop dream gold dream purse 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.440
 to let 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.730
 a day later was my personal 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.570
 had to finish and I was right 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.840
 happy 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.100
 and yes, a bit proud 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.810
 to have complete set 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.550
 It was never planned at this time 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.560
 that we have your wallet in ours 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.960
 we were going to have an assortment 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.090
 absolutely no head for it 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.220
 Because we had one year with Carina 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.940
 previously started correctly and was still 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.850
 fully involved 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.780
 our ipad or iphone assortment 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.670
 build and establish 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.709
 but in the aftermath I always have 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.750
 again my mindset tweeted 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.300
 respectively posted on instagram 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.040
 and so our surprise has the 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.380
 Purse weird a lot 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.740
 attention and positive feedback 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.959
 get from you and then we started 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.080
 We should think about it all at once 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.880
 We should not make purses 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.650
 speaks for what speaks against it 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.590
 We have different patterns 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.800
 Let's think about size and shape and 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.959
 now I hold the hands here 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.959
 first riot money munich
