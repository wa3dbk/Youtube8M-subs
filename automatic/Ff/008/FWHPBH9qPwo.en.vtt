00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.920
 and today will be with us 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.559
 interesting azik 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:14.129
 This is not the same on the mod however, notice that 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.689
 adds this mod allows 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.849
 he allows to play such a game under 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:22.179
 by name 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:24.189
 milan bomber jacket yes it's like a bomberman 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.880
 just some short version without 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:30.070
 any beans without any diaries 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.760
 there should be a multiplayer rather 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:37.320
 there should be interest all over 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.770
 visibility this mod came out not so long ago and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.830
 so he has bugs here 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.070
 oil is recorded noticeable is creeping 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:51.550
 errors creak could not be 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.060
 The problem is, let's just start 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:00.040
 break everything on this map 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:01.570
 the house will be a little boring for some 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.239
 those who did not play bender man 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.570
 I do not know how to explain I do not know me 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.110
 like this toy it to me all the time 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.880
 very much we can like this through 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.930
 textures like this and for 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.790
 what bugs on could so here so 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.310
 walk well as ordinary 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.780
 shop or gayvera 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.640
 and so 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:33.810
 it is in theory the same bomber, we 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:37.159
 nothing at all unless the engine sometimes 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.159
 better sauce like 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:46.719
 I don't know what kind of girl it is 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.719
 anton adds Phil 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.970
 let's perhaps here and so are broken down as 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.870
 we have another watermelon can 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:02.820
 present two 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:07.170
 that's cool on business yes i seem dead and 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.360
 she was breaking through the visible 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.450
 here and so that you can be remembered 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:21.700
 press space is true we have skills 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:24.690
 gone and everything so say yes what 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.660
 The usual bomber mining screen is here 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.680
 mission for not starting and every 10 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.810
 generated by 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.800
 I have not tested the surface yet and it seems 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.800
 would be the third time playing 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:43.140
 here and so everything explode find 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.829
 I just loved it and so sad 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.829
 chic 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.500
 here and here 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:05.730
 i will be just a mixture 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.730
 I want to do a very big bang 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.230
 so ok was 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:28.110
 not bad I exaggerated a little bit and we 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.110
 play that 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.530
 I think everyone knows about this cool 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:43.549
 toy explain everything current is not nothing 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:52.609
 such a short short addon 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:55.400
 we have here more precisely mod mode hat we 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.170
 picked up I do not know in the usual in Germany 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.810
 there seems to be no such modifications that 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.540
 on pick you buy la pack at home i'm she 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.200
 adds flow effects you will be strong 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.120
 blow up all that but something is here 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.409
 add to put your new id and since i 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:16.880
 I see it falls down like this but there 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:20.590
 it was not a hat and I could not archive 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.590
 not an explosion effect 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.000
 check get a hat 7 of some kind and 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.000
 bomb 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 as 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:38.219
 I do not understand where I have a powerful explosion 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.219
 appeared because your head 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.950
 I think the fuel did not pick up any 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.730
 now i picked up 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.940
 what is our short addon 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.940
 for now i will probably write one more and 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.340
 in general, I sit by the window in general, all here 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.880
 for some reason we can jump this way 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.450
 we can even through the textures the feast will come 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:14.910
 so here is a map of us so small 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:17.610
 even this is how they understand 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.850
 why such a big card can still 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.130
 increase because that rink which with 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.290
 by boxes 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.140
 I do not know I hope to add here 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.940
 more any shit that was 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.710
 standard here germany more 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.370
 all thrash explosions and 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:37.770
 zombies monster it can be arranged i 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.130
 I think the family creator of this but 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.080
 could do something like that could 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.510
 do a tattoo bykov there I do not know 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.750
 ant lions there still remember shit 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.210
 cram everything and everything would be cool 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:56.960
 this could play caftan I do not know 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:58.990
 like a time killer on here so here 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.990
 and 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.480
 I want to try to catch the whole line 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.480
 necessarily 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.150
 they lacked stupidly 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.639
 kashira 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:24.040
 it is not enough for him that he too 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.770
 enough and from google and books and 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.780
 subscribe channel put likes 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:31.830
