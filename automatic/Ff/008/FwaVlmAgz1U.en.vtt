00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.910
 video of minecraft and good guys 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.769
 stable I bring a new calls 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.570
 poor are vice poles you can already 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.810
 imagine what that good reason adds 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.340
 if in mineral zombies and power not 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.869
 let's start first with the zombies 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.269
 that appear in all the biomes that 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.269
 would be the one of coal the one of iron and 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.119
 the one of and the one of colo is the one of the coal the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.340
 of iron and gold and well, these 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.960
 these zombies good is first the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.460
 texture like to see the textures almost 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.160
 They do not change in any just you 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.600
 puts in this part quotations of the mineral of 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.030
 that is in this case the yellow gold 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.780
 as you can see here and well as 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.460
 you can see the gold has 50 life and 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.649
 let's put me in came model in game or 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.059
 20 to see the speed that has 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.699
 the truth is brutal 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.670
 here, here the truth is 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.609
 you get with pop with little armor and you 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.300
 fuck this young man and good if this one the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:07.140
 zombies approach you loose from 0 to 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.530
 2 golden gold let's remove this 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.380
 ok the iron can not see also 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.700
 he has 50 life and he releases you from 0 to 2 of 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.939
 iron 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.090
 the coal as you can see has 40 of 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.850
 life but less than the others 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.369
 and you also loose from 0 to 2 carbon 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.890
 ok ok now let's move on to the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.780
 zombies that appear in the deserts in 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.490
 the forests in the swamps and in the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.219
 plains that will be the one of 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.009
 emerald the diamond and the 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:40.530
 redstone the redstone it lets go 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.240
 from 3 to 10 of network this we are going to put it 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.250
 here and this one is also pretty fast 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.049
 It has 60 life as you can see as 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.479
 can see her and she goes crazy for 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.729
 how fast it is and we are missing from 3 to 10 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.360
 redstone in this case we think that 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.510
 two there will not be three more 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.850
 good the diamond the zombie diamond 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.340
 it's pretty fast the truth I think it's 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.350
 the fastest of all has 70 of life 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.290
 not these 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.690
 and also releases us from 0 to 2 of 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.700
 diamond so let's drop this for 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.410
 here and let's move on first to the day 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.360
 which is also pretty fast almost 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.250
 same as the diamond and fast and 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.709
 It also has 70 life equal to that of 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.750
 diamond and but good an offer of 0 to 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.780
 2 emerald in this case not if not loose 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.550
 did not jump a bad luck fence and then 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.220
 well let's move on now the one that comes out 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.130
 the neder that would be the quartz 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.510
 let's put it here and as you can see 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.160
 this time the texture so we change 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.050
 put us in game or of 1 and as 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.370
 you can see the texture will change as well as 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.430
 you can see there 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.760
 and he has 60 of life this are we are going to 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.700
 kill it and release us from 0 to 3 quartz 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.590
 to 0 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.209
 all the opis are pretty fast the 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.430
 truth is that the creative image for 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.290
 Do not bother me so much 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.870
 ok and now let's move on to the zombie that 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.030
 appears in the plains in the biomes of 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.280
 snow in the swamps in the plains 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.319
 normal in the deserts in the 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.420
 ends hills or as pronounced in 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.709
 the forests and in the frozen rivers of 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.330
 the zombie of lapis lazuli who is 60 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.120
 of life and as you can see they appear almost 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.250
 all the biomes lol and good we can to 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.060
 kill them is 60 life and this is not 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.360
 release 5 if I'm not wrong 5 to 10 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.069
 of lapis lazuli in this case not 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.650
 he released 5 the least that you can let go 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.690
 and well, if now we are going to spend a 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.519
 area to which they added this new version 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.250
 mode which had been the shit 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.049
 this does not appear any biome or anything like that 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.870
 we can only put it with the egg 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.819
 this and because it's not a real garbage like 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.010
 can see it has 40 life and the truth 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.690
 it does not do anything it's just quick as 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.079
 all the zombies that the monster adds 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.670
 not that they are quite fast and therefore 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.769
 good if this one the weakest of all 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.569
 because it does not appear anywhere or anything 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.579
 and well, good earthquakes 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.109
 guys this is pretty easy way 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.790
 the truth and well I hope that you have 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:02.260
 liked this mode do not forget to comment 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.260
