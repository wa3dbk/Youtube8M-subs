00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 It's me you and from here it's we'll see that 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:12.960
 lucas was an extraordinary man 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.440
 just you twitta he was a gentil of 6 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.720
 meaning that he was not a Jew 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.240
 he was not one of those waiting 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.220
 the messiah 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.439
 secondly we do not know the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.289
 details but he got in touch with the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.790
 gospel to anyone and became a 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.790
 follower of the apostle paul 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:45.750
 he went with Paul in many of the places 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:48.450
 paulo visited after saying he 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.960
 was a very close friend 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.289
 was a doctor so maybe he 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.800
 took care of the apostle was part of life 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.800
 his 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.710
 so the apostle had good 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.010
 about lucas where the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.750
 apostle Paul and in places that were 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.530
 churches erected 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.740
 he preached about Jesus and how he himself 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.810
 cites one of his epistles in which he spoke 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.380
 on the death of Christ on the cross 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.780
 this is the message of paulo according to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.750
 the apostle Paul and raising these 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.990
 many churches wondered who 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:36.840
 is this jesus what we should know more 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.650
 about what's so special about 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.780
 Jesus 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.250
 this was the question many asked themselves 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.290
 that Jews had understood that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.079
 they should expect the messiah 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.659
 they knew the prophecies then by 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.420
 prophetic interpretation they knew that 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.070
 should expect the messiah of jesus is the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.920
 Messiah 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.049
 but to the Gentiles of these cities 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.939
 they had no information about 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.299
 the messiah 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.340
 they did not expect the messiah as a gentle one 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.340
 Lucas had these questions in his mind. 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.250
 and sit 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.769
 are that the Indians had who is Jesus the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.180
 who has so special in him what is 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.730
 That's what he said that no one else 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.780
 said what he can do that no one 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.760
 more can right 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:28.209
 these were some of the questions and 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:30.760
 many of the apostle's churches and lucas 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:38.140
 realized that he should write about 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:43.150
 jesus write the life story of the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.799
 work and the ministry of Jesus and that 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.630
 It's what I did about Lucas. 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.630
 the church historian
