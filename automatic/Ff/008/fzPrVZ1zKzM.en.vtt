00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.350 
in and I've had a go at lift making a
little<00:02:04.620> crossing<00:02:05.400> here<00:02:05.580> for<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.940> cinnamon

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
little crossing here for the cinnamon

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.760 
little crossing here for the cinnamon
this<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:08.060> sleepers<00:02:09.060> from<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.509> picot<00:02:10.050> code<00:02:10.290> 100

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770

track<00:02:10.979> bits<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.790> cut<00:02:12.000> off<00:02:12.180> when<00:02:12.420> you

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
track bits I have to cut off when you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.570 
track bits I have to cut off when you
join<00:02:12.780> 50<00:02:13.080> plates<00:02:13.260> up<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.680> they're<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.340> glued

to some plastic guard and painted they

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.220 
to some plastic guard and painted they
look<00:02:17.310> quite<00:02:17.459> good<00:02:17.550> I'll<00:02:17.880> make<00:02:17.910> if<00:02:18.360> some<00:02:18.989> side

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
look quite good I'll make if some side

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.140 
look quite good I'll make if some side

pieces as well and quite effective also
there's<00:02:24.480> been<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.630> change<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.050> route<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:26.430> is

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
there's been a change of route this is

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.460 
there's been a change of route this is
the<00:02:26.640> middle<00:02:27.030> track<00:02:27.300> which<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.810> 47<00:02:28.380> is

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
the middle track which is the 47 is

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.000 
the middle track which is the 47 is
running<00:02:28.800> on

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
running on

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.780 
running on
now<00:02:30.250> follows<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:31.060> slightly<00:02:31.360> different<00:02:31.540> path

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
now follows a slightly different path

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.330 
now follows a slightly different path
I've<00:02:33.790> moved<00:02:33.970> this<00:02:34.209> point<00:02:34.590> which<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:36.040> point

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
I've moved this point which this point

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.009 
I've moved this point which this point
here<00:02:36.580> was<00:02:36.790> originally<00:02:37.239> over<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.629> this<00:02:37.750> side

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
here was originally over to this side

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.039 
here was originally over to this side
there<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.069> it<00:02:40.000> used<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.299> connect<00:02:40.599> this<00:02:40.750> track

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
there and it used to connect this track

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.530 
there and it used to connect this track
to<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.680> middle<00:02:41.920> track<00:02:42.159> but<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.060> problem<00:02:43.360> was

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
to the middle track but the problem was

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.559 
to the middle track but the problem was
if<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.959> ever<00:02:44.080> went<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.379> park<00:02:45.269> here<00:02:46.269> in<00:02:46.480> the

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
if you ever went to park here in the

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.039 
if you ever went to park here in the
station<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:48.459> ended<00:02:49.030> up<00:02:49.090> transferring<00:02:49.599> tracks

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
station you ended up transferring tracks

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.479 
station you ended up transferring tracks
when<00:02:50.319> you<00:02:50.440> walk<00:02:50.590> perhaps<00:02:50.920> wanted<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.280> stay<00:02:51.430> on

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
when you walk perhaps wanted to stay on

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.619 
when you walk perhaps wanted to stay on
the<00:02:51.580> middle<00:02:51.849> track<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.269> found<00:02:52.540> my

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
the middle track and I found my

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:53.970 
the middle track and I found my
passenger<00:02:53.049> trains<00:02:53.290> always<00:02:53.500> want<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.680> stay<00:02:53.950> on

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
passenger trains always want to stay on

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.309 
passenger trains always want to stay on
the<00:02:54.099> middle<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:55.180> now<00:02:55.330> every<00:02:55.599> ruse<00:02:55.840> of<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:56.110> I

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
the middle so now every ruse of it I

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.500 
the middle so now every ruse of it I
effectively<00:02:57.280> have<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.430> passing<00:02:57.940> loop<00:02:58.090> in<00:02:58.390> the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
effectively have a passing loop in the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.789 
effectively have a passing loop in the
middle<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.900> station<00:02:59.260> for<00:02:59.409> the<00:02:59.500> sensor

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
middle of the station for the sensor

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.539 
middle of the station for the sensor
track<00:03:01.079> so<00:03:02.079> I<00:03:02.110> can<00:03:02.349> come<00:03:02.530> along<00:03:02.739> where<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:02.950> 47

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
track so I can come along where the 47

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.970 
track so I can come along where the 47
is<00:03:03.670> now<00:03:03.849> or<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.720> can<00:03:04.930> come<00:03:05.079> along<00:03:05.260> this<00:03:05.410> side<00:03:05.680> and

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
is now or I can come along this side and

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.390 
is now or I can come along this side and
I<00:03:06.190> still<00:03:06.489> remain<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.530> actual<00:03:08.859> middle

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
I still remain in the actual middle

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.550 
I still remain in the actual middle
track<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.090> accidentally<00:03:10.780> transferring<00:03:11.470> to

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
track and I accidentally transferring to

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.120 
track and I accidentally transferring to
another<00:03:11.650> track

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.980 

this<00:03:16.670> makes<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.060> bit<00:03:17.210> easy<00:03:17.480> for<00:03:17.630> me<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:17.720> run

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
this makes it a bit easy for me to run

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.670 
this makes it a bit easy for me to run
stuff<00:03:18.260> so<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:20.090> inside<00:03:20.480> track<00:03:20.780> there's<00:03:21.410> this

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
stuff so the inside track there's this

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.000 
stuff so the inside track there's this
platform<00:03:22.000> this<00:03:23.000> platform<00:03:23.060> and<00:03:23.840> here

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
platform this platform and here

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
platform this platform and here
the<00:03:26.900> way<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:27.959> runs<00:03:28.140> through<00:03:28.409> there<00:03:28.849> and<00:03:29.849> also

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
the way it runs through there and also

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.360 
the way it runs through there and also
the<00:03:30.720> middle<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:31.019> track<00:03:31.200> now<00:03:31.409> has<00:03:31.739> this<00:03:32.099> track

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
the middle of track now has this track

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.130 
the middle of track now has this track
and<00:03:32.610> this<00:03:32.790> track<00:03:32.849> to<00:03:33.090> run<00:03:33.390> through<00:03:33.659> it's<00:03:33.959> only

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
and this track to run through it's only

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.869 
and this track to run through it's only
the<00:03:34.319> outside<00:03:34.769> that's<00:03:35.010> restricted<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.730> one

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
the outside that's restricted to one

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.300 
the outside that's restricted to one
lane<00:03:35.909> for<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.480> station<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.799> I'm<00:03:37.920> going<00:03:38.069> to<00:03:38.129> use

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
lane for the station so I'm going to use

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.119 
lane for the station so I'm going to use
that<00:03:38.459> line<00:03:38.640> as<00:03:38.849> a<00:03:38.930> dedicated<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:40.349> freight<00:03:40.890> line

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
that line as a dedicated a freight line

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.369 
that line as a dedicated a freight line
pretty<00:03:41.370> much<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:42.599> can<00:03:42.750> still<00:03:42.930> kick<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.200> still

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
pretty much and I can still kick I still

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:44.869 
pretty much and I can still kick I still
can't<00:03:43.620> transfer<00:03:44.069> at<00:03:44.129> all<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.459> so<00:03:44.519> I<00:03:44.610> can<00:03:44.760> use

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
can't transfer at all and so I can use

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.970 
can't transfer at all and so I can use
this<00:03:45.030> point<00:03:45.269> over<00:03:45.450> here<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.780> come<00:03:45.959> through<00:03:46.230> on

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
this point over here to come through on

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.270 
this point over here to come through on

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
crossing onto the middle track it's no

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.949 
crossing onto the middle track it's no

the full circuit back in about March I

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.940 
the full circuit back in about March I
just<00:03:57.780> accidentally<00:03:58.200> put<00:03:58.379> this<00:03:58.530> point<00:03:58.799> over

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
just accidentally put this point over

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.000 
just accidentally put this point over
here<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.400> then<00:03:59.970> realize<00:04:00.360> that<00:04:00.500> I'm<00:04:01.500> going

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
here and then realize that I'm going

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.809 
here and then realize that I'm going
into<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.489> wrong<00:04:02.670> tracks<00:04:03.230> so<00:04:04.609> that's<00:04:05.609> a

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
into the wrong tracks so that's a

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.009 
into the wrong tracks so that's a
improve<00:04:06.269> things<00:04:06.510> quite<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.870> bit

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.869 

I've<00:04:10.019> also<00:04:10.230> noticed<00:04:10.650> that<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.400> vaccine<00:04:11.849> is

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
I've also noticed that the vaccine is

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.509 
I've also noticed that the vaccine is
fully<00:04:12.269> up<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:12.750> fully<00:04:12.989> painted<00:04:13.519> excluding

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
fully up and fully painted excluding

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.110 
fully up and fully painted excluding
that<00:04:14.970> bit<00:04:15.150> over<00:04:15.359> there<00:04:15.540> ignore<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.530> bit

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
that bit over there ignore that bit

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.490 
that bit over there ignore that bit
please<00:04:18.120> speak<00:04:18.329> enough<00:04:18.539> to<00:04:18.720> fill<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.019> space<00:04:19.289> it

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
please speak enough to fill the space it

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.890 
please speak enough to fill the space it
was<00:04:19.560> just<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.829> bit<00:04:19.949> too<00:04:19.979> long<00:04:20.419> it<00:04:21.419> comes<00:04:21.660> all<00:04:21.810> the

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
was just a bit too long it comes all the

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.219 
was just a bit too long it comes all the
way<00:04:21.930> along<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.800> it<00:04:23.400> just<00:04:23.930> keeps<00:04:24.930> everything

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
way along and it just keeps everything

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.960 
way along and it just keeps everything
looking<00:04:25.590> clean<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:25.889> keeps<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:26.520> looking<00:04:26.850> at

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
looking clean and keeps you looking at

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.360 
looking clean and keeps you looking at
the<00:04:27.060> layout<00:04:27.240> rather<00:04:27.690> than<00:04:27.960> all<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.740> boxes<00:04:29.190> and

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
the layout rather than all the boxes and

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.180 
the layout rather than all the boxes and
things<00:04:29.550> are<00:04:29.910> actually<00:04:30.150> hiding<00:04:30.599> behind<00:04:31.190> it's

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
things are actually hiding behind it's

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.190 
things are actually hiding behind it's
pretty<00:04:32.400> good<00:04:32.669> we<00:04:33.419> want<00:04:33.599> to<00:04:33.660> try<00:04:33.870> and<00:04:34.020> go<00:04:34.080> around

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
pretty good we want to try and go around

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:48.260 
pretty good we want to try and go around
you'll<00:04:34.500> see<00:04:34.530> there<00:04:34.950> it's<00:04:35.940> a<00:04:36.030> lot<00:04:36.180> neater<00:04:36.840> now

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.939 

the<00:04:48.750> vaccine<00:04:49.169> runs<00:04:49.410> all<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.650> way<00:04:49.740> around

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
the vaccine runs all the way around

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:58.290 
the vaccine runs all the way around
there

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.620 

so<00:04:59.520> that's<00:05:00.520> pretty<00:05:00.730> much<00:05:00.820> what's<00:05:01.180> been<00:05:01.360> going

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
so that's pretty much what's been going

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.890 
so that's pretty much what's been going
on

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
on

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.800 
on
I'll<00:05:02.020> just<00:05:02.200> put<00:05:02.350> this<00:05:03.210> CMD<00:05:04.210> we've<00:05:04.690> been

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
I'll just put this CMD we've been

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.080 
I'll just put this CMD we've been
installed<00:05:05.200> and<00:05:05.440> just<00:05:05.680> various<00:05:06.010> other<00:05:06.160> little

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
installed and just various other little

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.520 
installed and just various other little
bits<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:07.420> pieces<00:05:07.980> this<00:05:08.980> track<00:05:09.310> over<00:05:09.640> here

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
bits and pieces this track over here

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.640 
bits and pieces this track over here
this<00:05:11.530> one<00:05:11.770> will<00:05:12.550> run<00:05:12.760> round<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.180> corner

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
this one will run round the corner

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.750 
this one will run round the corner
underneath<00:05:14.650> the<00:05:14.830> road<00:05:15.010> it<00:05:15.220> will<00:05:15.280> be<00:05:15.400> disguised

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
underneath the road it will be disguised

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.250 
underneath the road it will be disguised
this<00:05:16.000> wall<00:05:16.180> that<00:05:16.210> end<00:05:16.540> up<00:05:16.630> as<00:05:16.750> a<00:05:16.780> road<00:05:17.020> bridge

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
this wall that end up as a road bridge

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.180 
this wall that end up as a road bridge
sort<00:05:17.680> of<00:05:17.770> here

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
sort of here

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.190 
sort of here
it<00:05:18.730> will<00:05:18.850> run<00:05:18.970> round<00:05:19.240> here<00:05:19.570> and<00:05:19.750> I'll<00:05:19.930> be<00:05:20.050> more

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
it will run round here and I'll be more

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.870 
it will run round here and I'll be more
sightings<00:05:20.650> along<00:05:20.770> this<00:05:21.040> side<00:05:21.280> to<00:05:21.460> store<00:05:21.700> more

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
sightings along this side to store more

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.790 
sightings along this side to store more
locos<00:05:22.360> and<00:05:22.630> stuff<00:05:22.840> and<00:05:23.140> I<00:05:23.440> might<00:05:23.620> make<00:05:23.770> a

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
locos and stuff and I might make a

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.070 
locos and stuff and I might make a
little<00:05:23.980> refueling<00:05:24.580> point<00:05:24.880> and<00:05:25.060> get<00:05:26.050> a

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
little refueling point and get a

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.610 
little refueling point and get a
maintenance<00:05:26.620> shed<00:05:26.830> in<00:05:26.950> and<00:05:27.100> stuff

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
maintenance shed in and stuff

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.860 
maintenance shed in and stuff
so<00:05:29.620> what<00:05:29.890> I'll<00:05:30.550> leave<00:05:31.210> you<00:05:31.360> with<00:05:31.480> a<00:05:31.510> couple<00:05:31.810> of

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
so what I'll leave you with a couple of

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.150 
so what I'll leave you with a couple of
clips<00:05:32.050> of<00:05:32.230> trains<00:05:32.470> run<00:05:32.740> and<00:05:34.770> that's<00:05:35.770> it<00:05:35.980> for

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
clips of trains run and that's it for

00:05:36.160 --> 00:06:49.460 
clips of trains run and that's it for
now

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470
