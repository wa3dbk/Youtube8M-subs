00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.450

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.990
 that there will be stuff that will not cost 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.840
 expensive with but this model good morning because 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.359
 that we wanted to answer the questions of 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.920
 our viewers on facebook and 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.810
 Sato inspired chronicle this morning 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.400
 starting with the question of roxane 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.320
 denis who wants to have stuff 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.199
 because good the expenses were very 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.610
 present in December said I'm losing you 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.070
 a lot of my budget to art in 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.050
 January as many women I try 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.239
 to draw how can we roll back 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.760
 the hollywood sauce and the sauce yes because 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.620
 that it's January 15th we were a little 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.809
 more per year a big holiday season 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.059
 we have the complexion but we want to be in 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.710
 vote yes the means it is sincerely 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.379
 that we were maybe under 9 years old 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.539
 in the time by better it's the jack 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.520
 day cream is over it's the goal 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.230
 in England it's all the time there 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.109
 then it ends all the time while 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.460
 same time the countries of the tales is melted 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.449
 talked about it in the beginning that it's con 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.720
 but in the bottom of the bottle 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.189
 but actually the fountain aspect 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.159
 often to go to my 18 years and 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.750
 massot two weeks three weeks of 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.520
 more how to do but what I do you 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.900
 suggests that with a fountain you 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.610
 can use if you use a 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.400
 fountain still quite expensive 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.350
 you retire by mixing it with 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.189
 a moisturizer and still not 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.619
 very expensive 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.720
 take for example if I have one 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.240
 can find at least 15 dollars in 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.820
 pharmacy that you take a share of 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.619
 hockey foundation as well as a part 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.040
 so instead of having two three hits 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.310
 fist 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.049
 take a moisturizer 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.670
 wanted to mix together then at this 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.590
 moment there to see her play 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.090
 yes you go firing and they you 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.689
 are going to have like a little the effect of a 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.540
 bb cream 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.250
 Ah yes 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.660
 I tend to take my cream 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.880
 day then to do that is when it's 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.230
 a very good beauty gesture because in 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.470
 same time while depending your cream of 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.590
 day 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.870
 if you have a fps but at the same time 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.760
 you will protect your skin with that 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.590
 it's a good way to thierry when we 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.770
 look also at the level of the foundation 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.720
 for to close a little bit is that if they 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.040
 go on vacation during the time of the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.350
 parties or three months of january february 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.550
 a document in the south comes the 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.590
 their foundation and then the good 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.120
 color no it's true so buy 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.980
 you a pale color and a color 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.950
 dark room and can make January 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.590
 to July in the doses together the 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.209
 mixes ahead the right tone he 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.130
 do not have to have five fountains 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.950
 different depending on your complexion 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.770
 during the year it's good video we can 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.750
 do everything with the powder also yes but 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:46.000
 that's it pulls and hurts after some 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:48.280
 thing to adhere to he swears by the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.690
 yard if we look at the level this does not 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.320
 was finally doing what do we do 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.530
 long fire 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.120
 messari precisely could answer me 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.130
 then you can take a tour 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.530
 eye drops that you're going 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.760

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.700

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.290
 side of your tea cup as if he's the 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.750

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.360
 like when you were little so that's 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.070
 a little paw and to go out on 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.489
 pigman scene you can make a line 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.840
 which she defined with that 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:21.070
 really they will really do the 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.799
 eyelid and another thing if you are 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.570
 on vacation and you want to do me 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.450
 a ride you forgot there is the 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.150
 their at home is taking a mascara 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.400
 water repellent as it is then you take 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.970
 when you take off you take the door 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.010
 waterproof mascara with your brush 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.380
 bevel you are going to get the pass 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.739
 like that and you make a line then 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.900
 it becomes allen which is the test of 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.580
 water and karine little great idea 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.049
 because you did not know on the ground but no 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.430
 sir post at all is actively 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.920
 for the powder I tended to 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.720
 replace the same but i feel pau given 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.220
 except that it flies away quickly in the 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.410
 day is not so pronounced 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.209
 if it's over like houses so 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.190
 it's a great way to save a 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:07.450
 beautiful ring but here I commit you as 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.130

 dance on 6 but launch the woods 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.820
 keep eyebrows like we have more at 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.959
 instead of buying yourself a safe casing if 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.220
 you have to take shadows to 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.799
 eyelids in neutral tones 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.940
 or brown or any two wheels 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.280
 depending on the color of your hair 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.840

 I will use a burn like that for 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:50.669

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.669

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.680
 instead of going you buy a new 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.630
 blush in January where you can 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.490

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.660

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.550
 dollar but you will be able

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.400
 the trouble on women's issues 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.140
 either because I think of because our 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:44.120
 cameraman here who complained about it all 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:46.340
 scrapped but frankly given as 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.590
 economic thing earthquake in small

 pots like that in the dollarama 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.210
 yes then you can mix either a 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.790
 bond carmex or a bis text that 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:07:00.650
 was a leap that is restorative with 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:01.600
 your favorite lipstick september 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.320
 where I was going 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.150

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.000
 play it 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.250
 then you can mix a step not 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.200
 of notebook with a share of red to 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:17.050
 lips and you can arrange it on a 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.690
 pillbox 1 or in small jars like 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:22.360
 that had to mention also that we can 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.900
 take all our old lipstick and 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.610
 make new colors its rights 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.690
 jallet that is useless we have not

 used for a long time 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.980
 start mixing the colors of 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:36.100
 same tone is more mixed with 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.930
 a spatula well in and you make a 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.160
 custom lipstick palette 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.690
 with all your old lipstick it's 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.600
 the purchase option that we would really have 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.650
 no time to do everything one last 

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.730
 often we use wipes and
