00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
protein now you just add a little bit of

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.740 
protein now you just add a little bit of
water<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.920> texture<00:01:14.430> we're<00:01:14.610> trying<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.600> get

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
water the texture we're trying to get

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.609 
water the texture we're trying to get
here<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.020> more<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.799> UH<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.189> thicker<00:01:17.670> texture

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
here is more of a UH a thicker texture

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.050 
here is more of a UH a thicker texture
muddied<00:01:19.619> up<00:01:19.710> add<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.159> little<00:01:20.340> bit<00:01:20.610> too<00:01:20.820> much

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
muddied up add it a little bit too much

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.760 
muddied up add it a little bit too much
here<00:01:22.189> we'll<00:01:23.189> see

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
you basically just want to have it so

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.330 
you basically just want to have it so
that<00:01:31.450> there's<00:01:32.170> no<00:01:32.380> more<00:01:32.620> clumps<00:01:33.100> in<00:01:33.190> the

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
that there's no more clumps in the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.390 
that there's no more clumps in the
protein<00:01:33.790> powder<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.800> peanut<00:01:36.100> butter<00:01:36.130> is

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
protein powder but the peanut butter is

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:48.090 
protein powder but the peanut butter is
not<00:01:36.610> all<00:01:36.760> stuck<00:01:37.090> together<00:01:37.270> or<00:01:37.720> anything<00:01:47.100> all
