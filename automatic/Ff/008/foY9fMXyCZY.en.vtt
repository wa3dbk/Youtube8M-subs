00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
is the safe way we go to wolves I didn't

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.210 
is the safe way we go to wolves I didn't
lose<00:02:44.640> any<00:02:44.910> HP<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.870> tower<00:02:46.049> so<00:02:46.560> they<00:02:46.920> don't<00:02:47.130> know

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
lose any HP and tower so they don't know

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.009 
lose any HP and tower so they don't know
I'm<00:02:47.340> gonna<00:02:47.549> do<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.819> but<00:02:48.360> I'm<00:02:48.510> going<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.780> move

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
I'm gonna do this but I'm going to move

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.780 
I'm gonna do this but I'm going to move
with<00:02:49.200> our<00:02:49.319> items<00:02:49.680> I'm<00:02:50.010> gonna<00:02:50.250> start<00:02:50.459> wolves

with our items I'm gonna start wolves

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.170 
with our items I'm gonna start wolves
these<00:02:51.209> these<00:02:51.660> are<00:02:51.930> probably<00:02:52.349> the<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:53.340> slowest

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
these these are probably the the slowest

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.390 
these these are probably the the slowest
way<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.840> do<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.230> because<00:02:55.680> as<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.069> can<00:02:56.220> see

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
way to do this because as you can see

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.610 
way to do this because as you can see
I'm<00:02:56.519> wasting<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:57.030> lot<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.209> time<00:02:57.470> but<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.560> the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
I'm wasting a lot of time but in the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.650 
I'm wasting a lot of time but in the
moment<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.920> die<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.340> just<00:02:59.610> go<00:02:59.730> into<00:02:59.910> my<00:03:00.000> passive<00:03:00.480> I

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
moment I die I just go into my passive I

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.660 
moment I die I just go into my passive I
kill<00:03:01.079> wolves<00:03:01.440> there<00:03:01.920> are<00:03:02.010> three<00:03:02.220> walls<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:02.610> I

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
kill wolves there are three walls so I

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.509 
kill wolves there are three walls so I
can<00:03:02.879> level<00:03:03.150> 3<00:03:03.329> I<00:03:03.450> go<00:03:03.569> level<00:03:03.900> 2<00:03:04.019> sorry<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.620> right

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519
