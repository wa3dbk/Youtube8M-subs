this<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:01.829> a<00:00:01.860> hydrogen<00:00:02.220> somnium<00:00:02.820> ice<00:00:02.939> I've<00:00:03.120> been

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
this is a hydrogen somnium ice I've been

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.369 
this is a hydrogen somnium ice I've been
working<00:00:03.659> on<00:00:03.810> this<00:00:04.500> dl<00:00:04.859> it<00:00:05.009> is<00:00:05.130> is<00:00:06.379> 317

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
plate and put it in series down here we

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.410 
plate and put it in series down here we
have<00:00:13.019> positive<00:00:13.860> contact<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.210> inner

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
have positive contact to the inner

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.320 
have positive contact to the inner
plates<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.710> though<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.070> secondary<00:00:18.029> plates

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
plates and though the secondary plates

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.620 
plates and though the secondary plates
are<00:00:18.720> negative<00:00:19.230> contact<00:00:19.710> we<00:00:20.670> got<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> few<00:00:21.150> system

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
are negative contact we got a few system

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.870 
are negative contact we got a few system
we've<00:00:21.990> got<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.140> switch<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.619> power<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.980> up<00:00:23.070> and

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
we've got to switch to power it up and

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.189 
we've got to switch to power it up and
we're<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.210> be<00:00:24.330> running<00:00:24.539> at<00:00:24.720> about<00:00:24.779> 30

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
we're going to be running at about 30

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.849 
we're going to be running at about 30
amps<00:00:25.590> between<00:00:26.430> 15<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.820> 30<00:00:27.119> amps<00:00:27.560> this<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.710> just

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
amps between 15 to 30 amps this is just

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.710 
amps between 15 to 30 amps this is just
straight<00:00:29.099> water<00:00:29.310> there's<00:00:29.910> no<00:00:30.090> assault<00:00:30.449> as<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
straight water there's no assault as the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.670 
straight water there's no assault as the
additives<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.380> water<00:00:31.790> from<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> top<00:00:33.680> this

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
additives to the water from the top this

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.229 
additives to the water from the top this
is<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> container<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:35.700> i'm<00:00:35.790> going<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.969> put<00:00:36.149> over

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
is a container but i'm going to put over

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.660 
is a container but i'm going to put over
top<00:00:36.440> to<00:00:37.440> catch<00:00:37.649> any<00:00:37.860> hydrogen<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.489> comes

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
top to catch any hydrogen that comes

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:51.750 
top to catch any hydrogen that comes
through<00:00:40.640> can<00:00:41.640> open<00:00:41.879> up<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.030> foul

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.520 

now<00:00:52.760> i<00:00:52.789> want<00:00:53.059> to<00:00:53.149> remind<00:00:53.269> you<00:00:53.600> that<00:00:53.840> there's

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
now i want to remind you that there's

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.779 
now i want to remind you that there's
going<00:00:54.680> to<00:00:54.739> be<00:00:54.769> a<00:00:54.860> lot<00:00:55.039> of<00:00:55.070> a<00:00:55.219> hydrogen<00:00:55.610> escaping

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
going to be a lot of a hydrogen escaping

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.240 
going to be a lot of a hydrogen escaping
from<00:00:56.329> this<00:00:56.539> area<00:00:56.809> when<00:00:57.140> we<00:00:57.260> use<00:00:57.410> it<00:00:57.620> we're

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
from this area when we use it we're

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.850 
from this area when we use it we're
going<00:00:58.339> to<00:00:58.399> have<00:00:58.550> to<00:00:58.699> develop<00:00:59.000> our<00:00:59.589> cell<00:01:00.589> a<00:01:00.620> bit

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
going to have to develop our cell a bit

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.950 
going to have to develop our cell a bit
more<00:01:01.100> where<00:01:01.370> it's<00:01:01.489> enclosed<00:01:01.789> where<00:01:02.750> we<00:01:02.839> can

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
more where it's enclosed where we can

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.780 
more where it's enclosed where we can
build<00:01:03.079> up<00:01:03.260> more<00:01:03.440> pressure<00:01:03.739> but<00:01:04.519> basically

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
build up more pressure but basically

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.520 
build up more pressure but basically
what<00:01:04.909> we're<00:01:05.059> going<00:01:05.150> to<00:01:05.239> do<00:01:05.390> is<00:01:06.110> we're<00:01:06.350> going<00:01:06.440> to

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.710 
what we're going to do is we're going to
run<00:01:06.649> this<00:01:06.830> engine<00:01:07.250> it's<00:01:07.790> about<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:08.030> half<00:01:08.420> horse

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
run this engine it's about a half horse

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.830 
run this engine it's about a half horse
weedwacker<00:01:09.110> motor<00:01:09.940> we're<00:01:10.940> going<00:01:11.060> to<00:01:11.119> suck<00:01:11.690> the

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
weedwacker motor we're going to suck the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.410 
weedwacker motor we're going to suck the
hydrogen<00:01:12.259> through<00:01:12.470> here<00:01:12.740> this<00:01:13.729> canister<00:01:14.330> is

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
hydrogen through here this canister is

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.359 
hydrogen through here this canister is
just<00:01:14.630> out<00:01:14.810> mix<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.290> air<00:01:15.590> with<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.130> hydrogen

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
just out mix the air with the hydrogen

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.999 
just out mix the air with the hydrogen
and<00:01:17.110> it's<00:01:18.110> going<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.289> run<00:01:18.440> down<00:01:18.590> to<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:18.770> host

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
and it's going to run down to the host

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.830 
and it's going to run down to the host
to<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.310> back<00:01:19.460> of<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.670> carburetor<00:01:20.180> you<00:01:20.690> want

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
to the back of the carburetor you want

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.990 
to the back of the carburetor you want
to<00:01:20.930> take<00:01:21.080> a<00:01:21.110> look<00:01:21.340> there's<00:01:22.340> no<00:01:22.460> fuel<00:01:22.759> lines

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
to take a look there's no fuel lines

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.529 
to take a look there's no fuel lines
there's<00:01:23.450> no<00:01:23.600> hoses<00:01:24.320> rather<00:01:25.280> than<00:01:25.550> my<00:01:25.789> hydrogen

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
there's no hoses rather than my hydrogen

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:32.770 
there's no hoses rather than my hydrogen
supply<00:01:26.750> line<00:01:28.090> going<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.240> engine<00:01:31.720> now<00:01:32.720> I'm

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
supply line going to the engine now I'm

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.600 
supply line going to the engine now I'm
going<00:01:32.899> to<00:01:32.990> power<00:01:33.200> up<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.409> system<00:01:33.830> and<00:01:34.310> produce

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
going to power up the system and produce

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:43.980 
going to power up the system and produce
some<00:01:34.789> hydrogen

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.780 

as<00:01:44.530> you<00:01:44.740> can<00:01:44.890> see<00:01:45.070> there's<00:01:45.310> quite<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.610> bit<00:01:45.670> of

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
as you can see there's quite a bit of

00:01:45.790 --> 00:02:00.130 
as you can see there's quite a bit of
hydrogen<00:01:46.270> being<00:01:46.509> produced

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.420 

this<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.320> kind<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.650> bucket<00:02:02.070> weigh<00:02:02.190> anywhere

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
this is kind of a bucket weigh anywhere

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:12.660 
this is kind of a bucket weigh anywhere
but<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:04.590> works

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.550 

so<00:02:13.330> we<00:02:13.420> wrote<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.630> hydrogen<00:02:13.990> build<00:02:14.200> up<00:02:14.319> for<00:02:14.530> a

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
so we wrote the hydrogen build up for a

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.830 
so we wrote the hydrogen build up for a
few<00:02:14.740> minutes<00:02:14.890> just<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.310> get<00:02:15.430> down<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.940> hose

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.320 

as<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:21.040> can<00:02:21.130> see<00:02:21.280> all<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.430> extra<00:02:22.060> hydrogen

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
as you can see all the extra hydrogen

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.710 
as you can see all the extra hydrogen
escaping<00:02:22.599> on<00:02:23.230> both<00:02:23.349> sides<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.800> canister

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.850 

it's<00:02:28.720> going<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:28.900> turn<00:02:29.020> over<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.470> might<00:02:29.650> take<00:02:29.830> a

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
it's going to turn over it might take a

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.290 
it's going to turn over it might take a
minute<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.190> get<00:02:30.400> going<00:02:30.640> because<00:02:30.819> it<00:02:31.030> has<00:02:31.150> to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
minute to get going because it has to

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.330 
minute to get going because it has to
start<00:02:31.510> sucking<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.989> hydrogen<00:02:32.440> through<00:02:33.190> this

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
start sucking the hydrogen through this

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.360 
start sucking the hydrogen through this
tank<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:33.880> down<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.540> line<00:02:34.750> mixing<00:02:35.319> with<00:02:35.470> air
