manually we're gonna blow it up inflate

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.540 
manually we're gonna blow it up inflate
it<00:02:38.909> and

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
it and

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.180

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
use the the blow up part of it as well

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.500 
use the the blow up part of it as well
to<00:02:42.340> see<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.790> get<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:42.970> feel<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.180> what<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.480> is

trying to swim with a life preserver is

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.810 
trying to swim with a life preserver is
not<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.960> same<00:02:47.170> as<00:02:47.440> swimming<00:02:48.190> with<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.490> on<00:02:48.670> so

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
not the same as swimming with that on so

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
not the same as swimming with that on so
we're<00:02:48.910> gonna<00:02:49.000> jump<00:02:49.180> in<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.390> pool<00:02:49.540> we're<00:02:49.750> gonna

we're gonna jump in the pool we're gonna

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.390 
we're gonna jump in the pool we're gonna
do<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.110> few<00:02:50.290> lengths<00:02:50.650> with<00:02:50.770> it<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.100> can<00:02:51.220> see

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
do a few lengths with it so you can see

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.640 
do a few lengths with it so you can see
how<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:51.930> once<00:02:52.930> we<00:02:53.080> get<00:02:53.200> into<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.470> water

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
with the life preservers we're gonna go

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.790 
with the life preservers we're gonna go
over<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.080> proper<00:02:56.380> techniques<00:02:56.680> for
