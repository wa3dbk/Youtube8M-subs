00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.540 

reproduction<00:00:17.990> is<00:00:18.200> the<00:00:18.590> fundamental<00:00:19.310> feature

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
reproduction is the fundamental feature

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.600 
reproduction is the fundamental feature
to<00:00:20.240> all<00:00:20.510> known<00:00:20.869> life<00:00:21.110> each<00:00:21.680> individual

to all known life each individual

reproduction are broadly grouped into

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.450 
reproduction are broadly grouped into
two<00:00:31.760> main<00:00:32.150> types<00:00:32.860> sexual<00:00:33.860> and<00:00:34.100> asexual

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
two main types sexual and asexual

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.430 
two main types sexual and asexual
asexual<00:00:37.460> reproduction<00:00:38.030> is<00:00:38.420> a<00:00:38.840> mode<00:00:39.230> of

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
asexual reproduction is a mode of

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.430 
asexual reproduction is a mode of
reproduction<00:00:40.040> by<00:00:40.910> which<00:00:41.210> offspring<00:00:41.960> arise

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
reproduction by which offspring arise

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.660 
reproduction by which offspring arise
from<00:00:43.340> a<00:00:43.520> single<00:00:44.090> parent<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:45.340> inherit<00:00:46.340> the

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
from a single parent and inherit the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.950 
from a single parent and inherit the
genes<00:00:46.970> of<00:00:47.239> that<00:00:48.110> parent<00:00:48.739> only<00:00:49.809> there<00:00:50.809> are

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
genes of that parent only there are

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.139 
genes of that parent only there are
several<00:00:51.230> types<00:00:51.620> of<00:00:51.770> asexual<00:00:52.640> reproduction

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
several types of asexual reproduction

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.410 
several types of asexual reproduction
such<00:00:54.140> as<00:00:54.380> one<00:00:55.210> binary<00:00:56.210> fission<00:00:56.950> 2

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
such as one binary fission 2

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
for budding and five spore formation the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:21.610 
for budding and five spore formation the
process<00:01:10.759> of<00:01:10.970> asexual<00:01:11.840> reproduction<00:01:12.380> in<00:01:12.800> which

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.970 

in<00:01:22.620> binary<00:01:23.250> fission<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.990> parent<00:01:24.990> organism<00:01:25.770> is

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
in binary fission the parent organism is

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.560 
in binary fission the parent organism is
replaced<00:01:26.940> by<00:01:27.240> two<00:01:27.630> daughter<00:01:28.410> organisms

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
replaced by two daughter organisms

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.550 
replaced by two daughter organisms
because<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:31.200> literally<00:01:31.830> divides<00:01:32.370> into<00:01:32.670> two<00:01:33.090> a

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
because it literally divides into two a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.530 
because it literally divides into two a
good<00:01:34.560> example<00:01:34.980> of<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> same<00:01:35.730> is<00:01:36.060> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
good example of the same is a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.830 
good example of the same is a
single-celled<00:01:37.140> organism<00:01:37.910> like<00:01:38.910> Paramecium

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
single-celled organism like Paramecium

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.670 
single-celled organism like Paramecium
in<00:01:40.280> this<00:01:41.280> case<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:42.270> process<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:43.050> reproduction

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
in this case the process of reproduction

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.010 
in this case the process of reproduction
begins<00:01:44.370> with<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.450> division<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.200> its<00:01:46.620> nucleus

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
begins with the division of its nucleus

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.100 
begins with the division of its nucleus
into<00:01:49.020> nuclei<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.790> followed<00:01:51.330> by<00:01:51.360> division

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
into nuclei this is followed by division

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.630 
into nuclei this is followed by division
of<00:01:52.260> its<00:01:52.830> body<00:01:53.160> into<00:01:53.820> two<00:01:54.140> each<00:01:55.140> part<00:01:55.650> receiving

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
of its body into two each part receiving

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.710 
of its body into two each part receiving
a<00:01:56.760> nucleus<00:01:58.130> finally<00:01:59.130> two<00:01:59.730> Paramecium<00:02:00.570> are

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
a nucleus finally two Paramecium are

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.080 
a nucleus finally two Paramecium are
born<00:02:01.200> from<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.280> single<00:02:02.790> parent<00:02:03.330> cell<00:02:03.680> in<00:02:05.090> case

of unicellular organisms cell division
of<00:02:09.479> fission<00:02:10.229> leads<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> creation<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:12.120> new
