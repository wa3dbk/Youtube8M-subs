00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.519
 what's up guys? 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.530
 with another great personal car and is expensive 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.360
 I just got home and moved in. 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.960
 and I noticed that I created a world in one of 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.880
 I'm going to ask those new ones 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.320
 biomas or minecraft cast bill django 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.480
 it seemed very expensive 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.699
 if his car and she showed up 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.109
 biome and even a little face rage 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.949
 but it's looking so much better you 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.019
 why not 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.300
 I think it also has a new now that 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.590
 It's kind of asking a bit these 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.809
 biomes that people get enough 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.489
 in the mask in the past I'll have to 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.399
 be increased because promotion shows 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.190
 Do you think the biome is a forest? 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.930
 that django is one of our worst guy 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.030
 now I see all fenced in django 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.170
 that I will be this biome that already 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.210
 Back, guys. 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.910

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.949
 bioma was big as hell come slowly 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.739

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.460
 but the same thing I want to do I 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.619
 I can do it but I did not have the gold. 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.799
 for making but I cut very short 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.430
 redstone discussions very short one 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.470
 system itself 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.740
 well then is the next needy then 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.360
 op here are three new items and also a 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.640
 what we can put here 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.250
 in mexico this monster or else people 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.579
 have to look at you guys that I'm normal 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.619
 repeat the buyer and the new things 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.890
 What are the rest of the fish? 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.200
 the tiger peter and this attend 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.700
 I'm going to pick up a light here too. 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.150
 a lever to be able to power the system 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.369
 actor beauty is the next guys here 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.430
 people try our lever that day already 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.020
 saw is that respect the work here O 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.299
 people can call that usually in this 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.759
 Tony network and will connect it also can 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.500
 then use that n fish which is as if 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.670
 It was a normal star, but you 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.369
 have a little more mobility 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.640
 we can say yes more freedom with 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.530
 history and also you can put looks 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.409
 this guy can put also in 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.599
 vertical very very cool same face 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.030
 for example here we come here 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.710
 I put a lightness that looks here 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.800
 back even you can 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.170
 I came here as stone here รณ I will also 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.140
 linking that kick but what the power 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.910
 linking here it will normally be the 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.510
 What I found cool now is that the level 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.790
 of stone he is going to let 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.510
 This business will feel good. 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.790
 like this 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.980
 depending on the type force so it goes 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.930
 change the color according to the strength but it is 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.850
 I need to see one here but I would attack 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.680
 do this beauty 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.590
 You saw it here, so look how cool. 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.130
 and the more red you have, the more 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.980
 force or in case responds fish tries on 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.230
 bike downstairs also in bandung 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.540
 but here is what will create a problem 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.190
 to go out and come back here 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.350
 so here you can put everything good 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.180
 that little or also can not use the 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.520
 also shift key that you can place 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.190
 at both ends is for example the 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.410
 pv the shift here o beauty so well then 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.090
 he put the hottest is in front and 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.830
 behind 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.630
 you can also use it to place 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.610
 side also to the second and take 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.310
 alexandre fish for example here just for 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.830
 O you here and only comes out this match seeing if 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.840
 if I split shift and break it will be 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.360
 the two parts are the following ok a 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.450
 We have several editions of fish linked 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.640
 here and here for sale here just that 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.270
 It finishes sony fish and the stronger I 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.540
 it is linked in our mechanism of 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.060
 our strength but red but reddish 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.500
 they alexandre fish is so expensive I 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.660
 I think it's really cool, lets get this 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.130
 part here like putting a sign up 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.530
 you see how it works explains 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.760
 Also the blocks so I think it will 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.250
 It's better to do even though she does not 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.390
 get down there and do think I 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.950
 I think I 've changed my mind. 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.020
 can come here hugging 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.150
 here for example we can direct 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.670
 Look at this page, look at this, man. 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.320
 for who likes the redstone goes in the moral 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.820
 For who I like, I'm in this mode that is 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.040
 perfect but look at 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.040
 and we can even say that way it was kind of 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.610
 less worth than the stone network is kind 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.790
 wireless networking is a mold of stone without 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.890
 because here you do not need the 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.290
 goe so you can do the mechanism 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.970
 So, man, I thought it was cool. 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.330
 another good thing also time that you 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.430
 Yes, you can call us, it's just like ours. 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.870
 normal and only there they do not 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.509
 in conflict they work perfectly 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.289
 What you can change again here 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:36.930
 it's normal but it does not draw strength 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.970
 It was never the same, only you. 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.160
 can make kind use the same thing 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.020
 redstone here I present attack 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.120
 Only you can seal here. 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.410
 thing and you want to put it underneath to 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.949
 You can come here to put it underneath. 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.590
 Also that needs to be answered pitt is 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.780
 exactly what you are turning 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.789
 He needs to call this fish and here 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.919
 you can put it back and back 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.570
 usually they are estonia malta 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.729
 so you do not lose up to that ratio 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.800
 to be able to make it really cool 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.830
 good service neither easy can use here 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.380
 jaime ball with a stone design ball with the 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.840
 dream is the return of normal peter and it is 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.479
 this zpe ball with a story I compared 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.849
 Tart showed some patients here 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.099
 you can also connect this normal buyer 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.210
 with normal return there will put 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.460
 on here 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.889
 that one there because I read a little inside 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.509
 side here cool 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.639
 and you can train if you can put 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.550
 so the two who are normal by the way 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.620
 do not repeat on this team have chip and 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.030
 So people have a western fish, come on. 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.110
 put here our and Peter Hullermann 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.630
 to see if it works or works 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.849
 usually on Nasdaq the technician always 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.490
 You give it to us, it's really cool. 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:46.440
 There this one is Alexandre Fish and it's alright. 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.220
 simple this template in case now i am 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.080
 recording a simpler mode 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.270
 lately because I 'm working on a 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.789
 very large period that was occupying 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.669
 A lot of time is solved but I learned what 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.570
 It's being really, really cool, it's ethical. 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.490
 I can not talk now because a 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.599
 surprise really but it's getting 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.310
 very cool 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.229
 This is how I end what I'm doing. 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.389
 I'll go back with much more complex and 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.759
 Also mode most complete right because 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.949
 willy - nilly takes but always gives 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:13.050
 the motto to test some things and 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.720
 learn more about fashion and beauty 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.909
 there that mote that is available for 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:21.000
 7.2 and also present point 10 if you 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:23.190
 others have mobilized 7.10 in the case of 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.690
 player while two here but it works 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.680
 usually there as each other 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:30.680
 11 also company so this is it guys 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.680
 said
