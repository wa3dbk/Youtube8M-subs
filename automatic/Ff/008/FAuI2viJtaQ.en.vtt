furniture<00:00:49.520> we<00:00:50.520> envisioned<00:00:50.969> both<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.390> these

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
furniture we envisioned both of these

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.510 
furniture we envisioned both of these
two<00:00:52.079> towers<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:52.739> being<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.129> know<00:00:53.160> holding

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
two towers as being you know holding

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.990 
two towers as being you know holding
lights<00:00:54.920> probably<00:00:55.920> really<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:56.430> cool<00:00:56.850> to

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
lights probably really really cool to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.639 
lights probably really really cool to
repurpose<00:00:57.329> them<00:00:57.539> as<00:00:57.629> light<00:00:57.809> holders<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.410> left

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
repurpose them as light holders the left

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.229 
repurpose them as light holders the left
one<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.039> 71<00:00:59.609> inches<00:00:59.789> tall<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:01.320> right<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.949> is

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
one is 71 inches tall the right one is

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.440 
one is 71 inches tall the right one is
82<00:01:03.239> inches<00:01:03.449> tall<00:01:04.460> again<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.790> really

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
82 inches tall again it's just really

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.929 
82 inches tall again it's just really
really<00:01:06.750> unique<00:01:07.140> pieces<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:11.490> table<00:01:11.820> has

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
really unique pieces the table has

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.130 
really unique pieces the table has
rollers<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.479> top<00:01:12.659> obviously<00:01:13.080> you

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
rollers on the top obviously you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.750 
rollers on the top obviously you
wouldn't<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.680> necessarily<00:01:13.799> reuse<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
wouldn't have to necessarily reuse the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.890 
wouldn't have to necessarily reuse the
rollers<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:20.450> probably<00:01:21.450> wouldn't<00:01:21.659> use<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
rollers you probably wouldn't use the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.350 
rollers you probably wouldn't use the
table<00:01:22.229> either<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> width<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.090> lake

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
table either but the width of this lake

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.749 
table either but the width of this lake
set<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.750> 57<00:01:25.439> inches<00:01:25.650> wide<00:01:25.890> nets<00:01:26.369> from<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
set is 57 inches wide nets from the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.679 
set is 57 inches wide nets from the
widest<00:01:27.119> point<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> left<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.229> right<00:01:28.380> and

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
widest point on the left and right and

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.690 
widest point on the left and right and
believe<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.840> or<00:01:30.930> not<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.350> actually<00:01:31.890> 63

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
believe it or not it is actually 63

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.340 
believe it or not it is actually 63
inches<00:01:32.939> deep<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.180> basically<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.020> go<00:01:34.200> from

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
inches deep so basically if you go from

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.679 
inches deep so basically if you go from
this<00:01:34.590> tip<00:01:34.850> all<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.390> way<00:01:36.540> over<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.439> side

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
this tip all the way over to this side

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.210 
this tip all the way over to this side
what's<00:01:39.689> really<00:01:39.960> unique<00:01:40.170> about<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:41.009> table

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
what's really unique about this table

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.219 
what's really unique about this table
base<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.720> raise<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.110> lower<00:01:43.140> it

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
base is that you can raise and lower it

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.679 
base is that you can raise and lower it
it<00:01:46.229> lowers<00:01:46.680> down<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.399> 18<00:01:47.850> inches<00:01:48.149> all<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.600> way

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
it lowers down to 18 inches all the way

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.130 
it lowers down to 18 inches all the way
up<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.140> 32<00:01:49.680> inches<00:01:49.979> however<00:01:50.509> that<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:52.049> at

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
up to 32 inches however that is just at

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.539 
up to 32 inches however that is just at
the<00:01:52.229> top<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.619> rail<00:01:52.799> here<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.369> not

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the top of the rail here that is not

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.550 
the top of the rail here that is not
measuring<00:01:54.000> from<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.299> tabletop<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:55.049> are<00:01:55.170> just

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
measuring from the tabletop we are just

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.300 
measuring from the tabletop we are just
measuring<00:01:55.829> from<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.280> top<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.700> rail<00:01:57.020> so

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
measuring from the top of the rail so

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.100 
measuring from the top of the rail so
the<00:01:59.310> only<00:01:59.520> thing<00:02:00.090> broken<00:02:00.479> on<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.689> whole<00:02:00.869> set

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the only thing broken on this whole set

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.609 
the only thing broken on this whole set
is<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:02.040> lock<00:02:02.250> pin<00:02:02.520> broke<00:02:02.790> obviously<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:04.590> you

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
is the lock pin broke obviously so you

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.469 
is the lock pin broke obviously so you
can<00:02:05.100> either<00:02:05.219> cut<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.549> off<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.030> clean<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.360> up

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
can either cut this off and clean it up

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.020 
can either cut this off and clean it up
and<00:02:06.659> put<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> new<00:02:07.259> lock<00:02:07.469> pin<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.829> here<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.280> it

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and put a new lock pin in here and it

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.820 
and put a new lock pin in here and it
would<00:02:09.119> function<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.750> as<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.200> should<00:02:10.229> because

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
would function just as it should because

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.460
