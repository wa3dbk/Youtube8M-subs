00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.230
 hello everyone today is the time for samsung 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.900
 galaxy s2 ie the new proposal of 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.289
 samsung for entry level on the range 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.210
 phone 4g first thing we notice is the 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.689
 well-known 4 and a half inch screen 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.769
 that we have the front camera on 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.869
 mine with the key 1 virtual keys of 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:35.290
 android options quebec 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:38.290
 then we paraded for six hours 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:44.160
 the 5 megapixel camera speaker with 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:48.539
 flash on and off button 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:53.730
 pockets I want another goal in the eu 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.730
 go for the three and a half audio jack cable 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.559
 but for that on Sunday the two Swiss 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.050
 connection advances and charge free 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.640
 samsung galaxy express and mounts a wall 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.090
 nandroid third point of course he knows 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.950
 as he has accustomed us to coinage 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.520
 in disagreement we have a screen from 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.850
 great quality in this case with a 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:19.049
 4 and 5 inch display and one 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.450
 resolution of 540 x 960 the dual chipset 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.450
 core of 1.7 giulia rizza that joined to the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.719
 mainsail 1 against 5 gigabytes by phone 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.060
 to quietly perform we say 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.189
 makes using android a lot 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.060
 simple a lot of which should not start 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.489
 from scrolling through a printer and not there 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.810
 they are problems but data reasoning 

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:42.869
 thanks to the 8 gigabyte love 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.849
 expandable with microsd up to 64 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.069
 gigabytes therefore could actively and 

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:50.270
 so linearly then a music is 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.799
 rather more feel more appropriate 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.890
 the main gift of this area 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.020
 against study by commissions between ie 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.640
 that connectivity 4g and thanks so 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.989
 to the via ciliani network to be able to be 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.010
 use on everything from 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:04.360
 streaming 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.940
 youtube 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.429
 the experiment the area is complete 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.540
 all a 5 megapixel camera 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.900
 luca digital zoom we were just saying 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.189
 of the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.780
 than that of the feature 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:21.500
 main of this phone is precisely 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.970
 4g connectivity we will now do a test 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.040
 with a speed test of advance that there 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.629
 we find at vodafone village to appreciate 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.180
 these are the lines and therefore we have a 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.489
 very high number of terminals that 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.370
 mark in the tablets that are held 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.640
 to our cell 4g then the results 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.489
 however, they will not be a record counting 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.829
 precisely this paper precisely which are in 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.200
 large number of tennessee terminals vi 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.430
 will give an idea of ​​what it can do 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.690
 this terminal of my mind of 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.310
 network towards the hour we say they have 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.440
 exactly what I said I am 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.420
 absolutely not 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.970
 and that's all for samsung galaxy 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.680
 s ii see you at the next wifi networks 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.680
 just product hello to all
