 they are all boys more than the lion and today 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.270
 we are here in the company of marci hello a 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.090
 all boys friends but precisely crossing 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.460
 to talk about our project on ma 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.039
 he also left the project behind 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.070
 that was the beginning up until today 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.960
 to bring videos that arlon only 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.510
 some tutorials that only concerned 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.089
 minecraft tutorial passes though we have 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.250
 noticed that it's not that he was born bad though 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:45.260
 we are not giving the results 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.300
 hoped for and for this reason we asked to 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.780
 if you had wanted to see gods 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.960
 gameplay not the pixel but not those things 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.520
 just that they really are seen 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.309
 always but a bit of gameplay 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:03.170
 nicer and more fun 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.729
 so I thought therefore to ask you for 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.780
 make a decision anyway 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:12.500

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.880
 this channel 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.790
 the gameplay we could bring you 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.220
