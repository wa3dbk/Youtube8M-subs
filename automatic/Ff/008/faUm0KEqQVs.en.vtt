 to fall the moon the 90 itch not the first 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.250
 January 2014 as always we're leaving 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.950
 to do dotcom and we will look for the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.140
 selection of extended letter that is this 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.610
 that you see here, there you click and it's going to 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.840
 take to another interface is so that 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.720
 you enter your data 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.510
 birth once they do I need 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.880
 that go down here in options for 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.340
 that put the date of the new moon goes 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.470
 to be the first of January 2014 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.960
 After that, they will click 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.440
 show chat or click here to show 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.660
 the letter 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.460
 just the snow the other interface is what 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.949
 what he is going to show you is his astral chart 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.320
 the astral chart as you will see is a circle 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.300
 with 12 houses each house governs an area of 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.920
 our life and they will look for the symbol 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.379
 of the Capricorn sign that is this that 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.949
 is here in this person's letter 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.019
 as in 89% of the letters there are signs 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.600
 that occupy two houses or houses 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.510
 intercepted the important thing is to know what 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.729
 Capricorn rules the house where it starts 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.070
 the crest of capitol is here in the 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.409
 house number 4 so that you can 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.380
 see where a new one is going to fall, they have to 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.770
 click to show transits or with 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.229
 one sets at that time the page changed 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.580
 is going to show you the planets outside the 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.060
 circle these are the planets in 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.460
 transit or how are you today tomorrow or in the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.509
 date that you want to review here 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.550
 they will see that there is an accumulation 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.920
 energetic is to say capricorn because 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.780
 that new moon will be like this link 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.789
 in the sign this line is when there is 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.920
 several planets together the new moon is going 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.979
 to be in the grade the number 11 of the sign 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.610
 if the Capricorn sign starts here 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.280
 we count 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.050
 when 1 2 3 4 5 the largest hairline 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.150
 of grade number 5 the other hairline more 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.340
 great is my grade number 10 and here what 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.530
 I see we are going to have the sun in the moon 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.440
 pluton and mercury together for this 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.880
 opening at the beginning of the year because 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.220
 It is so important 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.030
 Capricorn rules success 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.560
 persistence status hard work 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.630
 Climb the mountain until you reach the top 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.200
 I think we start the year with this 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.000
 Moon 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.580
 an opening a time to sow 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.530
 seeds of intention will direct the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.240
 rest of the year but we have to be very 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.160
 sure what we want before 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.630
 take advantage of that opening if you do not know 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.430
 still what do you want to manifest 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.930
 ask yourself again and again I always 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.610
 I ask my clients what do you want 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.230
 because many times they come to me with 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.390
 questions like good I want a good 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.459
 work or I want stability in the 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.720
 home and you ask them the question and 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.580
 you ask the question and ask them the question 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.660
 until they break and finally they tell you 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.239
 What I want is to get a husband 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.800
 because we have so much resistance and 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.350
 we have an idea of â€‹â€‹what we should 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.480
 wish we said no I wish it was 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.440
 eduardo I want to get the position of 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.420
 The management 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.670
 the wishes and intentions of the new moon 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.830
 it is not treated and it does not make sense that 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.410
 do for what others want to do 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.910
 you or what would look good in front of the 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.000
 society that wants imperative that you 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.730
 want for yourself that you want this is 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.500
 for you with you can share it if 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.030
 you share it with force if you do not 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.960
 they share the same, not the least, you are 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.640
 clear 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.190
 this is how I said the election of 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.960
 exclusive is to put a name on the 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.540
 part of the bus outside to know 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.060
 where are we going, it's a joke to say here 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.820
 the voices have in the outside 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.710
 a sign that says where we are going 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.020
 we have to have a name in our 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.770
 life bus can not say only to 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.740
 where are you going 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.690
 vila destiny hope does not have to 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.950
 have the name of the destination that of 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.330
 we really want to achieve because if not 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.400
 we will always be stopping and we 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.170
 let's confuse this opening is 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.180
 extremely powerful because pluton is 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.090
 there and pluton on that planet of the 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.730
 transformation everything you want and 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.550
 is within you in potential you have to 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.610
 transform certain things to be able to 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.130
 take out the light 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.470
 it's not about getting love it 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.380
 try to unlock all beliefs 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.510
 and fears that you have that are covering the 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.880
 love that is already inside you want 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.980
 success success is already within you but 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.080
 you have so many layers of fear on you and 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.300
 so many layers of who will say that you do not see it 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.740
 you can not use it because you can not be 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.170
 channel of expression 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.600
 pluton go through transform dilute 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.070
 dissolves also and dissolves that the 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.290
 fears is not like neptune that you do not 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.480
 dissolves the ego but everything works with 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.970
 the fears with the psychological part with 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.620
 the taboo with what society believes 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.329
 what should I do and you say no? 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.310
 matter this is my passion this is what 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.660
 I want this was a new one is also 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.240
 extremely important because it is the 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.060
 first new moon in Capricorn from 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.440
 many years ago that product did not 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.210
 is in a position of power every time 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.040
 that we had a capricorn moon 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.290
 2008 of 2013 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.610
 the moon and the sun entered the century and 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.920
 they were completely first time 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.080
 very strong saying this is going to be like 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.850
 I say it's going to be the example that 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.860
 I always give them that I always give them 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.470
 because it 's too appropriate is the 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.540
 hugo chÃ¡vez cold he was of course 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.820
 of 98 but let's assume that he is 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.890
 like Pluto and Capricorn and from 2008 in 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.920
 2013 every time one wanted to do something 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.720
 was with model and could and now returns 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.520
 the planets to capricorn have given him 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.280
 the turn the zodiac and get with 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.870
 that that king or that tax person or 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.030
 that person who wanted to transform us 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.740
 his way is gone and now you have 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.800
 the choice to transform at your own pace 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.030
 at your pleasure at your disposal you go to 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.370
 realize that you have the power to 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.920
 Giorgio with you and that you can direct 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.630
 design to star in your life that's why 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.160
 very important for this person because 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.920
 example that has had brute during 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.620
 five years in the house four move out of the 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.940
 country have own house ask for a loan 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.440
 a loan to have their 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.920
 medium possessions is extremely 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.480
 complicated 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.610
 the planets have turned around and 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.500
 they go back to capricorn this person can 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.240
 reapply can start a 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.190
 work that gives you more money and better 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.040
 quality of life or can simply 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.050
 leave home and say my life no longer the 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.060
 they manage my parents I have independence and 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.010
 I can direct to how I want to go to 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.360
 feel the change is feeling more 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.520
 strong because we are on a cross 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.470
 cardinal the cardinal cross is squeezing 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.800
 by different boards this sign is 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.690
 capricorn last year tuesday joined 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.760
 to pluton in Capricorn and there was a 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.530
 situation in which you said he was from 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.580
 more than me she can more than me char 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.830
 it was more than me 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.330
 the government can more than I s that 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.090
 organization that planet can more than 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.920
 me and this year the situation repeats itself and 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.690
 you're going to say he does not have that much power 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.000
 over fills me with the stone or no longer 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.490
 push me to my buttons you will feel 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.710
 liberated and really from who you 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.770
 you freed was of a limiting fear that 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.300
 you had 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.400
 I hope everyone can locate the moon 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.500
