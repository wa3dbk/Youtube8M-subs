00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.090 
was designed for Mathew Walzer who was
the<00:00:40.950> famous<00:00:41.340> Nike<00:00:41.820> letter<00:00:42.000> kid<00:00:42.870> who<00:00:43.200> famously

the famous Nike letter kid who famously

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.790 
the famous Nike letter kid who famously
wrote<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> letter<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.879> couple<00:00:45.000> years<00:00:45.329> ago<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.800> CEO

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800

wrote a letter a couple years ago to CEO
Mark<00:00:47.160> Parker<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.510> mentioned<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.079> he

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
Mark Parker and I mentioned that he

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.979 
Mark Parker and I mentioned that he
couldn't<00:00:49.829> wear<00:00:50.039> Nike<00:00:50.460> shoes<00:00:50.670> because<00:00:51.149> you

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
couldn't wear Nike shoes because you

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.040 
couldn't wear Nike shoes because you
know<00:00:52.110> he<00:00:52.260> has<00:00:52.829> cerebral<00:00:53.430> palsy<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.090> that

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
know he has cerebral palsy and that

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.479 
know he has cerebral palsy and that
basically<00:00:55.469> makes<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.829> difficult<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.250> him<00:00:56.460> to

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
basically makes it difficult for him to

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.310 
basically makes it difficult for him to
tie<00:00:56.850> shoes<00:00:57.210> actually<00:00:57.690> makes<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.989> practically

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
tie shoes actually makes it practically

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.260 
tie shoes actually makes it practically
impossible<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.039> he<00:00:59.129> has<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.489> you<00:01:00.090> know

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
impossible so he has to have you know

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.569 
impossible so he has to have you know
someone<00:01:00.809> tie<00:01:00.960> his<00:01:01.170> shoes<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:01.649> him<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.039> since

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
someone tie his shoes for him and since

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.329 
someone tie his shoes for him and since
he<00:01:02.760> was<00:01:02.789> actually<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.600> at<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> time<00:01:04.439> almost

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
he was actually a at the time almost

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.490 
he was actually a at the time almost

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
great it be cool if they could design

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.200 
great it be cool if they could design
shoes<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.210> did<00:01:18.630> not<00:01:18.810> allow<00:01:19.610> for<00:01:20.610> him<00:01:21.030> to

of<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.670> Nike<00:01:23.880> shoes<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:25.110> know<00:01:25.259> took<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
of like Nike shoes so you know took a

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.160 
of like Nike shoes so you know took a
couple<00:01:26.310> years<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:27.150> know<00:01:27.270> prototypes<00:01:27.840> you

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
couple years you know prototypes you

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.530 
couple years you know prototypes you
know<00:01:28.290> walls<00:01:28.650> are<00:01:28.829> work<00:01:28.979> with<00:01:29.159> Nike<00:01:29.540> especially

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
know walls are work with Nike especially

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.999 
know walls are work with Nike especially
with<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> Tobey<00:01:31.049> Hatfield<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> couple<00:01:31.979> of

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
with a Tobey Hatfield on a couple of

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.410 
with a Tobey Hatfield on a couple of
different<00:01:32.100> prototypes<00:01:32.490> including<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
different prototypes including like the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.450 
different prototypes including like the
hyper<00:01:33.570> dunk<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.020> believe<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:35.100> one<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
hyper dunk I believe was one of the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.060 
hyper dunk I believe was one of the
first<00:01:35.579> ones<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.909> he<00:01:36.060> got<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.799> this<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
first ones that he got and this is the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.710 
first ones that he got and this is the
first<00:01:38.310> one<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.759> actually<00:01:38.850> come<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.210> market

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
first one to actually come to market

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.770 
first one to actually come to market
these<00:01:40.380> zooms<00:01:40.680> soldier<00:01:41.040> ate<00:01:41.159> fly<00:01:41.400> YZ<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.659> I

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
these zooms soldier ate fly YZ so like I

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.060 
these zooms soldier ate fly YZ so like I
mentioned<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.380> basically<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> zoom

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
mentioned this is basically the zoom

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.740 
mentioned this is basically the zoom
soldier<00:01:44.399> 8<00:01:44.549> but<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> big<00:01:45.119> difference<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.600> that

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
soldier 8 but the big difference is that

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.569 
soldier 8 but the big difference is that
you<00:01:45.899> can<00:01:46.049> see<00:01:46.200> here

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
you can see here

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
like that but you know zippers have a

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.570 
like that but you know zippers have a
tendency<00:04:23.840> to<00:04:23.990> just<00:04:24.169> not<00:04:24.410> be<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.770> best<00:04:24.919> most

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580
