00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
anything like that that might actually

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.330 
anything like that that might actually
harm<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.630> are<00:02:32.750> damaged<00:02:33.200> or<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.160> I

very top like a brown circle speck that
was<00:02:46.010> actually<00:02:46.370> on<00:02:46.520> there<00:02:46.670> when<00:02:46.850> I<00:02:46.880> bought<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.209> I

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
was actually on there when I bought it I

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.360 
was actually on there when I bought it I
guess<00:02:49.040> it's<00:02:49.310> from<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.030> refinishing<00:02:50.780> or

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
guess it's from the refinishing or

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.400 
guess it's from the refinishing or
production<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.490> it<00:02:52.670> I'm<00:02:52.850> not<00:02:53.030> sure<00:02:53.350> but<00:02:54.350> I

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
production of it I'm not sure but I

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.230 
production of it I'm not sure but I
couldn't<00:02:54.740> get<00:02:54.800> that<00:02:55.190> off<00:02:55.459> either<00:02:55.820> but<00:02:56.120> it

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
couldn't get that off either but it

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.940 
couldn't get that off either but it
wasn't<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.110> point<00:02:57.350> where<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.590> was<00:02:57.830> like

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
wasn't to the point where I was like

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.310 
wasn't to the point where I was like
desperate<00:02:58.459> to<00:02:58.550> get<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:58.820> off<00:02:58.970> or<00:02:59.150> anything<00:02:59.320> so

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
desperate to get it off or anything so

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.229 
desperate to get it off or anything so
while<00:03:00.560> I<00:03:00.590> was<00:03:01.010> cleaning<00:03:01.160> off<00:03:01.610> this<00:03:03.340> with<00:03:04.340> the

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
while I was cleaning off this with the

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.770 
while I was cleaning off this with the
jewelry<00:03:05.570> wipes<00:03:06.459> both<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.760> fingerprint<00:03:08.420> and

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
jewelry wipes both the fingerprint and

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.190 
jewelry wipes both the fingerprint and
that<00:03:09.440> little<00:03:09.739> spot<00:03:10.070> came<00:03:10.370> off<00:03:11.019> so<00:03:12.019> I<00:03:12.050> was

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
because it will do the same thing

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.340 
because it will do the same thing
basically<00:04:58.030> just<00:04:58.810> a<00:04:58.960> soft<00:04:59.290> wipe<00:05:00.750> it<00:05:01.750> probably

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
basically just a soft wipe it probably

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.110 
basically just a soft wipe it probably
will<00:05:02.500> take<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:02.830> little<00:05:03.130> bit<00:05:03.340> of<00:05:03.430> time<00:05:03.640> depending

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
will take a little bit of time depending

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.820 
will take a little bit of time depending
on<00:05:04.270> how<00:05:04.479> bad<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:04.900> tarnish<00:05:05.470> is<00:05:06.210> but<00:05:07.830> basically

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
on how bad the tarnish is but basically

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.810 
on how bad the tarnish is but basically
