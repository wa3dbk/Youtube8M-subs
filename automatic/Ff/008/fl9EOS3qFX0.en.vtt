00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.039
 this house that we are here seeing and 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.140
 Well he's going to tell you fargas rolling 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.179
 yes this house is a recreation of the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.890
 michelle analysis house for those who 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.169
 do not know who annelise michelle is 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.539
 a very catholic German woman was very 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.699
 Catholic who was subjected to an exorcism 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.390
 this story is based on assumptions 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.579
 real facts this woman when she was 16 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.050
 years he had an epileptic attack and it was 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.210
 diagnosed lobe epilepsy 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.850
 temporary vale fell quickly in 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.920
 depression and was treated in a hospital 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.510
 psychiatric in 1973 it became 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.390
 intolerant to various objects 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.699
 religious and began to hear voices worth 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.230
 his condition was getting worse and despite 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.940
 medication you were giving 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.230
 michelle worth it and attempted suicide 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.210
 michelle and their families were convinced 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.120
 that she was possessed they called a priest 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.670
 Catholic and practiced an exorcism 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.409
 so this house would be to say it 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.509
 this way is a recreation of the 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.840
 of that girl's 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:14.950
 that girl in which in this house 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.259
 we could find several indications of 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.270
 mystery and we could also if you 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.979
 look at these in the windows if you 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.049
 you notice that everything is closed with timbers 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.090
 it can be a symbol that for that 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.609
 prevent the departure of those spirits 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.439
 malignant we must also say that this 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:33.500
 girl was possessed nothing more and nothing 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.090
 less than six demons are worth Ã¡lex 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.119
 you want to continue the good story 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.099
 continue as you see as he said fraga have 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.439
 bricked up and have done everything possible to 

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:44.569
 that nothing comes from inside and I also 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.520
 I think they have burned things because as 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.250
 we can see here is the truck 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.289
 burned and another truck or you or 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.750
 truck and burned or is it all at 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.280
 deceased is impressive the truth is a 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.319
 very good mystery that we are going to 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.359
 start telling now that this is coming 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.609
 how interesting are you seeing here 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.189
 there is a mattress come here far gun 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:06.500
 I will continue with the hand come I think it is 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.329
 where they did the exorcisms where 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.399
 the priest was doing it and good 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.420
 these the voices that were heard in him 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.670
 same 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.459
 if in the same place in the same place 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.810
 in the same place as where they say masters 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.239
 the exorcism in his bed and this is the 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.709
 mattress where the truth was very 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.680
 shocking let's leave now with the 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.849
 sounds that are very very good and we're going to 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.180
 and let's leave them for a while 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.180
 listen 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.950
 central 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.960
 well, continuing with the story 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.030
 you have seen those sounds that we have 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.610
 left very disturbing he has heard 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.520
 very fragrant 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.230
 those are the sounds of the recording that 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.120
 the priest did when the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.460
 exorcism those voices that you have 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.160
 listened to are the supposed demons that 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.960
 They owned this girl and they are real 100% 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.630
 real is a real mystery that then it 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.370
 he made a movie that that was the 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.230
 exorcism of emily rose is not to say 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.790
 know that the movie but good 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.310
 awesome as you see we keep seeing 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.780
 all doors boarded with masters with 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.510
 wood and with wood and everything 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.610
 impressively capped good as 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.850
 we are seeing here there are very many 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.710
 scratches and a lot of things that do not 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.170
 are usually I do not know why they will be the 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.550
 truth we do not have a thing that is 100% 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.920
 true but good is something else 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.480
 Mysterious I do not know if it will be the demons or 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.850
 something that we have been discussing 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.010
 before very rare but very rare everything 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.530
 It must be said that demons affect 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.120
 what is all the all the place in the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.100
 where they are so it is 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.920
 possible that the house is completely 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.260
 shattered precisely by that one for that 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.359
 non-negative energy that the demons 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.250
 they contain not to say it in some way 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.070
 and what do you want to get out so how can we 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.560
 observe scratches on wooden floors 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.229
 broken in this hollow this hole 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.850
 that hides something something behind but is 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.400
 completely dark we can not 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.830
 peeping out we can not get close but 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.449
 A lot of eye is very careful I do not know here 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.560
 that there will be inside this house the truth 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.780
 we do not know 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.030
 we have not tried to enter or anything by the 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.919
 We are going to leave that phase of the 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.320
 mystery to you if you want to feel 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.419
 try to enter or anything to 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.130
 look what's inside we're going to leave you 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.289
 location in the description for all 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.660
 the curious and well I think that 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.590
 we finish here the mysteries of the air 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.210
 I think so 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.830
 laxe wanted to put or if you want 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.560
 inform you a little about what we have 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.870
 you just have to search for it by 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.419
 google and you will see that this connected everything 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.370
 real and nothing basically that would be all 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.840
 Well yes the truth we have left the 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.570
 voices I hope you liked this 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.340
 mystery please as I always say to 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.199
 see how much that figure likes and 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.580
 let's make this mystery very interesting 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.690
 we appear to you put in 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.800
 comments everything you think 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.610
