it's it's very similar to another game
that<00:00:18.990> I've<00:00:19.350> seen<00:00:19.710> previously<00:00:20.250> um<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:21.510> know

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
that I've seen previously um you know

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.140 
that I've seen previously um you know
like<00:00:21.779> an<00:00:21.869> arcade<00:00:22.230> or<00:00:22.289> something<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.150> is

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
like an arcade or something it is

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.599 
like an arcade or something it is
basically<00:00:26.779> you<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.380> planet<00:00:29.160> like<00:00:29.310> right

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
basically you have a planet like right

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.330 
basically you have a planet like right
here<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.060> your<00:00:30.510> job<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.289> obviously<00:00:31.920> just

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
here and your job is to obviously just

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.310 
here and your job is to obviously just
defeat<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.880> enemy<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.600> what<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.870> do<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.079> you

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
defeat the enemy so what you do is you

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.350 
defeat the enemy so what you do is you
take<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.620> planet<00:00:35.100> each<00:00:35.520> planet<00:00:35.910> has<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.030> rate

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
take that planet each planet has a rate

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.510 
take that planet each planet has a rate
of<00:00:36.570> building<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.860> take<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.129> planet<00:00:38.430> to

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
of building you take that planet to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.270 
of building you take that planet to
capture<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> other<00:00:39.210> planets<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
capture the other planets in the the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.280 
capture the other planets in the the
game<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:42.180> each<00:00:42.450> when<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.989> capture

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
game and then each when you capture

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.139 
game and then each when you capture
planets<00:00:43.649> table<00:00:43.920> each<00:00:44.070> start<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:44.910> build

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
planets table each start to like build

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.260 
planets table each start to like build
more<00:00:45.450> ships<00:00:45.600> um<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.430> ship's<00:00:47.670> build<00:00:48.090> it

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
more ships um and the ship's build it

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.380 
more ships um and the ship's build it
like<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.420> certain<00:00:48.809> rate<00:00:48.989> each<00:00:49.140> time<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.390> excuse

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
like a certain rate each time so excuse

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.959 
like a certain rate each time so excuse
me<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:52.050> if<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.410> each<00:00:53.070> planet<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
me so if you each planet is like a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.250 
me so if you each planet is like a
different<00:00:54.270> production<00:00:54.600> rate<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:54.960> planet

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
different production rate so this planet

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.380 
different production rate so this planet
produces<00:00:55.379> 52<00:00:56.100> per<00:00:56.340> minute<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.879> 60<00:00:57.149> per

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
produces 52 per minute this is 60 per

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.290 
produces 52 per minute this is 60 per
minute<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.140> 27<00:00:58.680> per<00:00:58.859> minute<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.579> know

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
minute this is 27 per minute so you know

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.490 
minute this is 27 per minute so you know
you<00:01:00.359> kind<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.660> want<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.930> look<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.230> see<00:01:01.289> like

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you kind of want to look to see like

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.529 
you kind of want to look to see like
what<00:01:01.530> are<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> high<00:01:02.190> grossing<00:01:02.969> planets<00:01:03.390> which

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
what are the high grossing planets which

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
what are the high grossing planets which
are<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> planets<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.110> are<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.409> give

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
are the planets that are going to give

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.420 
are the planets that are going to give
you<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> most<00:01:04.799> amount<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.840> most<00:01:06.840> amount<00:01:07.080> of

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
you the most amount of a most amount of

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.950 
you the most amount of a most amount of
units<00:01:08.430> per<00:01:08.700> minute<00:01:08.970> then<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.510> always<00:01:09.630> want<00:01:09.900> to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
units per minute then you always want to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.320 
units per minute then you always want to
look<00:01:10.110> at<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.770> enemy<00:01:11.130> where<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.180> they

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
look at like the enemy where are they

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.730 
look at like the enemy where are they
how<00:01:12.540> many<00:01:12.720> they<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.290> try<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.500> aim<00:01:13.710> for

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
how many they have you try to aim for

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.039 
how many they have you try to aim for
like<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.340> planets<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.330> know<00:01:15.420> fewest

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
like the planets have you know fewest

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.100 
like the planets have you know fewest
amounts<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:17.000> enemies<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.299> because<00:01:18.869> it's

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
amounts of enemies in it because it's

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.109 
amounts of enemies in it because it's
obviously<00:01:19.439> easier<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:20.369> take<00:01:20.520> over<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> planet

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
obviously easier to take over a planet

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.120 
obviously easier to take over a planet
that<00:01:21.150> has<00:01:21.330> less<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.170> choose<00:01:22.409> one<00:01:22.710> planet

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that has less you can choose one planet

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.249 
that has less you can choose one planet
to<00:01:23.159> attack<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.759> other<00:01:23.850> planets<00:01:24.299> or<00:01:25.110> if<00:01:25.170> you

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
to attack the other planets or if you

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.380 
to attack the other planets or if you
double-click<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.070> planet<00:01:26.640> all<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.210> your

double-click on that planet all of your
planet's<00:01:27.750> will<00:01:27.869> attack<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.259> planet<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.159> like

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
planet's will attack that planet so like

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.740 
planet's will attack that planet so like
if<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.579> pick<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.060> know<00:01:30.150> these<00:01:30.329> four<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.600> want

these four to attack this one if I
double-click<00:01:34.350> all<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.369> planets<00:01:35.700> will<00:01:35.850> attack

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
double-click all the planets will attack

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.370 
double-click all the planets will attack
ah<00:01:37.009> I<00:01:38.180> mean<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.270> was<00:01:39.329> easy<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.720> put<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
camp that you gave up to four players

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.179 
camp that you gave up to four players
per<00:01:44.340> game<00:01:44.549> there's<00:01:44.939> also<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.210> campaign<00:01:45.750> mode

devices and you can enter a pin code to
get<00:03:47.640> online<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.630> can<00:03:48.660> make<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.019> name<00:03:49.290> I

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
haven't tried it yet um so I'm not sure

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.590 
haven't tried it yet um so I'm not sure
exactly<00:03:53.459> how<00:03:53.670> well<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.000> works<00:03:54.209> let's<00:03:54.570> see<00:03:56.600> for

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
exactly how well it works let's see for

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.360 
exactly how well it works let's see for
pin<00:03:57.840> code<00:03:58.110> so<00:03:58.440> i'm<00:03:58.500> going<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.709> enter<00:03:58.860> this<00:03:59.100> pin

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
pin code so i'm going to enter this pin

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.940 
pin code so i'm going to enter this pin
code<00:03:59.610> right<00:03:59.880> now<00:04:00.860> and<00:04:03.470> see<00:04:04.470> how<00:04:04.590> this<00:04:04.739> works

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
code right now and see how this works

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.650 
code right now and see how this works
this<00:04:05.549> is<00:04:05.610> actually<00:04:05.880> my<00:04:06.000> first<00:04:06.030> time<00:04:06.329> i<00:04:06.480> know

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
this is actually my first time i know

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.539 
this is actually my first time i know
it's<00:04:06.840> probably<00:04:06.959> not<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.350> best<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.739> look<00:04:08.430> at

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
it's probably not the best to look at

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.770 
it's probably not the best to look at
this<00:04:08.610> for<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.820> first<00:04:08.850> time<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.360> review<00:04:09.720> um

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
this for the first time in a review um

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.449 
this for the first time in a review um
let's<00:04:12.780> see<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.370> can<00:04:14.610> just<00:04:15.560> in<00:04:16.560> game<00:04:16.979> so<00:04:17.370> you

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
let's see so you can just in game so you

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.880 
let's see so you can just in game so you
can<00:04:17.579> invite<00:04:17.760> people<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:18.180> play<00:04:18.620> but<00:04:19.620> doesn't

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
can invite people to play but doesn't

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.180 
can invite people to play but doesn't
look<00:04:20.040> that<00:04:20.070> there's<00:04:20.489> that<00:04:20.820> many<00:04:21.650> games<00:04:22.650> going

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
look that there's that many games going

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.210 
look that there's that many games going
on<00:04:23.310> only<00:04:23.940> really<00:04:24.510> one<00:04:24.840> game<00:04:25.140> two<00:04:25.979> players

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
on only really one game two players

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.790 
on only really one game two players
online

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
online

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.279 
online
probably<00:04:27.099> why<00:04:27.389> they<00:04:28.389> said<00:04:28.900> they've<00:04:29.020> had<00:04:29.139> some

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
probably why they said they've had some

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.140 
probably why they said they've had some
problems<00:04:29.710> with<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:30.099> and<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:30.669> know<00:04:30.699> because

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
problems with it and you know because

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.969 
problems with it and you know because
they've<00:04:31.419> had<00:04:31.569> problems<00:04:31.720> connecting<00:04:32.319> over<00:04:32.409> 3g

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
they've had problems connecting over 3g

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.980 
they've had problems connecting over 3g
so<00:04:33.310> that<00:04:33.940> might<00:04:34.090> be<00:04:34.120> it<00:04:34.330> because<00:04:34.750> of<00:04:34.780> any

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
so that might be it because of any
