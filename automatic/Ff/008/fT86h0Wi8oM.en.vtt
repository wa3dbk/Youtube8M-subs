and Lancaster it's just a straight line
on<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.470> map<00:00:56.650> it's<00:00:56.920> pretty<00:00:57.130> interesting<00:00:57.400> so

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
on the map it's pretty interesting so

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.630 
on the map it's pretty interesting so
anyway<00:00:58.830> it's<00:00:59.830> pretty<00:01:00.040> neat<00:01:00.220> being<00:01:00.430> here

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
anyway it's pretty neat being here

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
actually it may be like right around

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.380

look at the curving of that rock across

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.230 
look at the curving of that rock across
the<00:01:38.200> way<00:01:38.319> it's<00:01:38.649> absolutely<00:01:39.340> glorious<00:01:39.460> the

better<00:01:43.179> shot<00:01:43.299> of<00:01:43.659> all<00:01:43.780> this<00:01:43.990> but<00:01:44.799> this<00:01:45.249> is<00:01:45.369> a

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
better shot of all this but this is a

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.390 
better shot of all this but this is a
famous<00:01:45.670> road<00:01:46.090> cut

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400

I'll cut with with that book don't fall
on<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.580> sagebrush<00:02:20.970> here<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.450> mean<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.110> hope<00:02:22.410> that

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
on the sagebrush here I mean I hope that

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.100 
on the sagebrush here I mean I hope that
I<00:02:22.620> sure<00:02:22.890> hope<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.160> zooms<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.610> when<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.850> can

I sure hope the zooms in when you can
well<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.290> your<00:02:25.410> computers<00:02:25.890> that's<00:02:26.100> just<00:02:26.340> a

well on your computers that's just a
beautiful<00:02:26.910> cut<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.330> don't<00:02:27.540> care<00:02:27.690> who<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.959> are

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
beautiful cut I don't care who you are

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.280 
beautiful cut I don't care who you are
that's<00:02:28.290> pretty<00:02:29.450> okay<00:02:30.450> here's<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.720> close-up<00:02:30.959> I'm

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
that's pretty okay here's a close-up I'm

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
here at the San Andreas Fault you can

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.730 
here at the San Andreas Fault you can
see<00:02:32.970> just<00:02:33.720> in<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:33.900> little<00:02:34.050> section<00:02:34.380> where<00:02:34.560> I

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
see just in this little section where I

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.210 
see just in this little section where I
am<00:02:34.890> how<00:02:35.490> this<00:02:35.730> curves<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.780> bends<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.320> these

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
am how this curves and bends and these

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.600 
am how this curves and bends and these
layers<00:02:39.410> look<00:02:40.410> at<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:40.770> mean<00:02:40.920> for<00:02:41.100> my<00:02:41.370> hand

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
layers look at that I mean for my hand

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.400 
layers look at that I mean for my hand
for<00:02:41.790> reference<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.150> mean<00:02:42.270> those<00:02:42.420> are<00:02:42.600> fairly

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
for reference I mean those are fairly

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.830 
for reference I mean those are fairly
thin<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.160> then<00:02:44.880> there's<00:02:45.180> layers<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.750> this

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
thin and then there's layers of this

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.290 
thin and then there's layers of this
rock<00:02:46.080> like<00:02:46.290> material<00:02:46.890> but<00:02:47.280> then<00:02:47.490> in<00:02:47.790> between

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
rock like material but then in between

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.790 
rock like material but then in between
it<00:02:48.570> looks<00:02:48.780> like<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.110> as<00:02:49.230> well<00:02:49.260> I'll<00:02:49.590> say<00:02:49.770> it

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
it looks like it as well I'll say it

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.220 
it looks like it as well I'll say it
looks<00:02:50.040> like<00:02:50.100> it's<00:02:50.310> quartz<00:02:50.700> kind<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.030> a

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
looks like it's quartz kind of a

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.600 
looks like it's quartz kind of a
light-colored<00:02:54.380> crystal<00:02:55.380> but<00:02:55.860> very<00:02:56.220> flat

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
light-colored crystal but very flat

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.660 
light-colored crystal but very flat
squeezed<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.690> tortured<00:02:58.080> by<00:02:58.430> geologic<00:02:59.430> forces

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
squeezed and tortured by geologic forces

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.660 
squeezed and tortured by geologic forces
this<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.209> really<00:03:00.900> really<00:03:01.200> cool<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.920> be<00:03:02.310> able<00:03:02.459> to

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
this is really really cool to be able to

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.170 
this is really really cool to be able to
stand<00:03:03.120> right<00:03:03.330> here<00:03:04.459> where<00:03:05.459> all<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.670> actions

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
stand right here where all the actions

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.080 
stand right here where all the actions
happening<00:03:06.739> geologically<00:03:07.739> speaking<00:03:07.860> ho<00:03:08.370> in

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
happening geologically speaking ho in

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.350 
happening geologically speaking ho in
California<00:03:09.630> that's<00:03:10.050> neat
