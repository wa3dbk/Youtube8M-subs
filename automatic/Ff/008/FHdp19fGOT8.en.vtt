lovey dovey heart this is an actual
model<00:00:10.830> of<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.099> human<00:00:11.400> heart<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.049> it's<00:00:13.049> not<00:00:13.230> that

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
model of a human heart and it's not that

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.140 
model of a human heart and it's not that
accurate<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.130> model<00:00:14.400> but<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:14.759> good<00:00:14.910> enough

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
accurate of a model but it's good enough

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.480 
accurate of a model but it's good enough
that<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.360> can<00:00:15.599> teach<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.529> guys<00:00:16.710> about<00:00:17.130> how<00:00:17.190> the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
that I can teach you guys about how the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.810 
that I can teach you guys about how the
human<00:00:18.119> heart<00:00:18.150> works<00:00:18.859> using<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.550> minecraft

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
human heart works using this minecraft

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.519 
human heart works using this minecraft
model<00:00:21.920> so<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.039> heart<00:00:23.250> has<00:00:23.430> four<00:00:23.460> chambers

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
model so the heart has four chambers

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.240 
model so the heart has four chambers
here<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.099> right<00:00:26.910> atrium<00:00:27.510> Oh<00:00:28.039> set<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.130> my

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
here is the right atrium Oh set in my

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.999 
here is the right atrium Oh set in my
heart<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.609> fire<00:00:30.199> put<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.380> out<00:00:31.529> there's<00:00:31.769> lava

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
heart on fire put that out there's lava

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.190 
heart on fire put that out there's lava
and<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:32.790> interacted<00:00:33.239> with<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> wool<00:00:33.600> it's

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
and it's interacted with the wool it's

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.840 
and it's interacted with the wool it's
okay<00:00:34.469> because<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.860> fire<00:00:35.040> tick<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.399> off<00:00:35.520> anyway

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
okay because the fire tick is off anyway

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.119 
okay because the fire tick is off anyway
this<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.510> right<00:00:36.840> atrium<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
this is the right atrium this is the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.119 
this is the right atrium this is the
right<00:00:38.399> ventricle<00:00:39.000> left<00:00:39.469> atrium<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.860> left

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
right ventricle left atrium and left

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.520 
right ventricle left atrium and left
ventricle<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.840> four<00:00:43.079> chambers<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
ventricle so the four chambers of the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.560 
ventricle so the four chambers of the
heart<00:00:43.710> now<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.820> might<00:00:44.910> sound<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.300> I'm

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
heart now it might sound like I'm

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.540 
heart now it might sound like I'm
talking<00:00:45.899> about<00:00:46.050> them<00:00:46.320> backwards<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.520> that's

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
talking about them backwards but that's

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.729 
talking about them backwards but that's
because<00:00:47.899> I'm<00:00:48.899> gonna<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.289> imagine<00:00:49.469> that

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
because I'm gonna have to imagine that

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.380 
because I'm gonna have to imagine that
this<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.039> your<00:00:50.280> heart<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.879> sitting<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.270> your

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
this is your heart and sitting in your

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.290 
this is your heart and sitting in your
body<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.870> you're<00:00:52.020> over<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.149> we're<00:00:54.149> kind

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
body and you're over here and we're kind

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.000 
body and you're over here and we're kind
of<00:00:54.329> looking<00:00:54.510> at<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.840> from<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.500> side<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.949> is

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
of looking at it from the side this is

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.900 
of looking at it from the side this is
going<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.370> annoying

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.490 

so<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.780> yeah<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:02.370> blue<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.840> water<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.470> I

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
so but yeah so the blue the water here I

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.490 
so but yeah so the blue the water here I
guess<00:01:05.119> represents<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> deoxygenated<00:01:06.990> blood

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
guess represents the deoxygenated blood

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.969 
guess represents the deoxygenated blood
and<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.700> orange<00:01:09.150> lava<00:01:09.890> represents<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
and the orange lava represents the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.510 
and the orange lava represents the
oxygenated<00:01:11.640> blood<00:01:12.110> of<00:01:13.110> course<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.860> an<00:01:14.070> actual

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
oxygenated blood of course in an actual

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.730 
oxygenated blood of course in an actual
body<00:01:14.760> all<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.750> blood<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.080> red<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.619> not

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
body all the blood is red it's not

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.070 
body all the blood is red it's not
actually<00:01:17.400> blue<00:01:18.060> even<00:01:18.659> though<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.840> may<00:01:18.900> look

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
actually blue even though it may look

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.179 
actually blue even though it may look
like<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.680> your<00:01:19.830> veins

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.899 

so<00:01:23.189> basically<00:01:24.030> there's<00:01:24.540> kind<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.979> love<00:01:26.610> and

lub dub and so those two sounds oh my
gosh<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.860> fire<00:01:35.270> is<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.450> worst<00:01:36.659> those<00:01:37.500> two

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
gosh this fire is the worst those two

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.580 
gosh this fire is the worst those two
sounds<00:01:37.770> are<00:01:38.070> caused<00:01:38.310> by<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:42.140> valves<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.530> are

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
sounds are caused by the valves that are

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.499 
sounds are caused by the valves that are
in<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:43.829> heart<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.729> there's<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.270> couple

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
in your heart and and there's a couple

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.600 
in your heart and and there's a couple
places<00:01:45.689> where<00:01:45.930> there<00:01:46.200> are<00:01:46.229> valves<00:01:46.549> there's<00:01:47.549> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
places where there are valves there's a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.149 
places where there are valves there's a
valve<00:01:47.850> between<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.680> atrium<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
valve between the atrium and the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.460 
valve between the atrium and the
ventricle<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.850> each<00:01:51.299> side<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.079> that's<00:01:52.229> this

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
ventricle on each side so that's this

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.160 
ventricle on each side so that's this
this<00:01:53.070> white<00:01:53.340> bit<00:01:53.579> here<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:55.020> you'll<00:01:55.110> notice

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
this white bit here and you'll notice

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.219 
this white bit here and you'll notice
the<00:01:55.530> valve<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.920> opening<00:01:56.340> each<00:01:56.659> each<00:01:57.659> time<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the valve is opening each each time and

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.560 
the valve is opening each each time and
when<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> valve<00:01:58.590> closes<00:01:58.969> that's<00:01:59.969> where<00:02:00.479> you

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
when the valve closes that's where you

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.380 
when the valve closes that's where you
get<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.930> lub<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.740> then<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> dub<00:02:02.759> happens

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
get the lub and then the dub happens

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.490 
get the lub and then the dub happens
when<00:02:03.780> there's<00:02:04.530> another<00:02:04.829> valve<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.670> that

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
when there's another valve that that

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.790 
when there's another valve that that
when<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.890> blood<00:02:08.099> exits<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.000> ventricle<00:02:09.800> here

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
when the blood exits the ventricle here

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.820 
when the blood exits the ventricle here
the<00:02:10.979> ventricle<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.760> exits<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.780> heart<00:02:13.080> and

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the ventricle and exits the heart and

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.700 
the ventricle and exits the heart and
notice<00:02:14.070> that's<00:02:14.280> these<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:16.140> can<00:02:16.290> see<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.530> kind

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
notice that's these you can see it kind

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.480 
notice that's these you can see it kind
of<00:02:16.770> flowing<00:02:17.160> up<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.490> out<00:02:19.160> there's<00:02:20.160> another

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
of flowing up and out there's another

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.100 
of flowing up and out there's another
that's<00:02:20.850> what<00:02:21.030> that's<00:02:21.390> where<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.570> dub<00:02:21.780> comes

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
that's what that's where the dub comes

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.740 
that's what that's where the dub comes
from<00:02:22.440> it's<00:02:23.220> from<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:24.450> valve<00:02:25.380> on<00:02:25.800> those

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
from it's from the valve on those

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.330 
from it's from the valve on those
arteries<00:02:29.270> shutting<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:30.890> did<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.920> lot<00:02:32.070> of<00:02:32.190> reading

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
arteries shutting I did a lot of reading

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.570 
arteries shutting I did a lot of reading
on<00:02:32.520> Wikipedia<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.210> learn<00:02:33.330> all<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:34.220> yeah<00:02:35.220> so

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
on Wikipedia to learn all this yeah so

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.760 
on Wikipedia to learn all this yeah so
so<00:02:36.450> basically<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.170> have<00:02:37.380> on<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:39.530> left<00:02:40.530> side

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
so basically you have on the left side

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.700 
so basically you have on the left side
you<00:02:41.100> have<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:42.120> blood<00:02:42.690> coming<00:02:43.080> in<00:02:43.200> through<00:02:43.530> the

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
you have the blood coming in through the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.300 
you have the blood coming in through the
pulmonary<00:02:44.340> vein<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.050> enters<00:02:46.310> actually

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
pulmonary vein and that enters actually

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.190 
pulmonary vein and that enters actually
now<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.460> should<00:02:47.610> start<00:02:47.820> on<00:02:47.940> start<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> right

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
now I should start on start on the right

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.150 
now I should start on start on the right
side<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.770> so<00:02:49.950> confusing<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.550> sides<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:52.740> I

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
side it's so confusing the sides the I

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.830 
side it's so confusing the sides the I
guess<00:02:53.340> okay<00:02:53.580> so<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.790> blood<00:02:53.940> comes<00:02:54.270> in<00:02:54.510> through

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
guess okay so the blood comes in through

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.130 
guess okay so the blood comes in through
the<00:02:55.130> vena<00:02:56.130> cava<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.760> probably<00:02:57.720> said<00:02:57.959> it<00:02:57.990> all

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
the vena cava I probably said it all

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.730 
the vena cava I probably said it all
wrong<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.459> enters<00:02:59.820> into<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:01.200> right

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
wrong and so that enters into the right

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.150 
wrong and so that enters into the right
atrium<00:03:01.770> here<00:03:02.490> and<00:03:02.700> then<00:03:03.709> that<00:03:04.709> goes<00:03:04.950> through

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
atrium here and then that goes through

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.790 
atrium here and then that goes through
this<00:03:05.280> valve<00:03:05.610> here<00:03:06.290> into<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.560> right<00:03:07.770> ventricle

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
this valve here into the right ventricle

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.430 
this valve here into the right ventricle
and<00:03:08.959> it<00:03:09.959> gets<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.560> gets<00:03:10.950> pumped<00:03:11.190> out<00:03:11.370> through

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
and it gets it gets pumped out through

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.660 
and it gets it gets pumped out through
this<00:03:13.440> which<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:16.310> pulmonary<00:03:17.310> artery

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
this which is the the pulmonary artery

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.850 
this which is the the pulmonary artery
and<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.510> pulmonary<00:03:18.810> artery<00:03:19.320> carries<00:03:19.650> that

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
and the pulmonary artery carries that

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.199 
and the pulmonary artery carries that
deoxygenated<00:03:20.730> blood<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.320> lungs<00:03:23.209> the

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
deoxygenated blood to the lungs the

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.060 
deoxygenated blood to the lungs the
lungs<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.600> course<00:03:24.870> add<00:03:25.200> oxygen<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.980> blood

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
lungs of course add oxygen to the blood

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.320 
lungs of course add oxygen to the blood
and<00:03:26.810> it<00:03:27.810> comes<00:03:28.019> back<00:03:28.320> in<00:03:28.650> from<00:03:29.190> this<00:03:30.030> the

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
and it comes back in from this the

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.620 
and it comes back in from this the
pulmonary<00:03:30.810> vein<00:03:31.640> goes<00:03:32.640> into<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.239> left

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
pulmonary vein goes into the left

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.490 
pulmonary vein goes into the left
ventricle<00:03:33.860> sorry<00:03:34.860> left<00:03:35.070> air<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.610> left<00:03:36.500> left

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
ventricle sorry left air to left left

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.520 
ventricle sorry left air to left left
atrium<00:03:37.980> left<00:03:38.250> atrium<00:03:38.580> that's<00:03:38.730> what<00:03:38.820> is<00:03:38.910> called

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
atrium left atrium that's what is called

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.460 
atrium left atrium that's what is called
through<00:03:40.530> through<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.550> valve<00:03:41.730> here<00:03:42.120> into<00:03:42.600> the

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
through through the valve here into the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.800 
through through the valve here into the
left<00:03:43.769> ventricle<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.519> then<00:03:44.700> exits<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.480> hearts

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
left ventricle and then exits the hearts

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.910 
left ventricle and then exits the hearts
through<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.680> aorta<00:03:47.340> which<00:03:47.550> is<00:03:48.230> this<00:03:49.230> yellow

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
through the aorta which is this yellow

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.350 
through the aorta which is this yellow
pet<00:03:50.330> yellow<00:03:51.330> path<00:03:51.570> here<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.430> goes<00:03:53.430> out<00:03:53.610> to<00:03:53.880> the

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
pet yellow path here and goes out to the

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.960 
pet yellow path here and goes out to the
various<00:03:54.570> places<00:03:54.870> in<00:03:55.110> your<00:03:55.170> body<00:03:55.790> so<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.850> can

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
various places in your body so you can

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.870 
various places in your body so you can
see<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.769> that's<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:58.890> whole<00:03:59.040> path<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.640> we

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
see that that's the whole path and we

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.720 
see that that's the whole path and we
can<00:04:00.030> kind<00:04:00.900> of<00:04:00.989> follow<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.860> if<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.040> look<00:04:02.340> so<00:04:02.670> you

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
can kind of follow it if you look so you

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.520 
can kind of follow it if you look so you
go<00:04:02.970> like<00:04:03.150> this<00:04:03.209> and<00:04:03.600> you<00:04:03.989> can<00:04:04.140> see<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.350> valve

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
go like this and you can see the valve

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.440 
go like this and you can see the valve
opens<00:04:04.920> here<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.340> it<00:04:05.400> flows<00:04:05.670> into<00:04:05.880> here<00:04:06.269> and

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
opens here and it flows into here and

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.910 
opens here and it flows into here and
then<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:07.530> evaluates<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:09.530> ventricle<00:04:10.530> here<00:04:10.739> up

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
then it evaluates the ventricle here up

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.970 
then it evaluates the ventricle here up
through<00:04:11.160> here<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.820> so<00:04:12.510> that's<00:04:12.720> all<00:04:12.930> shown<00:04:13.620> by

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
through here and so that's all shown by

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.849 
through here and so that's all shown by
my<00:04:14.250> model<00:04:14.549> of<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.760> heart<00:04:15.440> it's<00:04:16.440> not<00:04:16.590> the

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
my model of the heart it's not the

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.680 
my model of the heart it's not the
best-looking<00:04:17.160> model<00:04:17.519> but<00:04:17.940> hopefully<00:04:18.570> it's

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
best-looking model but hopefully it's

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.030 
best-looking model but hopefully it's
good<00:04:18.840> enough<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:19.140> teach<00:04:19.260> you<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.530> thing<00:04:19.680> or<00:04:19.890> two

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
good enough to teach you a thing or two

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.949 
good enough to teach you a thing or two
that<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.340> didn't<00:04:20.580> know<00:04:20.729> about<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.630> way<00:04:21.780> the

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
that you didn't know about the way the

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.590 
that you didn't know about the way the
human<00:04:22.080> heart<00:04:22.320> works<00:04:23.000> that's<00:04:24.000> about<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.270> thanks

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
human heart works that's about it thanks

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:48.070 
human heart works that's about it thanks
for<00:04:24.630> watching

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.139
