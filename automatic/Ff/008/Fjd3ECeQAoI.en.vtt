to share it with you guys um they're
three<00:00:16.770> different<00:00:17.160> brands<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.699> i<00:00:17.940> found<00:00:18.330> a

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
three different brands that i found a

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.150 
three different brands that i found a
rummy<00:00:20.279> first<00:00:21.270> one<00:00:21.539> my<00:00:22.230> guess<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.740> would

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
rummy first one my guess is that would

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.679 
rummy first one my guess is that would
be<00:00:23.369> with<00:00:23.580> rum<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.779> has<00:00:25.849> three<00:00:26.849> point<00:00:27.359> seven

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
be with rum and it has three point seven

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.730 
be with rum and it has three point seven
percent<00:00:28.410> alcohol<00:00:28.880> so<00:00:29.880> that's<00:00:30.630> like<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.050> beer<00:00:31.500> so

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
percent alcohol so that's like a beer so

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.690 
percent alcohol so that's like a beer so
that's<00:00:31.920> pretty<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:33.149> pretty<00:00:33.210> strong<00:00:34.700> next

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that's pretty it's pretty strong next

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.380 
that's pretty it's pretty strong next
one<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.200> let's<00:00:37.200> see<00:00:37.579> I'm<00:00:38.579> not<00:00:38.790> sure<00:00:39.149> how<00:00:39.329> to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
one is let's see I'm not sure how to

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.580 
one is let's see I'm not sure how to
pronounce<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> guess<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.910> batches

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
pronounce this but I guess it's batches

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.650 
pronounce this but I guess it's batches
and<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.860> has<00:00:44.629> three-point-two<00:00:45.629> percent

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
and it has three-point-two percent

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.610 
and it has three-point-two percent
alcohol<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:47.629> the<00:00:48.629> last<00:00:49.020> one<00:00:50.539> calvados

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.099 

two-point-six<00:00:55.620> percent<00:00:56.059> alcohol<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:58.620> um

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
two-point-six percent alcohol so um

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.100 
two-point-six percent alcohol so um
let's<00:01:01.109> try<00:01:01.920> them<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.969> let's<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:03.899> one

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
let's try them so let's see which one

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.560 
let's try them so let's see which one
should<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.409> start<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.280> strongest<00:01:06.030> or<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
should I start with the strongest or the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.420 
should I start with the strongest or the
weakest<00:01:07.290> um<00:01:08.060> i<00:01:09.560> guess<00:01:10.560> i'm<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.130> start

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
weakest um i guess i'm going to start

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.200 
weakest um i guess i'm going to start
with<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.790> weakest<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:13.680> i've<00:01:14.610> never<00:01:14.939> tried

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
with the weakest so i've never tried

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.170 
with the weakest so i've never tried

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.740 

I<00:01:42.890> bet<00:01:43.520> it<00:01:43.640> in<00:01:43.730> half<00:01:44.000> because<00:01:44.180> I<00:01:44.360> was<00:01:44.480> going<00:01:44.660> to

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.240 
I bet it in half because I was going to
show<00:01:44.780> you<00:01:44.990> guys<00:01:45.140> what<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.590> inside<00:01:45.950> looked

like<00:01:46.430> but<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.480> really<00:01:47.840> shouldn't<00:01:48.170> have<00:01:48.880> because

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
like but I really shouldn't have because

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.080 
like but I really shouldn't have because
it's<00:01:50.210> full<00:01:50.360> of<00:01:50.510> liquid<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:51.820> now<00:01:52.820> it's<00:01:53.000> like

but yeah the alcohol taste is not that

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.470 
but yeah the alcohol taste is not that
strong<00:02:06.820> but<00:02:07.820> um<00:02:08.210> I<00:02:09.850> don't<00:02:10.850> know<00:02:10.970> it's<00:02:11.120> got<00:02:11.270> kind

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:19.840 
strong but um I don't know it's got kind
of<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:13.210> week<00:02:14.440> Apple<00:02:15.440> tastes<00:02:16.280> um<00:02:18.640> I'm<00:02:19.640> not<00:02:19.790> sure

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
of a a week Apple tastes um I'm not sure

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.830 
of a a week Apple tastes um I'm not sure
which<00:02:20.270> alcohol<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:21.020> is<00:02:21.760> but<00:02:22.760> um<00:02:22.910> there<00:02:23.510> aren't

apples<00:02:24.020> on<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.770> box<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.850> guess<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:26.690> makes

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
apples on the box so I guess that makes

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:41.809 
apples on the box so I guess that makes
sense<00:02:27.290> yeah<00:02:29.800> okay<00:02:34.360> let's<00:02:35.360> try<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.780> next<00:02:35.930> one

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.979 

the<00:02:42.530> middle<00:02:43.530> one<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:44.900> back<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:48.540> that's

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
the middle one is back just so that's

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.660 
the middle one is back just so that's
three-point-two<00:02:49.950> percent<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:52.280> gonna<00:02:53.280> open

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
three-point-two percent and gonna open

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.940 
three-point-two percent and gonna open
that<00:02:53.730> one<00:02:55.129> ok<00:02:56.129> so<00:02:56.760> here<00:02:57.599> I<00:02:57.629> go<00:02:57.959> this<00:02:58.439> time<00:02:58.709> I

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
that one ok so here I go this time I

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.819 
that one ok so here I go this time I
don't<00:02:59.310> think<00:02:59.519> I'll<00:02:59.700> bite<00:02:59.879> it<00:03:00.030> in<00:03:00.150> half<00:03:00.389> I

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
don't think I'll bite it in half I

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.170 
don't think I'll bite it in half I
realize<00:03:01.829> now<00:03:02.069> they're<00:03:02.340> all<00:03:02.519> made<00:03:02.760> by<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.000> same

realize now they're all made by the same
brand<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:04.489> latte<00:03:05.569> so<00:03:07.189> I'm<00:03:08.189> sure<00:03:08.609> it<00:03:08.819> will<00:03:09.150> be

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
brand a latte so I'm sure it will be

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.810 
this one's pretty good the chocolate
flavor<00:03:29.920> is<00:03:30.070> a<00:03:30.130> lot<00:03:30.370> stronger<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.490> doesn't

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
flavor is a lot stronger and it doesn't

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.720

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.550 

three-point-seven<00:04:02.050> percent<00:04:02.080> oh<00:04:05.010> wow<00:04:06.010> and

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
three-point-seven percent oh wow and

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.030 
three-point-seven percent oh wow and
this<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:08.740> different<00:04:09.160> packaging<00:04:09.910> as<00:04:10.120> well<00:04:11.040> I'm

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
this is different packaging as well I'm

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.590 
this is different packaging as well I'm
hoping<00:04:12.370> I<00:04:12.520> don't<00:04:12.550> have<00:04:12.850> to<00:04:12.970> eat<00:04:13.150> this<00:04:13.300> whole

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
hoping I don't have to eat this whole

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.720 
hoping I don't have to eat this whole
bar<00:04:13.930> I<00:04:16.380> mean<00:04:17.380> that's<00:04:17.530> that's<00:04:17.919> kind<00:04:18.220> of<00:04:18.310> like<00:04:18.489> a

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
bar I mean that's that's kind of like a

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.000 
bar I mean that's that's kind of like a
lot<00:04:19.120> of<00:04:19.299> chocolate<00:04:19.570> maybe<00:04:20.380> I'll<00:04:20.590> just<00:04:20.739> take<00:04:20.950> a

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
lot of chocolate maybe I'll just take a

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.230 
lot of chocolate maybe I'll just take a
bite<00:04:21.780> ok<00:04:22.780> so<00:04:22.840> for<00:04:23.350> rummy<00:04:23.650> it<00:04:24.550> looks<00:04:25.000> like

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
bite ok so for rummy it looks like

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.850 
bite ok so for rummy it looks like
there's<00:04:25.510> actually<00:04:26.350> grape<00:04:27.310> pieces<00:04:28.620> inside<00:04:29.620> of

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
there's actually grape pieces inside of

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.580 
there's actually grape pieces inside of
the<00:04:29.980> chocolate<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:30.640> no<00:04:31.180> liquid<00:04:31.660> so<00:04:32.050> it's<00:04:32.410> not

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
the chocolate and no liquid so it's not

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:43.000 
the chocolate and no liquid so it's not
messy<00:04:33.010> this<00:04:33.280> time<00:04:33.610> so<00:04:34.330> let's<00:04:35.110> see

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.670 

hmm

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.640 

not<00:04:47.340> bad<00:04:50.570> these<00:04:51.570> are<00:04:51.720> all<00:04:51.750> actually<00:04:52.259> really

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
not bad these are all actually really

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.950 
not bad these are all actually really
good<00:04:52.889> I<00:04:54.320> mean<00:04:55.320> you<00:04:55.470> can't<00:04:55.680> eat<00:04:55.860> them<00:04:55.979> every<00:04:56.310> day

good I mean you can't eat them every day
and<00:04:57.960> you<00:04:57.990> probably<00:04:58.259> shouldn't<00:04:58.680> sit<00:04:58.860> down<00:04:59.100> and

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
wondering which ones I think are the

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.180 
wondering which ones I think are the
best<00:05:20.460> I<00:05:20.850> have<00:05:21.840> to<00:05:21.990> say<00:05:22.199> my<00:05:22.470> favorite<00:05:23.930> was<00:05:25.190> this

because it has actual fruit in it and
even<00:06:09.030> though<00:06:09.120> it's<00:06:09.300> stronger<00:06:10.699> it<00:06:11.699> doesn't

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
even though it's stronger it doesn't

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.600 
even though it's stronger it doesn't
burn<00:06:12.330> like<00:06:12.660> alcohol<00:06:15.830> it<00:06:16.830> just<00:06:17.160> has<00:06:17.340> the

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
burn like alcohol it just has the

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.200 
burn like alcohol it just has the
alcohol<00:06:18.090> flavor<00:06:18.440> it's<00:06:19.440> pretty<00:06:19.740> nice<00:06:21.139> and<00:06:22.139> then

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
alcohol flavor it's pretty nice and then

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.760

last<00:06:24.210> place<00:06:24.510> but<00:06:24.539> not<00:06:25.349> bad<00:06:25.650> choice<00:06:27.770> that's

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
last place but not bad choice that's

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.500 
last place but not bad choice that's
just<00:06:29.570> this<00:06:30.570> one<00:06:31.760> had<00:06:32.760> a<00:06:32.789> little<00:06:33.090> bit<00:06:33.330> of<00:06:33.360> a

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
just this one had a little bit of a

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.110 
just this one had a little bit of a
stronger<00:06:33.870> flavor<00:06:34.199> to<00:06:34.710> me<00:06:34.860> even<00:06:35.639> though<00:06:35.789> it<00:06:35.970> was

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
stronger flavor to me even though it was

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:42.310 
stronger flavor to me even though it was
not<00:06:36.270> the<00:06:36.479> strongest<00:06:36.750> in<00:06:37.289> alcohol<00:06:39.530> um<00:06:40.699> but<00:06:41.699> I

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
not the strongest in alcohol um but I

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.020 
not the strongest in alcohol um but I
mean<00:06:43.320> it's<00:06:43.560> not<00:06:43.800> a<00:06:44.130> bad<00:06:44.610> one<00:06:45.169> so<00:06:46.190> um<00:06:47.190> I

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
mean it's not a bad one so um I

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.710 
mean it's not a bad one so um I
recommend<00:06:48.990> trying<00:06:49.229> all<00:06:49.530> three<00:06:50.150> but<00:06:51.150> don't<00:06:51.360> sit

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
recommend trying all three but don't sit

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.500 
recommend trying all three but don't sit
down<00:06:51.900> and<00:06:52.080> eat<00:06:52.229> the<00:06:52.380> whole<00:06:52.500> package<00:06:52.770> just<00:06:53.510> like

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:54.510

one<00:06:55.260> or<00:06:55.440> two<00:06:55.650> pieces<00:06:55.979> at<00:06:56.430> a<00:06:56.460> time<00:06:56.930> and<00:06:59.840> that<00:07:00.840> way

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
one or two pieces at a time and that way

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.529 
one or two pieces at a time and that way
it<00:07:01.110> last<00:07:01.349> longer<00:07:01.650> too<00:07:01.830> so<00:07:02.340> it's<00:07:03.090> like<00:07:03.360> a
