normally you had a Pike border with
naturally<00:00:47.480> slot<00:00:47.780> underneath<00:00:48.260> but<00:00:48.500> there<00:00:48.649> are

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
naturally slot underneath but there are

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.040

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
nozzles

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.069 
nozzles
although<00:00:58.219> Wilton<00:00:58.850> is<00:00:58.969> exactly<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.600> same<00:00:59.780> and

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
although Wilton is exactly the same and

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.860 
although Wilton is exactly the same and
this<00:01:00.230> is<00:01:00.379> soft<00:01:00.620> pete<00:01:00.920> royal<00:01:01.160> icing<00:01:01.420> so<00:01:02.420> first

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
this is soft pete royal icing so first

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.469 
this is soft pete royal icing so first
of<00:01:03.079> all<00:01:03.230> I<00:01:03.500> would<00:01:03.890> go<00:01:04.070> in<00:01:04.280> attach<00:01:04.940> my<00:01:05.239> royal

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
of all I would go in attach my royal

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.940 
of all I would go in attach my royal
icing<00:01:07.119> then<00:01:08.119> gently<00:01:08.810> pull<00:01:09.080> it<00:01:09.110> away<00:01:09.409> let

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
icing then gently pull it away let

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.160 
icing then gently pull it away let
gravity<00:01:10.220> be<00:01:10.549> your<00:01:10.700> friend

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
gravity be your friend

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.780 
gravity be your friend
they<00:01:12.170> do<00:01:12.229> drape<00:01:12.590> down<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.220> bring<00:01:13.580> it<00:01:13.700> across

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
they do drape down and bring it across

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.620 
they do drape down and bring it across
and<00:01:14.740> touch<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:15.920> off<00:01:16.100> at<00:01:16.820> this<00:01:17.000> point<00:01:17.299> I<00:01:17.450> would

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
and touch it off at this point I would

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.679 
and touch it off at this point I would
reach<00:01:17.810> for<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.110> paintbrush<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:19.009> I<00:01:19.820> would<00:01:19.970> tidy

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
reach for a paintbrush and I would tidy

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.429 
reach for a paintbrush and I would tidy
that<00:01:20.960> joiner<00:01:21.259> I<00:01:21.880> would<00:01:22.880> then<00:01:23.060> do<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.930> next<00:01:23.960> one

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
that joiner I would then do the next one

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.980 
that joiner I would then do the next one
make<00:01:25.070> sure<00:01:25.280> it's<00:01:25.430> attached<00:01:25.820> all<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.869> way

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
make sure it's attached all the way

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.730 
make sure it's attached all the way
slightly<00:01:27.820> let<00:01:28.820> gravity<00:01:29.060> help<00:01:29.299> you<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.380> let<00:01:30.590> it

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
slightly let gravity help you and let it

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.440 
slightly let gravity help you and let it
drape<00:01:31.009> all<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.369> way<00:01:31.460> down<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:31.939> line<00:01:32.150> and

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
drape all the way down to the line and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.600 
drape all the way down to the line and
then<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:32.750> course<00:01:32.829> bring<00:01:33.829> it<00:01:33.950> across<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.400> top

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
then of course bring it across the top

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.420 
then of course bring it across the top
finish<00:01:35.180> it<00:01:35.329> off<00:01:35.829> use<00:01:36.829> a<00:01:36.860> paintbrush<00:01:37.250> just

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
finish it off use a paintbrush just

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.020 
finish it off use a paintbrush just
tidied<00:01:38.390> up<00:01:38.560> as<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:39.680> can<00:01:39.860> see<00:01:40.159> with<00:01:40.549> these<00:01:40.729> bits

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
tidied up as you can see with these bits

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.020 
tidied up as you can see with these bits
here<00:01:41.360> I've<00:01:41.659> actually<00:01:42.310> not<00:01:43.310> got<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.670> scalloped

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
here I've actually not got the scalloped

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.179 
here I've actually not got the scalloped
so<00:01:44.150> I'll<00:01:44.240> put<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.420> mark<00:01:44.689> above<00:01:44.960> it<00:01:45.170> now<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:45.950> way

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
so I'll put a mark above it now the way

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.039 
so I'll put a mark above it now the way
people<00:01:46.640> would<00:01:46.729> do<00:01:46.939> this<00:01:47.180> is<00:01:47.570> they<00:01:47.869> would

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
people would do this is they would

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.249 
people would do this is they would
sometimes<00:01:48.320> use<00:01:48.740> a<00:01:48.920> count<00:01:49.450> so<00:01:50.450> for<00:01:50.899> instance

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
sometimes use a count so for instance

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:58.620 
sometimes use a count so for instance
say<00:01:52.000> touch<00:01:53.000> that<00:01:53.329> one<00:01:54.020> two<00:01:55.180> three<00:01:56.180> four<00:01:57.130> five

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
say touch that one two three four five

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.929 
say touch that one two three four five
that<00:01:59.630> will<00:01:59.810> give<00:01:59.930> my<00:02:00.140> depth<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.460> if<00:02:01.549> I<00:02:01.640> do<00:02:01.759> that

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
that will give my depth so if I do that

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:09.430 
that will give my depth so if I do that
again<00:02:02.799> one<00:02:03.799> two<00:02:04.990> three<00:02:06.009> four<00:02:07.179> five<00:02:08.200> that<00:02:09.200> will

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
again one two three four five that will

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.520 
again one two three four five that will
give<00:02:09.590> me<00:02:09.769> another<00:02:10.070> scoop<00:02:10.880> now<00:02:11.180> if<00:02:11.989> you<00:02:12.290> can

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
give me another scoop now if you can

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.270 
give me another scoop now if you can
keep<00:02:12.709> your<00:02:13.010> speed<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:13.849> your<00:02:15.160> press

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
keep your speed and your press

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.790 
keep your speed and your press
consistent<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.270> works<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.959> lot<00:02:18.290> of<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.560> time

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
consistent that works a lot of the time

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.960 
consistent that works a lot of the time
because<00:02:19.160> I'm<00:02:19.490> very<00:02:19.670> much<00:02:19.990> about<00:02:20.990> accuracy

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
because I'm very much about accuracy

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.090 
because I'm very much about accuracy
probably<00:02:22.970> use<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.090> template<00:02:23.600> so<00:02:24.380> that's<00:02:24.620> gently

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
probably use a template so that's gently

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.830 
probably use a template so that's gently
take<00:02:25.310> this<00:02:25.459> template<00:02:25.850> away<00:02:26.120> because<00:02:26.540> once

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
take this template away because once

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.690 
take this template away because once
I've<00:02:27.080> established<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.740> first<00:02:27.980> line

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
I've established the first line

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.720 
I've established the first line
I<00:02:28.730> can't<00:02:29.480> do<00:02:29.630> anymore<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.290> piping<00:02:30.740> with

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
I can't do anymore of the piping with

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.630 
I can't do anymore of the piping with
the<00:02:31.819> template<00:02:32.270> in<00:02:32.420> place<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:37.130> hope<00:02:37.340> you<00:02:37.489> can

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
the template in place so hope you can

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.430 
the template in place so hope you can
see<00:02:37.819> that<00:02:38.030> gives<00:02:38.270> me<00:02:38.420> my<00:02:38.569> number<00:02:38.959> three<00:02:39.230> line

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
see that gives me my number three line

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.789 
say the width of the gap needs to be
width<00:04:15.070> of<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.340> line<00:04:15.550> above<00:04:15.910> or<00:04:16.060> below<00:04:16.209> it<00:04:16.799> so

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
width of the line above or below it so

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.440 
width of the line above or below it so
that's<00:04:18.340> not<00:04:18.489> something<00:04:18.700> I'm<00:04:18.940> dealing<00:04:19.420> with

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
that's not something I'm dealing with

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.420 
that's not something I'm dealing with
now<00:04:19.750> so<00:04:20.380> I've<00:04:20.500> done<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.859> number<00:04:21.100> three<00:04:21.340> I've

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
now so I've done the number three I've

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.250 
now so I've done the number three I've
done<00:04:21.609> number<00:04:21.910> two<00:04:22.090> I<00:04:22.120> now<00:04:22.480> need<00:04:22.720> to<00:04:22.750> take<00:04:22.930> my

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
done number two I now need to take my

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.620 
done number two I now need to take my
number<00:04:23.410> two<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:24.460> actually<00:04:25.000> put<00:04:25.300> a<00:04:25.330> line

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
number two and actually put a line

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:45.610 
number two and actually put a line
directly<00:04:26.200> on<00:04:26.290> top<00:04:26.530> of<00:04:26.770> my<00:04:26.980> number<00:04:27.250> three

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.730 

so<00:04:46.310> that<00:04:46.700> makes<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.720> top<00:04:47.960> line<00:04:48.200> of<00:04:48.410> three<00:04:48.650> in

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
so that makes the top line of three in

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.790 
so that makes the top line of three in
the<00:04:48.860> zoo<00:04:49.040> and<00:04:49.340> this<00:04:49.460> number<00:04:49.910> two<00:04:50.290> now<00:04:51.290> my<00:04:51.530> last

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
the zoo and this number two now my last

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.740 
the zoo and this number two now my last
and<00:04:52.070> final<00:04:52.100> line<00:04:52.610> in<00:04:52.850> this<00:04:53.030> instance<00:04:53.570> is

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
and final line in this instance is

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.930 
and final line in this instance is
actually<00:04:54.140> number<00:04:54.410> one<00:04:54.440> and<00:04:55.400> what<00:04:55.610> you<00:04:55.670> do<00:04:55.820> with

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
actually number one and what you do with

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.790 
actually number one and what you do with
this<00:04:56.120> is<00:04:56.360> you<00:04:56.450> go<00:04:56.570> in<00:04:56.720> underneath<00:04:59.410> and<00:05:00.410> you

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
this is you go in underneath and you

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:28.170 
this is you go in underneath and you
pipe<00:05:01.070> a<00:05:01.220> line<00:05:01.400> there

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.900 

so<00:05:28.750> that's<00:05:28.900> my<00:05:29.080> number<00:05:29.260> one<00:05:29.440> I<00:05:29.890> now<00:05:30.430> have<00:05:30.670> to<00:05:30.790> go

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
so that's my number one I now have to go

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.850 
so that's my number one I now have to go
in<00:05:31.060> again<00:05:31.390> and<00:05:31.540> put<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:31.780> number<00:05:32.050> one<00:05:32.200> over<00:05:32.620> top

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
in again and put the number one over top

00:05:32.860 --> 00:06:00.000 
in again and put the number one over top
it's<00:05:33.220> number<00:05:33.520> two

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.040 

and<00:06:00.550> to<00:06:00.670> finish<00:06:00.820> this<00:06:01.000> off<00:06:01.330> I<00:06:01.540> need<00:06:01.600> to<00:06:01.810> put<00:06:01.960> in

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
and to finish this off I need to put in

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:24.340 
and to finish this off I need to put in
number<00:06:02.320> one<00:06:02.500> on<00:06:02.710> top<00:06:02.770> of<00:06:02.980> this<00:06:03.250> number<00:06:03.640> two

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.940 

so<00:06:24.920> that's<00:06:25.280> just<00:06:25.490> a<00:06:25.670> reiterate<00:06:26.440> the<00:06:27.440> top<00:06:27.680> line

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
so that's just a reiterate the top line

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.000 
so that's just a reiterate the top line
here<00:06:28.340> is<00:06:28.520> a<00:06:28.580> three<00:06:29.090> two<00:06:29.510> and<00:06:29.690> one<00:06:29.990> the<00:06:30.710> next

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
here is a three two and one the next

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.740 
here is a three two and one the next
line<00:06:31.250> down<00:06:31.490> is<00:06:31.820> a<00:06:31.850> two<00:06:32.150> and<00:06:32.300> one

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
line down is a two and one

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.960 
line down is a two and one
the<00:06:33.080> final<00:06:33.560> line<00:06:33.770> is<00:06:33.980> number<00:06:34.310> one<00:06:34.460> now

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
the final line is number one now

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.550 
the final line is number one now

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 
direct line work however if you were to

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.070 
direct line work however if you were to
look<00:06:48.620> at<00:06:48.890> English<00:06:49.490> over<00:06:49.850> piping<00:06:50.330> German<00:06:50.780> over

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
look at English over piping German over

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.530 
look at English over piping German over
piping<00:06:51.530> Lambeth<00:06:52.010> you<00:06:52.610> would<00:06:52.790> find<00:06:53.060> that<00:06:53.270> some

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:53.540 
piping Lambeth you would find that some

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.210 
piping Lambeth you would find that some
of<00:06:53.570> these<00:06:53.720> you<00:06:53.990> can<00:06:54.200> go<00:06:54.350> up<00:06:54.410> to<00:06:54.590> five<00:06:54.830> or<00:06:55.010> six

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
of these you can go up to five or six

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.730 
of these you can go up to five or six
layers<00:06:55.460> deep<00:06:56.420> all<00:06:56.720> you<00:06:56.870> would<00:06:57.050> do<00:06:57.170> is<00:06:57.200> increase

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
layers deep all you would do is increase

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.330 
layers deep all you would do is increase
them<00:06:58.070> size<00:06:58.610> and<00:06:58.910> nozzle<00:06:59.240> above<00:06:59.890> so<00:07:00.890> say<00:07:01.130> this

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
them size and nozzle above so say this

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.000 
them size and nozzle above so say this
would<00:07:01.520> be<00:07:01.550> a<00:07:01.670> 44<00:07:02.470> underneath<00:07:03.470> that<00:07:03.650> would<00:07:03.860> be<00:07:03.980> a

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.010 
would be a 44 underneath that would be a

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.450 
would be a 44 underneath that would be a
42<00:07:04.640> then<00:07:05.450> there'd<00:07:05.720> be<00:07:05.750> a<00:07:05.840> 4<00:07:06.230> then<00:07:06.530> a<00:07:06.560> 3<00:07:06.920> then<00:07:07.160> a<00:07:07.190> 2

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
42 then there'd be a 4 then a 3 then a 2

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.070 
42 then there'd be a 4 then a 3 then a 2
and<00:07:07.670> a<00:07:07.730> 1<00:07:07.760> if<00:07:08.360> you<00:07:08.510> look<00:07:08.660> at<00:07:08.780> some<00:07:08.930> of<00:07:09.020> the

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 
and a 1 if you look at some of the

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.570 
and a 1 if you look at some of the
Wilton<00:07:09.440> techniques<00:07:09.950> they<00:07:10.190> have<00:07:10.400> these

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 
Wilton techniques they have these

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.030 
Wilton techniques they have these
draping<00:07:11.150> all<00:07:11.390> the<00:07:11.540> way<00:07:11.660> down<00:07:11.960> so<00:07:12.530> this<00:07:12.740> is<00:07:12.890> just

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:13.040 
draping all the way down so this is just

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.100 
draping all the way down so this is just
the<00:07:13.220> basics<00:07:13.700> and<00:07:13.850> the<00:07:13.940> introduction<00:07:14.570> to<00:07:14.600> a

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 
the basics and the introduction to a

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.730 
the basics and the introduction to a
drape<00:07:15.620> line<00:07:15.860> work<00:07:16.100> technique<00:07:16.550> ok<00:07:17.390> so<00:07:18.020> just<00:07:18.290> to

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:18.740 
drape line work technique ok so just to

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.040 
drape line work technique ok so just to
make<00:07:18.920> sure<00:07:19.160> we<00:07:19.310> know<00:07:19.490> the<00:07:19.790> nozzles<00:07:20.480> used<00:07:20.810> were

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.050 
make sure we know the nozzles used were

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.370 
make sure we know the nozzles used were
a<00:07:21.080> PME<00:07:21.650> nozzle<00:07:22.340> number<00:07:23.030> 3<00:07:23.360> number<00:07:23.570> 2<00:07:23.750> number<00:07:24.200> 1

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:24.380 
a PME nozzle number 3 number 2 number 1

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.250 
a PME nozzle number 3 number 2 number 1
these<00:07:25.130> sizes<00:07:25.550> are<00:07:25.940> the<00:07:25.970> same<00:07:26.090> sizes<00:07:27.020> as<00:07:27.230> a

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:27.260 
these sizes are the same sizes as a

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.920 
these sizes are the same sizes as a
Wilton<00:07:28.180> although<00:07:29.180> if<00:07:29.240> you<00:07:29.360> do<00:07:29.510> use<00:07:29.720> other

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:29.930 
Wilton although if you do use other

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.020 
Wilton although if you do use other
nozzles<00:07:30.740> just<00:07:31.010> make<00:07:31.190> sure<00:07:31.370> you've<00:07:31.580> got<00:07:31.610> them

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.030 
nozzles just make sure you've got them

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.630 
nozzles just make sure you've got them
so<00:07:32.270> they<00:07:32.420> decrease<00:07:32.840> in<00:07:33.020> size<00:07:33.230> I<00:07:33.620> was<00:07:34.430> using

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:34.640 
so they decrease in size I was using

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.510 
so they decrease in size I was using
soft<00:07:35.060> peak<00:07:35.300> royal<00:07:35.600> icing<00:07:35.780> and<00:07:36.320> I<00:07:37.010> did<00:07:37.250> use<00:07:37.490> a

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 
soft peak royal icing and I did use a

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.970 
soft peak royal icing and I did use a
template<00:07:38.120> for<00:07:38.390> these<00:07:38.720> two<00:07:39.020> and<00:07:39.290> I<00:07:39.470> didn't<00:07:39.860> use

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:39.980 
template for these two and I didn't use

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.130 
template for these two and I didn't use
a<00:07:40.010> template<00:07:40.550> for<00:07:40.700> those<00:07:40.880> two<00:07:41.150> normally<00:07:42.080> if

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:42.140 
a template for those two normally if

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.840 
a template for those two normally if
there<00:07:42.320> was<00:07:42.410> a<00:07:42.440> barrel<00:07:42.860> border<00:07:43.250> on<00:07:43.340> the<00:07:43.490> top<00:07:43.670> of

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:43.850 
there was a barrel border on the top of

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.060 
there was a barrel border on the top of
this<00:07:43.970> cake<00:07:44.210> they<00:07:44.690> would<00:07:44.870> naturally<00:07:45.050> sneak<00:07:45.800> and

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.070 
this cake they would naturally sneak and

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.460 
this cake they would naturally sneak and
snug<00:07:46.370> underneath<00:07:46.850> them<00:07:47.180> so<00:07:47.780> I<00:07:48.020> hope<00:07:48.200> that's

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:48.470 
snug underneath them so I hope that's

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:53.410 
snug underneath them so I hope that's
helped<00:07:48.740> you<00:07:51.280> so<00:07:52.280> I<00:07:52.310> hope<00:07:52.550> you<00:07:52.700> enjoyed<00:07:53.000> that<00:07:53.030> I
