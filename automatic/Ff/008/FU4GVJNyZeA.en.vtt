00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
the factors i'm sure i could figure it

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.070 
the factors i'm sure i could figure it
out<00:03:08.730> there's<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.180> much<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.420> goes<00:03:09.600> into<00:03:09.720> that

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080
