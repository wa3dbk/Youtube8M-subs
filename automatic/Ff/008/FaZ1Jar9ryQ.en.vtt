00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
because I thought that would look cool

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.910 
because I thought that would look cool
and<00:01:29.390> yeah<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:30.869> over<00:01:31.259> trace<00:01:31.650> the

and yeah I just like over trace the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.810 
and yeah I just like over trace the
whole<00:01:32.130> picture<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:34.369> microsoft<00:01:35.369> paint<00:01:35.549> with

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
whole picture in a microsoft paint with

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.870 
whole picture in a microsoft paint with
that<00:01:35.970> kind<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.240> curve<00:01:36.509> tool<00:01:37.579> so<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.700> looks

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
that kind of curve tool so it looks

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.580 
that kind of curve tool so it looks
almost<00:01:39.060> kind<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.479> pixelated<00:01:40.049> because<00:01:40.140> that

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
almost kind of pixelated because that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.950 
almost kind of pixelated because that
image<00:01:40.950> itself<00:01:41.280> was<00:01:41.520> really<00:01:41.759> tiny<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.780> I

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
image itself was really tiny but I

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.600 
image itself was really tiny but I
thought<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.320> actually<00:01:43.740> gives<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.280> weird

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
thought that actually gives it a weird

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.880 
thought that actually gives it a weird
effect<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:45.180> looks<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.899> don't<00:01:46.439> know<00:01:46.619> it

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
effect that looks like I don't know it

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.950 
effect that looks like I don't know it
gives<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> pixel<00:01:47.880> kind<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.420> effect

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
gives it like a pixel kind of effect

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.810 
gives it like a pixel kind of effect
that<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.350> think<00:01:49.649> there's<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.890> type<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.159> art<00:01:50.430> even

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
that I think there's a type of art even

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.969 
that I think there's a type of art even
called<00:01:51.240> pixel<00:01:51.750> art<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.680> gives<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.920> that

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
called pixel art and it gives it that

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.770 
called pixel art and it gives it that
kind<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.369> cool<00:01:53.579> effect<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.149> actually<00:01:54.600> looks

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
kind of cool effect that actually looks

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.069 
kind of cool effect that actually looks
good<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.909> yeah<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.630> made<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.960> like
