00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
favorite times of the year so I want to

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.930 
favorite times of the year so I want to
take<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.230> quick<00:00:13.469> second<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.009> give<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.759> few

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
take a quick second and give you a few

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.810 
take a quick second and give you a few
things<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.450> how<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.980> maximize<00:00:16.980> your<00:00:17.430> speed<00:00:17.699> and

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
things on how to maximize your speed and

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.760 
things on how to maximize your speed and
efficiency<00:00:17.910> over<00:00:18.779> taller<00:00:19.109> bears<00:00:19.439> we're

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
efficiency over taller bears we're

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.340 
efficiency over taller bears we're
talking<00:00:20.300> maximum<00:00:21.300> height<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.510> 40<00:00:21.930> centimeters

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
talking maximum height is 40 centimeters

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.910 
talking maximum height is 40 centimeters
so<00:00:22.590> anywhere<00:00:23.460> around<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:24.000> range<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:25.710> ones

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
so anywhere around that range the ones

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.349 
so anywhere around that range the ones
that<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.189> definitely<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.760> dismount<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
that you definitely have to dismount the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.870 
that you definitely have to dismount the
bike<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.279> I'm<00:00:29.519> going<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.730> use<00:00:29.849> a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
bike for so for this I'm going to use a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.609 
bike for so for this I'm going to use a
little<00:00:30.090> bit<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.300> slow-mo<00:00:30.750> video<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.349> got

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
little bit of slow-mo video that we got

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.340 
little bit of slow-mo video that we got
of<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.669> local<00:00:32.969> rider<00:00:33.149> named<00:00:33.420> Seth<00:00:33.630> rider<00:00:33.870> except

racing<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> first<00:00:47.789> way<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.030> increase<00:00:48.450> your

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
racing so the first way to increase your

racing so the first way to increase your
speed<00:00:48.809> over<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> Bears<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.770> something

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
speed over the Bears this is something

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.770 
speed over the Bears this is something
we<00:00:50.640> talked<00:00:50.820> about<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> runners<00:00:51.570> all<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
we talked about with the runners all the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.020 
we talked about with the runners all the
time<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.289> minimizing<00:00:53.250> your<00:00:53.489> frontside

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
time is minimizing your frontside

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.119 
time is minimizing your frontside
contact<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:55.020> never<00:00:55.230> want<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> have<00:00:55.680> your<00:00:55.829> foot

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
contact you never want to have your foot

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.490 
contact you never want to have your foot
land<00:00:56.489> out<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.910> front<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.149> your<00:00:57.270> body<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:58.260> in

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
land out in front of your body that in

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.020 
land out in front of your body that in
turn<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.920> actually<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.430> pushing<00:00:59.789> back<00:01:00.000> on

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
turn is actually just pushing back on

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.110 
turn is actually just pushing back on
you<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.420> stealing<00:01:00.840> your<00:01:00.960> momentum<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.370> as<00:01:02.730> you

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
you and stealing your momentum so as you

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.299 
you and stealing your momentum so as you
see<00:01:03.300> here<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.570> Seth<00:01:03.809> comes<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.769> only<00:01:05.070> time

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
see here as Seth comes in the only time

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.830 
see here as Seth comes in the only time
his<00:01:05.460> foot<00:01:05.670> lands<00:01:05.939> out<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.150> front<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.570> right

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
his foot lands out in front is right

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.320 
his foot lands out in front is right
here<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.380> penultimate<00:01:07.979> step<00:01:08.220> now<00:01:08.880> once<00:01:09.180> he

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
here that penultimate step now once he

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.130 
here that penultimate step now once he
gets<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.720> over<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> barrier<00:01:11.040> he<00:01:11.520> will<00:01:11.640> never

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
gets up over the barrier he will never

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.840 
gets up over the barrier he will never
land<00:01:13.140> out<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.530> front<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.920> his<00:01:14.100> body<00:01:14.280> again<00:01:14.729> his

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
land out in front of his body again his

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.820 
land out in front of his body again his
foots<00:01:15.150> always<00:01:15.600> underneath<00:01:15.869> his<00:01:16.140> hips<00:01:16.350> his

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
foots always underneath his hips his

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.469 
foots always underneath his hips his
shin<00:01:17.070> angles<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:17.490> always<00:01:17.790> forward<00:01:18.150> or

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
shin angles are always forward or

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.109 
shin angles are always forward or
vertical<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:20.040> he's<00:01:20.220> always<00:01:20.400> either<00:01:20.610> creating

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
vertical so he's always either creating

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:32.620 
vertical so he's always either creating
lift<00:01:21.360> or<00:01:21.659> he's<00:01:22.170> creating<00:01:22.650> forward<00:01:23.040> momentum

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.830 

so<00:01:33.630> when<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.870> minimize<00:01:34.290> frontside<00:01:34.890> contact

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
so when you minimize frontside contact

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.900 
so when you minimize frontside contact
you<00:01:36.840> actually<00:01:37.560> reduce<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.190> number<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.520> steps

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
you actually reduce the number of steps

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.550 
you actually reduce the number of steps
that<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.570> take<00:01:39.750> between<00:01:39.960> barriers

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
that you have to take between barriers

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.120 
that you have to take between barriers
as<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.040> see<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:41.690> Seth<00:01:42.690> only<00:01:43.380> takes<00:01:43.680> two

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
as you can see here Seth only takes two

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.510 
as you can see here Seth only takes two
steps<00:01:44.490> his<00:01:44.820> feet<00:01:45.030> hit<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.210> ground<00:01:45.330> two<00:01:45.840> times

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
steps his feet hit the ground two times

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.690 
steps his feet hit the ground two times
between<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.850> set<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.420> barriers<00:01:48.750> now<00:01:49.700> Johnny

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
between this set of barriers now Johnny

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.969 
between this set of barriers now Johnny
Brown<00:01:51.000> coming<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.660> behind<00:01:51.990> him<00:01:52.110> also<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> force

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
Brown coming in behind him also a force

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.969 
Brown coming in behind him also a force
to<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.160> reckoned<00:01:53.280> with<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:54.600> road<00:01:55.229> cycling<00:01:55.770> and

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
to be reckoned with in road cycling and

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.300 
to be reckoned with in road cycling and
cyclocross<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:58.020> right<00:01:58.740> on<00:01:59.070> his

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
cyclocross you can see right on his

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.760 
cyclocross you can see right on his
second<00:01:59.760> step<00:02:00.060> he's<00:02:00.870> out<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.290> front<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.680> his

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
second step he's out in front of his

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.950 
second step he's out in front of his
body<00:02:01.950> just<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.610> little<00:02:02.880> bit<00:02:03.030> there<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.450> what

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
body just a little bit there so what

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.900 
body just a little bit there so what
that<00:02:04.110> does<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.979> steals<00:02:05.220> his<00:02:05.369> momentum<00:02:05.820> it

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
that does is it steals his momentum it

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.670 
that does is it steals his momentum it
forces<00:02:06.360> him<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.540> have<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.930> take<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.320> third

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
forces him to have to take this third

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:16.510 
forces him to have to take this third
step<00:02:08.100> between<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.580> barriers

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.250 

now<00:02:17.030> before<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.510> heard<00:02:17.660> me<00:02:17.780> use<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.080> term

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
now before you heard me use the term

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.230 
now before you heard me use the term
penultimate<00:02:18.920> step<00:02:19.160> this<00:02:19.580> is<00:02:19.640> more<00:02:19.880> commonly

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
penultimate step this is more commonly

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.640 
penultimate step this is more commonly
used<00:02:20.570> in<00:02:20.960> long<00:02:21.650> jump<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.130> high<00:02:22.340> jump<00:02:22.700> but<00:02:23.650> the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
used in long jump and high jump but the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.440 
used in long jump and high jump but the
idea<00:02:25.070> is<00:02:25.160> that<00:02:25.370> we're<00:02:25.670> just<00:02:25.700> trying<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.180> create

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
idea is that we're just trying to create

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.760 
idea is that we're just trying to create
lift<00:02:27.160> so<00:02:28.160> as<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:29.420> can<00:02:29.570> see<00:02:29.840> here<00:02:30.170> in<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.530> next

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
lift so as you can see here in the next

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.390 
lift so as you can see here in the next
frame<00:02:31.370> as<00:02:31.790> set<00:02:32.480> this<00:02:32.660> coming<00:02:32.990> in<00:02:33.200> his<00:02:34.070> foot

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
frame as set this coming in his foot

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.860 
frame as set this coming in his foot
will<00:02:34.550> land<00:02:34.760> right<00:02:35.120> out<00:02:35.270> in<00:02:35.390> front<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.630> his<00:02:35.720> body

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
will land right out in front of his body

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.540 
will land right out in front of his body
it's<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.200> only<00:02:36.410> time<00:02:36.710> his<00:02:36.890> foot<00:02:37.280> will<00:02:37.400> land

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
it's the only time his foot will land

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.980 
it's the only time his foot will land
out<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:37.760> front<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.120> his<00:02:38.210> body<00:02:38.450> but<00:02:38.690> what<00:02:38.840> it

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
out in front of his body but what it

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.440 
out in front of his body but what it
does<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:40.040> creates<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.550> little<00:02:40.700> hinge<00:02:41.090> almost

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
does is it creates a little hinge almost

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.150 
does is it creates a little hinge almost
like<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.630> pole<00:02:41.960> vaulter<00:02:42.290> putting<00:02:42.620> its<00:02:42.740> pole<00:02:43.010> in

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
like a pole vaulter putting its pole in

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.030 
like a pole vaulter putting its pole in
the<00:02:43.250> ground<00:02:43.490> it<00:02:43.640> creates<00:02:44.000> lift<00:02:44.360> for<00:02:44.720> him<00:02:45.040> so

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
the ground it creates lift for him so

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.370 
the ground it creates lift for him so
he's<00:02:46.250> gonna<00:02:46.340> get<00:02:46.520> a<00:02:46.580> lot<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.880> lift<00:02:47.090> up<00:02:47.300> over<00:02:47.630> the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
he's gonna get a lot of lift up over the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.970 
he's gonna get a lot of lift up over the
barrier<00:02:48.770> now<00:02:49.870> learning<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:50.990> utilize<00:02:51.470> this<00:02:51.740> pen

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980

ultimate<00:02:52.100> step<00:02:52.610> does<00:02:52.820> a<00:02:52.850> couple<00:02:53.090> things<00:02:53.390> one

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
ultimate step does a couple things one

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.290 
ultimate step does a couple things one
as<00:02:54.110> we<00:02:54.200> talked<00:02:54.440> about<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.800> creates<00:02:55.070> lift<00:02:55.370> -<00:02:55.970> as

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
as we talked about it creates lift - as

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.120 
as we talked about it creates lift - as
you<00:02:56.510> can<00:02:56.630> see<00:02:56.690> here<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.560> allows<00:02:57.830> you<00:02:58.010> to

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
you can see here it allows you to

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.340 
you can see here it allows you to
dismount<00:02:58.550> really<00:02:59.120> close<00:02:59.570> to<00:02:59.900> the<00:02:59.990> barrier

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
dismount really close to the barrier

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.560 
dismount really close to the barrier
thus<00:03:00.950> reducing<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.670> number<00:03:01.940> of<00:03:01.970> steps<00:03:02.210> you

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
thus reducing the number of steps you

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.590 
thus reducing the number of steps you
have<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.870> take<00:03:03.460> this<00:03:04.460> clip<00:03:04.760> just<00:03:05.030> demonstrates

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
have to take this clip just demonstrates

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.290 
have to take this clip just demonstrates
the<00:03:06.050> difference<00:03:06.530> in<00:03:06.650> step<00:03:07.130> savings<00:03:07.640> between

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
last tip we have is to make sure that

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.020 
last tip we have is to make sure that
you<00:03:23.870> power<00:03:24.260> off<00:03:24.440> as<00:03:24.890> you<00:03:25.010> can<00:03:25.130> see<00:03:25.310> Seth<00:03:25.610> -<00:03:25.790> here
