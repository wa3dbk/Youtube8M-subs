00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.019
 a small precision 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.179
 in our last edition of March 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.300

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.350
 falls 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.520
 she had not succeeded and had said she had strangled 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.689
 by the atmosphere not the people who were there 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.900
 but she was planning to do it again if the atmosphere was ok was not 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:33.970
 trouble 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.070
 after the broadcast of it we proposed 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.760
 an appointment to repeat the experience without the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.760
 disturbed at all 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.570

 had during 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.780
 it is therefore an association for me of equity 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.010
 the king of pop had wanted him out at brooklyn 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.539

 yes, which is called databases of belgium 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.480
 an enigma we would have liked 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.190
 it's a wave those who will wonder about relatively recently unfolded 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.450
 the dates of the beginning of the wave the woman takes the events will lie 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.360
 Demorand 89 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.720

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.329
 then by your side 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.709
 hello sir robert rousselle who is a journalist and author of a book 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.019
 which is a little bit of people elected home about it these compromises the 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.519
 hidden truths 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.330
 of their official investigation 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.749
 here is the book the rendezvous is a saddle horse 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:23.479
 so mister rossel 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:24.799
 what did you mean by that 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.159
 but I do not hear much but the gesture is pretty pretty young woman holding 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.800
 to ask me how there is plenty of talent 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.170
 the prefecture afp 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.550
 it's not a bit more noise made around the official investigator 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.379
 precisely done in the past 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.900
 and that's a little bit of what I want to develop around statements 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.779
 certainly sir velasco agree 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:43.099
 and I have some documents that could soon be at the big 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.999

 this document if you saw as an airline pilot 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.379
 you've seen yourself and witnesses from after domain 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.269
 it can be said of entry into the atmosphere of an unidentified craft 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.749
 it's up on the back 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:18.179
 in the field of saving savvy customers having left a truly 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:22.370
 of entry simply to return for a second our plane was exceeded 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.709
 by a phenomenon 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.589
 I do not know where he came from you do not know but it is not clear 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:29.109

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.460
 and there had been there he planned 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.140
 cantor now almost 30 years old because it's still 35 hours 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.119
 at the end of these games 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:00.569
 he hid for years and years for 17 years because I 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.419
 thought we would take seriously for tennis 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.469
 and then today he is testifying 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:07.409
 here it is without your agreement 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.109
 including recruitment 64 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.379

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.109
 when one morning we all fight by 64 the day before there was a line of the rocha 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.999
 I see in the field towards death 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:25.430
 a huge cistern 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.520
 on the north side 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.530
 the device structure details 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.319
 it was down the coast 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:31.370
 and the big countries 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.520
 housing 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.300
 to see what's going on in this woman, too 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.389
 and with whom 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:37.580
 huge group 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.469
 gbagbo the red

 the water has returned with the committee for their blooming and especially it makes 

00:04:42.739 --> 00:04:43.340
 three years 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.160
 it's been thirty years since I'm sure because it's the most serious and the 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.599
 closed off 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.610
 alas when did you realize that it was little too much 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.159
 this one lets go where he was going to see her what he defended in 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.129
 paths 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:54.520
 but most green plants also 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.540
 she is known to all 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.940
 and while it all starts to take off that moves that DIY the noise I 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.210
 behave 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.219
 I did not hear anything 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:03.410
 she was eating an apple 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.029
 a white smoke 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:06.300
 a week after 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.939
 I want to take to the place of takeoff 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:10.800
 have all the partners 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.219
 if the good is not ugly like the right ones 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:16.400
 and you're sure that's a problem for any couple 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.440
 it can not be a person who is not obtuse of metal objects 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.659
 as a woman on another body and then farnham 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.949
 the beauty besides that everything goes wrong is done

 four children 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.580
 so why flying by the containers 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.639
 at the time when we went to the gendarmerie to say that we had 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.860
 paris flying saucer should find something we call and 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.150
 irredeemably 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.319
 locked up in a psychiatric asylum 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:41.389
 and you know what to do 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.199
 earlier 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.580
 thank you for letting go early 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.849
 I think he exaggerates a little raised in a big club here is the victory 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:48.449
 Bordeaux 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.199
 but it's life here is the decimal jump that will not be possible if we 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.759
 remember the six pieces he found as it brought you
