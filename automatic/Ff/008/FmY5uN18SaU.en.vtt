ounces<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:50.330> you<00:02:50.420> could<00:02:50.540> even<00:02:50.690> go<00:02:50.840> bigger<00:02:51.049> if

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
ounces so you could even go bigger if

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.339 
ounces so you could even go bigger if
you<00:02:51.290> want<00:02:52.060> some<00:02:53.060> other<00:02:53.209> tests<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:54.019> bigger<00:02:54.230> the

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
smaller caps like these ones do not work

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.100 
smaller caps like these ones do not work
as<00:03:01.250> well<00:03:01.280> they're<00:03:01.610> much<00:03:01.790> harder<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.989> also

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
as well they're much harder to it also
