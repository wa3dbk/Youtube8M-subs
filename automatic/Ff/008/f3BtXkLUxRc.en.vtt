00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
like I am this might make you a little

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:46.810 
like I am this might make you a little
crazy

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.940 

I<00:01:46.850> then<00:01:47.510> filled<00:01:47.780> in<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:48.020> eye<00:01:48.050> area<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:48.650> also

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
I then filled in the eye area and also

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.500 
I then filled in the eye area and also
the<00:01:49.070> nose<00:01:49.280> with<00:01:49.520> a<00:01:49.610> mix<00:01:49.790> of<00:01:49.970> that<00:01:50.180> black<00:01:50.480> and

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
the nose with a mix of that black and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.600 
the nose with a mix of that black and
brown<00:01:50.720> body<00:01:51.170> painted<00:01:51.680> I<00:01:51.740> didn't<00:01:52.070> want<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.460> be

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
brown body painted I didn't want to be

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.610 
brown body painted I didn't want to be
straight-up<00:01:53.060> black<00:01:53.660> I<00:01:53.930> wanted<00:01:54.230> this<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:54.470> look

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
straight-up black I wanted this to look

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.230 
straight-up black I wanted this to look
more<00:01:54.950> like<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.190> tattoo<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:55.760> more<00:01:55.940> like<00:01:56.120> it's

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
more like a tattoo and more like it's

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.640 
more like a tattoo and more like it's
been<00:01:56.450> there<00:01:56.630> for<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:56.840> while

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.530 

using<00:02:01.370> that<00:02:01.520> same<00:02:01.700> color<00:02:01.970> I<00:02:02.060> went<00:02:02.330> ahead<00:02:02.390> and

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
using that same color I went ahead and

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.000 
using that same color I went ahead and
started<00:02:02.720> sketching<00:02:03.200> in<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.590> teeth

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
started sketching in the teeth

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.100 
started sketching in the teeth
once<00:02:04.250> again<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.700> teeth<00:02:04.910> do<00:02:05.180> extend<00:02:05.630> further

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
once again the teeth do extend further

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.960 
once again the teeth do extend further
than<00:02:06.440> your<00:02:06.590> natural<00:02:06.770> teeth<00:02:07.220> would<00:02:07.550> so<00:02:07.790> just

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
than your natural teeth would so just

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:16.300 
than your natural teeth would so just
keep<00:02:08.119> that<00:02:08.240> in<00:02:08.390> mind

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.010 

in<00:02:16.819> between<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.270> teeth<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.569> then<00:02:17.750> went<00:02:17.870> ahead

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
in between the teeth I then went ahead

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.600 
in between the teeth I then went ahead
and<00:02:18.140> added<00:02:18.350> some<00:02:18.650> shading<00:02:18.950> using<00:02:19.220> black

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
and added some shading using black

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.190 
and added some shading using black
eyeshadow<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.420> just<00:02:20.569> kind<00:02:20.750> of<00:02:20.810> put<00:02:21.020> it<00:02:21.110> in

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
eyeshadow and just kind of put it in

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:30.250 
eyeshadow and just kind of put it in
between<00:02:21.410> each<00:02:21.950> tooth

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.199 

going<00:02:31.010> back<00:02:31.159> with<00:02:31.310> my<00:02:31.400> detail<00:02:31.730> brush<00:02:31.760> in<00:02:32.180> that

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
going back with my detail brush in that

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.940 
going back with my detail brush in that
mixture<00:02:32.629> of<00:02:32.780> body<00:02:32.989> paint<00:02:33.290> I'm<00:02:33.409> conducting<00:02:33.739> my

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
mixture of body paint I'm conducting my

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.830 
mixture of body paint I'm conducting my
lower<00:02:34.340> jaw<00:02:34.730> as<00:02:35.000> well<00:02:35.030> as<00:02:35.330> filling<00:02:35.569> in<00:02:35.810> that

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.990 
lower jaw as well as filling in that
area<00:02:36.379> I<00:02:36.500> use<00:02:36.830> as<00:02:36.980> much<00:02:37.129> water<00:02:37.159> for<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:37.760> area

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
area I use as much water for this area

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.460 
area I use as much water for this area
because<00:02:38.209> I<00:02:38.390> wanted<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.900> be<00:02:39.049> a<00:02:39.080> little<00:02:39.349> bit

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
because I wanted it to be a little bit

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.830 
because I wanted it to be a little bit
more<00:02:39.650> powdery<00:02:40.190> don't<00:02:40.549> overthink<00:02:41.090> things<00:02:41.330> just

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
more powdery don't overthink things just

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.240 
more powdery don't overthink things just
like<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.049> can<00:02:42.170> go<00:02:42.290> ahead<00:02:42.409> and<00:02:42.650> draw<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:42.920> gum

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
like you can go ahead and draw the gum

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.130 
like you can go ahead and draw the gum
line<00:02:43.519> details<00:02:44.150> in<00:02:44.480> there<00:02:44.690> just<00:02:44.959> with<00:02:45.019> the

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
line details in there just with the

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:55.130 
line details in there just with the
brush<00:02:45.349> you're<00:02:45.530> using<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:46.010> just<00:02:46.040> by<00:02:46.370> shading

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.980 

I<00:02:55.170> also<00:02:56.040> went<00:02:56.340> ahead<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.670> went<00:02:56.820> around<00:02:56.940> my<00:02:57.270> jaw

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.270 

for<00:03:01.990> the<00:03:02.080> side<00:03:02.230> of<00:03:02.350> my<00:03:02.410> face<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.770> went<00:03:03.070> ahead<00:03:03.130> to

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
for the side of my face I went ahead to

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.950 
for the side of my face I went ahead to
follow<00:03:03.550> how<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.850> skull<00:03:04.180> should<00:03:04.510> be<00:03:04.690> which<00:03:04.870> is

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
follow how the skull should be which is

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.540 
follow how the skull should be which is
going<00:03:05.110> around<00:03:05.320> your<00:03:05.590> cheekbone<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:06.100> leaving

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
going around your cheekbone and leaving

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.540 
going around your cheekbone and leaving
a<00:03:06.610> hole<00:03:06.790> for<00:03:07.000> your<00:03:07.060> temple<00:03:08.070> using<00:03:09.070> my<00:03:09.280> double

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
a hole for your temple using my double

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
ended brush and gray eyeshadow I very

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.020 
ended brush and gray eyeshadow I very
lightly<00:03:11.740> went<00:03:12.160> in<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.430> added<00:03:12.520> some<00:03:12.790> shading

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
lightly went in and added some shading

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.640 
lightly went in and added some shading
according<00:03:13.630> to<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.840> reference<00:03:14.170> photo<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:14.500> was

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
according to the reference photo I was

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.080 
according to the reference photo I was
looking<00:03:14.950> at<00:03:15.100> this<00:03:15.280> helped<00:03:15.520> add<00:03:15.640> some<00:03:15.850> shading

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
looking at this helped add some shading

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.610 
looking at this helped add some shading
to<00:03:16.240> one<00:03:16.510> side<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.870> face<00:03:17.020> and<00:03:17.200> also<00:03:17.350> make

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
to one side of the face and also make

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.470 
to one side of the face and also make
the<00:03:17.740> holes<00:03:17.980> appear<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.460> little<00:03:18.760> bit<00:03:18.910> more<00:03:19.240> like

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
the holes appear a little bit more like

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:27.330 
the holes appear a little bit more like
holes

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.460 

I<00:03:27.370> use<00:03:27.970> my<00:03:28.120> detail<00:03:28.420> brush<00:03:28.450> for<00:03:28.900> like<00:03:29.020> the<00:03:29.170> finer

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.350 
I use my detail brush for like the finer
areas<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.250> little<00:03:30.489> details<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.090> also

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
areas and little details and also

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.520 
areas and little details and also
blended<00:03:31.690> those<00:03:31.780> out<00:03:31.959> with<00:03:32.050> my<00:03:32.170> fingers

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
blended those out with my fingers

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.839 
blended those out with my fingers
because<00:03:32.709> like<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.160> said<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:33.370> don't<00:03:33.610> want

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849

tendons<00:03:50.990> and<00:03:51.170> drew<00:03:51.380> those<00:03:51.530> out<00:03:51.740> first<00:03:52.040> and

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
tendons and drew those out first and

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.830 
tendons and drew those out first and
this<00:03:52.370> is<00:03:52.490> all<00:03:52.700> an<00:03:52.880> eye<00:03:53.000> shadow<00:03:53.030> if<00:03:53.510> there<00:03:53.720> are

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
this is all an eye shadow if there are

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.990 
this is all an eye shadow if there are
any<00:03:53.990> holes<00:03:54.350> in<00:03:54.650> between<00:03:54.830> those<00:03:55.310> tendons<00:03:55.820> go

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
any holes in between those tendons go

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.340 
any holes in between those tendons go
ahead<00:03:56.210> and<00:03:56.330> fill<00:03:56.480> those<00:03:56.630> in<00:03:56.690> so<00:03:56.990> you<00:03:57.050> don't<00:03:57.080> get

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
ahead and fill those in so you don't get

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:04.120 
ahead and fill those in so you don't get
confused<00:03:57.770> later<00:03:57.860> on

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.160 

once<00:04:04.820> I<00:04:04.910> had<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.060> larger<00:04:05.510> tent<00:04:05.720> is<00:04:05.810> down<00:04:05.990> from

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
once I had a larger tent is down from

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.380 
once I had a larger tent is down from
AHS<00:04:06.770> I<00:04:06.920> went<00:04:07.190> ahead<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.430> references<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.180> bee

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
AHS I went ahead and references a bee

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.450 
AHS I went ahead and references a bee
boy<00:04:08.570> for<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:08.960> rest<00:04:09.140> of<00:04:09.320> you<00:04:09.500> like<00:04:09.680> next<00:04:10.220> rings

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
boy for the rest of you like next rings

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.920 
boy for the rest of you like next rings
out<00:04:10.670> hauls<00:04:10.970> you<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.180> explain<00:04:11.480> it's<00:04:11.660> because<00:04:11.870> I

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
out hauls you to explain it's because I

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.420 
out hauls you to explain it's because I
feel<00:04:12.110> like<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:12.320> webbing<00:04:12.650> on<00:04:12.740> his<00:04:12.950> neck<00:04:13.220> has<00:04:13.400> a

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
feel like the webbing on his neck has a

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.130 
feel like the webbing on his neck has a
little<00:04:13.640> bit<00:04:13.760> of<00:04:13.820> a<00:04:13.880> cooler<00:04:14.150> pattern<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:14.960> the

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
little bit of a cooler pattern to it the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.660 
little bit of a cooler pattern to it the
easiest<00:04:15.440> way<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:15.650> explain<00:04:15.860> this<00:04:16.310> stringy

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
easiest way to explain this stringy

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.970 
easiest way to explain this stringy
pattern<00:04:17.150> is<00:04:17.300> to<00:04:17.450> draw<00:04:17.660> circles<00:04:18.170> and<00:04:18.380> then<00:04:18.590> draw

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
pattern is to draw circles and then draw

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.040 
pattern is to draw circles and then draw
curves<00:04:19.459> around<00:04:19.760> that<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.390> make<00:04:20.420> strings

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.050 
curves around that to make strings

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.290 
curves around that to make strings
extending<00:04:21.980> from<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.340> circles<00:04:22.850> and<00:04:23.090> then

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
extending from the circles and then

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.360 
extending from the circles and then
within<00:04:23.600> those<00:04:24.050> circles<00:04:24.380> also<00:04:24.890> draw

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
within those circles also draw

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.700 
within those circles also draw
additional<00:04:25.940> strings<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:26.540> shade<00:04:26.870> in<00:04:27.050> any<00:04:27.350> of

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
additional strings and shade in any of

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:54.469 
additional strings and shade in any of
the<00:04:27.830> negative<00:04:28.190> spaces

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.360 

once<00:04:55.080> I<00:04:55.199> had<00:04:55.319> all<00:04:55.349> that<00:04:55.620> like<00:04:55.770> webbing<00:04:56.249> in

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
once I had all that like webbing in

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.439 
once I had all that like webbing in
there<00:04:56.550> I<00:04:56.580> went<00:04:56.849> ahead<00:04:56.909> and<00:04:57.059> added<00:04:57.360> the

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
there I went ahead and added the

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:58.999 
there I went ahead and added the
vertebrae<00:04:57.840> for<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.169> vertebrae<00:04:58.529> I<00:04:58.559> went<00:04:58.770> back

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
vertebrae for the vertebrae I went back

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:06.640 
vertebrae for the vertebrae I went back
to<00:04:59.039> a<00:04:59.279> just<00:04:59.699> and<00:04:59.879> reference<00:05:00.240> net

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
go ahead and use your tape reference

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.390 
go ahead and use your tape reference
photo<00:05:08.900> and<00:05:09.169> fill<00:05:09.320> in<00:05:09.500> any<00:05:09.620> strings<00:05:10.100> that<00:05:10.280> might

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
photo and fill in any strings that might

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.129 
photo and fill in any strings that might
cross<00:05:10.669> over<00:05:10.970> the<00:05:11.060> vertebrae<00:05:11.510> also<00:05:11.900> deep

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
cross over the vertebrae also deep

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.469 
cross over the vertebrae also deep
enough<00:05:12.440> the<00:05:12.680> lines<00:05:13.160> that<00:05:13.460> are<00:05:13.520> around<00:05:13.970> view

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.110 

using<00:05:21.710> black<00:05:21.919> eyeshadow<00:05:22.100> I<00:05:22.460> then<00:05:22.729> just<00:05:22.910> went

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
using black eyeshadow I then just went

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.600 
using black eyeshadow I then just went
over<00:05:23.419> one<00:05:23.750> entire<00:05:24.199> side<00:05:24.229> very<00:05:25.039> lightly<00:05:25.520> as

over one entire side very lightly as

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.640 
over one entire side very lightly as
well<00:05:25.850> as<00:05:26.000> shading<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.539> larger<00:05:27.020> tendons<00:05:27.500> on

well as shading the larger tendons on
the<00:05:27.800> sides<00:05:28.039> this<00:05:28.490> is<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.759> easiest<00:05:29.090> and

section if there were any details that I
may<00:05:32.960> have<00:05:33.080> missed<00:05:33.350> I<00:05:33.470> went<00:05:33.680> in<00:05:33.770> with<00:05:33.860> gray<00:05:34.130> and

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
may have missed I went in with gray and

those<00:05:35.990> off<00:05:36.580> for<00:05:37.580> the<00:05:37.669> ears<00:05:37.880> I<00:05:38.150> don't<00:05:38.270> really

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
those off for the ears I don't really

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:39.730 
those off for the ears I don't really
know<00:05:38.600> what's<00:05:38.720> going<00:05:38.780> on<00:05:38.990> so<00:05:39.229> I<00:05:39.259> just<00:05:39.440> put<00:05:39.620> those

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
know what's going on so I just put those

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.200 
know what's going on so I just put those
little<00:05:39.979> stringy<00:05:40.340> things<00:05:40.639> on<00:05:40.820> them<00:05:43.210> and

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
little stringy things on them and

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.520 
little stringy things on them and
because<00:05:44.449> like<00:05:44.479> I<00:05:44.780> said<00:05:44.960> I<00:05:44.990> wanted<00:05:45.320> it's<00:05:45.470> a

because like I said I wanted it's a

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.779 
because like I said I wanted it's a
little<00:05:45.889> bit<00:05:45.979> more<00:05:46.160> like<00:05:46.280> a<00:05:46.370> tattoo<00:05:46.580> like

little bit more like a tattoo like
zombie<00:05:47.389> boy<00:05:47.539> I<00:05:47.570> went<00:05:47.900> ahead<00:05:48.020> and<00:05:48.320> powder<00:05:48.560> the
