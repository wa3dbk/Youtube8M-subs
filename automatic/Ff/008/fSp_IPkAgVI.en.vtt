00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:09.010
 hello good we're all here with a 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.320
 new video of gta 5 we are in the 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.160
 door in the city of saints where 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.789
 let's try the yacht for the first time 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.800
 a cactus with hallucinogenic properties 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.280
 that will allow us to become and 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.520
 control some of the species 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:31.030
 animals that populate the game 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:35.199
 in this case we faint and we 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:37.640
 we turn into grape 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.340
 As you can see here we can run and we can 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.890
 attack we can not do much more but 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.440
 good is good to have a laugh and 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.210
 especially to lengthen the life of the 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.610
 game with one of the new 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.820
 collectibles that we can find 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.320
 specifically we have 27 peyote plants 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.440
 spread across the stage 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.800
 that will allow us to do crazy things 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.160
 how are you to chase buzzer acts and 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.160
 hit a bite to one come to your house 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:15.470
 we jump to another this time at the end of 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:18.470
 dock of the dog in the saints 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.470
 also in this case we are going to find 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.929
 the peyote plant submerged so 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.250
 let's get some air because if 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.400
 do not 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.260
 it will cost us to reach the end and 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.990
 I leave you more or less the position in 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.180
 that we have to place so that the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.150
 Game control system when diving 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.150
 that is not all the good that should 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.509
 well that it does not cost us much either 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.020
 find the plant there you have a 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.800
 beam and a fallen beam and right next to 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.650
 see to see michael look 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.700
 what 's the girl's worth here 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.700
 we feed him 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.810
 this thing of eating under water has to be 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.430
 complicated 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.119
 but well, try those red turns 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.119
 that you take something 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.780
 and in this case we become 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.930
 flipper clear because we have eaten peyote 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.410
 and we're freaking out this joke 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.930
 garden has left 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.110
 well here we can not attack alone 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.090
 we can swim faster, slower what 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.670
 that would be already milk would be able to jump 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.970
 towards the surface and give a 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.760
 somersault but it is not the case 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.100
 we are again on solid ground in the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.200
 Airport of the Saints just behind 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.900
 where we left the car in the workshop for 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.319
 first time in the campaign we tested the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.180
 peyote 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.180
 and we become a 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.830
 in a deer look what went down there with 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.450
 your antlers and their things 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:04.210
 here the thanks to hit a trip to 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.230
 someone to see if we can find a 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.850
 way to get out of here around here that is 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.950
 where we came from here there is no 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:18.140
 there we are 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.140
 Come on, run around delgadillo 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.930
 well back here I've seen people before ai 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.810
 ai ai ai ai ai ai are even when we go 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.240
 in tele mÃ©tele omar chestnut where it happens 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.180
 that with this also take 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.740
 I'm finished I'll be next to 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.740
 lara punch to speak 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:45.519
 We went to the chilian mountain to 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.160
 here right in front of where the 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.959
 cable car we found these flags and 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.860
 here is more peyote to see frank is a 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.860
 flat of straw is there there 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.750
 to see what we can become 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.250
 there are little birds we are in the high zone or 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.250
 be that I think it's pretty clear 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:12.160
 effectively bird x to take off 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:16.420
 square to land 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:20.010
 and r2 to attack as we attack 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.840
 we shit literally to a shit 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.260
 and if you hit someone in the head 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.260
 it is prize 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.240
 finally we move to the other 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.529
 point of the montegordo map right here at 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.699
 side of this lake 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.790
 there is a tree and there, tiny, there is almost no 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.620
 go 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.620
 is the other peyote plant 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.010
 and see see see to see well 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:57.500
 what we have here 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:05:00.530
 a dog a shepherd dog we can run 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.970
 and we can attack that we can not do 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.860
 piss us on nobody bad rockstar 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:11.140
 Well, that was all we left for today
