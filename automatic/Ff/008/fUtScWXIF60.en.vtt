00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
inventory so it's really easy to operate

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.410 
inventory so it's really easy to operate
and<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:31.410> here<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.859> take<00:00:32.820> out<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.090> top<00:00:33.239> words

and do here is take out the top words
this<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.719> useful<00:00:33.960> because<00:00:34.170> once<00:00:34.530> you're<00:00:34.710> out

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
this is useful because once you're out

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.190 
this is useful because once you're out
of<00:00:35.010> food<00:00:35.309> or<00:00:35.579> someone<00:00:36.300> like<00:00:36.420> pjs<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.960> talked

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
of food or someone like pjs you talked

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
about that before right yeah you gotta

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.709 
about that before right yeah you gotta
run<00:00:39.239> away<00:00:39.270> fastest<00:00:40.230> way<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.440> do<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:41.719> using

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
run away fastest way to do that is using

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.069 
run away fastest way to do that is using
teleports<00:00:43.230> ok<00:00:44.180> so<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:47.520> main<00:00:47.670> thing<00:00:47.700> here<00:00:47.969> that

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
teleports ok so the main thing here that

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.299 
teleports ok so the main thing here that
you<00:00:49.079> take<00:00:49.230> out<00:00:49.320> your<00:00:49.350> weapons<00:00:49.770> right<00:00:49.860> yeah

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
that's uh pretty much hype EK there's

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.359 
that's uh pretty much hype EK there's
nothing<00:01:19.049> really<00:01:19.409> much<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.100> pretty

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
nothing really much to it is pretty

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.570 
nothing really much to it is pretty
simple<00:01:20.640> once<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.720> figured<00:01:21.869> out<00:01:22.110> and

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
simple once you have it figured out and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.550 
simple once you have it figured out and
the<00:01:23.580> most<00:01:23.729> important<00:01:24.150> thing<00:01:24.180> about<00:01:24.600> decaying

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the most important thing about decaying

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.630 
the most important thing about decaying
is<00:01:27.350> stats<00:01:28.350> because<00:01:28.740> once<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.189> have<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> stats

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
is stats because once you have the stats

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.940 
is stats because once you have the stats
is<00:01:29.880> pretty<00:01:30.119> easy<00:01:30.479> your<00:01:31.290> stats<00:01:31.560> pretty<00:01:31.829> much

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
is pretty easy your stats pretty much

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.280 
is pretty easy your stats pretty much
guarantees<00:01:32.490> your<00:01:33.079> advantage<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> world

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
guarantees your advantage in the world

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.910 
guarantees your advantage in the world
so<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.210> guy<00:01:39.360> thinks<00:01:39.780> he<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.990> drop<00:01:40.320> so

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
so and the guy thinks he can drop so

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.400 
so and the guy thinks he can drop so
what<00:01:41.070> quedaras<00:01:41.580> are<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.060> people<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.080> walk

what quedaras are is people that walk
around<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.920> involved<00:01:44.880> with<00:01:45.000> someone<00:01:45.150> else<00:01:45.330> is

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
around and involved with someone else is

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.240

fighting to interrupt them which doesn't

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.220 
fighting to interrupt them which doesn't
really<00:01:47.310> make<00:01:47.490> any<00:01:47.550> sense<00:01:47.850> because<00:01:48.230> person

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
really make any sense because person

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.290
