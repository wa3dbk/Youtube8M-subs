now the second thing I want to talk

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.400 
now the second thing I want to talk
about<00:00:08.940> is<00:00:09.240> your<00:00:09.450> training<00:00:09.809> environment

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
about is your training environment

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.410 
about is your training environment
training<00:00:10.950> environment<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.429> huge<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.389> know

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
training environment is huge you know

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.549 
training environment is huge you know
one<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.870> things<00:00:12.990> I've<00:00:13.110> learned<00:00:13.139> from<00:00:13.410> the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
one of the things I've learned from the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.379 
one of the things I've learned from the
USDA<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.219> what<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:14.519> call<00:00:14.670> progressions

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
USDA is what we call progressions

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.510 
USDA is what we call progressions
progressions<00:00:16.139> are<00:00:16.260> very<00:00:16.590> important<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.279> I'm

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
progressions are very important and I'm

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.429 
progressions are very important and I'm
going<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.699> take<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.690> through<00:00:18.960> what<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.410> a

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
going to take you through what is a

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.830 
going to take you through what is a
basic<00:00:19.890> progression<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:21.300> first<00:00:21.539> stage<00:00:21.720> of

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
basic progression the first stage of

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.630 
basic progression the first stage of
progression<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.710> having<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.130> very<00:00:23.310> closed

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
progression is having a very closed

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.099 
progression is having a very closed
environment<00:00:24.180> what<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> closed<00:00:24.570> environment<00:00:24.720> is

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
environment what a closed environment is

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.529 
environment what a closed environment is
is<00:00:25.289> where<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.609> where<00:00:26.820> if<00:00:27.330> I'm

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
is where you have it where if I'm

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.630 
is where you have it where if I'm
working<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.869> my<00:00:27.990> forehand<00:00:28.380> or<00:00:28.619> my<00:00:28.980> contact<00:00:29.460> I'm

working on my forehand or my contact I'm

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.950 
working on my forehand or my contact I'm
not<00:00:29.880> working<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.179> anything<00:00:30.359> else<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.869> way

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
not working on anything else and the way

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.630 
not working on anything else and the way
they'll<00:00:31.140> do<00:00:31.380> this<00:00:31.619> or<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.130> right<00:00:32.219> way<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.489> can

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
they'll do this or the right way you can

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.819 
they'll do this or the right way you can
do<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.390> just<00:00:33.600> pitching<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.110> ball<00:00:34.260> you

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
do this it's just pitching the ball you

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:35.959 
do this it's just pitching the ball you
know<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.010> some<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.190> my<00:00:35.309> videos<00:00:35.340> you've<00:00:35.760> seen

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
know in some of my videos you've seen

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.850 
know in some of my videos you've seen
where<00:00:36.480> I've<00:00:36.690> had<00:00:36.870> someone<00:00:37.079> pitched<00:00:37.440> me<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> ball

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
where I've had someone pitched me a ball

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.190 
where I've had someone pitched me a ball
that's<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.399> great<00:00:38.760> training<00:00:39.239> tool<00:00:39.390> because

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
that's a great training tool because

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.660 
that's a great training tool because
when<00:00:40.710> they're<00:00:40.860> pitching<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.370> ball<00:00:41.520> they're

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
when they're pitching the ball they're

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.610 
when they're pitching the ball they're
gonna<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:41.879> more<00:00:42.090> control<00:00:42.480> over<00:00:42.629> how<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.079> get

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
gonna have more control over how you get

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.319 
gonna have more control over how you get
the<00:00:43.800> ball<00:00:43.980> giving<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> more<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.210> an

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the ball giving you the more of an

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.459 
the ball giving you the more of an
opportunity<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.960> work<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.320> one

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
opportunity just to work on that one

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.959 
opportunity just to work on that one
thing<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:47.100> know<00:00:47.160> by<00:00:47.309> pitching<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.820> being

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
thing you know by pitching and being

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.639 
thing you know by pitching and being
this<00:00:48.090> close<00:00:48.270> over<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.870> side<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.500> net

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
this close over on this side of the net

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.010 
this close over on this side of the net
then<00:00:50.129> they<00:00:50.520> can<00:00:50.670> be<00:00:50.789> really<00:00:51.120> accurate<00:00:51.360> even<00:00:51.899> if

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
then they can be really accurate even if

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.869 
then they can be really accurate even if
they're<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.289> let's<00:00:52.920> say<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> tennis<00:00:53.760> player

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
they're not let's say a tennis player

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.090 
they're not let's say a tennis player
you<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.300> someone<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.840> has<00:00:54.960> no<00:00:55.440> no

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
you can get someone that has no no

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.650 
you can get someone that has no no
history<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.460> playing<00:00:56.730> tennis<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.360> get<00:00:57.510> them

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
history of playing tennis and get them

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.849 
history of playing tennis and get them
to<00:00:57.750> come<00:00:57.840> out<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.109> pitch<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.500> ball<00:00:58.710> and

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
to come out and pitch you a ball and

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.920 
to come out and pitch you a ball and
it's<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> best<00:00:59.789> situation<00:01:00.300> ever<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.870> I'm

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
it's the best situation ever and I'm

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.849 
it's the best situation ever and I'm
going<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.079> take<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.379> through<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
going to take you through this in a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.650 
going to take you through this in a
second<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.550> second<00:01:02.969> environment<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.510> where

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
second the second environment is where

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.880 
second the second environment is where
they're<00:01:03.840> feeding<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> ball<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.830> is

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
they're feeding you the ball this is

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.219 
they're feeding you the ball this is
kind<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> classic<00:01:05.549> way<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.720> training<00:01:06.990> that

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
kind of the classic way of training that

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.200 
kind of the classic way of training that
we've<00:01:07.350> used<00:01:07.530> over<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.070> over<00:01:08.340> again<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
we've used over and over again but the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.120 
we've used over and over again but the
problem<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.630> sometimes<00:01:09.840> if<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.770> don't<00:01:10.950> close

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
problem is sometimes if you don't close

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.530 
problem is sometimes if you don't close
the<00:01:11.310> environment<00:01:11.670> close<00:01:11.820> enough<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.390> never

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the environment close enough you never

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.050 
the environment close enough you never
really<00:01:12.869> get<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.020> chance<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.580> give<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.760> person

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
really get a chance to give the person

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.280 
really get a chance to give the person
the<00:01:15.150> type<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.360> ball<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:15.750> need<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.110> better

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
the type of ball they need to get better

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.929 
the type of ball they need to get better
unless<00:01:16.830> you're<00:01:17.070> usually<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.400> pro<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.790> to

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
unless you're usually a pro you have to

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.310 
unless you're usually a pro you have to
go<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.150> pro<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.659> because<00:01:18.869> they<00:01:19.200> have

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
go to a pro to do it because they have

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.630 
go to a pro to do it because they have
experience<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.770> feeding<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.250> ball<00:01:20.340> exactly

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
experience in feeding the ball exactly

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.280 
experience in feeding the ball exactly
where<00:01:20.850> they<00:01:21.060> want<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.659> other<00:01:21.840> problem

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
where they want it the other problem

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.679 
where they want it the other problem
with<00:01:22.409> let's<00:01:22.710> say<00:01:22.860> going<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.580> kind<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.390> semi

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
with let's say going to a kind of semi

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.530 
with let's say going to a kind of semi
open<00:01:24.990> environment<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.880> they're<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.240> far

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
open environment is that they're so far
