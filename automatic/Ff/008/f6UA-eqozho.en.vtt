00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
to a normal healthy long state date in

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.390 
to a normal healthy long state date in
which<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.030> used<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.680> that's<00:01:16.680> another

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
which it used to be that's another

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.700 
which it used to be that's another
reason<00:01:17.670> why<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:18.330> pretty<00:01:18.689> much<00:01:18.780> all<00:01:18.960> brown<00:01:19.200> um

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
reason why it's pretty much all brown um

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.070 
reason why it's pretty much all brown um
it's<00:01:20.220> because<00:01:20.520> my<00:01:20.700> hair<00:01:20.909> really<00:01:21.600> only<00:01:21.810> girls

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
it's because my hair really only girls

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.460 
it's because my hair really only girls
when<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.380> dark<00:01:22.500> brown<00:01:22.799> huh<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.869> I<00:01:24.869> don't

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
when it's dark brown huh and I don't

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.719 
when it's dark brown huh and I don't
have<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.710> keep<00:01:25.830> touching<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.400> all<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.610> time

have to keep touching it up all the time

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.100 
have to keep touching it up all the time
and<00:01:27.270> guided<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.490> doesn't<00:01:29.490> matter<00:01:30.110> just

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110

about<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.780> tape<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.140> hair<00:02:01.290> extensions<00:02:01.649> I

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
about the tape in hair extensions I

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.950 
about the tape in hair extensions I
haven't<00:02:02.880> probably<00:02:03.180> worn<00:02:03.360> those<00:02:03.479> for<00:02:03.780> about<00:02:03.930> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
haven't probably worn those for about a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.150 
haven't probably worn those for about a
year<00:02:04.259> or<00:02:04.710> more<00:02:05.189> because<00:02:05.939> they<00:02:06.829> were<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.890> bitch

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
year or more because they were a bitch

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.949 
year or more because they were a bitch
to<00:02:08.369> get<00:02:08.459> out<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> think<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.209> would<00:02:09.360> put<00:02:09.720> them<00:02:09.869> in

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
to get out I think it would put them in

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.180 
to get out I think it would put them in
twice<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.560> then<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.770> was<00:02:10.860> like

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
twice and then I was like

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.960 
twice and then I was like
not<00:02:11.850> doing<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.120> again<00:02:12.210> so<00:02:13.040> yeah<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.280> was<00:02:14.760> using

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
not doing that again so yeah I was using

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.150 
not doing that again so yeah I was using
the<00:02:15.180> liquid<00:02:15.360> gold<00:02:15.720> glue<00:02:16.110> but<00:02:16.320> I<00:02:16.350> also<00:02:16.770> switched

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
the liquid gold glue but I also switched

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.450 
the liquid gold glue but I also switched
over<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:18.180> this<00:02:19.050> one<00:02:19.230> it's<00:02:19.760> kiss<00:02:20.760> glue<00:02:21.920> it's<00:02:22.920> a

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
over to this one it's kiss glue it's a

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.300 
over to this one it's kiss glue it's a
latex<00:02:23.790> based<00:02:24.090> glue<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.870> i<00:02:25.500> find<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:26.010> doesn't

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
latex based glue and i find it doesn't

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.770 
latex based glue and i find it doesn't
last<00:02:26.430> as<00:02:26.670> long<00:02:26.700> as<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.150> liquid<00:02:27.300> gold<00:02:27.690> but<00:02:28.110> it

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
last as long as the liquid gold but it

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.170 
last as long as the liquid gold but it
it's<00:02:30.780> easier<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.230> get<00:02:31.350> out<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:32.310> one<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:33.000> only

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
it's easier to get out this one you only

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.700 
it's easier to get out this one you only
need<00:02:33.360> conditioner<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:34.050> get<00:02:34.200> out<00:02:34.320> where<00:02:34.500> is<00:02:34.590> the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
need conditioner to get out where is the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.440 
need conditioner to get out where is the
other<00:02:34.800> one<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.130> needed<00:02:35.310> an<00:02:35.550> actual<00:02:35.970> remover

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
other one you needed an actual remover

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.360 
other one you needed an actual remover
which<00:02:36.630> was<00:02:36.810> like<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.990> super<00:02:37.350> heavy<00:02:37.620> oil<00:02:37.980> based

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
which was like a super heavy oil based

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.550 
which was like a super heavy oil based
things<00:02:39.330> was<00:02:39.630> kind<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.900> hard<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.200> get<00:02:40.380> out<00:02:40.530> of

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
things was kind of hard to get out of

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.980 
things was kind of hard to get out of
there<00:02:40.800> after<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.820> was<00:02:41.910> just<00:02:42.120> more<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.870> a

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
there after it was just more of a

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.630 
there after it was just more of a
process<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:43.890> one<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.480> we<00:02:45.480> do<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:46.250> every<00:02:47.250> two<00:02:47.610> to

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
process this one I we do it every two to

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.630 
process this one I we do it every two to
three<00:02:47.820> weeks<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.510> take<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.900> out<00:02:48.990> and<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:50.370> find<00:02:50.580> it

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
three weeks I take it out and I find it

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.180 
three weeks I take it out and I find it
super<00:02:50.880> easy<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.330> get<00:02:51.450> out<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.960> hue<00:02:52.440> if<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:53.040> don't

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
super easy to get out a hue if you don't

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.280 
super easy to get out a hue if you don't
leave<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.760> longer<00:02:53.970> than<00:02:54.210> that<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.420> did<00:02:54.690> once<00:02:54.930> it

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
leave it longer than that I did once it

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.050 
leave it longer than that I did once it
was<00:02:55.380> about<00:02:55.500> five<00:02:55.740> weeks<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.730> was<00:02:56.880> still

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
was about five weeks and it was still

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.880 
was about five weeks and it was still
pretty<00:02:57.150> easy<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:57.660> there<00:02:57.810> were<00:02:57.870> some<00:02:58.050> chunks

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
pretty easy but there were some chunks

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.220 
pretty easy but there were some chunks
that<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.070> had<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.370> really<00:02:59.610> rip<00:02:59.910> at<00:03:00.120> use<00:03:00.900> that

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
that I had to really rip at use that

more<00:04:34.590> product<00:04:35.100> than<00:04:35.160> natural<00:04:35.850> hair<00:04:36.500> so<00:04:37.500> this

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
more product than natural hair so this

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.550 
more product than natural hair so this
one<00:04:38.250> is<00:04:39.620> similar<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.889> like<00:04:41.100> a<00:04:42.440> Moroccan<00:04:43.440> oil

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.040 
one is similar to like a Moroccan oil
kind<00:04:43.919> of<00:04:44.040> thing<00:04:44.280> which<00:04:44.940> gives<00:04:45.330> shine<00:04:45.630> or

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
kind of thing which gives shine or

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.040 
kind of thing which gives shine or
whatever<00:04:46.320> um<00:04:46.880> but<00:04:47.880> this<00:04:48.150> one<00:04:48.330> doesn't<00:04:48.479> coat

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
whatever um but this one doesn't coat

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.990 
whatever um but this one doesn't coat
the<00:04:49.229> hair<00:04:49.380> like<00:04:49.620> those<00:04:50.160> ones<00:04:50.370> do<00:04:50.669> it<00:04:50.850> actually

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
the hair like those ones do it actually

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.510 
the hair like those ones do it actually
it's<00:04:51.660> kind<00:04:52.080> of<00:04:52.110> like<00:04:52.260> a<00:04:52.320> treatment<00:04:52.710> oil<00:04:53.100> almost

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
it's kind of like a treatment oil almost

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.969 
it's kind of like a treatment oil almost
i<00:04:53.729> find<00:04:54.000> it<00:04:54.330> actually<00:04:55.260> absorbs<00:04:55.350> into<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:55.860> hair

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
i find it actually absorbs into the hair

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.920 
i find it actually absorbs into the hair
so<00:04:56.340> it<00:04:56.460> kind<00:04:56.729> of<00:04:56.789> moisturizes<00:04:57.389> as<00:04:57.570> well<00:04:57.750> it

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930

so it kind of moisturizes as well it
works<00:04:58.139> super<00:04:58.710> super<00:04:59.430> good<00:04:59.550> on<00:04:59.669> the<00:04:59.760> ends<00:05:00.090> and

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
works super super good on the ends and

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.210 
works super super good on the ends and
it<00:05:00.660> does<00:05:00.870> give<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:01.139> a<00:05:01.169> really<00:05:01.380> nice<00:05:01.560> shine<00:05:01.889> so

hours<00:06:10.320> so<00:06:10.680> they<00:06:11.280> get<00:06:11.430> really<00:06:11.610> really<00:06:11.820> soft

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
hours so they get really really soft

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.589 
hours so they get really really soft
from<00:06:12.599> end<00:06:13.020> to<00:06:13.050> end<00:06:13.970> which<00:06:14.970> is<00:06:15.150> nice<00:06:15.360> because

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 
from end to end which is nice because

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:17.719 
from end to end which is nice because
when<00:06:15.840> they<00:06:15.960> go<00:06:16.080> back<00:06:16.229> in<00:06:16.500> there<00:06:16.830> like<00:06:17.130> this<00:06:17.430> and

when they go back in there like this and

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.610 
when they go back in there like this and
