00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
advocacy is amazing if you have the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.790 
advocacy is amazing if you have the
Cobra<00:00:26.430> site<00:00:26.670> i<00:00:26.880> really<00:00:27.720> recommend<00:00:27.900> using<00:00:28.500> it

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
Cobra site i really recommend using it

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.099 
Cobra site i really recommend using it
but<00:00:29.220> if<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.490> only<00:00:29.670> have<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> reflex<00:00:30.599> sight<00:00:30.900> i

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
but if you only have the reflex sight i

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.650 
but if you only have the reflex sight i
recommend<00:00:31.890> using<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.610> well<00:00:32.820> i<00:00:33.030> would<00:00:33.450> say

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
recommend using that as well i would say

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.430 
recommend using that as well i would say
the<00:00:33.809> reflex<00:00:34.200> has<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:35.180> 75-percent<00:00:36.180> best<00:00:36.719> aim<00:00:37.050> and

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
the reflex has a 75-percent best aim and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.470 
the reflex has a 75-percent best aim and
the<00:00:37.770> chrome<00:00:37.980> size<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> hundred<00:00:38.700> percent<00:00:38.790> bang

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the chrome size a hundred percent bang

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.720 
the chrome size a hundred percent bang
on<00:00:39.690> i<00:00:39.719> would<00:00:40.140> get<00:00:40.320> kill<00:00:40.590> every<00:00:40.950> time<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> win<00:00:41.700> a

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
on i would get kill every time I win a

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.330 
on i would get kill every time I win a
match<00:00:42.180> against<00:00:42.899> anyone<00:00:43.290> with<00:00:43.770> chrome<00:00:44.040> sight

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
match against anyone with chrome sight

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.069 
match against anyone with chrome sight
literally<00:00:44.670> one<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.059> one<00:00:45.180> fight<00:00:45.420> Cove<00:00:45.780> site

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
literally one on one fight Cove site

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.139 
literally one on one fight Cove site
will<00:00:46.289> win<00:00:46.469> reflex<00:00:47.309> sight<00:00:47.550> you'll<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:47.940> your

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
will win reflex sight you'll have your

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.040 
will win reflex sight you'll have your
denial<00:00:48.710> neurons<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.039> find<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.050> reflex

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
denial neurons I find that the reflex

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.920 
denial neurons I find that the reflex
sight<00:00:52.260> isn't<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:53.070> great<00:00:53.640> as<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.059> Cobra<00:00:54.570> say<00:00:54.780> if

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
sight isn't as great as the Cobra say if

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.490

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
look heavy barrel I find the recall

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.770 
look heavy barrel I find the recall
reduces<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.580> lot<00:01:20.820> when<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.150> use<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.330> because

on the pc i'll go with a EK ok so this

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.520 
on the pc i'll go with a EK ok so this
is<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> brilliant<00:01:47.159> gun<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.729> think<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.570> damage<00:01:49.170> at

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
is a brilliant gun I think the damage at

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.630 
is a brilliant gun I think the damage at
close<00:01:49.950> round<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.340> faulty<00:01:51.329> damage<00:01:51.890> think<00:01:52.890> but

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
close round is faulty damage think but

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.999 
close round is faulty damage think but
it's<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> three<00:01:54.360> shot<00:01:54.540> kill<00:01:54.750> anyway<00:01:55.049> I'd

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
it's like a three shot kill anyway I'd
