few choices you have for this car in

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.070 
few choices you have for this car in
this<00:00:22.439> scale<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.509> pretty<00:00:24.509> much<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.840> any<00:00:24.930> other

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
this scale and pretty much in any other

this scale and pretty much in any other
scale<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.619> us<00:00:25.800> certainly<00:00:26.340> because<00:00:26.700> it<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:28.430> not

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
scale of us certainly because it is not

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.970 
scale of us certainly because it is not
very<00:00:29.700> much<00:00:29.989> popular<00:00:30.989> but<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.710> should<00:00:31.890> have

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
very much popular but it should have

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.920 
very much popular but it should have

this<00:00:37.110> scale<00:00:37.700> pretty<00:00:38.700> much<00:00:38.850> typical<00:00:39.120> stuff<00:00:39.570> but

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
