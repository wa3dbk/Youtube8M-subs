that's dissolved in there we have

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.630 
that's dissolved in there we have
negative<00:01:55.450> buoyancy<00:01:55.690> that<00:01:56.500> means<00:01:56.950> if<00:01:57.280> you<00:01:57.400> fell

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
negative buoyancy that means if you fell

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.700 
negative buoyancy that means if you fell
into<00:01:57.880> there<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.510> would<00:01:58.750> sink<00:01:59.080> straight<00:01:59.470> down

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
into there you would sink straight down

settle down to the bottom of the tank

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.599 
settle down to the bottom of the tank
and<00:02:37.049> they're<00:02:37.260> recirculated<00:02:38.250> back<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.549> the

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
and they're recirculated back to the

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.000 
and they're recirculated back to the
activated<00:02:39.180> sludge<00:02:39.299> tank<00:02:39.810> some<00:02:40.379> of<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.590> solids

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
activated sludge tank some of the solids

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.520 
activated sludge tank some of the solids
going<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.489> make<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.700> fertilizer<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.170> liquid

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
going to make a fertilizer and a liquid

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.289 
going to make a fertilizer and a liquid
from<00:02:43.650> here<00:02:43.950> goes<00:02:44.459> over<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.849> edge<00:02:44.969> onto<00:02:45.180> the

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
from here goes over the edge onto the

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.740 
from here goes over the edge onto the
next<00:02:45.480> stage<00:02:45.840> oh<00:02:46.519> so<00:02:47.519> it<00:02:47.639> spills<00:02:48.060> over<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.599> edge

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
next stage oh so it spills over the edge

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.520 
next stage oh so it spills over the edge
and<00:02:49.680> goes<00:02:50.069> into<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.370> rivers<00:02:51.230> yeah<00:02:52.230> but<00:02:52.409> it's

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
and goes into the rivers yeah but it's

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.349 
and goes into the rivers yeah but it's
really<00:02:52.680> hard<00:02:52.950> quality<00:02:53.430> water<00:02:53.669> doesn't<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.180> by

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
really hard quality water doesn't it by

00:02:54.359 --> 00:03:00.979 
really hard quality water doesn't it by
then<00:02:57.319> you<00:02:58.319> know<00:02:59.090> the<00:03:00.090> retinic<00:03:00.510> saved<00:03:00.780> them

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
then you know the retinic saved them

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.339 
then you know the retinic saved them
over<00:03:01.109> a<00:03:01.349> million<00:03:02.720> that's<00:03:03.720> why<00:03:04.019> they're<00:03:04.230> able

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
over a million that's why they're able

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.099 
over a million that's why they're able
