00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.970
 house on the French Riviera everything to be 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:22.790
 happy and yet barely home 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.640
 bought the adventure starts i bought 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.980
 this house in July 2010 so I 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.570
 went to the edf to do but my 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.840
 connecting my new contract and to 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.700
 from that moment on I was offered a 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.489
 energy saving diagnosis and sign 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.120
 a contract with objectives works with 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.680
 edf 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.480
 I went to see Mr. Belval 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.690
 to make a complete diagnosis of 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.149
 100 dwellings the technician came he 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.840
 asked me a few questions he made the 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.430
 tower of the house 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.199
 the diagnosis is made using 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.989
 of a thermal camera and we look 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.280
 especially the building the walls opening them the 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.710
 roof from which come the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.480
 losses we advocated in 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.609
 a first time to improve the insulation 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.140
 housing and then we left so 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.120
 on a recommendation of pumps to 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.170
 heat air air because the customer wanted 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.110
 also refreshment during summer 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.270
 It Works owen heat pumps associated 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.880
 at the main heating we decided 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.770
 the installation of a wood insert is in 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.159
 thinking of you that edf has selected his 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.479
 blue sky partner network 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.100
 all partners blue sky edf 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.630
 today work compared to a 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.280
 edf technical reference 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.259
 we have to create products that are 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.149
 standardized with quite a specification 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.240
 important at the facilities level so 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.850
 it is a guarantee of seriousness for the customer 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.950
 final we have material that allows 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.259
 to have optimum performance at the level 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.569
 comfort level energy consumption 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.159
 I also chose this company 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:46.929
 for three reasons the first reason 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.720
 is that their price was much more 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.380
 tantalizing the second reason this is 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.670
 that they were closer to my home 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.619
 and the third reason is that they 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.659
 were available and availability 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.580
 I think is a sign of seriousness of 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.929
 the company and the serious sir 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.459
 belval needed it 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.619
 he actually had some fears for 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:08.920
 his home the problematic it was 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.130
 to succeed put the installations without 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.930
 change the decoration 103 life but what 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.040
 it was a complicated project by the 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.470
 did you have to go from 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.150
 connections in a dwelling where the 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.959
 configuration was quite complex nothing 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.640
 visible 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.410
 nothing else in everything is in perfect 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.410
 harmony with the decoration of the house 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.140
 and if the indoor unit wall type 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.420
 so nothing apparent indoor units 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.239
 passage of links inside the 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.280
 closet to join the crawl space 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.159
 it had to be passed in the void 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.170
 sanitary which was at 40 cm 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.329
 someone very athletic of very 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.609
 young people very flexible so that they can 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.500
 to pass the sheaths and it was not easy 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:54.470
 another advantage taxation 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.799
 thanks to these works I was able to recover a 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.099
 greenhouse tax credit in the 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.569
 chimney is about 40% and handle 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.349
 also recover a tax credit 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.569
 on relationships 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.450
 a pretty positive balance nice gentlemen 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.879
 badly I was very well advised by the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.510
 advise odf and comfort in the 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.889
 house is reproachable 160 sqm even 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.560
 consumption than a house 100 meters 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.730
 square 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.730
 a few smothered 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.860
 these stars are going to fly I sign 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.860
 right now
