general advice and then at some
different<00:00:12.360> riding<00:00:12.929> positions<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.590> finish

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
different riding positions and finish

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.680 
different riding positions and finish
with<00:00:14.219> some<00:00:14.370> great<00:00:14.580> tips<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:15.120> help<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.420> get<00:00:15.540> to

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
with some great tips to help you get to

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.040 
with some great tips to help you get to
the<00:00:15.780> top<00:00:16.190> so<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.250> begin<00:00:17.580> first<00:00:18.060> change<00:00:18.869> down

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
the top so to begin first change down

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.650 
the top so to begin first change down
early<00:00:19.529> thus<00:00:20.189> far<00:00:20.460> better<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:21.029> start<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.420> climb

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
early thus far better to start the climb

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.870 
early thus far better to start the climb
in<00:00:21.810> an<00:00:21.930> easy<00:00:22.170> gear<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.740> change<00:00:23.310> up<00:00:23.580> as<00:00:23.760> you

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
in an easy gear and change up as you

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.880 
in an easy gear and change up as you
establish<00:00:24.390> your<00:00:24.539> rhythm<00:00:24.720> then<00:00:25.320> start<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
establish your rhythm then start in a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.220 
establish your rhythm then start in a
higher<00:00:26.099> gear<00:00:26.400> exhaust<00:00:27.000> yourself<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.599> have<00:00:28.109> to

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
higher gear exhaust yourself and have to

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.800 
higher gear exhaust yourself and have to
change<00:00:28.410> down<00:00:28.769> remember<00:00:29.730> climbing<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.539> about

establishing a pace and a rhythm that

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.150 
establishing a pace and a rhythm that
will<00:00:32.940> get<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> top<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.620> not<00:00:34.890> want

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
will get you to the top you do not want

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.220 
will get you to the top you do not want
to<00:00:35.219> be<00:00:35.309> an<00:00:35.399> oxygen<00:00:35.910> debt<00:00:36.120> as<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.780> will<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:36.899> hard

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
to be an oxygen debt as it will be hard

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.610 
to be an oxygen debt as it will be hard
to<00:00:37.320> come<00:00:37.410> back<00:00:37.710> from<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:39.020> secondly<00:00:40.020> in

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
to come back from that secondly in

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.700 
to come back from that secondly in
general<00:00:41.129> sit<00:00:41.550> up<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.879> sit<00:00:42.329> back<00:00:42.629> window<00:00:43.530> air

general sit up and sit back window air
resistance<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.460> less<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.879> an<00:00:45.030> issue<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.930> moving

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
resistance is less of an issue so moving

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.510 
resistance is less of an issue so moving
your<00:00:46.350> weight<00:00:46.500> back<00:00:46.800> will<00:00:47.100> give<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.309> more

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
your weight back will give you more

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.430 
your weight back will give you more

primarily your glutes for largest in
your<00:00:52.140> body<00:00:53.449> thirdly<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:55.289> need<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> establish

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
your body thirdly you need to establish

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.490 
your body thirdly you need to establish
a<00:00:56.039> rhythm<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.820> your<00:00:57.000> breathing<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.230> breath

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
a rhythm in your breathing so one breath

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.650 
a rhythm in your breathing so one breath
every<00:00:58.739> two<00:00:59.190> pedal<00:00:59.550> strokes<00:00:59.820> for<00:01:00.030> example<00:01:00.480> and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
every two pedal strokes for example and

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.750 
every two pedal strokes for example and
adjust<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.739> your<00:01:02.010> speed<00:01:02.280> offers

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
adjust it as your speed offers

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.969 
adjust it as your speed offers
throughout<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.059> climb<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:04.290> will<00:01:04.500> help<00:01:04.710> both

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
throughout the climb this will help both

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.240 
throughout the climb this will help both
physically<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.610> mentally<00:01:06.650> so<00:01:07.650> let's<00:01:07.950> look<00:01:08.100> at

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
physically and mentally so let's look at

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.710 
physically and mentally so let's look at
some<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> different<00:01:08.880> riding<00:01:09.240> positions

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
some of the different riding positions

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.719 
some of the different riding positions
for<00:01:09.990> climbing<00:01:10.409> we'll<00:01:10.920> start<00:01:11.220> with<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.430> one

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
for climbing we'll start with this one

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.760
