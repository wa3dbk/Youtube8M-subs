00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.230 
it right well there's two main uses took
to<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> grapple<00:01:38.280> hook<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.640> first<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.000> being

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
to the grapple hook the first one being

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.550 
to the grapple hook the first one being
moving<00:01:39.780> around<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.049> environment<00:01:40.409> really

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
moving around the environment really

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.859 
moving around the environment really
quickly<00:01:41.060> when<00:01:42.060> you're<00:01:42.180> grappling<00:01:42.450> around

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
quickly when you're grappling around

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.590 
quickly when you're grappling around
it's<00:01:43.079> hard<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.380> them<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.579> target<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.759> but

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
it's hard for them to target you but

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.719 
it's hard for them to target you but
more<00:01:45.990> importantly<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.470> more<00:01:46.530> fun<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:47.100> actual

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
more importantly and more fun is actual

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.210 
more importantly and more fun is actual
using<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> grapple<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.140> combat<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.860> can

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
using the grapple in combat so you can

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.480

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
pull people like adjusted over there

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.590 
pull people like adjusted over there
towards<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.729> juggle<00:01:54.119> them<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> guns

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
towards you juggle them with the guns

chaos about its game chaos is like the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.059 
chaos about its game chaos is like the
unlocking<00:02:27.390> mechanism<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.049> game<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.950> more

chaos<00:02:29.400> he<00:02:29.489> generates<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:31.590> what<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.129> if<00:02:32.310> you

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
chaos he generates is what the if you

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.759 
chaos he generates is what the if you
generate<00:02:32.730> chaos<00:02:33.360> your<00:02:33.900> unlock<00:02:34.349> missions<00:02:34.680> in

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
you just unlock some chaos by going for

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.650 
you just unlock some chaos by going for
some<00:02:58.860> optional<00:02:59.459> extra<00:02:59.819> damage<00:03:00.000> but<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.569> know

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
some optional extra damage but you know

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.539 
some optional extra damage but you know
destroying<00:03:01.019> that<00:03:01.110> radio<00:03:01.500> tower<00:03:01.739> exactly<00:03:02.430> why

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
destroying that radio tower exactly why

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.220 
destroying that radio tower exactly why
not<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:02.910> there's<00:03:03.090> there's<00:03:03.629> always<00:03:04.019> an

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
not so there's there's always an

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.199 
not so there's there's always an
incentive<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.739> be<00:03:04.950> like<00:03:05.129> a<00:03:05.160> total<00:03:05.489> jerk<00:03:05.700> right

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
incentive to be like a total jerk right

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.229 
incentive to be like a total jerk right
definitely<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:07.079> like<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.129> kind<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.430> game<00:03:08.610> it

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239

seems<00:03:09.420> like<00:03:09.540> it's<00:03:09.660> pretty<00:03:09.690> much<00:03:09.900> designed<00:03:10.319> for

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
seems like it's pretty much designed for

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.240 
seems like it's pretty much designed for
me<00:03:11.660> as<00:03:12.660> far<00:03:12.959> as<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.709> know<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.920> weapons

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
to start out like pretty limited and

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.629 
to start out like pretty limited and
then<00:03:18.690> unlock<00:03:19.260> stuff<00:03:19.470> as<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:19.950> go<00:03:20.100> along<00:03:20.190> or<00:03:20.549> is
