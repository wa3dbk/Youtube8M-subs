00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
so many people work so hard on this and

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.600 
so many people work so hard on this and
now<00:01:21.670> we<00:01:21.729> see<00:01:22.180> that<00:01:22.390> not<00:01:23.229> only<00:01:23.410> the<00:01:23.860> passengers

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
now we see that not only the passengers

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.820 
now we see that not only the passengers
like<00:01:24.820> it<00:01:25.060> not<00:01:25.210> only<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.780> operators<00:01:26.470> like<00:01:26.649> it

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
like it not only the operators like it

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.469
