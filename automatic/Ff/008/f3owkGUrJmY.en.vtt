00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.680
 hello welcome to the channel where I bring to 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.740
 You guys plus a gopro camera tip 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.870
 rio 3 series and I wanted to comment with you 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.549
 today about the integrated wifi system 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.730
 on this camera 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.250
 we have a black edition here and I 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.590
 I want to show you how he 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.840
 works with integration is with the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.750
 eos devices 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.009
 this system helped a lot 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.380
 for there experience and saw the 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:39.870
 previously in the laugh version the uncle we 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.420
 We had that for 111 lcd back pack for 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.680
 visual feedback than the one I 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.500
 was recording 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.649
 it still maintains this function you can 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.309
 get the premium lcd accessory black 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.610
 pack 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.719
 but you already have the possibility to have 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.910
 in live view by device and oeci 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.280
 devices are these or an iphone one 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.790
 ipad and today I want to show you how 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.400
 this works through an iphone 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.760
 so I have here an iphone 4s for 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.150
 show you how it interacts 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.759
 with an application made available by 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.030
 apple store that we have to connect to 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.030
 camera 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.680
 with the camera on we give two 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.870
 side button clicks 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.660
 this side button it is just the 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.660
 button that activates the wifi 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.260
 this blue light indicates that the signal is 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:48.150
 released from this we have here 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:53.110
 on screen the system and we will select there 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.160
 the function gopro is the third function of 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.840
 up down 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:04.330
 is already generating the signal is working 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:10.140
 now I need to pick up the phone and 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.140
 settings on the wifi network controller 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.270
 activate them as my own and 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:23.350
 select the camera that will appear 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:27.430
 here on the goal website we make a 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:30.910
 and through this register of this 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.340
 card we named the camera is together with 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.770
 the recognition of computer and UN 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.530
 so she gets her name here then 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.380
 is selected 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.120
 we will now open the application 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.120
 the application calls gopro 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:56.560
 ready this application to have functions 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.870
 very important and very helpful in 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.920
 experience the camera 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:07.000
 we have selected connect found and 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:13.140
 now let's have a simple dashboard of 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:17.470
 affirming about the signal and about the 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.910
 battery then look only you have here 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:25.269
 settings through the 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.950
 you can set up the whole camera you 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:35.530
 you can switch between 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:37.420
 such as photos or 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.870
 timer world 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.170
 We only have to look at the video system. 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.120
 setting if we have all the 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.870
 the bed configuration available to you 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:54.640
 change the resolution you change to the frame 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:57.700
 rate alternates between the system or AIDS 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.400
 you put 16 by 9 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.890
 you change the capture sequence to 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.340
 resolution of the photos if you want to 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.799
 the camera to record upside down 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:13.359
 finally everything can be changed here 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:15.070
 audio volume and button selection 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:18.340
 everything can be accessed here including 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:23.410
 sd card capacity here also shows 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.930
 what's left of the recording or photos to 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.610
 be made 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:32.669
 ok let me show you the aspect of 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.669
 live view 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.190
 he has a delay of more or less one 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.190
 second 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.669
 two seconds of delay this delay 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.639
 it's obviously not a very 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:56.129
 convenient but does not prevent people from 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.669
 already been able to adjust the camera or 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:01.470
 any kind of a notice to see 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.289
 how is the camera positioned 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.330
 or it helps a lot then from here 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.150
 we can begin recording this was the 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.129
 button or cancel live 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.039
 view 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:16.740
 leave it disabled something that 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:20.729
 needs to be said about it 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.810
 the battery with the wifi system connected is 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:28.680
 consumed by at least 50 percent 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.699
 wear faster so it's good 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.550
 turn it off 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.650
 If you're not going to use it, we can call you. 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.849
 directly from the cell phone itself or 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.740
 here giving a click and select 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:45.590
 reselect the office version to 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:48.539
 selection off and again with the selection 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:52.259
 is off the blue light will stop 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:56.400
 fish and we have the camera without the love 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:59.280
 saw again on the cell phone that 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.180
 The process works for you. 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:05.340
 accessing the wifi by the remote control is 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.949
 basically the same but beyond the selection 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:14.190
 we have selected remote control 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:15.599
 instead the wifi is the proep goal you can 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.319
 use the remote control which is also 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:18.810
 very good 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:21.060
 Imagine spending a little less than 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:25.020
 energy or time does not give visual feedback 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:27.090
 only a return of functions like photo and 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:31.740
 recording trigger 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:33.840
 This is indeed a welcome novelty. 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.560
 it Works very well 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.090
 despite the leg it gives you complete vision 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.009
 what camera is there then you 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.409
 can perfectly adjust the angle 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:48.090
 the camera before recording your 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:50.090
 That helped a lot for us to see there. 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.229
 anticipate not to have errors of 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.599
 positioning 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:57.270
 we stay here today I hope you enjoy it 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:57.960
 share a channel and share tips and 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.400
 was expelled 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.400
 You until the next
