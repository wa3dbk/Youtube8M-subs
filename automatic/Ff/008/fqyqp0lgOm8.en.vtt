reasoning<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.780> mirror<00:02:25.230> force<00:02:25.560> which<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:25.980> never

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
reasoning and mirror force which I never

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.740 
reasoning and mirror force which I never
thought<00:02:26.640> I'd<00:02:26.760> ever<00:02:26.880> seen<00:02:27.150> mayor<00:02:27.330> force<00:02:27.570> on

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
thought I'd ever seen mayor force on

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.260 
thought I'd ever seen mayor force on
that<00:02:27.920> so<00:02:28.920> yeah<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.340> looks<00:02:29.670> like<00:02:29.850> this<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.150> our

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
that so yeah it looks like this is our

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.510 
that so yeah it looks like this is our
list<00:02:30.510> now<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.930> guess<00:02:31.500> there's<00:02:31.860> still<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.190> very

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
list now I guess there's still a very

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.400 
list now I guess there's still a very
small<00:02:32.820> chance<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.390> TCG<00:02:33.870> list<00:02:34.050> could<00:02:34.260> be

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
small chance that the TCG list could be

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.520 
small chance that the TCG list could be
different<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.920> never<00:02:35.490> has<00:02:35.910> been<00:02:36.270> but<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.260> mean

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
different it never has been but I mean

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.260 
different it never has been but I mean
this<00:02:37.950> list<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.370> pretty<00:02:38.520> weird<00:02:38.850> too<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.240> guess

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
this list is pretty weird too so I guess

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.210 
this list is pretty weird too so I guess
Konami<00:02:39.780> really<00:02:40.110> can<00:02:40.290> do<00:02:40.470> whatever<00:02:40.830> they<00:02:41.190> want

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
Konami really can do whatever they want

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.350 
Konami really can do whatever they want
you<00:02:41.520> know<00:02:41.550> they<00:02:41.820> could<00:02:41.970> always<00:02:42.150> do<00:02:42.270> something

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
you know they could always do something

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.390 
you know they could always do something
crazy<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.320> we<00:02:43.470> don't<00:02:43.620> know<00:02:43.710> also<00:02:43.980> there<00:02:44.310> was

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
crazy so we don't know also there was

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.520 
crazy so we don't know also there was
rumors<00:02:45.120> on<00:02:45.270> that<00:02:45.420> they<00:02:45.510> would<00:02:45.690> change<00:02:45.840> some

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
rumor and then like 50 cards in the main

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.410 
rumor and then like 50 cards in the main
deck<00:02:52.530> but<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:53.130> haven't<00:02:53.760> seen<00:02:53.880> anything<00:02:54.150> on<00:02:54.300> that
