these<00:03:06.329> um<00:03:07.129> things<00:03:08.129> here<00:03:08.640> like<00:03:08.790> are<00:03:09.120> flowing

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
around so I could understand how she

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.990 
around so I could understand how she
could<00:03:12.239> use<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.599> to<00:03:12.629> fly<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.849> to<00:03:14.849> use

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
could use it to fly and to use

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.699 
could use it to fly and to use
flying-type<00:03:15.450> moves<00:03:15.870> like<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.260> totally

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
flying-type moves like I totally

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.470 
flying-type moves like I totally

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
understand it now I always thought is

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.940 
understand it now I always thought is
gonna<00:03:18.660> be<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.780> normal<00:03:19.169> type<00:03:19.319> but<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.799> be<00:03:19.919> a

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
gonna be a normal type but to be a

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.229 
gonna be a normal type but to be a
Flying<00:03:20.250> type<00:03:20.310> I'd<00:03:20.700> find<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.150> bit

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
Flying type I'd find that a bit

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.539 
Flying type I'd find that a bit
reasonable<00:03:21.900> as<00:03:22.049> you<00:03:22.799> see<00:03:22.980> they<00:03:23.099> kind<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.370> also

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
reasonable as you see they kind of also

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.180 
reasonable as you see they kind of also
look<00:03:23.819> like<00:03:23.970> Wingels<00:03:24.359> wings<00:03:24.599> um<00:03:25.019> if<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.829> ask<00:03:25.950> me

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
look like Wingels wings um if you ask me

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.920 
look like Wingels wings um if you ask me
but<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.790> don't<00:03:27.060> think<00:03:27.150> there's<00:03:27.359> anything<00:03:27.599> to<00:03:27.720> do

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
but I don't think there's anything to do

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.890 
but I don't think there's anything to do
with<00:03:28.019> it<00:03:28.370> so<00:03:29.370> next<00:03:29.579> video<00:03:29.910> we<00:03:30.450> will<00:03:30.480> be<00:03:30.630> going
