the Hay River very hard to get to and

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.270 
the Hay River very hard to get to and
they're<00:02:05.020> probably<00:02:05.260> here<00:02:05.740> because<00:02:06.070> of<00:02:06.190> the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
they're probably here because of the

they're probably here because of the
lake<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:08.140> gives<00:02:08.649> you<00:02:08.740> an<00:02:08.860> idea<00:02:08.950> of<00:02:09.220> how<00:02:09.520> big

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
lake this gives you an idea of how big

no boats and as we were having an engine
problem<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.310> was<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.840> little<00:02:16.840> bit

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
problem that was a little bit

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:28.860 
problem that was a little bit
disconcerting<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.580> say<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.880> least<00:02:27.630> this<00:02:28.630> is

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870

the river as we were saved in a cabin
the<00:02:34.330> night<00:02:34.510> before<00:02:35.130> miserable<00:02:36.130> night<00:02:36.370> got

the night before miserable night got

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.240 
the night before miserable night got
eaten<00:02:37.150> alive<00:02:37.209> by<00:02:37.450> bugs<00:02:37.770> this<00:02:38.770> is<00:02:38.830> quite

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
eaten alive by bugs this is quite

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.699 
eaten alive by bugs this is quite
typical<00:02:39.489> of<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.060> camps<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:40.660> we<00:02:40.930> have<00:02:41.170> Wayne

typical of the camps that we have Wayne

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.300 
typical of the camps that we have Wayne
was<00:02:42.010> our<00:02:42.360> chief<00:02:43.360> cook<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:43.959> he<00:02:44.410> really<00:02:45.100> made

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
was our chief cook and he really made

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.490 
was our chief cook and he really made
the<00:02:45.580> trip<00:02:45.850> here<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.690> can<00:02:46.840> see<00:02:46.989> him<00:02:47.110> sending

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
the trip here you can see him sending

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:58.050 
the trip here you can see him sending
out

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.839 

this<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.810> something<00:02:59.319> that<00:02:59.349> I<00:02:59.680> have<00:03:00.190> never<00:03:00.520> seen

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
this is something that I have never seen

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.690 
this is something that I have never seen
before<00:03:01.110> it's<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.349> fish<00:03:02.739> swimming<00:03:03.190> around<00:03:03.370> like

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
before it's a fish swimming around like

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.670 
before it's a fish swimming around like
that<00:03:03.910> coming<00:03:04.239> out<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.599> the<00:03:04.720> water<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:05.230> almost

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
that coming out of the water it almost

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.040 
that coming out of the water it almost
looks<00:03:05.950> like<00:03:06.130> it's<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.489> a<00:03:06.520> fishing<00:03:07.120> line<00:03:07.300> but<00:03:07.810> it

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
looks like it's on a fishing line but it

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.410 
looks like it's on a fishing line but it
wasn't<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.590> fish<00:03:08.770> was<00:03:09.010> fine<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:10.270> only

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
wasn't the fish was fine and the only

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.120 
wasn't the fish was fine and the only
thing<00:03:10.630> I<00:03:10.750> can<00:03:10.930> think<00:03:10.959> of<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.739> was<00:03:11.770> going

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
thing I can think of is it was going

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:25.589 
thing I can think of is it was going
after<00:03:12.310> bugs<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:24.580> not<00:03:24.790> wanting<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.120> work<00:03:25.330> very

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599
