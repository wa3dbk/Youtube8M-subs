you<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.630> grouping<00:00:10.080> movement<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.679> goes<00:00:10.889> along

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
you a grouping movement that goes along

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.820 
you a grouping movement that goes along
to<00:00:11.400> faster<00:00:12.000> beat<00:00:12.360> music<00:00:12.870> for<00:00:13.349> example

to faster beat music for example

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.090 
to faster beat music for example
electronics<00:00:14.610> or<00:00:14.759> house<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:15.870> faster<00:00:16.350> be<00:00:16.500> type

electronics or house so faster be type
of<00:00:17.220> music<00:00:25.189> this<00:00:26.189> move<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.609> broken<00:00:27.029> down<00:00:27.180> into

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
of music this move is broken down into

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.599 
of music this move is broken down into
three<00:00:27.539> different<00:00:28.019> sections<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.949> as<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.429> can

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
three different sections and as you can

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.150 
three different sections and as you can
tell<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.970> Scot<00:00:30.210> rocking<00:00:30.990> motion<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.560> so

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
tell the Scot rocking motion going so

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.040 
tell the Scot rocking motion going so
first<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.610> all<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> bending<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> knees

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
first of all is the bending of the knees

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.069 
first of all is the bending of the knees
which<00:00:34.590> goes<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.190> one<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.059> two<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.750> one

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
which goes like this one and two and one

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.590 
which goes like this one and two and one
and<00:00:37.260> two<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.640> sense<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.120> more<00:00:39.420> or<00:00:39.540> less

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and two and in the sense is more or less

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.330 
and two and in the sense is more or less
of<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.079> balance<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.770> you're<00:00:40.950> going<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> be

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
of a balance so you're going to be

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.860 
of a balance so you're going to be
starting<00:00:41.850> with<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> bending<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.780> knees

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
starting with the bending of the knees

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.779 
starting with the bending of the knees
and<00:00:43.379> you're<00:00:43.590> going<00:00:44.040> up<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.640> up<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.440> up

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
alright the second thing is the rocking

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.279 
alright the second thing is the rocking
motion<00:00:49.559> which<00:00:50.010> looks<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.430> one<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.660> two

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
motion which looks like this one and two

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.540 
motion which looks like this one and two
and<00:00:52.530> one<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.219> two<00:00:53.969> one<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.140> two<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.920> one<00:00:56.309> and

two third thing you're going to do is

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.459 
two third thing you're going to do is
the<00:00:59.190> leaning<00:00:59.579> to<00:01:00.059> one<00:01:00.090> side<00:01:00.449> or<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.230> other

the leaning to one side or the other

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.290 
the leaning to one side or the other
side<00:01:01.649> or<00:01:02.070> pivoting<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.609> should<00:01:02.789> say<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.000> you're

side or pivoting I should say so you're

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.990 
side or pivoting I should say so you're
going<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:03.809> way<00:01:03.960> or<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.739> other<00:01:04.920> one<00:01:05.760> and

two and one and two one and two and one
and<00:01:09.930> two<00:01:10.530> pretty<00:01:11.159> simple<00:01:11.340> right<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:11.970> let's<00:01:12.180> put

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
and two pretty simple right so let's put

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.149 
and two pretty simple right so let's put
it<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:12.630> together<00:01:12.810> first<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.830> all<00:01:13.920> at<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
it all together first of all at the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.969 
it all together first of all at the
bounce<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.640> goes<00:01:14.790> one<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.659> two<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.380> one<00:01:16.770> and

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
bounce it goes one and two and one and

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.310 
bounce it goes one and two and one and
two<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:18.360> we're<00:01:18.540> going<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.720> add<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
two and then we're going to add in the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.730 
two and then we're going to add in the
upper<00:01:19.590> body<00:01:19.710> rock<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.570> two<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.320> one

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
upper body rock so one and two and one

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.580 
upper body rock so one and two and one
and<00:01:22.979> two<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.299> putting<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.720> together<00:01:24.900> look<00:01:25.409> like

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
and two so putting it together look like

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.020 
and two so putting it together look like
this<00:01:25.770> one<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.820> two<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.750> one<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.470> two<00:01:29.310> notice

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
this one and two and one and two notice

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.780 
this one and two and one and two notice
how<00:01:30.180> my<00:01:30.360> cord<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.140> more<00:01:31.380> rigid<00:01:31.799> I'm<00:01:32.250> flexing<00:01:32.759> my

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
how my cord is more rigid I'm flexing my

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.660 
how my cord is more rigid I'm flexing my
poor<00:01:33.150> here<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.930> when<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.350> bend<00:01:34.920> down<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.490> this

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
poor here so when we bend down like this

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.149 
poor here so when we bend down like this
I'm<00:01:35.970> kind<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.020> sitting<00:01:37.259> down<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.560> leaning

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
I'm kind of sitting down and leaning

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.249 
I'm kind of sitting down and leaning
backwards<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.000> little<00:01:39.240> bit<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.570> as<00:01:40.110> I

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
backwards just a little bit and as I

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.469 
backwards just a little bit and as I
extend<00:01:40.650> my<00:01:40.710> legs<00:01:41.009> my<00:01:41.610> body<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.090> going<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> go

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
extend my legs my body is going to go

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.899 
extend my legs my body is going to go
forward<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.399> 1<00:01:45.149> &amp;<00:01:45.450> 2<00:01:46.020> &amp;<00:01:46.439> 1<00:01:46.979> &amp;<00:01:47.399> 2

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
forward like this so it's 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 2

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.780 
forward like this so it's 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
i'm<00:01:48.450> doing<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.290> little<00:01:49.470> bit<00:01:49.710> exaggerated<00:01:50.490> in

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
i'm doing it a little bit exaggerated in

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.389 
i'm doing it a little bit exaggerated in
an<00:01:51.210> exaggerated<00:01:51.960> motion<00:01:52.380> i<00:01:52.500> should<00:01:52.680> say<00:01:52.860> but

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
an exaggerated motion i should say but

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.660 
an exaggerated motion i should say but
you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.759> do<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:53.909> softer<00:01:54.450> with<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:55.340> or<00:01:56.340> more

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
you can do it softer with this or more

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.200 
you can do it softer with this or more
boom<00:01:57.479> boom

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
boom boom

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.170 
boom boom
and<00:01:59.560> so<00:02:00.560> one<00:02:00.770> more<00:02:00.920> time<00:02:00.950> is<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.760> bending<00:02:01.970> of

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
and so one more time is the bending of

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.550 
and so one more time is the bending of
