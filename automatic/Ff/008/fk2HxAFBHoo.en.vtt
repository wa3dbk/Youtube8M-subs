Windows Home Server there's a media

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.730 
Windows Home Server there's a media
center<00:00:27.420> up<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:27.990> can<00:00:28.230> access<00:00:28.529> all<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
center up in so you can access all the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
have a look at doing this is where we

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.200 
have a look at doing this is where we
put<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.050> content<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.130> little<00:00:35.820> bit<00:00:35.940> how<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
put the content a little bit how the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.869 
put the content a little bit how the
install<00:00:36.780> works<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.590> IV<00:00:38.100> adding<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.640> then

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
install works of the IV adding and then

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.340 
install works of the IV adding and then
we'll<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.180> see<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> content<00:00:39.899> but<00:00:40.200> like<00:00:40.320> I

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
we'll just see the content but like I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.380 
we'll just see the content but like I
said<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.710> really<00:00:40.739> simple<00:00:41.219> really<00:00:41.879> really

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
said it's really simple really really

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.910 
said it's really simple really really
easy<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.570> use<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:43.020> great<00:00:43.050> feature<00:00:43.440> with<00:00:43.829> no

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
easy to use and a great feature with no

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.459 
easy to use and a great feature with no
time<00:00:44.129> server<00:00:44.960> so<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.020> first<00:00:46.230> thing<00:00:46.379> you'll

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
time server so the first thing you'll

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.779 
time server so the first thing you'll
noticed<00:00:46.800> after<00:00:47.100> you've<00:00:47.250> installed<00:00:47.460> power

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
noticed after you've installed power

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.020 
noticed after you've installed power
pack<00:00:48.090> -<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.020> update<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:50.030> Windows

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
pack - you have to update the Windows

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.850 
pack - you have to update the Windows
Home<00:00:51.210> Server<00:00:51.239> connector<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.379> I've<00:00:52.559> already

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
Home Server connector and I've already

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.290 
Home Server connector and I've already
done<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.579> assume<00:00:53.850> you've<00:00:53.969> done<00:00:54.120> that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
done that so I assume you've done that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.959 
done that so I assume you've done that
you've<00:00:54.510> got<00:00:54.690> everything<00:00:55.469> from<00:00:55.590> running<00:00:55.969> not

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
you've got everything from running not

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.389 
you've got everything from running not
just<00:00:57.149> we're<00:00:57.270> not<00:00:57.329> going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.750> my<00:00:58.100> home<00:00:59.100> server

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
just we're not going to my home server

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.770 
just we're not going to my home server
now<00:00:59.789> I've<00:00:59.910> got<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> new<00:01:00.239> folder<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.629> there

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
now I've got a new folder in there

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.609 
now I've got a new folder in there
called<00:01:01.079> bucolic<00:01:01.379> TV<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.629> especially

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
called bucolic TV so this is especially

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.859 
called bucolic TV so this is especially
for<00:01:04.920> recording<00:01:05.369> TV<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:08.299> put<00:01:09.299> some<00:01:09.330> content

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
for recording TV and I put some content

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.950 
for recording TV and I put some content
in<00:01:10.080> there<00:01:10.640> some<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.700> my<00:01:11.820> old<00:01:12.060> Doctor<00:01:12.570> Who<00:01:12.689> files

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
in there so those were recording from

these<00:01:22.140> without<00:01:22.799> going<00:01:23.159> through<00:01:23.220> some

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
these without going through some

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.580 
these without going through some
registries<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.210> file<00:01:24.450> sharing<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:25.170> and

be said to Ashley if you want to install
the<00:01:30.329> connector<00:01:30.450> or<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.070> go<00:01:32.250> through

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the connector or you can go through

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.859 
the connector or you can go through
install<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.790> manually<00:01:33.090> she'll<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.570> storage

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
install it manually she'll be in storage

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.580 
install it manually she'll be in storage
manually<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.650> go<00:01:34.890> click<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.630> start<00:01:36.630> all

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
programs and then we'll see you can see

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.999 
programs and then we'll see you can see
down<00:01:40.380> here<00:01:40.439> we've<00:01:41.430> got<00:01:41.659> Windows<00:01:42.659> Media<00:01:42.869> Center

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
down here we've got Windows Media Center

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.730 
down here we've got Windows Media Center
connector<00:01:44.899> so<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.930> run<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:48.619> that<00:01:49.619> was

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
connector so I run that that was

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.039 
connector so I run that that was
installed<00:01:50.070> after<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:51.049> homesteader

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
installed after the homesteader

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.580 
installed after the homesteader
connector<00:01:52.439> was<00:01:52.560> updated<00:01:53.100> next<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.200> need<00:01:55.409> my

Windows Home Server password
alright<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.240> now<00:02:00.420> I'm<00:02:00.630> loading<00:02:01.219> recenter

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.060 

let's<00:02:05.480> have<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.690> look<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:06.020> see<00:02:06.050> if<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.590> contents

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
let's have a look to see if the contents

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.650 
let's have a look to see if the contents
showing<00:02:07.280> up<00:02:10.630> there<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.750> goes<00:02:12.310> it's<00:02:13.310> just<00:02:13.370> gonna

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
showing up there it goes it's just gonna

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.280 
showing up there it goes it's just gonna
index<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:14.840> huh

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
index I huh

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.510 
index I huh
I<00:02:15.320> think<00:02:15.560> he'll<00:02:15.680> do<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.890> thumbnails<00:02:16.310> in<00:02:16.460> the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
I think he'll do the thumbnails in the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.900 
I think he'll do the thumbnails in the
moment<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:18.310> once<00:02:19.310> you've<00:02:19.460> got<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.700> plug-in

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
moment so once you've got the plug-in

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.610 
moment so once you've got the plug-in
installed<00:02:20.420> there<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:20.780> absolutely<00:02:21.170> no<00:02:21.470> effort

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
installed there is absolutely no effort

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.100 
installed there is absolutely no effort
at<00:02:21.830> all<00:02:22.100> so<00:02:22.460> it's<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:23.150> actually<00:02:23.510> accessing<00:02:23.990> the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
at all so it's to actually accessing the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.650 
at all so it's to actually accessing the
content<00:02:24.260> there<00:02:24.710> we<00:02:24.770> go<00:02:24.920> it's<00:02:25.100> coming<00:02:26.060> in<00:02:26.270> now

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
content there we go it's coming in now

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.320 
content there we go it's coming in now
it's<00:02:27.590> just<00:02:27.740> drop<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.130> in<00:02:28.220> that<00:02:28.250> TV<00:02:28.610> folder<00:02:29.150> and
