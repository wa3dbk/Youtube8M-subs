what<00:00:00.299> do<00:00:00.450> you<00:00:00.510> think<00:00:00.630> should<00:00:01.050> be<00:00:01.230> the<00:00:01.260> priority

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:02.149 
what do you think should be the priority

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.480 
what do you think should be the priority
for<00:00:03.259> federal<00:00:04.259> spending<00:00:04.470> well<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.009> think<00:00:05.190> it

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
for federal spending well I think it

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.769 
for federal spending well I think it
comes<00:00:05.670> back<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.910> something<00:00:06.359> very<00:00:06.390> simple

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
comes back to something very simple

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.179 
comes back to something very simple
something<00:00:07.230> I've<00:00:07.350> been<00:00:07.379> talking<00:00:07.859> about<00:00:07.950> since

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
something I've been talking about since

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.330 
something I've been talking about since
I<00:00:08.340> got<00:00:08.550> up<00:00:08.670> here<00:00:08.820> what<00:00:09.030> are<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.780> essential

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
I got up here what are the essential

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.259 
I got up here what are the essential
functions<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.490> federal<00:00:11.849> government<00:00:12.150> what

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
functions of the federal government what

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.339 
functions of the federal government what
are<00:00:12.360> our<00:00:12.509> constitutionally<00:00:13.320> mandated

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
are our constitutionally mandated

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.350 
are our constitutionally mandated
functions<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.700> think<00:00:14.969> that's<00:00:15.150> what<00:00:15.330> we

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
functions and I think that's what we

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.640 
functions and I think that's what we
have<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.750> start<00:00:15.960> looking<00:00:16.139> at<00:00:16.410> when<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.619> look

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
have to start looking at when you look

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.279 
have to start looking at when you look
at<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.100> 12<00:00:17.789> appropriations<00:00:18.119> bill<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:18.960> we

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
at the 12 appropriations bill that we

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.810 
at the 12 appropriations bill that we
put<00:00:19.500> brillz<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:20.039> we<00:00:20.130> produce<00:00:20.340> here<00:00:20.520> out<00:00:20.789> of

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
put brillz that we produce here out of

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.340 
put brillz that we produce here out of
the<00:00:20.910> house<00:00:21.060> what<00:00:21.600> are<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.810> priorities<00:00:22.020> for

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
the house what are the priorities for

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.960 
the house what are the priorities for
those<00:00:22.470> appropriations<00:00:23.250> bills<00:00:23.550> what's<00:00:23.850> the

those appropriations bills what's the
Tier<00:00:24.210> one<00:00:24.240> tier<00:00:24.510> two<00:00:24.960> two<00:00:25.199> or<00:00:25.320> three

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
Tier one tier two two or three

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.560 
Tier one tier two two or three
priorities<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.699> way<00:00:26.910> we<00:00:27.119> don't<00:00:27.269> find

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
priorities and that way we don't find

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.759 
priorities and that way we don't find
ourselves<00:00:27.720> run<00:00:28.140> into<00:00:28.380> these<00:00:28.500> situations

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
ourselves run into these situations

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.970 
ourselves run into these situations
where<00:00:29.539> we<00:00:30.539> don't<00:00:30.689> know<00:00:30.929> what<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.560> important

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
where we don't know what the important

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.350 
where we don't know what the important
things<00:00:32.160> are<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.399> do<00:00:32.520> or<00:00:32.730> we<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.149> an

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
things are to do or we have an

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.240 
things are to do or we have an
individual<00:00:33.930> who<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.170> threatening<00:00:34.469> certain

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
individual who is threatening certain

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.000 
individual who is threatening certain
groups<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:36.450> use<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> political<00:00:37.260> pawns<00:00:37.710> and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
groups to use as a political pawns and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.889 
groups to use as a political pawns and
so<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.520> think<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.149> very<00:00:39.390> important

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
so I think that this is a very important

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.900 
so I think that this is a very important
we<00:00:40.020> send<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.379> message<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.280> set<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> standard

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
we send a message and set a standard

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.700 
we send a message and set a standard
that<00:00:42.480> there<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.840> certain<00:00:43.140> things<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.500> need

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
that there are certain things that need

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.959 
that there are certain things that need
to<00:00:43.739> be<00:00:43.860> taken<00:00:44.070> care<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.640> country

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
to be taken care of in this country

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.180 
to be taken care of in this country
first<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.329> foremost<00:00:45.750> when<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> president

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
first and foremost when the president

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.000 
first and foremost when the president
said<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.610> social<00:00:48.539> security<00:00:48.960> checks<00:00:49.260> may<00:00:49.829> not

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
said that social security checks may not

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.619 
said that social security checks may not
go<00:00:50.160> out<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> deal<00:00:50.940> isn't<00:00:51.149> reached<00:00:51.300> well<00:00:51.600> a

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
go out if the deal isn't reached well a

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
go out if the deal isn't reached well a
second<00:00:52.260> do<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.440> agree<00:00:52.710> or<00:00:52.829> disagree<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
president I totally disagree and I think

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.619 
president I totally disagree and I think
that's<00:00:55.890> fair<00:00:56.100> mongering<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.640> having<00:00:57.449> been<00:00:57.570> a

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
that's fair mongering and having been a

military leadership by fear mongering is

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.460 
military leadership by fear mongering is
not<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> unapproved<00:01:03.090> solution<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.840> think<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
not a unapproved solution I think the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.710 
not a unapproved solution I think the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
catastrophic situation that's more debt

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.390 
catastrophic situation that's more debt
than<00:01:26.250> from<00:01:26.939> beliefs<00:01:27.650> 1776<00:01:28.650> up<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.979> nineteen

than from beliefs 1776 up to nineteen
ninety-four<00:01:29.970> almost<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.930> that's<00:01:31.110> what<00:01:31.290> we're

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
ninety-four almost so that's what we're

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.480 
ninety-four almost so that's what we're
contending<00:01:31.890> with<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.250> we're<00:01:32.340> also

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
spending problem in Washington DC we

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.479 
spending problem in Washington DC we
must<00:02:17.900> contend<00:02:18.290> with<00:02:18.439> and<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:18.980> think<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.280> when

you<00:02:19.519> see<00:02:19.819> us<00:02:19.849> bring<00:02:20.180> forth<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.569> legislation

you see us bring forth the legislation

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.170 
you see us bring forth the legislation
on<00:02:21.349> cut<00:02:21.620> cap<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:21.920> balance<00:02:22.129> that<00:02:22.939> would<00:02:23.060> be

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
on cut cap and balance that would be

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.819 
on cut cap and balance that would be
something<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:24.019> president<00:02:24.680> doesn't

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
something that the president doesn't

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.530 
something that the president doesn't
agree<00:02:25.099> with<00:02:25.189> then<00:02:25.790> we<00:02:25.939> know<00:02:26.060> he's<00:02:26.239> just<00:02:26.390> a

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
agree with then we know he's just a

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.300 
agree with then we know he's just a
