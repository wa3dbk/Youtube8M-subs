00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
I have a radar image so I'm going to

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.190 
I have a radar image so I'm going to
select<00:02:20.410> radar<00:02:20.830> image<00:02:21.100> if<00:02:21.490> i<00:02:22.450> wanted<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.810> do<00:02:23.020> a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
select radar image if i wanted to do a

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.610 
select radar image if i wanted to do a
loop<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:23.800> radar<00:02:24.190> i<00:02:24.430> would<00:02:25.090> select<00:02:25.480> radar<00:02:26.350> loop

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
loop of radar i would select radar loop

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.400 
loop of radar i would select radar loop
if<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:28.060> wanted<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.360> do<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> radar<00:02:28.930> loop<00:02:29.230> you

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
if you wanted to do a radar loop you

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.940 
if you wanted to do a radar loop you
would<00:02:29.530> probably<00:02:29.920> use<00:02:29.950> gif<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.500> then<00:02:32.500> select

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
would probably use gif and then select

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
would probably use gif and then select
radar<00:02:33.400> loop<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.910> then<00:02:34.720> in<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.960> next<00:02:35.970> field

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.120 
radar loop and then in the next field
you<00:02:37.600> would<00:02:37.690> select<00:02:37.900> how<00:02:38.200> many<00:02:38.260> images<00:02:38.650> in<00:02:38.950> that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
you would select how many images in that

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.000 
you would select how many images in that
loop<00:02:39.340> if<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.330> select<00:02:40.810> 10<00:02:41.050> for<00:02:41.290> example<00:02:41.770> it

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
loop if you select 10 for example it

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.900 
loop if you select 10 for example it
will<00:02:42.580> save<00:02:42.880> 10<00:02:43.360> images<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.100> as<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.160> new<00:02:45.670> image

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
will save 10 images and as a new image

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.420 
will save 10 images and as a new image
is<00:02:46.180> created<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.930> previous<00:02:47.890> images<00:02:48.280> are

is created the previous images are

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.080 
is created the previous images are
renamed<00:02:48.940> so<00:02:49.390> that<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:51.070> constantly<00:02:51.460> have<00:02:51.820> the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
last 10 most recent images then you

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.260 
last 10 most recent images then you
select<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:56.020> file<00:02:56.440> name<00:02:56.940> I'm<00:02:57.940> just<00:02:58.060> going<00:02:58.210> to
