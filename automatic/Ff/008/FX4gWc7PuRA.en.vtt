00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
up it's kind of like doing a two leg you

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:28.620 
up it's kind of like doing a two leg you
know<00:01:12.120> like<00:01:12.540> extension<00:01:13.260> without<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.100> machine

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.840 

that's<00:01:29.110> just<00:01:29.439> five<00:01:29.650> reps<00:01:30.010> but<00:01:30.280> I<00:01:30.369> can<00:01:30.520> already

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
that's just five reps but I can already

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.580 
that's just five reps but I can already
start<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.299> feel<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.750> burning<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:32.350> my

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
start to feel the burning and my

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.190 
start to feel the burning and my
quadriceps<00:01:33.040> my<00:01:33.850> recommendation<00:01:34.600> would<00:01:34.750> be<00:01:34.810> to

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
quadriceps my recommendation would be to

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.340 
quadriceps my recommendation would be to
not<00:01:35.590> always<00:01:35.950> hold<00:01:36.610> with<00:01:37.330> just<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.780> same<00:01:37.990> arm

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
not always hold with just the same arm

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.890 
not always hold with just the same arm
so<00:01:38.799> maybe<00:01:39.040> do<00:01:39.250> five<00:01:39.549> to<00:01:39.970> eight<00:01:40.299> reps<00:01:40.630> on<00:01:40.869> one

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
so maybe do five to eight reps on one

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.899 
so maybe do five to eight reps on one
shot<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:41.740> then<00:01:42.130> face<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.460> other<00:01:42.790> direction

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
shot and then face the other direction

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.289
