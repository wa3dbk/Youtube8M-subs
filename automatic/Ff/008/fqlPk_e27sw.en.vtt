00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.259
 Today we are launching a new way of explaining 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.959
 the videos and we start with this side of 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.589
 apple the ingredients that we're going to 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:13.919
 need are 2 green apples 120 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:17.580
 milliliters of cream 175 milliliters of 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:20.240
 milk the juice of a lime and 100 grams 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.240
 sugar 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.650
 the first step is to cut the apple in 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:27.650
 Taquitos and squeeze the lime juice 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.769
 so that we do not get rusted afterwards in a 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.410
 we add the cream of milk and the 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.340
 sugar and we will be moving until it 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.340
 dissolve everything well 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.300
 while in a blender we will insert the 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.070
 small pieces of apple and liquefy it 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.190
 all right until it has the texture that 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.720
 we seek in my case I have not 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.430
 liquefied a lot because I prefer that it 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.910
 note a little in the apple 300 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.100
 then we mix everything well and leave 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.790
 let it cool down for more or less a 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.790
 time in the fridge 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.509
 if we have a refrigerator, we simply 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.820
 is to put it in and I finally threw 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.770
 a little cinnamon and light the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.679
 machine that should be more or less a 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.229
 time if we do not have machine simply 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:23.600
 we'll have to put it in a tupper and 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.090
 every two hours or so and taking it out and 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.069
 beating with a hand blender this 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.319
 it will break the ice crystals 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:33.530
 and in the end we can have a texture 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:35.929
 creamy if you do it without a machine will be a 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.179
 little more work but we'll get 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.600
 also a delicious ice cream 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.610
 green apple 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.350
 and here you have the result of the first 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.090
 video of the ice cream series that I'm going to 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.030
 go climbing during these next 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.159
 weeks I hope you like it and here you 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.960
 I leave a next the next recipe and 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.920
