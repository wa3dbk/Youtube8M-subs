do is you break the boat get in ok and

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.650 
do is you break the boat get in ok and
then<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.460> drive<00:00:59.969> through<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.570> then

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
then you just drive through and then

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.270 
then you just drive through and then
just<00:01:00.870> let<00:01:01.020> go<00:01:01.320> no<00:01:01.800> take<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.550> up<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.969> docu<00:01:04.280> then

just let go no take you up a docu then

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.120 
just let go no take you up a docu then
you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.610> get<00:01:06.119> out<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:06.780> business<00:01:07.130> this

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
this could potentially be like your

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.649 
this could potentially be like your
second<00:01:10.950> floor<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.250> your<00:01:11.340> base<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.729> them<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
second floor of your base of them and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.740 
second floor of your base of them and
when<00:01:12.780> you're<00:01:12.869> ready<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.200> go<00:01:14.030> push<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.299> boat

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
back out and then it should make you

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.770 
back out and then it should make you
flow<00:01:22.380> straight<00:01:22.740> down<00:01:23.450> straight<00:01:24.450> into<00:01:24.750> that

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780
