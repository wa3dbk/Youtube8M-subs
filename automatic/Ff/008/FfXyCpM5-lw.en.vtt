driven<00:04:03.049> films<00:04:03.530> are<00:04:03.709> working<00:04:04.280> but<00:04:05.739> our<00:04:06.739> writers

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
driven films are working but our writers

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.770 
driven films are working but our writers
aren't<00:04:07.430> doing<00:04:07.669> too<00:04:07.849> well<00:04:07.880> you<00:04:08.389> know<00:04:08.510> they

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
aren't doing too well you know they

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.300 
aren't doing too well you know they
aren't<00:04:08.930> empowered<00:04:09.500> they<00:04:09.709> aren't<00:04:09.889> paid<00:04:10.040> enough

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
aren't empowered they aren't paid enough

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.809 
aren't empowered they aren't paid enough
they<00:04:10.579> aren't<00:04:10.700> valued<00:04:11.060> enough<00:04:11.180> there

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
they aren't valued enough there

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.490 
they aren't valued enough there
so<00:04:13.239> something<00:04:13.780> needs<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:13.989> happen<00:04:14.110> on<00:04:14.469> that

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
so something needs to happen on that

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.860 
so something needs to happen on that

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
way you know we really need to start

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.689 
way you know we really need to start
giving<00:04:19.570> our<00:04:20.019> writers<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:21.009> value<00:04:21.250> and<00:04:21.370> respect

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
that they deserve and should get in

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.930 
that they deserve and should get in
order<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.620> be<00:04:23.740> motivated<00:04:24.370> to<00:04:24.400> come<00:04:24.520> up<00:04:24.820> with

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
order to be motivated to come up with

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.760 
order to be motivated to come up with
good<00:04:25.690> solid<00:04:25.960> original<00:04:26.620> content<00:04:26.949> yeah<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:29.080> agree

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
good solid original content yeah I agree

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.659 
good solid original content yeah I agree
with<00:04:30.039> this<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:31.350> also<00:04:32.350> probably<00:04:33.280> will<00:04:33.520> take

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
with this and also probably will take

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.730 
with this and also probably will take
some<00:04:33.880> time<00:04:33.910> to<00:04:34.090> match<00:04:34.389> up<00:04:34.570> to<00:04:34.690> a<00:04:34.720> scale<00:04:35.110> of<00:04:35.350> an

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
some time to match up to a scale of an

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.790 
some time to match up to a scale of an
avenger'<00:04:36.370> or<00:04:36.840> something<00:04:37.840> like<00:04:37.990> that<00:04:38.199> but

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
avenger' or something like that but

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.550 
avenger' or something like that but
emotionally<00:04:39.610> we<00:04:39.850> have<00:04:40.570> far<00:04:41.020> richer<00:04:41.229> content

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
emotionally we have far richer content

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.360 
emotionally we have far richer content
you<00:04:42.280> know<00:04:42.490> you<00:04:43.240> know<00:04:43.330> which<00:04:43.509> can<00:04:43.860> really<00:04:44.860> come

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
you know you know which can really come

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.249 
you know you know which can really come
out<00:04:45.400> and<00:04:45.849> which<00:04:46.060> should<00:04:46.449> but<00:04:46.810> in<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.050> right

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
out and which should but in the right

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:49.379 
out and which should but in the right
channel<00:04:47.560> in<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.919> right<00:04:48.070> way<00:04:48.430> because<00:04:49.030> that's

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
channel in the right way because that's

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.200 
channel in the right way because that's
the<00:04:49.570> USB<00:04:50.110> that<00:04:50.259> we<00:04:50.440> have<00:04:50.650> I<00:04:50.919> think<00:04:51.759> it's<00:04:51.970> fair

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
the USB that we have I think it's fair

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.610 
the USB that we have I think it's fair
to<00:04:52.330> compare<00:04:52.979> English<00:04:53.979> films<00:04:54.820> to<00:04:55.090> a<00:04:55.810> language

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
to compare English films to a language

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.950 
to compare English films to a language
film<00:04:56.919> because<00:04:57.699> English<00:04:58.120> breaks<00:04:58.389> it<00:04:58.930> breaks

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
film because English breaks it breaks

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.570 
film because English breaks it breaks
the<00:04:59.320> barriers<00:04:59.770> around<00:05:00.099> the<00:05:00.250> world

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
the barriers around the world

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.330 
the barriers around the world
yeah<00:05:00.729> in<00:05:00.970> every<00:05:01.120> country<00:05:01.889> the<00:05:02.889> universal

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
yeah in every country the universal

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.670 
yeah in every country the universal
language<00:05:03.669> so<00:05:03.699> it's<00:05:03.940> illogical<00:05:04.240> to<00:05:04.630> even<00:05:05.410> try

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
language so it's illogical to even try

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.589 
language so it's illogical to even try
and<00:05:05.740> compare<00:05:06.310> obviously<00:05:06.849> in<00:05:06.910> every<00:05:07.030> country

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:07.599 
and compare obviously in every country

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:08.999 
and compare obviously in every country
in<00:05:07.660> the<00:05:07.720> world<00:05:07.900> they<00:05:08.110> will<00:05:08.229> watch<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:08.919> in

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:09.009 
in the world they will watch it in

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.850 
in the world they will watch it in
little<00:05:09.400> but<00:05:09.699> Hindi<00:05:10.419> films<00:05:11.199> despite<00:05:11.650> of<00:05:11.800> the

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
little but Hindi films despite of the

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.230 
little but Hindi films despite of the
fact<00:05:11.889> that<00:05:12.130> we<00:05:12.280> are<00:05:12.310> India<00:05:12.669> not<00:05:12.820> everybody

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
fact that we are India not everybody

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.999 
fact that we are India not everybody
around<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.539> world<00:05:13.570> speaks<00:05:14.470> it<00:05:14.740> we<00:05:14.919> have

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
around the world speaks it we have

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:17.100 
around the world speaks it we have
broken<00:05:15.250> barriers<00:05:15.520> into<00:05:15.849> countries<00:05:16.300> like

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
broken barriers into countries like

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.600 
broken barriers into countries like
Germany<00:05:17.740> Japan<00:05:18.599> because<00:05:19.599> countries<00:05:20.430> that<00:05:21.430> do

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
Germany Japan because countries that do

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.399 
Germany Japan because countries that do
we<00:05:21.820> want<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.180> say<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.479> world's<00:05:22.750> population

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.409 
we want to say the world's population

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:25.740 
we want to say the world's population
but<00:05:23.440> besides<00:05:23.949> that<00:05:24.070> I<00:05:24.220> think<00:05:24.639> that<00:05:25.270> indie

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
but besides that I think that indie

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.200 
but besides that I think that indie
films<00:05:26.080> just<00:05:26.289> have<00:05:27.099> so<00:05:27.370> much<00:05:27.430> joy<00:05:27.849> and<00:05:30.210> that

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
films just have so much joy and that

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.810 
films just have so much joy and that
