00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
things firstly by reducing the amount of

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.209 
things firstly by reducing the amount of
fat<00:00:14.030> above<00:00:14.540> your<00:00:14.809> abdominal<00:00:15.590> muscles<00:00:15.620> and

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
matter how many crunches you do if these

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.069 
matter how many crunches you do if these
two<00:00:22.130> things<00:00:22.429> aren't<00:00:22.759> right<00:00:23.179> then<00:00:23.720> you<00:00:23.839> won't

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:24.079 
two things aren't right then you won't

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.149 
two things aren't right then you won't
have<00:00:24.169> a<00:00:24.619> 2-pack<00:00:25.220> and<00:00:25.550> a<00:00:25.640> reminder<00:00:25.909> six-pack<00:00:27.159> so

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:28.159 
have a 2-pack and a reminder six-pack so

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.339 
have a 2-pack and a reminder six-pack so
my<00:00:28.249> first<00:00:28.489> tip<00:00:28.730> is<00:00:28.970> to<00:00:29.029> reduce<00:00:29.449> total<00:00:29.929> body<00:00:30.109> fat

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.350 
my first tip is to reduce total body fat
and<00:00:30.829> one<00:00:31.099> way<00:00:31.249> that<00:00:31.429> you<00:00:31.519> can<00:00:31.669> do<00:00:31.849> this<00:00:32.029> is<00:00:32.210> to

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
and one way that you can do this is to

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.209 
and one way that you can do this is to
have<00:00:32.480> a<00:00:32.509> healthy<00:00:33.050> balanced<00:00:33.620> diet<00:00:33.680> with<00:00:34.190> a

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
slightly reduced calorie intake your

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.619 
slightly reduced calorie intake your
ontem<00:00:36.890> in<00:00:36.980> short<00:00:37.280> butter<00:00:37.519> every<00:00:38.090> meal<00:00:38.300> you've

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
ontem in short butter every meal you've

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.169 
ontem in short butter every meal you've
got<00:00:38.840> either<00:00:39.050> salad<00:00:39.890> fruit<00:00:40.250> or<00:00:40.519> vegetables

00:00:41.169 --> 00:00:41.179 
got either salad fruit or vegetables

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:43.720 
got either salad fruit or vegetables
you've<00:00:41.750> got<00:00:41.899> some<00:00:42.140> sort<00:00:42.379> of<00:00:42.500> lean<00:00:42.800> proteins<00:00:43.489> -

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
you've got some sort of lean proteins -

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.540 
you've got some sort of lean proteins -
such<00:00:43.910> as<00:00:44.120> turkey<00:00:44.660> chicken<00:00:44.960> fish<00:00:45.589> or<00:00:45.859> lentils

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
such as turkey chicken fish or lentils

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.840 
such as turkey chicken fish or lentils
and<00:00:46.789> thirdly<00:00:47.510> you<00:00:47.809> want<00:00:48.019> a<00:00:48.170> low<00:00:48.469> GI<00:00:49.010> carb

drinking<00:01:19.480> my<00:01:20.480> third<00:01:20.810> tip<00:01:21.050> is<00:01:21.260> to<00:01:21.350> chill<00:01:21.950> out

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.950 
drinking my third tip is to chill out
and<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.730> reason<00:01:22.880> why<00:01:23.150> I<00:01:23.180> say<00:01:23.480> this<00:01:23.690> is<00:01:23.930> that

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
and the reason why I say this is that

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.840 
and the reason why I say this is that
stress<00:01:24.620> produces<00:01:25.370> a<00:01:25.400> hormone<00:01:25.640> called

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
stress produces a hormone called

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.690 
stress produces a hormone called
cortisol<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:27.230> cortisol<00:01:27.710> actually<00:01:28.160> makes<00:01:28.490> you

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
cortisol and cortisol actually makes you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.510 
cortisol and cortisol actually makes you
store<00:01:29.060> fat<00:01:29.090> on<00:01:29.540> stomach<00:01:30.020> just<00:01:30.740> make<00:01:31.040> sure<00:01:31.310> that

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520
