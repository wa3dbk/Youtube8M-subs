00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
I don't think of the only thing I think

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.280 
I don't think of the only thing I think
of<00:02:34.590> when<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.769> see<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.099> tube<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.549> Scotty<00:02:35.849> so

of when I see this tube is Scotty so

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.990 
of when I see this tube is Scotty so
yeah<00:02:37.290> but<00:02:37.650> there<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.370> been<00:02:38.489> other<00:02:38.640> people<00:02:38.760> in
