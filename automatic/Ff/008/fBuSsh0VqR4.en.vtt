everything there is as planned one of
the<00:00:49.020> features<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.620> really<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.969> that

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the features that I really like is that

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.209 
the features that I really like is that
you<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.910> telephoto<00:00:54.020> zoom<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.410> both<00:00:55.860> left

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
and right one actually on the lens which

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.290 
and right one actually on the lens which
in<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.859> case<00:00:59.070> I'm<00:00:59.280> able<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.640> use<00:00:59.820> my<00:01:00.090> left

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300

thumbs up Nikon so with the P 900 we
have<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.530> pretty<00:02:18.460> standard<00:02:18.910> video<00:02:19.980> very<00:02:20.980> stable

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
have a pretty standard video very stable

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.300 
have a pretty standard video very stable
as<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:21.940> mentioned<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:23.410> also<00:02:23.590> offers<00:02:23.770> a

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
as I mentioned and it also offers a

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.450 
as I mentioned and it also offers a
time-lapse<00:02:25.230> option<00:02:26.230> which<00:02:26.470> seems<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.310> be

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
time-lapse option which seems to be

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.380 
time-lapse option which seems to be
creeping<00:02:27.850> up<00:02:28.030> into<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.480> handheld<00:02:28.930> bones<00:02:29.290> so

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
creeping up into the handheld bones so

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.480 
creeping up into the handheld bones so
again<00:02:31.390> that's<00:02:31.600> great<00:02:31.990> if<00:02:32.260> you're<00:02:32.650> using<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.340> as

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
again that's great if you're using it as

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.790 
again that's great if you're using it as
a<00:02:33.550> nature<00:02:34.240> photographer<00:02:34.990> perhaps<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.620> can

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
a nature photographer perhaps you can

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.570 
a nature photographer perhaps you can
tripod<00:02:36.220> mount<00:02:36.520> it<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.910> course<00:02:37.210> and<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:39.250> get<00:02:39.550> a

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
tripod mount it of course and and get a

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.460 
tripod mount it of course and and get a
great<00:02:39.850> time<00:02:40.120> lapse<00:02:40.360> piece<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:41.020> work<00:02:41.200> the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
great time lapse piece of work the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.690 
great time lapse piece of work the
camera<00:02:41.680> body<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:42.160> Wi-Fi<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:43.080> also<00:02:44.080> has<00:02:44.290> NFC

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
camera body is Wi-Fi and also has NFC

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.070 
camera body is Wi-Fi and also has NFC
capability<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:45.940> it's<00:02:46.090> up<00:02:46.210> to<00:02:46.240> date<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:46.600> up<00:02:46.930> to

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
capability so it's up to date and up to

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.860 
capability so it's up to date and up to
speed<00:02:47.410> with<00:02:48.040> almost<00:02:48.400> all<00:02:48.730> of<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:49.210> new<00:02:49.390> cameras
