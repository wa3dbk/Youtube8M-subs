went directly to the men to pick one up
very<00:00:34.469> very<00:00:34.680> cool<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.309> did<00:00:36.090> like<00:00:36.270> half<00:00:36.870> dollars

take that these are more of a sports
collect<00:00:40.410> or<00:00:40.590> really<00:00:40.800> than<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> boolean<00:00:41.280> device

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550
