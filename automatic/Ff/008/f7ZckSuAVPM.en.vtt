here<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.369> probably<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.910> best<00:00:18.150> plane<00:00:18.510> you

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
here is probably the best plane you

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.210 
here is probably the best plane you
could<00:00:18.810> start<00:00:19.080> with<00:00:19.199> it's<00:00:19.830> really<00:00:20.070> recommended

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
could start with it's really recommended

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.950 
could start with it's really recommended
by<00:00:20.699> everyone<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.210> start<00:00:21.420> with<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.720> plane

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
by everyone to start with this plane

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.080 
by everyone to start with this plane
it's<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.740> three<00:00:22.949> channel<00:00:23.160> plane<00:00:23.490> but<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.730> added

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
it's a three channel plane but I added

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.790 
it's a three channel plane but I added
on<00:00:24.180> ailerons<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:25.050> forget<00:00:25.380> about<00:00:25.410> that

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
on ailerons to just forget about that

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.859 
on ailerons to just forget about that
but<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> three<00:00:26.849> channel<00:00:27.060> plane<00:00:27.420> usually

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
but it's a three channel plane usually

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.839 
but it's a three channel plane usually
comes<00:00:28.199> with<00:00:28.349> wheels<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.460> one<00:00:29.609> thing<00:00:29.789> I

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
comes with wheels but the one thing I

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.279 
comes with wheels but the one thing I
love<00:00:30.000> about<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.510> can<00:00:30.689> add<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> float

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
love about it is you can add on a float

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.690 
love about it is you can add on a float
set<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.830> gives<00:00:31.980> some<00:00:32.130> expandability

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
set so it gives some expandability

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.310 
set so it gives some expandability
there's<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.360> little<00:00:33.570> bit<00:00:33.660> more<00:00:33.780> fun<00:00:34.050> as<00:00:34.200> you're

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
there's a little bit more fun as you're

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.620 
there's a little bit more fun as you're
compressing<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.860> Hobby<00:00:35.149> these<00:00:36.149> cost<00:00:36.390> under

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
compressing the Hobby these cost under

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.500 
compressing the Hobby these cost under
200<00:00:37.110> bucks<00:00:37.290> around<00:00:38.100> 150<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:38.910> think<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.390> there's

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
200 bucks around 150 I think and there's

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.330 
200 bucks around 150 I think and there's
a<00:00:39.540> couple<00:00:39.719> different<00:00:40.140> versions<00:00:40.320> who's<00:00:41.100> buying

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
a couple different versions who's buying

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.889 
a couple different versions who's buying
them<00:00:41.520> fly<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.000> them<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.270> couple<00:00:42.450> ready<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
them fly and them as a couple ready to

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.069 
them fly and them as a couple ready to

start with a three-channel that's where

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.040 
start with a three-channel that's where
you<00:00:56.699> should<00:00:56.730> go<00:00:56.879> now<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:57.840> you've<00:00:57.989> already

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
you should go now if you've already

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.930 
you should go now if you've already
flown<00:00:58.469> through<00:00:58.710> town<00:00:58.920> planes<00:00:59.280> or<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.789> you've

by not hovers loops rolls and you know

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.800 
by not hovers loops rolls and you know
other<00:01:22.650> things<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.460> air<00:01:23.630> but<00:01:24.630> it

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
other things like that in the air but it

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.960 
other things like that in the air but it
also<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.259> very<00:01:25.290> stable<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.159> easy<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.790> learn

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
it clean glides for a long time so you

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.380 
it clean glides for a long time so you
actually<00:03:20.190> wanted<00:03:20.520> a<00:03:20.580> lot<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.790> space<00:03:21.000> the
