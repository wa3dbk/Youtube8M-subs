actually going out of town tomorrow i'll
probably<00:01:55.049> be<00:01:55.320> gone<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.890> won't<00:01:56.130> even<00:01:56.250> be<00:01:56.460> gone

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
probably be gone I won't even be gone

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.280 
probably be gone I won't even be gone
for<00:01:56.820> probably<00:01:57.240> two<00:01:57.390> days<00:01:57.509> maybe<00:01:57.750> maybe<00:01:58.049> just

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
for probably two days maybe maybe just

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.440 
for probably two days maybe maybe just
one<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.549> don't<00:01:59.759> want<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.000> leave<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.299> on

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
one but I don't want to leave it on

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.420 
one but I don't want to leave it on
while<00:02:00.810> I'm<00:02:00.960> gone<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.500> no<00:02:01.619> one's<00:02:01.799> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.130> be

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
while I'm gone and no one's going to be

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.630 
while I'm gone and no one's going to be
home<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:03.600> could

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
home that could

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.370 
home that could
you<00:02:04.940> know<00:02:05.090> it'll<00:02:05.450> probably<00:02:05.690> like<00:02:06.140> black

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
you know it'll probably like black

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.800 
you know it'll probably like black
screen<00:02:06.770> again<00:02:07.040> or<00:02:07.220> something<00:02:07.430> like<00:02:07.700> that<00:02:07.810> and

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
screen again or something like that and

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.790 
screen again or something like that and
that<00:02:09.080> would<00:02:09.200> not<00:02:09.319> be<00:02:09.380> good<00:02:10.030> another<00:02:11.030> reason<00:02:11.240> I

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
that would not be good another reason I
