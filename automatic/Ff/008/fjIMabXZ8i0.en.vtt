00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:10.069
 Today I'm going to talk 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:12.349
 of the jamoncillos 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.810
 the shampoos and all the caramelitos the singers 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.400
 of paper regulations 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.460
 what's in the hotels 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.759
 if they are there 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.029
 to cover one of the essential needs of the navel 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.230
 Steal 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.840
 people go to hotels to two things basically birds tire and they stole it 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.440
 and the hotels know it 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.910
 that's why they have to play with that double moral 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.470
 Good morning sir micifuz we know that you are a wealthy man of 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.970
 business 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.740
 the hotel to rest 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.590
 and steal 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.760
 therefore more if you protest comfortable room where the 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.210
 pictures that are bolted to the wall 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.090
 here the doubt is 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.350
 what things can you take 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.040
 and what things 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.250
 Chlorine soap can carry 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.370
 cash 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.190
 because because it is not bolted to there is only one rule if it is not 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.470
 screwed to the hotel you can take it 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.160
 the mayor can not take 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.160
 not because this one had the quotation marks and 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.510
 a question arises then and it is 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.060
 it is logical that there 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.190
 brushes 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.990
 in luxury hotels 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.119
 For on the one hand, if you own a luxury hotel, you are at the limit and paid with 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.350
 its little things to use but it's not because it's a luxury hotel 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.980
 I will not go to the dukes of Medina Sidonia has been refining the works 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.210
 everything is to steal 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.560
 if not 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.970
 it would be of better quality 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.970
 the dental 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.540
 they sell you an 'all to a hundred' and protests 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.289
 a brush that gets it after brushing scenes but on the teeth 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.289
 starting tomorrow in bermeo with the provinces 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.329
 there is only one thing 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:11.129
 quality 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.699
 there was more intimate than the dental cen 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:16.089
 the paper slippers 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.799
 manna mana macumba becket once stood out from the windows last 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.719
 to the ground 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.279
 the people took them 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.709
 - in the apple holy week people take them 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.869
 what material are the shoes that you have people at home 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.709
 are skype paper or can not be if they wanted to make them cheaper 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.709
 they would have to make photocopies 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.639
 strange credit card nipples the shoehorn so they put you a shoehorn 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.269
 if it's like putting a strass hair 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.459
 they do not pay attention to the European authorities 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.649
 everything is imperfect so that for the horror parker now we see and we play 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.149
 another thing that puts the hotels so that we steal oncca rings 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:06.149
 this crisis is really saying 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.139
 in him not because of who has been the idea of ​​putting him 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:15.499
 a paper overshadowed carmen lillo that says nothing about the taste of caramel sprint 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:19.299
 it is impossible to know what is that candy those of 6 2 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.040
 inside an eva 'fish tank from a fish tank 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.379

 Álava 80 unless you give a clue not hotel gold tower gold seems 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.019
 banana and 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:46.599
 for barberá I say it when the service is making laws ask for bed 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.099
 separate beds 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.099
 better separate beds are easier to carry 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.449
 however, American hotels put you as an amenity as a souvenir 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:57.899
 unanimity 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:01.509
 I encouraged you to pick it up you steal it from the house and when you receive it you will not steal 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:03.909
 you drop your face in shame 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.129

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.140
 in which comes everything that has a hotel satoko that allen shelter or go 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.769
 to a gym 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.769
 our anteater is cypress because you mess up 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:18.409
 it will not give me time using all 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:21.779
 Every order customer has a goal 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.779
 make the hotel have losses 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.849
 I will not be profitable to the hotel 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:34.459
 the thing is no longer amortizing its expense the thing is to reduce the margins of 

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:35.330
 gain 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.749
 the order is who is going saying I did not achieve even what he liked more 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.080
 that's why I say that whenever rubens 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.860

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.189
 that is not in your hand 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:02.509
 what are you doing this bar that little object 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:03.759
 to a better home
