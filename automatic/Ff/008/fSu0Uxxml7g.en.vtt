carrot<00:00:42.660> cake<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:42.899> not<00:00:42.930> really<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> best

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
carrot cake it's not really the best

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.709

thing<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.920> give<00:00:44.160> an<00:00:44.250> eight-year-old<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.360> why

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
thing to give an eight-year-old so why

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.150 
thing to give an eight-year-old so why
not<00:00:45.899> make<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.289> little<00:00:46.379> bit<00:00:46.559> more<00:00:46.680> healthier

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
not make it a little bit more healthier

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.060 
not make it a little bit more healthier
by<00:00:47.399> using<00:00:47.670> applesauce<00:00:48.450> instead<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.410> oil<00:00:49.710> and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
by using applesauce instead of oil and

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.490 
by using applesauce instead of oil and
using<00:00:50.640> Splenda<00:00:50.850> sugar<00:00:51.270> into<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> real<00:00:52.199> sugar

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
using Splenda sugar into the real sugar

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.310 
using Splenda sugar into the real sugar
