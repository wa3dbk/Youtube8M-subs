00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.000
 for the first time mine 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.250
 in the distance 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.230
 these years seeing all these fancy guitars 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.449
 I have a lot of saliva 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.109
 started here I understood what I want 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.989
 of this 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.099
 and once by chance in a young technique was 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:35.160
 such a syskar magazine name I discovered 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.559
 electric guitar drawing for about a year i 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.650
 master tried to understand what how why 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.540
 such has made a guitar sixty 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.180
 ninth year she was in before 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.790
 principle 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.890
 my first order 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.680
 I do not even remember the year some had 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.600
 but I am in this question thanks to the left 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.329
 pharafon it was my first customer 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.870
 who commanded moses here it was already 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.560
 a long time ago and this is my first strat 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.270
 made for him by filling 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.780
 this birth tool this 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:14.830
 quite an interesting process sometimes 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.340
 quite a long time I go around that slide 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.110
 the tree that is in my house and 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.350
 making a decision what will go that is 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.570
 meta you need to think everything over 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.170
 reasons will start some kind of constructive 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.140
 work it usually happens even more 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.910
 parts probably intuitive so I understand 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.550
 that this tree is this one this one 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.399
 pieces here they have to come up methods for 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.160
 solving such problems then starting 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.649
 further work ie birth 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.170
 tool is also in the mood 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.140
 happens if there is no mood and this 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.190
 set aside went birth 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.049
 tool may happen incorrect 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.710
 I was already convinced and more than once convinced 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.840
 what is done through force here besides 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.299
 your will is not always good at 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.369
 that is, the nature of the attitude to this 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.190
 instrument imposes on it some 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:13.110
 imprint 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:16.670
 I think that every instrument has 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.140
 some mental component think that 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.030
 master or team that works 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.240
 over the tool put your own there 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.020
 the soul of the instrument lives precisely by the fact that 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.340
 They were invested when I see my 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.630
 instrument on stage 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.790
 the musicians have the owner of this instrument 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.190
 I have 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.890
 some fear also sounds for an hour 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.710
 I can worry can be happy for 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.170
 This tool can be upset because 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.720
 that he has not sounded at the moment 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.200
 why but generally 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.750
 when everything happens successfully then ascended 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.210
 and this mood appears and desire 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.250
 keep doing it when our guitar 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.190
 leaves my hands on my 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.980
 for some time only this soul remains 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.980
 emptiness as if something from me 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.980
 broke away 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.530
 I think that we are ministers all 1 use 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.150
 under the name of her majesty this guitar 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.700
 tool 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.740
 truly he must have reached the heights now 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.290
 its in the excellence and consummate 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.540
 its popularity 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.050
 few people know what a guitar is and how 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.050
 she should sound 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.780
 take care your guitars don't drop no 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.770
 drop them 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.770
 I don't feel pain
