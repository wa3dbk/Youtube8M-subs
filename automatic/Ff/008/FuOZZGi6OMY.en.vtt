00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.940 

okay<00:00:08.700> so<00:00:09.150> i'm<00:00:09.510> going<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.139> be<00:00:10.260> showing<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.740> how

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
okay so i'm going to be showing you how

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.049 
okay so i'm going to be showing you how
to<00:00:11.460> make<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:12.469> two-by-two<00:00:13.469> hidden<00:00:14.429> piston<00:00:14.880> door

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
to make a two-by-two hidden piston door

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.500 
to make a two-by-two hidden piston door
just<00:00:15.750> exactly<00:00:16.049> like<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.560> I've<00:00:16.830> seen<00:00:17.510> three

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
just exactly like this I've seen three

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.950 
just exactly like this I've seen three
or<00:00:18.660> four<00:00:18.930> videos<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> hybrid<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:21.029> this

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
or four videos this is a hybrid of this

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.300 
or four videos this is a hybrid of this
is<00:00:22.080> actually<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.410> lowest<00:00:22.590> footprint<00:00:23.189> of

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
is actually the lowest footprint of

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.529 
is actually the lowest footprint of
anything<00:00:23.640> I've<00:00:23.789> seen<00:00:24.000> because<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.300> threw<00:00:24.510> a

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
anything I've seen because I threw a

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.939 
anything I've seen because I threw a
little<00:00:24.779> bit<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.260> wiring<00:00:26.180> myself<00:00:27.800> and<00:00:28.800> it

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
little bit of the wiring myself and it

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.550 
little bit of the wiring myself and it
opens<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.460> closes<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:30.150> three<00:00:30.929> or<00:00:31.050> four<00:00:31.080> tix

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
opens and closes in three or four tix

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.930 
opens and closes in three or four tix
and<00:00:32.000> can<00:00:33.000> be<00:00:33.120> easily<00:00:33.149> rigged<00:00:33.660> up<00:00:33.899> with<00:00:34.500> a

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
and can be easily rigged up with a

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.119 
and can be easily rigged up with a
pressure<00:00:35.940> plate<00:00:36.180> here<00:00:36.710> now<00:00:37.710> I'm<00:00:37.920> actually

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
pressure plate here now I'm actually

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.979 
pressure plate here now I'm actually
going<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.640> with<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.149> switch<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.780> i<00:00:39.809> can

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
going to do it with the switch so i can

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.130 
going to do it with the switch so i can
leave<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.260> leave<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.680> off<00:00:40.879> just<00:00:42.140> for

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
leave it on leave it off just for

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.630 
leave it on leave it off just for
construction<00:00:43.590> purposes<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.520> see

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
construction purposes so you can see

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.000 
construction purposes so you can see
what's<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.770> something<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.860> should

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
what's going on something you should

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.000 
what's going on something you should
know<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:48.390> means<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.320> door<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.649> closed

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
know is that on means the door is closed

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.270 
know is that on means the door is closed
and<00:00:50.280> off<00:00:51.059> means<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.260> doors<00:00:52.469> open<00:00:52.890> just

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and off means the doors open just

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.670 
and off means the doors open just
remember<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:55.199> other<00:00:55.350> thing<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.649> you

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
remember that the other thing is you

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.760 
remember that the other thing is you
need<00:00:55.890> at<00:00:56.070> least<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.640> intermediate

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
need at least a intermediate

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.200 
need at least a intermediate
understanding<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.859> redstone<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.640> what<00:01:00.180> I

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
understanding of redstone and what I

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.939 
understanding of redstone and what I
mean<00:01:00.270> by<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.020> site<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.530> doesn't

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
mean by that is the site of this doesn't

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.899 
mean by that is the site of this doesn't
scare<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> first<00:01:05.549> thing<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:05.729> need<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
scare you so the first thing we need to

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.980 
scare you so the first thing we need to
do<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.619> place<00:01:07.619> our<00:01:08.420> pistons<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.810> want<00:01:09.930> to

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
do is place our pistons and you want to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.790 
do is place our pistons and you want to
place<00:01:10.170> it

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
place it

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.830 
place it
do<00:01:12.800> I<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:12.980> right<00:01:13.340> behind<00:01:13.610> there<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.000> then

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
do I to right behind there and then

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.630 
do I to right behind there and then
another<00:01:15.170> two<00:01:15.740> by<00:01:15.890> two<00:01:17.020> let's<00:01:18.020> place<00:01:18.230> that<00:01:18.410> one

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
another two by two let's place that one

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.930 
another two by two let's place that one
right<00:01:19.640> there

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.910 

same<00:01:23.600> thing<00:01:23.750> on<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.870> other<00:01:23.900> side<00:01:24.050> array<00:01:24.890> of

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
same thing on the other side array of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.550 
same thing on the other side array of
two<00:01:25.160> by<00:01:25.310> two

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
two by two

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.920 
two by two
then<00:01:27.520> you<00:01:27.610> without<00:01:27.850> your<00:01:28.000> blog's

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
then you without your blog's

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.380 
then you without your blog's
you<00:01:30.470> put<00:01:30.680> two<00:01:30.890> blocks<00:01:31.100> up<00:01:31.280> top<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:32.060> then<00:01:32.210> one

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
you put two blocks up top and then one

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.240 
you put two blocks up top and then one
down<00:01:32.570> at<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.810> diagonal<00:01:33.020> right<00:01:33.620> here<00:01:34.010> and<00:01:34.220> you

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
down at a diagonal right here and you

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:42.190 
down at a diagonal right here and you
mere<00:01:34.910> it<00:01:35.030> on<00:01:35.740> both<00:01:36.740> sides<00:01:40.240> now<00:01:41.240> let's<00:01:41.450> wire<00:01:41.870> the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
mere it on both sides now let's wire the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.560 
mere it on both sides now let's wire the
easy<00:01:42.380> one<00:01:42.710> first<00:01:43.010> this<00:01:44.000> one's<00:01:44.210> gonna<00:01:44.330> be<00:01:44.450> the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
easy one first this one's gonna be the

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.320 
easy one first this one's gonna be the
easy<00:01:44.810> one<00:01:44.960> right<00:01:45.229> here<00:01:45.970> you<00:01:46.970> put<00:01:47.210> your

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
easy one right here you put your

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.680 
easy one right here you put your
redstone<00:01:47.690> repeater<00:01:48.110> right<00:01:48.530> there<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.690> you

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
redstone repeater right there and you

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.420 
redstone repeater right there and you
take<00:01:50.930> whatever<00:01:51.260> your<00:01:51.470> sources<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.220> wire<00:01:52.400> it

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
take whatever your sources and wire it

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.200 
take whatever your sources and wire it
to<00:01:52.610> it

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
to it

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.540 
to it
and<00:01:54.510> then<00:01:54.900> you<00:01:55.020> wire<00:01:55.290> it

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
and then you wire it

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.580 
and then you wire it
around<00:01:57.330> in<00:01:57.480> a<00:01:57.570> little<00:01:57.810> she<00:01:57.960> lives<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:58.290> go<00:01:58.470> up

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
around in a little she lives here go up

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.980 
around in a little she lives here go up
the<00:01:58.710> spiral

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
the spiral

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.649 
the spiral
and<00:02:00.170> now<00:02:00.650> this<00:02:00.829> one's<00:02:01.009> powered<00:02:01.310> by<00:02:01.430> that<00:02:01.659> now

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
and now this one's powered by that now

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.270 
and now this one's powered by that now
it's<00:02:02.840> probably<00:02:03.320> good<00:02:03.439> idea<00:02:03.649> to<00:02:03.740> go<00:02:03.829> ahead<00:02:03.860> and

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
it's probably good idea to go ahead and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.510 
it's probably good idea to go ahead and
set<00:02:04.520> this<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:05.600> two<00:02:05.899> or<00:02:06.590> at<00:02:06.740> least<00:02:06.860> two<00:02:07.040> to<00:02:07.490> three

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
set this to two or at least two to three

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.419 
set this to two or at least two to three
by<00:02:08.090> right<00:02:08.300> clicking<00:02:08.599> twice<00:02:09.009> and<00:02:10.009> now<00:02:10.190> when<00:02:10.340> you

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
by right clicking twice and now when you

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.589 
by right clicking twice and now when you
turn<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:10.610> on<00:02:12.700> while<00:02:13.700> four<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:14.030> them<00:02:14.120> extended

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
turn it on while four of them extended

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.509 
turn it on while four of them extended
we<00:02:14.750> turn<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.050> off<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.440> actually<00:02:15.560> will<00:02:15.950> pull<00:02:16.220> the

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
we turn it off it actually will pull the

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.410 
we turn it off it actually will pull the
back<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.900> back<00:02:18.290> pistons<00:02:19.000> now<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.300> can

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
back to of the back pistons now you can

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.910 
back to of the back pistons now you can
do<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.780> same<00:02:20.959> thing<00:02:21.200> on<00:02:21.319> both<00:02:21.349> sides<00:02:21.769> I'm

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
do the same thing on both sides I'm

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.809 
do the same thing on both sides I'm
going<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.099> do<00:02:22.190> something<00:02:22.370> slightly<00:02:22.580> different

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
going to do something slightly different

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.030 
going to do something slightly different
just<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.569> show<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:23.900> even<00:02:24.050> wire<00:02:24.500> things<00:02:24.860> a

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
just to show you that even wire things a

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.530 
just to show you that even wire things a
little<00:02:25.160> differently<00:02:25.580> but<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:26.000> can<00:02:26.120> hear<00:02:26.450> it

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
little differently but you can hear it

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.570 
little differently but you can hear it
perfectly<00:02:26.959> if<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.260> want<00:02:27.470> for<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.400> sake<00:02:28.550> of

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
perfectly if you want for the sake of

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.130 
perfectly if you want for the sake of
simplicity<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.300> just<00:02:29.480> kind<00:02:29.690> of<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:29.840> regard

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
simplicity and just kind of this regard

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.240

what<00:02:30.260> I'm<00:02:30.349> showing<00:02:30.530> here<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:32.870> still

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
what I'm showing here and you still

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.640 
what I'm showing here and you still
wired<00:02:34.250> around<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.670> spiral<00:02:35.260> just<00:02:36.260> exactly

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
wired around the spiral just exactly

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.820 
wired around the spiral just exactly
like<00:02:36.830> this

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.770 

except<00:02:40.460> you<00:02:40.550> take<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.850> rithi<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.720> redstone

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
except you take the rithi the redstone

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.800 
except you take the rithi the redstone
repeater<00:02:44.780> when<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.680> said<00:02:45.920> right<00:02:46.370> there<00:02:46.810> you

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
repeater when you said right there you

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:48.790 
repeater when you said right there you
can<00:02:47.960> still<00:02:48.140> put<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.320> there<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.680> would

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
can still put it there and it would

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.120 
can still put it there and it would
still<00:02:48.980> work<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.780> you<00:02:50.780> set<00:02:50.960> it<00:02:51.080> into<00:02:51.200> two<00:02:51.440> to

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
still work and you set it into two to

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.850 
still work and you set it into two to
three<00:02:52.400> with<00:02:52.580> kid<00:02:52.820> clicks<00:02:53.530> because<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.680> set<00:02:54.830> to

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
three with kid clicks because it set to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.220 
three with kid clicks because it set to
point<00:02:55.130> my<00:02:55.250> people<00:02:55.610> now<00:02:56.480> this<00:02:56.660> is<00:02:56.840> where<00:02:57.020> it

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
point my people now this is where it

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.500 
point my people now this is where it
gets<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.470> little<00:02:57.590> different<00:02:58.130> even<00:02:58.340> if<00:02:59.240> you<00:02:59.330> put

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
gets a little different even if you put

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.160 
gets a little different even if you put
it<00:02:59.600> there<00:02:59.810> as<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.230> want<00:03:00.740> to<00:03:00.890> build<00:03:01.070> it<00:03:01.280> up

it again you want to keep it on the same
level<00:03:16.330> and<00:03:17.800> put<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:18.890> repeater<00:03:19.190> right<00:03:19.550> there

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
level and put the repeater right there

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.330 
level and put the repeater right there
this<00:03:20.540> one<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:20.870> actually<00:03:21.020> want<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:21.410> leave<00:03:21.650> at

fun you want to set it up so that you
have<00:03:30.820> two<00:03:31.820> blocks<00:03:34.150> one<00:03:35.150> block<00:03:35.420> above<00:03:35.810> where

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
have two blocks one block above where

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.970 
have two blocks one block above where
those<00:03:36.709> two<00:03:36.980> are<00:03:37.190> in<00:03:37.790> one<00:03:38.030> blog<00:03:38.300> this<00:03:38.900> side<00:03:39.200> or

and they make a little zigzag like that

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.500 
and they make a little zigzag like that
you<00:03:54.700> cover<00:03:54.940> that<00:03:55.060> with<00:03:55.810> redstone<00:03:56.200> and

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
you cover that with redstone and

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.059 
you cover that with redstone and
assuming<00:03:58.510> everything<00:03:58.930> is<00:03:59.140> done<00:03:59.350> right
