00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.810 

so<00:00:00.900> I<00:00:00.930> was<00:00:01.260> over<00:00:01.439> at<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.589> scrap<00:00:01.829> yards<00:00:02.190> again<00:00:02.460> I

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
so I was over at the scrap yards again I

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.050 
so I was over at the scrap yards again I
was<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.629> naughty<00:00:03.840> boy<00:00:04.250> got<00:00:05.250> another<00:00:05.490> 5-horse

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
was a naughty boy got another 5-horse

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.930 
was a naughty boy got another 5-horse
Briggs<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:07.049> one<00:00:07.290> was<00:00:07.440> off<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.700> very<00:00:08.700> old

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
Briggs this one was off a very old

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.480 
Briggs this one was off a very old
generator<00:00:09.480> once<00:00:10.080> again<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.590> coolant<00:00:11.280> cover

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
generator once again the coolant cover

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.070 
generator once again the coolant cover
was<00:00:11.759> missing<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.330> don't<00:00:12.599> know<00:00:12.660> what<00:00:12.809> year<00:00:13.019> it

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
was missing so I don't know what year it

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.620 
was missing so I don't know what year it
is<00:00:13.290> but<00:00:13.590> it's<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.799> point<00:00:14.070> engine<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.759> the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
is but it's a point engine and the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.950 
is but it's a point engine and the
generator<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.670> suspect<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:17.820> could<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> 77

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
generator I suspect it could be a 77

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.650 
generator I suspect it could be a 77
engine<00:00:19.320> anyway<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.699> turns<00:00:20.970> out<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.510> got

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
engine anyway it turns out that it's got

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.490 
engine anyway it turns out that it's got
the<00:00:21.869> roller<00:00:22.560> bearing<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.300> output<00:00:25.199> end<00:00:25.380> of

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
the roller bearing on the output end of

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.310 
the roller bearing on the output end of
the<00:00:25.560> crankshaft<00:00:25.920> those<00:00:26.460> are<00:00:26.670> kind<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.939> rare<00:00:27.320> so

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
the crankshaft those are kind of rare so

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.349 
the crankshaft those are kind of rare so
I<00:00:28.650> know<00:00:28.920> these<00:00:29.340> are<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> little<00:00:29.789> bit<00:00:29.880> tricky<00:00:30.179> to

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
I know these are a little bit tricky to

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.380 
I know these are a little bit tricky to
time<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.679> I'm<00:00:32.009> going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.880> not<00:00:33.059> removed

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
time so I'm going to I have not removed

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.330 
time so I'm going to I have not removed
the<00:00:33.570> camshaft<00:00:34.110> out<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.590> yet<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
the camshaft out of this yet and the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.750 
the camshaft out of this yet and the
valves<00:00:35.760> appear<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.510> be<00:00:36.660> timed<00:00:37.320> correctly<00:00:37.760> so

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
valves appear to be timed correctly so

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.270 
valves appear to be timed correctly so
what<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.510> look<00:00:39.690> for<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.739> little<00:00:41.070> dot

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
what you look for is this little dot

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.450 
what you look for is this little dot
right<00:00:41.520> here<00:00:45.260> little<00:00:46.260> dot<00:00:46.469> right<00:00:46.500> right<00:00:47.190> there

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
right here little dot right right there

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.500 
right here little dot right right there
on<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.000> counterweight<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:50.300> it's<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.420> to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
on the counterweight and it's going to

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.560 
on the counterweight and it's going to
be<00:00:51.570> tricky<00:00:51.809> camerawork<00:00:52.410> here<00:00:53.210> apparently<00:00:54.210> my

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
be tricky camerawork here apparently my

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.520 
be tricky camerawork here apparently my
lights<00:00:54.780> too<00:00:55.020> bright

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
lights too bright

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.560 
lights too bright
so<00:00:55.890> there's<00:00:56.039> your<00:00:56.219> regular<00:00:56.579> timing<00:00:57.270> mark<00:00:57.449> on

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
so there's your regular timing mark on

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.599 
so there's your regular timing mark on
the<00:00:57.660> camshaft<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.890> when<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.100> rotate<00:00:59.460> that

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the camshaft but when you rotate that

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.170 
the camshaft but when you rotate that
around

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
around

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.080 
around
of<00:01:00.239> course<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.690> disappears<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.670> looks<00:01:02.940> to

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
of course it disappears but it looks to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.929 
of course it disappears but it looks to
me<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:04.670> you<00:01:05.670> get<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.939> right<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.360> point

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
me like you get it right to that point

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.429 
me like you get it right to that point
see<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> light<00:01:09.869> here<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.740> dot<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
see just the light here the dot on the

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.999 
see just the light here the dot on the
crankshaft<00:01:13.439> counterweight<00:01:15.530> lines<00:01:16.530> up<00:01:16.799> with

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
crankshaft counterweight lines up with

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.200 
crankshaft counterweight lines up with
the<00:01:17.909> dot<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.450> camshaft

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
the dot on that camshaft

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.999 
the dot on that camshaft
looks<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.420> they're<00:01:21.630> pretty<00:01:22.320> good<00:01:22.619> there<00:01:22.860> and

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
looks like they're pretty good there and

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.219 
looks like they're pretty good there and
then<00:01:23.520> also<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.000> continue<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.509> further<00:01:24.930> as

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
then also if you continue on further as

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.010 
then also if you continue on further as
a<00:01:25.259> second<00:01:25.740> check<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:27.270> run<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> crankshaft

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
a second check you run the crankshaft

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.510 
a second check you run the crankshaft
until<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:29.329> it's<00:01:30.329> like<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.310> casting<00:01:32.310> line

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
until it's it's like the casting line

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.890 
until it's it's like the casting line
and<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.820> crankshaft<00:01:33.150> lines<00:01:33.659> up

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
and the crankshaft lines up

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.710 
and the crankshaft lines up
approximately<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.939> dowel<00:01:35.939> pin<00:01:36.299> here

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
approximately with this dowel pin here

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.850 
approximately with this dowel pin here
and<00:01:38.509> just<00:01:39.509> at<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.930> point<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:42.720> dot<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
and just at that point the dot on the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.510 
and just at that point the dot on the
crankshaft

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
crankshaft

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.560 
crankshaft
get<00:01:47.520> there<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.850> there's<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> dot<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
get there and there's the dot on the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.170 
get there and there's the dot on the
crankshaft<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:50.060> two<00:01:51.060> teeth<00:01:52.280> ahead<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
crankshaft it is two teeth ahead of the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.490 
crankshaft it is two teeth ahead of the
dot<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.600> camshaft<00:01:56.360> so<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:58.110> could<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.439> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
dot on the camshaft so that could be a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.830 
dot on the camshaft so that could be a
secondary<00:01:59.280> check<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.479> course<00:02:00.689> you

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
secondary check and then of course you

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.100 
secondary check and then of course you
know<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:00.990> put<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.469> just<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.520> way<00:02:02.729> and

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
know you put in just just this way and

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.059 
know you put in just just this way and
test<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.259> valves<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:06.270> know<00:02:06.360> they<00:02:06.540> should

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
test the valves and you know they should

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.699 
test the valves and you know they should
basically

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
basically

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.710 
basically
when<00:02:10.709> when<00:02:11.549> you<00:02:11.670> run<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.970> piston<00:02:12.330> up<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.629> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
when when you run the piston up to the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.420 
when when you run the piston up to the
top<00:02:12.959> this<00:02:13.470> might<00:02:13.680> be<00:02:13.829> a<00:02:13.860> little<00:02:14.069> tricky<00:02:14.340> with

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
top this might be a little tricky with

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.059 
top this might be a little tricky with
one<00:02:14.610> hand<00:02:14.849> how<00:02:15.030> it's<00:02:15.150> working<00:02:15.299> okay<00:02:16.069> pistons

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
one hand how it's working okay pistons

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.640 
one hand how it's working okay pistons
at<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.340> top<00:02:17.579> both<00:02:18.510> valves<00:02:18.840> should<00:02:19.170> be<00:02:19.290> open

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
at the top both valves should be open

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.589 
at the top both valves should be open
fractionally<00:02:20.579> right<00:02:20.760> at<00:02:20.909> that<00:02:21.060> point<00:02:21.120> there

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
fractionally right at that point there

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.839 
fractionally right at that point there
you<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:21.900> see<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.110> intake<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:23.099> trying<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.549> open

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
you can see the intake is trying to open

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.449 
you can see the intake is trying to open
and<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.329> exhaust<00:02:24.659> is<00:02:24.840> closing<00:02:25.409> so<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:26.069> piston

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
and the exhaust is closing so the piston

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:27.949 
and the exhaust is closing so the piston
is<00:02:26.519> just<00:02:26.700> coming<00:02:26.909> to<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.239> top<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:27.870> would

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
is just coming to the top so that would

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.009 
is just coming to the top so that would
be<00:02:28.049> another<00:02:28.290> check<00:02:28.650> if<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.459> get<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.900> know

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
be another check if you get to you know

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.470 
be another check if you get to you know
timing<00:02:31.920> different<00:02:32.459> than<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.790> then<00:02:34.040> you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
timing different than that then you

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.050 
timing different than that then you
probably<00:02:36.480> have<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.230> dots<00:02:38.099> down<00:02:38.730> below

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
probably have the dots down below

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.880 
probably have the dots down below
they're<00:02:39.409> out<00:02:40.409> of<00:02:40.650> alignment<00:02:41.510> anyway<00:02:42.890> now

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
they're out of alignment anyway now

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.920 
they're out of alignment anyway now
racing<00:02:44.250> camshafts<00:02:45.000> could<00:02:45.329> be<00:02:45.480> different<00:02:45.870> I

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
racing camshafts could be different I

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.089 
racing camshafts could be different I
know<00:02:45.959> well<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.379> know<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> lot<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.709> these<00:02:46.859> five

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
know well you know a lot of these five

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.890 
know well you know a lot of these five
horses<00:02:47.549> with<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.819> roller<00:02:48.030> bearings<00:02:48.480> use

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
horses with the roller bearings use

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.610 
horses with the roller bearings use
Racing<00:02:49.739> cams<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.430> but<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.959> because<00:02:52.470> you

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
Racing cams and that but so because you

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.379 
Racing cams and that but so because you
can<00:02:52.739> vary<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.129> lobes<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.549> that<00:02:53.700> on<00:02:53.879> those<00:02:54.060> the

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
can vary the lobes and that on those the

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:55.789 
can vary the lobes and that on those the
timing<00:02:54.959> might<00:02:55.139> be<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> little<00:02:55.500> bit<00:02:55.590> different

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
timing might be a little bit different

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.940 
timing might be a little bit different
but<00:02:56.069> this<00:02:56.579> looks<00:02:56.849> like<00:02:57.000> how<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.510> setup<00:02:58.409> a<00:02:58.650> stock

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
but this looks like how to setup a stock

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.619 
but this looks like how to setup a stock
a<00:02:59.959> 5-horse<00:03:00.959> Briggs<00:03:01.379> model<00:03:01.769> 13<00:03:02.389> with<00:03:03.389> the

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
a 5-horse Briggs model 13 with the

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.800 
a 5-horse Briggs model 13 with the
roller<00:03:04.290> bearing<00:03:04.440> as<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.430> say<00:03:05.609> it's<00:03:05.849> that<00:03:05.909> that

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
roller bearing as I say it's that that

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.770 
roller bearing as I say it's that that
dot<00:03:07.109> on<00:03:07.139> the<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:08.239> counterweight<00:03:09.239> there<00:03:09.480> needs

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
dot on the the counterweight there needs

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.539 
dot on the the counterweight there needs
to<00:03:10.159> line<00:03:11.159> right<00:03:11.579> up<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.239> dot<00:03:12.450> on<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:12.750> camshaft

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
to line right up the dot on the camshaft

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.069 
to line right up the dot on the camshaft
so<00:03:14.549> anyway<00:03:14.819> I<00:03:14.849> don't<00:03:15.030> want<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.299> keep<00:03:15.449> this<00:03:15.690> make

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
so anyway I don't want to keep this make

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.280 
so anyway I don't want to keep this make
this<00:03:16.260> bid<00:03:16.440> too<00:03:16.620> long<00:03:16.829> so<00:03:17.750> best<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.900> luck<00:03:18.959> there

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
this bid too long so best of luck there

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.629 
this bid too long so best of luck there
if<00:03:19.379> you've<00:03:19.530> got<00:03:19.709> one<00:03:19.859> of<00:03:19.889> these<00:03:20.010> engines<00:03:20.459> and

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
if you've got one of these engines and

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.789 
if you've got one of these engines and
you're<00:03:20.760> trying<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.299> reassemble<00:03:22.169> it<00:03:22.470> or<00:03:22.590> time

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
you're trying to reassemble it or time

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.530 
you're trying to reassemble it or time
it<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:23.940> think<00:03:24.209> that's<00:03:24.359> how<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.750> go<00:03:25.260> about<00:03:25.349> it
