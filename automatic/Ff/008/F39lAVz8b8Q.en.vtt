00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.400
 Hello dear friends and today 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.270
 interesting information for you on 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.090
 account sneaker namely its replacement sneaker 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.850
 will be replaced by a small mouse if you can 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.640
 so to speak and this is a tank pretty 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.980
 interesting despite the fact that sneaker 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.630
 apnul here in the last update now 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.149
 it's really hard to break through 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.000
 developer apparently he still does not 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.239
 suits and that's why they him 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.200
 I replace and here on your screens you see 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.200
 what will replace it as we can see 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.110
 and the screenshot immediately becomes clear that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.969
 we will be a gun that's 100 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.440
 at the ninth level it is very good 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:00.059
 Consider booking this tanchika 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.609
 as we see the frontal detail in my 200 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.790
 millimeters is up and down too 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.890
 albeit with a smaller inclination, but I think 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.140
 that the kick will keep at least 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.380
 for the seventh level it will be real 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.760
 pain punch somewhere this tanchik 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.220
 special attention needs to be paid to 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.830
 commander turret just like her 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.710
 punch get something well and 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.259
 respectively, the mask and the tower itself is very 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.799
 well protected at 250 millimeters and 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.930
 the mask is also worth 250 millimeters 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.890
 there is there in general almost unreal 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.860
 will punch him by booking 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.140
 of our tank collection then well everything 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.840
 pretty good though corners here 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.659
 no but look for level nine 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.860
 it is very good 200 millimeters 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.409
 if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.240
 tower tanker armor and also hull but still 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.780
 and over tracked cranes 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.409
 I think everything is going well 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.240
 the back is clear the back booking is worse 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.350
 cover we have a cardboard box hello then 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.340
 there are those you can pass 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.740
 detail back it we have 150 millimeters 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.260
 here you see in front of you this 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.800
 tank but since this is a super test not yet 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.630
 time everything can change therefore believe 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.210
 fully that it would be based not 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.310
 I did not advise you but of interest 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.100
 still need to note the history cannon 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.040
 good defense of this tank ie armor 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.080
 call rushed vparyat but also strength 2000 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.900
 units it is also pretty good 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.380
 for lovers to delve into all these 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.020

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.750
