 I will learn to do so you will begin to understand 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.350
 the first reason why something is not 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.019
 why is it sold for example? 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.240
 companies small average check why 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.400
 no customer in this store I'm about 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.340
 your competitors are many and why 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.909
 eg your customer base is not growing is not 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.560
 increased that is by 3 we speak 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.170
 base is not due to what is happening 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.810
 why there is no sale and I here are the reasons 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.860
 why are you like gold so much 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.159
 I understand quickly 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.990
 also the company to bring on the go and position 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.229

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.530
 task is interpreted shop take 5 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.930
 positions of goods that you do not like and 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.979
 which will not break through at all 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.140
 either more with a little centralization you 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.299
 you need to do this take and 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.520
 make sure to write yourself in a notebook 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.180

 sell this thing here, and these my 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.120
 doing analysis 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.819

 me on the very process of selling what do you 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.280
 didn't like this particular thing and 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.400
 do an analysis do it with each of 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.069
 food to take it made recorded and 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.840

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.780
 which are sold at your home which 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.299
 just fly away slept so it causes 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.540
 a storm of emotions and the same approach every 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.069
 out of five things your colleagues 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.650

 did you look what was burning 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.630
 I will say at the end of the video I will tell 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.630
 you will notice a dramatic difference between 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.819
 the way you sell a thing that you donâ€™t 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.919
 like and which you don't know how 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.230
 sell which groin organization and those 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:51.709
 things that are very cool are sold and 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.330
 who are your people world are you selling it 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.060
 bricks tradition you give emotions 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.270
 your eyes shine you just infect 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.910
 customer by their confidence and necessity by 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:06.710
 that thing and the client feels it and the second 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.630
 option when you sell things that 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:13.170
 vocalization or not sold at all 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.780
 you have no shine in your eyes you are not sure 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.030
 All this makes a presentation of the sale in 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.770
 the customer ultimately feels your new 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.430
 vegas and as a result is what 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.680
 maybe it's not mine 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.410
 i need to get down to it how often do you 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.960
 hear these things and in the end the deal doesn't 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:36.330
 what happens to be done in order 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:40.740
 to make a deal at first 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:43.230
 after money the guys are cool when 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.870

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.000

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.330
