00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:24.420
 line that if the chicken from the bank gave

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.570

 color that my dog is scratching that he is 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.870

 I think I was desperate to be 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.180
 the first thing she did delivered 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.950

 There are not many people I 'll be there. 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.549
 running there but if I have to stop 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.670

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.770
