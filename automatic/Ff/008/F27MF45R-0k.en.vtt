00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
don't know what what and while was

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.370 
don't know what what and while was
thinking<00:00:36.270> when<00:00:36.420> they<00:00:36.540> created<00:00:37.020> these<00:00:37.170> I

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
thinking when they created these I

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.410 
thinking when they created these I
originally<00:00:37.950> thought<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.610> these<00:00:38.969> were<00:00:39.030> lips

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
originally thought that these were lips

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.200 
originally thought that these were lips
I'm<00:00:39.719> lip<00:00:40.050> glosses<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:41.370> their<00:00:41.550> liquid<00:00:42.030> lip

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
I'm lip glosses but their liquid lip

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.150 
I'm lip glosses but their liquid lip
colors<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> liquid<00:00:43.320> lipstick<00:00:43.980> I

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
colors so it's like a liquid lipstick I

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.760 
colors so it's like a liquid lipstick I
could<00:00:44.789> see<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.600> was<00:00:45.840> going<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.440> give<00:00:46.620> you

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
could see if this was going to give you

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.880 
could see if this was going to give you
a<00:00:46.800> matte<00:00:47.280> finish<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:48.030> no<00:00:48.750> stickiness<00:00:49.289> then<00:00:49.829> I

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
a matte finish and no stickiness then I

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.619 
a matte finish and no stickiness then I
would<00:00:50.070> say<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.579> perfect<00:00:51.210> you

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
would say that this is perfect you

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.170 
would say that this is perfect you

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
cannot build color with this because it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.010 
cannot build color with this because it
leaves<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:55.289> your<00:00:55.530> skin<00:00:56.059> coming<00:00:57.059> through<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
leaves like your skin coming through the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.260 
leaves like your skin coming through the
lip<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.590> lip<00:00:58.770> color<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.370> just<00:01:00.030> really

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270
