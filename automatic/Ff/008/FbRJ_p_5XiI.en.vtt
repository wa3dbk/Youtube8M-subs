fine<00:04:04.060> but<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.780> big<00:04:04.930> thing<00:04:04.959> is<00:04:05.170> if<00:04:05.410> he<00:04:05.500> can<00:04:05.650> fake

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
fine but the big thing is if he can fake

the<00:04:05.890> ball<00:04:06.130> from<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.340> quarterbacks<00:04:06.820> hand<00:04:07.120> was

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
the ball from the quarterbacks hand was

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.240 
the ball from the quarterbacks hand was
stick<00:04:08.200> it<00:04:08.320> in<00:04:08.410> his<00:04:08.470> belly<00:04:08.709> he<00:04:08.950> won't<00:04:09.100> have<00:04:09.220> to

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
stick it in his belly he won't have to

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.300 
stick it in his belly he won't have to
catch<00:04:09.459> it<00:04:09.610> too<00:04:09.730> often<00:04:10.060> but<00:04:10.870> uh<00:04:10.930> you<00:04:11.800> know<00:04:11.860> he's

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
catch it too often but uh you know he's

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.740 
catch it too often but uh you know he's
a<00:04:12.340> good<00:04:12.550> all-around<00:04:12.700> player<00:04:13.150> he<00:04:13.180> just<00:04:13.510> hadn't

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
a good all-around player he just hadn't

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.090 
a good all-around player he just hadn't
asked<00:04:13.959> to<00:04:14.020> do<00:04:14.110> that<00:04:14.260> I<00:04:14.290> think<00:04:14.410> he'd<00:04:14.770> be<00:04:14.800> a<00:04:14.950> good

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
asked to do that I think he'd be a good

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.560 
asked to do that I think he'd be a good
core<00:04:15.430> special<00:04:15.820> team<00:04:15.970> player<00:04:16.209> to<00:04:16.419> the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
core special team player to the

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.990 
core special team player to the
toughness<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:16.989> he<00:04:17.140> has<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:18.669> way<00:04:18.790> he

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
toughness that he has and the way he

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.729 
toughness that he has and the way he
plays<00:04:19.330> there's<00:04:20.080> a<00:04:20.169> chance<00:04:20.410> he<00:04:20.530> could<00:04:20.620> play

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
plays there's a chance he could play

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.890 
plays there's a chance he could play
special<00:04:21.040> teams<00:04:21.190> too<00:04:21.580> but<00:04:21.790> we'll<00:04:22.540> get<00:04:22.660> him<00:04:22.780> in

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.630 
special teams too but we'll get him in
here<00:04:22.930> find<00:04:23.710> out<00:04:23.830> what<00:04:23.950> he<00:04:24.010> can<00:04:24.160> do<00:04:24.280> well<00:04:24.430> and

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
here find out what he can do well and

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.100

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
try to use it to our advantage what do

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.409 
try to use it to our advantage what do
you<00:04:29.169> think<00:04:29.260> might<00:04:29.710> be<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.010> most<00:04:30.580> difficult

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
you think might be the most difficult

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.450 
you think might be the most difficult
part<00:04:31.450> of<00:04:31.750> a<00:04:31.870> transition<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.830> an<00:04:33.040> outside

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
part of a transition to an outside

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.610 
part of a transition to an outside
linebacker<00:04:33.700> spot<00:04:34.180> if<00:04:34.480> that<00:04:34.660> is<00:04:34.840> where<00:04:35.080> Smith

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
linebacker spot if that is where Smith

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.710 
linebacker spot if that is where Smith
wines<00:04:35.860> are<00:04:36.070> playing<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.580> do<00:04:37.060> you<00:04:37.120> see<00:04:37.390> him<00:04:37.480> as

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
wines are playing and do you see him as

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.380 
wines are playing and do you see him as
somebody<00:04:38.020> ready<00:04:38.380> to<00:04:38.740> be<00:04:39.430> a<00:04:39.460> starter<00:04:40.000> in<00:04:40.240> the

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
somebody ready to be a starter in the

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.700 
somebody ready to be a starter in the
end<00:04:40.510> of

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
end of

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.530 
end of
you<00:04:41.710> know<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:41.830> think<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:42.250> transition<00:04:42.850> should

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
you know I think the transition should

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.760 
you know I think the transition should
be<00:04:43.630> easy<00:04:43.810> for<00:04:44.080> him<00:04:44.140> because<00:04:44.350> he's<00:04:44.530> so<00:04:44.650> athletic

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
be easy for him because he's so athletic

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.410 
be easy for him because he's so athletic
you<00:04:45.460> know<00:04:45.550> that's<00:04:45.730> one<00:04:45.910> thing<00:04:46.060> that<00:04:46.120> drew<00:04:46.390> us

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
you know that's one thing that drew us

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.970 
you know that's one thing that drew us
to<00:04:46.690> him<00:04:46.720> was<00:04:46.900> his<00:04:46.990> athleticism<00:04:47.500> when<00:04:47.920> you

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
to him was his athleticism when you

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.500 
to him was his athleticism when you
watch<00:04:48.130> him<00:04:48.160> work<00:04:48.430> out<00:04:48.640> he's<00:04:48.790> got<00:04:48.940> smooth<00:04:49.240> hips

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
watch him work out he's got smooth hips

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.320 
watch him work out he's got smooth hips
and<00:04:49.720> very<00:04:50.230> good<00:04:50.410> athlete<00:04:50.530> fluid<00:04:51.100> you<00:04:52.060> know<00:04:52.180> he

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
and very good athlete fluid you know he

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.760 
and very good athlete fluid you know he
can<00:04:52.660> drop<00:04:52.870> into<00:04:53.020> coverage<00:04:53.110> he<00:04:53.440> caught<00:04:53.620> the

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
can drop into coverage he caught the

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.070 
can drop into coverage he caught the
ball<00:04:53.800> like<00:04:54.190> a<00:04:54.220> tight<00:04:54.490> end<00:04:54.730> at<00:04:55.270> his<00:04:55.390> pro<00:04:55.600> day<00:04:55.630> you

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
ball like a tight end at his pro day you

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.020 
ball like a tight end at his pro day you
know<00:04:56.170> very<00:04:56.380> athletic<00:04:56.920> so<00:04:56.950> I<00:04:57.310> don't<00:04:57.880> think

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
know very athletic so I don't think

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.880
