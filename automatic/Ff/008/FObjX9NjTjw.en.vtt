00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.160

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.990
 do not forget that the adrenaline team and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.560
 ultimate sniper sniper only then 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.080
 low Scots I not have the trouble 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.510
 to apply here is our there are some 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.079
 conditions to enter the team so 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.700
 the primary conditions already that because 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.460
 in fact in the team we are looking for 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.989
 players and editors but already I 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.440
 talked about the general conditions for 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.879
 everybody 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:53.690
 publisher and players as a condition 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:57.719
 general you must be at least 15 years old 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.090
 so I mean 15 years minimum and 1.1 to 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.039
 what we set to get into the shoot 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.199
 simply 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.420
 after this type is going to the Caribbean is not 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.189
 mature it's really mature people 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.700
 we are still looking for it and you 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.200
 will not be accepting in the focused 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.200
 general conditions rather be mature 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.000
 second general position have a 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.390
 acquisition box 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.580
 whether you are a player or publishers we 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.140
 must be a case the 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.410
 division and third general condition 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.920
 which will be very important as it is 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.440
 to have skype skype is very important 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.280
 simply to send 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.970
 files etc 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.360
 my agent told me about the conditions 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:51.140
 Recruitment for paying for 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.020
 players so for the players we have to 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.370
 a microphone to communicate when this 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.270
 communist between us during the 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.160
 parties and it's always good 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.020
 obviously have to have a case 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.370
 acquisition so I did not specify 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.790
 half who are what am I hearing 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.369
 over there 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:16.460
 and to quote the best known all 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:18.320
 simply hd pvr el gato of the blind 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.060
 at the quiz you can also have 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.800
 green do not have to have an age 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.570
 of green light if you have one so much 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:29.060
 better but you do not have to 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:31.340
 to have an acquisition box that 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.750
 finally go who's filming in HD who 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.640
 capture naters is not required 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.450
 the theule any case compulsory made of in 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.000
 have one continue for the players this 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.970
 which is mandatory to see call of duty 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.390
 a wasla warfare 2 call of duty 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.000
 mona par 3 and call of duty black blue 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.950
 So there it is similar only is fixed 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.350
 these three cases the goal he therefore yielded 4.3 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.840
 quality that make it more accessible for 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.840
 all and snipe so if you have two 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.150
 call of duty is good but it 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.980
 must have preferably these three there 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.090
 after you have to have 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.860
 new reasonable for sniper or of 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.299
 Anyway bossa test before 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.849
 get into the team like 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.870
 in most of the team now and 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.640
 you will be tested before returning there 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.710
 must also a very important thing is going 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.060
 be 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.010
 often available so what is that 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.900
 I call to support his parents 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.290
 send a really hot message one on 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.680
 do not really know how to be very much 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.200
 connected to several times in the 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.370
 week 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.050
 because being that we were only 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.820
 if you are the few us 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.070
 hold to apply anyway 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.080
 will see we'll see anyway but will 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.110
 try to be available anyway 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.090
 several times in the week 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.830
 So not good I think I 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.310
 a little spent the team always for the 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.720
 players are ready to rate very good me 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.800
 I did the morning tour we'll go 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.980
 to publishers so when publishers there 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.670
 simply have to have good 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.420
 software 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.590
 if you have our lives best me 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.680
 frankly it's not really a 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.200
 editor for research do not know 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.030
 really an editor who holds moviemaker 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.730
 early 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.220
 two programs like I do not know the gac 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.770
 etc. 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.440
 after having an acquisition box and 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.890
 yes it is also obligatory for you 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.690
 editor as for any player 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.590
 so here I do not specify a tessellation 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:46.610
 pda etc etc 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:49.440
 you have to show a non 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.300
 if you are in the in the 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.680
 you show a power montage of this 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.419
 that you are capable we see from what 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.290
 we were able so the montage where 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:05.560
 we would see to me then to the sowing 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:07.120
 and at all to judge our 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.949
 abilities so I also do not have any 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.870
 2 professional elite finally finally 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.780
 of publishers kind we are not fooled 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.650
 official to edit but hey I stay 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.570
 whether or not we are where we are 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.150
 and if you want if you are good now 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.889
 it's done around but I get involved 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.120
 a little paschal pasture test not 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.300
 do not make a video of three hours 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.760
 so I know the year the most the most 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.350
 quickly possible and the most accurate go to 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.560
 goal 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.760
 so that's so I think I'm doing 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.850
 all rest and zulte hours for the 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.000
 players it's good now you can 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.169
 also to be player and is reducer to do 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.310
 both 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.750
 it is something that I you 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.370
 advise not just because 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.190
 that being more publishers players so that's 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:57.280
 to say as a condition often be 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.780
 available so if you are often 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.460
 available on the console you have 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.870
 a lot less time to do 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:07.419
 your montages on your pc 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:09.250

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.830
