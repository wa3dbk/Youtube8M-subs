00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.140

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.030
 find today for a new 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.309
 zombie video on this new map 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.469
 beautiful and made of the dead of the dlc 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.699
 number 2 which is named a president who 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.219
 find themselves today for a video 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.500
 cloud tutorial released an hour ago 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.870
 of that and we end up for a video 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.059
 tutorial where I will explain 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.329
 how to activate so secret music 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.979
 of this new map which is my base 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.809
 so is I going to proceed from the same 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.420
 way that I have the cd for the last 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.460
 map of the very first dlc that the naive 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.810
 so I'm going to leave from the place where we 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.550
 stay good and I will show you the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.850
 the easiest way possible 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:19.030
 to activate this music so you have to 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.690
 know that he therefore has an item to 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.990
 infirmary 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.920
 just there an item at the docks and an item where 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.840
 we are so we start here so it's 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.819
 here where we stay good and it will take 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.750
 about 5000 so you can activate 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.179
 this music 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.440
 so we take the main path on 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.180
 arrives in the very first room and 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.310
 so we get this bottle of 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.960
 whiskey so you have to know that the items 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.840
 to recover on this new map does not 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.520
 are not cubs but many 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.799
 bottles of water if we go up 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.020
 on the second floor where lee slipped 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.000
 street so not at first I specify 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.950
 well in the second we will go to the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.420
 left take the path where there is 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.350
 all the new cherished electric asset 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.820
 just go on we'll take the 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.920
 corridor we are going to land so in 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.840
 the infirmary will send him something called 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.269
 Theriault take right then to 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.790
 left the interests in a kind of 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.370
 room because the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.719
 then we continue we go in the 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.790
 room opposite we will land in a 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.829
 bathroom then we will take the room 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.049
 right and there on a table metallica 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.400
 beauty night owls years there will be the 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.530
 second where lots here then it 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.420
 So just go the other way 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.400
 up to the all electric darling so there 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.390
 we go back 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.970
 you have to be careful not to 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.739
 fall out otherwise there is no way of 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.189
 come back to nothing except if we pay a 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.079
 door 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.510
 then we take a left at the very 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.849
 electric darling it will have to be active and 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.709
 so kind of switch that does it 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.769
 to die but little that is called death 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.079
 to activate them so the nacelle that is 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.290
 right there to go to docs 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:03:03.260
 then we will be naked we will take the 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:06.019
 nacelle so we can see the garden 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.370
 does a kind of prison garden 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.480
 so the docks are pretty easy to 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.730
 spot people takes the basket and 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.250
 and then when there is a point of reference 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.700
 for this third item we will take this 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.620
 FARC 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:23.760
 so we go down to the lighthouse is there 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.879
 in the lighthouse alley right here by getting 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.040
 placing the end of the aisle so there we 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.260
 end of the aisle we see that there is a 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.019
 door closed and just behind this 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.409
 piece there is the last bottle of 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.449
 whiskey 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.010
 so here I hope this video 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:40.260
 tutorial will help you activate this 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.669
 music that the video will have pleased you in 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.250
