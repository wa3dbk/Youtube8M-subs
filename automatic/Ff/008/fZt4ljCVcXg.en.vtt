00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.490
 Cameron and 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.880
 I did not think that my father was not in the spirit of West Papua so far 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.880
 to discover something unknown 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.050
 Berner newspaper 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.730
 Well he knows 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.030
 it's about 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.690
 which values ​​actually count 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.080
 around 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.080
 what does life mean to something 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.600
 we put r 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 and at least everyone thinks that makes our own lives question it 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.630
 meaning at all Dietmar Hoffmann goes work is coming out of the house 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.520
 you're done on vacation 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.640
 to clean up for a bit 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.140
 but often to clean the wandering e-business of the work for stands 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.990
 and included per bus is a weird runner so if you are now 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.500
 Coming here is a question of buses but that is different and is in 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.930
 % of life is yes percent increase 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.930
 that makes you think twice without turning your movie 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:56.819
 to 13 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.819
 you stand 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.799
 Berlin 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.150
 As a person as I have met you, you have your own world 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.369
 describes s 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:17.769
 is for me someone who had a very special childhood 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:22.539
 that was the intention of the mother of the tourist 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:25.799
 to give her children the most beautiful childhood she can think of 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:30.089
 Untersendling grew up in a world that we all do not know 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.580
 that makes you enrich that makes you say that makes you one 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.579
 special and very complex and very smart girls 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.639
 ours with this solitude but also wealth still wandering them today 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:42.989
 through the world 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.329
 US 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.329
 St 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.019
 St 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.689
 by 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.689
 8th 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:08.029
 Lehmann 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:11.029
 I love the 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:18.689
 here is 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.400
 to 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.039
 4 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.039
 dpa 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.479
 once awarded 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.770
 clear 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.770
 Hansa Rostock 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.849
 No coincidence with that, of course, as a witness 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.530
 Filmmaker but also as a spectator not Jana, so to speak, their stories 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.750
 I think a stranger to me on the line one 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.520
 something 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.120
 A fascinating thing is that it has to do with being those worlds 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.020
 other shows will not know getting stressed 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.590
 so it's very exciting to read the book and to know that we ourselves 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.770
 has just experienced growing up with the tribe yet 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.650
 or was discovered 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.830
 and then of course, but the meeting of the cultures so our culture so what 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.720
 we have learned what good and bad food we have to give and then 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.930
 Of course, what she experiences there and that's what we drive as a spectator 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:09.669
 The life 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.319
 who just other countries other customs so completely 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:15.150
 Rules give life to those same question life 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.180
 and that's exciting, but in the end I think so 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.300
 question yourself and say south side right way is it right 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.259
 as well as thinking is right what we think 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:26.259
 So in the end, that's the exciting thing about them 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.349
 No 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:41.499
 like 

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:44.499
 like 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:48.289
 s 

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:57.999
 the son should learn adults very much 

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:04.839
 the next seats 

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:06.240
 the fishermen 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.449
 image 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:10.569
 alone 

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:12.600
 a first instance had denied this 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.820
 We can not from today to tomorrow a new team give new impetus to tomorrow 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.820
 a real one makes it clear that we go very far 

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:36.529
 So far, the Left is rejecting a deal hence the whole life 

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:46.569
 There is life in Berlin 

00:07:46.569 --> 00:07:47.189
 Hello
