00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.850
 interior 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:40.310
 We're going to the city to town. 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:51.320
 in case you are in the city 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:53.000
 the city came to the south south city and river 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.290
 great northern 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:03.550
 the galley each point of that is a network 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:09.519
 wifi in your city 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:12.500
 green dots means that those that 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:17.870
 will fail released 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:23.440
 An example here is the cyclic chart 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:29.200
 in the free melo graph verified free 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:36.070
 francisco painters 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.070
 let's go to the red dots she was 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:46.390
 password protected space miserable 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:52.240
 explain 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:58.980
 As you can see, it 's there. 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:02.500
 the password is 8421 or isa 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.040
 there is no secret already the points that are 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.050
 so half of the green mud and red 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.610
 This is because the application does not 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.350
 could identify 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:19.019
 we go here in another the wifi 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.019

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:35.520
 Let's see if the bar is here. 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.520
 It's always easy.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:47.470
 very simple is this protected wifi network 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:57.190
 but this app is very efficient 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:05:01.150
 He can tell you the password and that's it. 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.820
 Very easy galley is not 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.000
 this app has another function here 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.450
 But that will be there for another to 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.800

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:18.910
