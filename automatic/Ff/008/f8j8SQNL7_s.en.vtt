00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.200
 well I'll show you how they are made 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.180
 bright ones for fishing very 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.470
 economic and they look very good in the 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.470
 night 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.470
 look at a restaurant toilet 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.380
 as you can see the rod that holds 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.240
 the line are the lazio pendants with 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.800
 umbrella rods 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.800
 settle the oxiden 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.830
 they are from artÃ  penalties 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.260
 with a led soldier directly very 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.880
 important that the color of the led be the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.880
 same as the plug 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.330
 it gets 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.770
 yes I can 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.870
 the other pile 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.770
 it means lynette 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.430
 the program what is like that or melt it and 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.750
 get inside against people are the 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:11.560
 350 grams 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:14.920
 we will put the porta that inside 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.040
 to the deodorant ball and in fact a 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.040
 hole 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.859
 which we put the led inside 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.369
 Y 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.369
 we put the stopper 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.050
 and now I'm going to turn off the light so that 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.250
 you can see it well forgive for the hobby 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.250
 from the camera 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.410
 Many 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.020
 you have already done this kind of luminous 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.830
 but for those who are starting 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.830
 I hope you have been helpful 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.110
 the truth with two stacks of double to one 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:26.200
 side and a battery holder 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.629
 it really seems to be a luminous 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.690
 of autonomy has I was fishing 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.370
 up to a whole week during all 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.460
 the nights 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.690
 german aus
