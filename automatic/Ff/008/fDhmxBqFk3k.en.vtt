00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
and Bowser I just previously driven by

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.260 
and Bowser I just previously driven by
the<00:00:37.980> camera<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.579> know<00:00:38.730> he's<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> game

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
the camera so we know he's in the game

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.330 
the camera so we know he's in the game
as<00:00:39.329> well<00:00:39.809> now<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:40.649> more<00:00:40.920> interesting<00:00:41.129> is

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
as well now it's more interesting is

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.069 
as well now it's more interesting is
that<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.670> background<00:00:41.969> there<00:00:42.570> are<00:00:42.690> two

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
that in the background there are two

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.590 
that in the background there are two
towers<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.070> goombahs<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:44.940> perhaps<00:00:45.180> we<00:00:45.420> can<00:00:45.539> see

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
towers of goombahs so perhaps we can see

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.229 
towers of goombahs so perhaps we can see
some<00:00:45.950> road<00:00:46.950> hazards<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.850> tracks<00:00:48.120> you

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
some road hazards on the tracks you

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.000 
some road hazards on the tracks you
might<00:00:48.390> want<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> watch<00:00:48.690> out<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:48.930> those<00:00:49.230> all

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
might want to watch out for those all

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.410 
might want to watch out for those all
right<00:00:50.190> move<00:00:50.430> for<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.670> little<00:00:50.789> bit<00:00:50.910> more<00:00:51.149> and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
right move for a little bit more and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.950 
right move for a little bit more and
right<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.590> see<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.039> Wario<00:00:53.660> DK<00:00:54.660> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
right here you can see that Wario DK and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.529 
right here you can see that Wario DK and
Yoshi<00:00:55.620> are<00:00:56.070> all<00:00:56.250> confirmed<00:00:56.520> as<00:00:57.059> playable

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
Yoshi are all confirmed as playable

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
characters as well and again moving ever

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.819 
characters as well and again moving ever
so<00:01:00.570> slightly<00:01:00.960> forward<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.500> see<00:01:01.710> that

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
so slightly forward we can see that

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.520 
so slightly forward we can see that
toadette<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.660> waluigi<00:01:03.660> are<00:01:03.780> also<00:01:03.989> confirmed

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
toadette and waluigi are also confirmed

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.980 
toadette and waluigi are also confirmed

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
replayable so already this game is quite

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.190 
replayable so already this game is quite
a<00:01:07.020> large<00:01:07.409> roster<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.280> characters<00:01:08.900> ok<00:01:09.900> enough

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
a large roster of characters ok enough

a large roster of characters ok enough
about<00:01:10.320> characters<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:11.070> now<00:01:11.220> move<00:01:11.640> forward<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
about characters for now move forward a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.370 
about characters for now move forward a
little<00:01:12.299> bit<00:01:12.420> more<00:01:12.689> you'll<00:01:12.930> notice<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.260> right

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
little bit more you'll notice that right

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.440 
little bit more you'll notice that right
here<00:01:13.680> coins<00:01:13.950> are<00:01:14.310> riddled<00:01:14.700> all<00:01:14.909> over<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
here coins are riddled all over the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.170 
here coins are riddled all over the
track<00:01:15.780> now<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.799> could<00:01:17.070> possibly<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:18.000> a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
track now this could possibly be a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.330 
track now this could possibly be a
return<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.840> mario<00:01:19.080> kart<00:01:19.290> 7<00:01:19.500> coin<00:01:19.860> mechanic

certain car combinations or bike
combinations<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.530> case<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.950> wheels

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
combinations in this case like wheels

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.899 
combinations in this case like wheels
bike<00:01:27.030> bodies<00:01:27.450> cart<00:01:27.750> bodies<00:01:28.140> or<00:01:28.320> gliders<00:01:28.909> they

bike bodies cart bodies or gliders they
also<00:01:30.090> appear<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.600> give<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.990> slight<00:01:31.770> visas

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
also appear to give you a slight visas

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.980 
also appear to give you a slight visas
when<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.850> collect<00:01:33.119> them<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.659> Mario<00:01:33.810> Kart

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.350 
when you collect them like in Mario Kart
7<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:34.860> that's<00:01:35.040> kind<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.430> hard<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.729> judge<00:01:36.150> and

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
7 but that's kind of hard to judge and

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.940 
7 but that's kind of hard to judge and
I'm<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.659> basing<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.170> off<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.500> particle

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
I'm just basing it off of the particle

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.380 
I'm just basing it off of the particle
effect<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.369> happens<00:01:38.700> when<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.000> collect

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
effect that happens when you collect

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.749 
effect that happens when you collect
those<00:01:39.720> coins<00:01:40.140> now<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.189> look<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.549> very

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
those coins now if you look in the very

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.910 
those coins now if you look in the very
back<00:01:42.090> round<00:01:42.479> you'll<00:01:42.689> notice<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.500> track

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
back round you'll notice that this track

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.940 
back round you'll notice that this track
goes<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:44.939> at<00:01:45.090> almost<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.540> 90-degree<00:01:46.350> angles<00:01:46.799> so

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
goes up at almost a 90-degree angles so

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.950 
goes up at almost a 90-degree angles so
we<00:01:47.040> might<00:01:47.340> see<00:01:47.520> some<00:01:47.549> anti-gravity<00:01:48.540> segments

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
we might see some anti-gravity segments

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.710 
we might see some anti-gravity segments
in<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.350> Mario<00:01:49.799> circuit<00:01:50.189> looking<00:01:51.180> stage<00:01:51.509> so
