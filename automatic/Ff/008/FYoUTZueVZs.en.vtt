drummers<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.579> they<00:00:59.760> have<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> lot<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.660> hard

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
drummers and they have a lot of hard

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.170 
drummers and they have a lot of hard
work<00:01:01.290> to<00:01:01.769> do<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.129> they're<00:01:02.760> doing<00:01:03.000> brilliantly

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
work to do and they're doing brilliantly

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.240 
work to do and they're doing brilliantly
actually<00:01:03.780> we've<00:01:03.960> done<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.199> lot<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.650> hard<00:01:04.890> work<00:01:04.949> I

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
actually we've done a lot of hard work I

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.130 
actually we've done a lot of hard work I
think<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.700> going<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.119> get<00:01:06.540> also<00:01:06.720> easier

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
think it's going to get also easier

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.990 
think it's going to get also easier
because<00:01:07.409> people<00:01:07.680> need<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.070> used<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
because people need to get used to the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.050 
because people need to get used to the
way<00:01:09.149> things<00:01:09.180> work<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.610> we<00:01:11.610> are<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:11.850> very

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
way things work and we are all very

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:21.880 
way things work and we are all very
