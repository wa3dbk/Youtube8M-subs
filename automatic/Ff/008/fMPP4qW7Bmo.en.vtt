00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
about a week of having him there and i'm

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.810 
about a week of having him there and i'm
using<00:01:06.240> Flipboard<00:01:06.750> stead<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.650> blinkfeed<00:01:08.130> which

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
using Flipboard stead of blinkfeed which

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.149 
using Flipboard stead of blinkfeed which
is<00:01:09.000> kind<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.390> same<00:01:09.570> idea<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.650> blank<00:01:10.950> feed

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
one's called glove box and so let's say

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.670 
one's called glove box and so let's say
you're<00:01:42.360> using<00:01:42.600> an<00:01:42.780> application<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.500> just

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
want to have their so you just go to

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.990 
want to have their so you just go to
whatever<00:01:53.729> app<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.149> want<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:55.610> i<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.820> the

whatever app you want to and i have the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.670 
whatever app you want to and i have the
free<00:01:57.180> version<00:01:57.360> which<00:01:57.780> i<00:01:57.930> think<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.560> can

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
free version which i think it you can

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.200 
free version which i think it you can
only<00:01:58.799> put<00:01:59.070> four<00:01:59.280> apps<00:01:59.460> on<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.729> side<00:01:59.909> which<00:02:00.090> i

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
only put four apps on the side which i

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.420 
only put four apps on the side which i
think<00:02:00.270> they're<00:02:00.630> enough<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:02.219> comes

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
think they're enough so that that comes

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.270 
think they're enough so that that comes
really<00:02:02.670> handy<00:02:02.759> when<00:02:03.750> when<00:02:04.680> I'm<00:02:04.829> trying<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.100> go

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
really handy when when I'm trying to go

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.180 
really handy when when I'm trying to go
when<00:02:06.149> I'm<00:02:06.270> trying<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.570> be<00:02:06.659> quick<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.649> really

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
when I'm trying to be quick so really

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.369 
when I'm trying to be quick so really
nice<00:02:08.340> shortcut<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.119> doesn't<00:02:09.840> come<00:02:10.289> up

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
nice shortcut and it doesn't come up

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.530 
nice shortcut and it doesn't come up
from<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.649> bottom<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.520> don't<00:02:12.239> have<00:02:12.300> any

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
from the bottom so you don't have any

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.910 
from the bottom so you don't have any
problem<00:02:12.900> swiping

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
problem swiping

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.620 
problem swiping
so<00:02:14.099> if<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.370> do<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.610> has<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:14.940> be<00:02:15.030> on<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.180> top<00:02:15.390> and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
so if you do it has to be on the top and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.690 
so if you do it has to be on the top and
that's<00:02:16.140> just<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.650> really<00:02:17.310> good<00:02:17.459> thing<00:02:17.490> to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
that's just a really good thing to

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.510 
that's just a really good thing to
developer<00:02:18.239> thought<00:02:19.020> about<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:20.130> second

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
developer thought about and the second

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.000 
developer thought about and the second
one<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:21.150> weight<00:02:21.510> control<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:22.709> go<00:02:22.950> to

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
one is weight control so you just go to

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.820 
one is weight control so you just go to
the<00:02:23.160> app<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.340> just<00:02:24.060> exit<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.630> out<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.709> going

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
the app and just exit it out it is going

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.979 
the app and just exit it out it is going
to<00:02:25.920> save<00:02:26.099> weight<00:02:26.280> control<00:02:26.459> turn<00:02:27.420> onto<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.780> top

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
to save weight control turn onto the top

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.100 
to save weight control turn onto the top
and<00:02:28.250> basically<00:02:29.250> what<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.640> do<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:30.540> sensor

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
and basically what you do is the sensor

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.590 
and basically what you do is the sensor
getting<00:02:31.650> heavier<00:02:31.980> on<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.610> top<00:02:32.819> is<00:02:33.060> always<00:02:33.420> on

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
getting heavier on the top is always on

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.140 
getting heavier on the top is always on
and<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.950> can<00:02:35.130> control<00:02:35.489> your<00:02:35.640> music<00:02:35.819> from

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
and you can control your music from

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.610 
and you can control your music from
there<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.569> I'm<00:02:36.810> going<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.020> go<00:02:37.140> ahead<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.380> put

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
there so I'm going to go ahead and put

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.559 
there so I'm going to go ahead and put
the<00:02:38.400> phone<00:02:38.580> aside<00:02:38.819> so<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.090> can<00:02:39.270> see<00:02:39.390> what<00:02:39.510> I'm

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.759 
the phone aside so you can see what I'm
doing<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:39.900> I'm<00:02:39.989> going<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.170> put<00:02:40.230> my<00:02:40.350> finger<00:02:40.470> in

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
doing so I'm going to put my finger in

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.130 
doing so I'm going to put my finger in
from<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.100> sensor<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:42.180> take<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.510> off<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.840> my

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.430 
from the sensor and take it off and my
music<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.590> gonna<00:02:43.739> be<00:02:43.800> turned<00:02:44.010> on<00:02:44.130> now<00:02:45.440> it

top<00:02:52.920> I'm<00:02:53.069> going<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.310> pause<00:02:53.459> it<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:55.080> by<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.319> way

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
top I'm going to pause it and by the way

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.490
