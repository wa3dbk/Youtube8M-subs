wanted the subframe repair and
reinforcement<00:00:30.869> process<00:00:31.410> carried<00:00:31.739> out<00:00:31.860> and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
reinforcement process carried out and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.250 
reinforcement process carried out and
once<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.239> inspected<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.020> could<00:00:34.170> obviously

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
once we inspected it we could obviously

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.640 
once we inspected it we could obviously
clearly<00:00:34.710> see<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.370> far<00:00:35.580> beyond<00:00:35.940> repair

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
clearly see that it's far beyond repair

extremely broken up and damaged and this

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.500 
extremely broken up and damaged and this
is<00:00:40.170> first<00:00:40.440> time<00:00:40.680> we've<00:00:41.430> we've<00:00:42.150> had<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> chance

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
is first time we've we've had a chance

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.200 
is first time we've we've had a chance
to<00:00:42.870> take<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:43.740> subframe<00:00:44.040> down<00:00:44.400> subsequently

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
to take the subframe down subsequently

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.270 
to take the subframe down subsequently
we<00:00:45.510> bought<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> car<00:00:45.960> off<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.290> customer<00:00:47.070> for

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
we bought the car off the customer for

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.270 
we bought the car off the customer for
spares<00:00:47.730> repairs<00:00:48.150> for<00:00:48.420> obvious<00:00:48.810> reasons<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:50.070> it

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
spares repairs for obvious reasons as it

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.130 
spares repairs for obvious reasons as it
no<00:00:50.520> longer<00:00:50.820> wants<00:00:51.060> to<00:00:51.090> continue<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.930> it

no longer wants to continue with this it
was<00:00:52.200> on<00:00:52.380> viable<00:00:52.829> repair<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:54.210> it's<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.390> first

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
was on viable repair and it's the first

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.090 
was on viable repair and it's the first
time<00:00:54.810> since<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:55.260> we've<00:00:55.440> had<00:00:55.470> chance<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> take

the<00:00:56.190> subframe<00:00:56.489> off<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:58.140> actually

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the subframe off and and actually

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
the subframe off and and actually
inspect<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.130> and<00:00:59.460> see<00:01:00.020> how<00:01:01.160> shockingly<00:01:02.160> bad

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
decent amount of problems however if we

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.260 
decent amount of problems however if we

outside of our plate area we wouldn't

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
in this extreme this is why we also do

and<00:03:24.100> then<00:03:24.220> probably<00:03:24.579> the<00:03:24.700> most<00:03:25.049> interesting

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
and then probably the most interesting

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
bit out of this whole thing is the we've

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.789 
bit out of this whole thing is the we've
got<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.480> exhaust<00:03:28.690> on<00:03:28.900> normally<00:03:29.319> we<00:03:29.500> take<00:03:29.680> the

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
got the exhaust on normally we take the

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.789 
got the exhaust on normally we take the
exhaust<00:03:30.130> system<00:03:30.310> off<00:03:30.640> completely<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.799> we

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
exhaust system off completely and we

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.289 
exhaust system off completely and we

shield<00:03:34.540> like<00:03:34.690> this<00:03:34.840> but<00:03:35.079> like<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:35.230> said<00:03:35.440> because

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
shield like this but like I said because

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.590 
shield like this but like I said because
it's<00:03:35.890> one<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.069> our<00:03:36.280> cars<00:03:36.519> we've<00:03:36.819> purchased<00:03:37.120> for

off in sections and pieces for various
reasons<00:03:43.930> but<00:03:44.049> technically<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.250> only<00:03:45.430> thing

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
carrier panel together is the exhaust

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.780 
carrier panel together is the exhaust

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
flapping like that and landing on the

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.509 
flapping like that and landing on the
Akula<00:04:03.819> foam<00:04:04.150> here<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:05.139> that<00:04:06.040> for<00:04:06.370> that<00:04:06.459> reason

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
Akula foam here and that for that reason

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.580 
Akula foam here and that for that reason
that's<00:04:07.030> why<00:04:07.269> it's<00:04:07.630> probably<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:08.079> worst<00:04:08.319> one

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
that's why it's probably the worst one

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.009 
that's why it's probably the worst one
we've<00:04:08.920> ever<00:04:09.190> seen<00:04:09.489> and<00:04:10.090> I<00:04:10.150> can<00:04:10.329> promise<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.780> we

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
we've ever seen and I can promise you we

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.750 
we've ever seen and I can promise you we
haven't<00:04:11.170> talked<00:04:11.620> or<00:04:11.829> pulled<00:04:12.100> that<00:04:12.250> in<00:04:12.430> any<00:04:12.579> way

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
haven't talked or pulled that in any way

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.360 
haven't talked or pulled that in any way
that's<00:04:12.910> exactly<00:04:13.180> where<00:04:13.780> we<00:04:13.959> found<00:04:14.019> it<00:04:14.470> once<00:04:15.160> we

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
that's exactly where we found it once we

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.190 
that's exactly where we found it once we
unbolted<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.910> separate<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.600> floor<00:04:16.870> actually

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
unbolted to separate the floor actually

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.979 
unbolted to separate the floor actually
came<00:04:17.440> down<00:04:17.739> with<00:04:18.099> the<00:04:18.340> with<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.299> subframe<00:04:19.690> or

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
came down with the with the subframe or

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.210 
came down with the with the subframe or
the<00:04:20.109> diff<00:04:20.650> carrier<00:04:21.099> itself<00:04:21.430> so

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
the diff carrier itself so

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:35.180 
the diff carrier itself so
yeah<00:04:22.820> that<00:04:23.060> is<00:04:23.410> quite<00:04:24.410> nasty

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.250
