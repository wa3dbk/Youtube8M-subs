Eggs with Spinach

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.799
Welcome to "Mutevazi Lezzetler" Cuisine!

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.479
we are going to cook an egg meal....

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:14.759
"Eggs with Spinach"

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.239
let’s see the ingredients list...

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:19.639
then we will see how to cook it

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.679
2 bunch of spinach (about 1.10 pounds)

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:25.399
6 eggs

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:30.879
2 onions, medium size

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.319
3 tomatoes, medium size

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
1/3 cup of sunflower oil

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
1/2 tsp black pepper

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.479
and 1 tsp salt

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.519
for the upper side; 1 tsp red pepper powder

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.519
as you can notice that, the ingredients list is very short

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.519
we can see how to prepare it now

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.839
we are dicing finely...

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.119
these 2 onions

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:05.519
you will not be able to believe...

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.119
how easily we will cook this meal

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.679
we are kneading the onion pieces gently...

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:15.319
with 1/2 tsp salt to soften them

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:21.639
it is enough

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:25.159
now we are cutting...

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.079
the spinach with their stems also

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:36.879
the pieces must not be too big...

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:40.839
they must not be so small also

00:01:40.839 --> 00:01:45.399
we are adding the onions on it

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.919
as you can notice, we are using the ingredients raw

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.439
after kneading the onion with salt...

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.879
I’ve added the spinach pieces on it

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.639
now we are adding about 1/2 tsp of salt...

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.839
about 1/2 tsp black pepper...

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.119
I think that black pepper goes well with spinach

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.959
we are adding 1/3 cup of sunflower oil...

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:49.279
and grated 3 medium size tomatoes

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.639
and, mixing it a little

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.359
now I’m covering the lid of the pot...

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.799
and setting the heat to low...

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.199
I’ve not added water at all

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:22.519
I’m keeping on cooking for about 20 minutes

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.359
the 20 minutes of cooking time is over now...

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:31.279
now we can remove the lid of the pot....

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.399
as you can see, the volume of the ingredients is decreased and it is more juicy

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:41.039
now we are making 6 holes...

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:43.439
for our 6 eggs

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:47.479
I’ll break the eggs into these holes

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.799
we are not boiling it...

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.839
to keep the iron it...

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:04.839
spinach keeps its all minerals and vitamins...

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:06.399
it seems nice

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:12.759
and easy to cook also

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.959
now, if you want, you can add pepper powder, crushed red pepper...

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:38.959
black pepper or other spices...

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:41.159
or you do not add any spices...

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.719
I’m just sprinkling pepper powder to colorize the meal...

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.719
I’m covering the lid again...

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:50.759
you can cook it, until it reaches to your favorite consistency

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:56.319
the meal has reached the consistency, which I want

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.959
now, we can serve it

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:01.879
at this episode...

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.000
we have cooked an easy egg meal...

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.959
please do not boil the spinach while cooking you meals....

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:09.079
even while cooking boreks, or buns...

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:11.039
or while cooking an egg meal...

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.839
use it by this method...

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:14.919
because, by this method, you can keep the vitamins and minerals

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.199
Bon Appetite! Afiyet Olsun!
