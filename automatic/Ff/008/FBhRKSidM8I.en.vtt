00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 today I will show you how to live a fps in 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:09.960
 virtual reality all you need 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:12.450
 is an oculus lift a hydra rocket is a 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.349
 storage compartment to attach to the chest 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.349
 let's see why 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:29.750
 I would say that they can even jump you to 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:32.079
 save yourself the setup part ok us 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.079
 we are 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.090
 as you can see it takes advantage of all the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.489
 body and not just tracking 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.220
 of occlusion for this favors a 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.229
 gameplay that doesn't call you 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.150
 being as it happened with only one 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.880
 head rotation indeed offers 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.650
 a virtual reality experience indeed 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.300
 faithful and fun I can also a 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.850
 aim gun animator blow the 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.310
 our stamp was even if it fails to 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.360
 make the idea that you are not 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.860
 seeing in stereo view like me 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.090
 anyway, it's cool, it's cool 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.090
 really crazy about the experience 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.610
 ok 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.820
 I said 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:01.369
 we can't go 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.369
 the sound of bamba puppies 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.200
 as can be seen quietly 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.880
 guys to enable it all 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.980
 quiet the gun as it was 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.980
 a real one, however, that this is how I am 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.030
 to the curtains 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.110
 I guess I didn't have to 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.830
 if still someone on the text 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.830
 where are you 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.730
 here is a bit of lead 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.730
 ok bertolini still that sucks 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.510
 from the door the grenade fight 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.100
 what for tanning so much 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.970
 we go there 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.240
 and then all the counters 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.720
 definitely not only can they be 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.720
 potential 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.990
 ok we're guys anyway 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.940
 the impression of being in the game is 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.950
 really so much I really hope that 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.510
 this technology can become the 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.150
 as soon as possible within everyone's reach 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.190
 why have virtual reality like that 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:46.310
 quietly at home is 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:46.310
 really something spectacular and come on 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:53.420
 very low the wall 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.420
 then, there is 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.840
 I want so much 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.840
 it is you 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.860
 6 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.690
 then no gentlemen 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.340
 out 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.340
 prori dies 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.870
 oh God 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.620
 I know yes 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.220
 the blood 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.220
 and now 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.970
 shields 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.910
 how are you 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.240
 to yesterday 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.210
 in dogs 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.980
 yes but never ending 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.680
 I hope so 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.100
 and you who you are 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.100
 with the most thing 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.080
 a norm 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.510
 but 9 rim a roma in the others 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.510
 heck 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.920
 ahi ahi ahi ahi ahi ahi ahi 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.090
 already 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:55.009
 ahi ahi always has too much if he is his own 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.009
 say children are children of profit 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.720
 ice core and I also made the point e 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.120
 julio personal record 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:09.060
 my very Italian record score 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:10.290
 I must say how what or gentlemen is 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.830
 an experience this was 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.810
 actually a very basic thing 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.960
 regarding virtual reality 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.160
 guys who tell you not the next gen 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:25.290
 will be done with checks and 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:27.750
 conventional but will be the vr ie viewers 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:30.210
 like the cruze lift and controller like 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.830
 the hydra although it will surely come 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.680
 something better because it is not 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.720
 very natural to put as you have seen 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.370
 one of the two controllers leaning against 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.530
 chest to indicate precisely where it is 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.650
 find the person in fact I'm waiting 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.060
 the release of the stem sixth sense which 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.730
 should have precisely the controllers for 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.760
 hands one for the chest that is tied 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.720
 in a special way and for the feet and 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.130
 obviously everything should be 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.150
 wireless because you have the how you have it 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.430
 seen 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.040
 there are cables for everything from kids 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.470
 if you want other videos of this type in 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.940
 to which I show you these attempts 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:06.960
 that you are doing virtual reality 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.480
 which I assure you are truly hallucinating 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.380
 just tell me in the comments and 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.690
 guys do see that actually 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.970
 this is the real ex gene non riva rework 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.770
 docs or other games that will start that are 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.350
 always the usual propinates you were propinated 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.510
 and passed off as good guys next 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.620
 I have nothing else to say a greeting to you 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.860
 see you next time 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.860
 Hello 

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:45.479
 much
