00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.630
 that faith not June when you stay 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.860
 has to be in maxi let go on the 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.400
 brake and it will appear or need 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.610
 it is to that light that appeared in the 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.160
 wedge brake that then allows you to pass 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.920
 the change 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.420
 If you do not have to defend the truck 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.740
 once you accelerate and release the 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.900
 clutch changes that are alone and 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.620
 still walking the deactivated towns 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.120
 again that did not work with the maxi 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.120
 pulled 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.580
 in the horn there was by agostino 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.960
 girls and for the air horn 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.150
 this is the cases 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.230
 this is the air velocity that is the 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:55.260
 direction of the air and the temperature of the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.670
 air if you squeeze it and this air 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.420
 inside or outside 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.770
 enter here recirculates only the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.500
 inside but here is the acr and the abs 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.480
 these serve only to deactivate 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.640
 not to activate either of these two 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:17.040
 controls the acr is for when the truck 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.490
 start skating 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.500
 and let it go 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.729
 then the revolutions or the 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.630
 caixa and it does not allow you to change 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.119
 skates if you do it you will be 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.820
 greater that more do not accelerate more will continue 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.310
 pulling more is going to skate joel to be 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.799
 reactivated and even if you do not change them 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.650
 it does not accelerate, on the contrary, they go down 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.220
 about revolutions 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.570
 this is the take force and it is activated and 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.780
 always deactivates with the state and with 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:54.460
 again with the maxi thrown this the air 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.110
 conditioning deactivated and activated already 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.990
 here are the balance with the changes I 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.690
 was this button is to pass 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.510
 always the first change now if you 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.760
 you want to pass for example you changes 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:12.170
 I kept it tight and you're going 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.720
 the changes you make and for this button 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.350
 from here 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.820
 the entitled right is that of the neutral 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.740
 every time you want to move to neutral 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.640
 you have to keep it tight come 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:27.040
 well used either the key that 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.870
 be here to see if he knows 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.930
 this key 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.170
 is the change mode look 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.709
 we will go up this is the middle 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.620
 change that there is then if you want 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.230
 get out in the truck you have to improve 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.939
 always change first each time 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.000
 you bend forward tighten the 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.709
 button and duties for the front of the joystick 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.109
 and automatically starts flashing the 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.659
 second because it will always leave the 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.450
 second if you want to go out first 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:02.269
 again press the button and the east 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.519
 back this will be in the first long 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.400
 if you do not do it like that if you only 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.120
 you stretch the me and have two is going to happen 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.400
 first short looks 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.400
 and there you think the clutch 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.909
 and stop blinking and change the change 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.950
 past 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.870
 You heard a whistle every time the whistle 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.159
 it sounds like you can release the 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.739
 clutch and now to pass the march 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:31.739
 back is with the man button everything and the 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.050
 joystick back and look and start to 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.930
 fail final 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.600
 and always with the button pressed you 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:43.510
 you have to step on the clutch and change 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.510
 gone and now a lot 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.420
 and that's all now that the steering wheel 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.569
 that these are the books for the 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.180
 computer and to go looking for a house and here 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.360
 has the theme of the volume of the 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.120
 radio and these do not work because this 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.360
 radio do not bring bluetooth that more I'm going 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.599
 to explain so far that new 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.599
 fire 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.299
 to this the first one is a blocker and the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.519
 second is troubadour if one day the 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.940
 truck you skid you activate it in the 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.670
 first position 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.830
 and that allows you to turn 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:30.100
 and leave with the truck and until the turn 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.400
 that is going to place that drawing of this 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.289
 and there the medium was placed a little dot 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.550
 black 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:41.969
 and if it is very active and the 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.969
 employee 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.639
 and look, they put all the dots 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:52.180
 black the three and leave with the heat 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.360
 only straight could not make turn anymore 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.649
 they emerged from to avoid all crowns 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.589
 this more force to look every time you 

00:04:56.649 --> 00:05:02.050
 active is also taken strength is 

00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:04.330
 place the same drawing 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.610
 but the dot is placed below black 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:11.610
 that 6 and the change is alone 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.610
 9 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:19.629
 the revolutions fell and on the button 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.879
 the little dot disappeared when it takes 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:24.030
 strength is activated if you could not 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.030
 speed up 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.780
 and that would be all look 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.250
 fuel marker 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.250
 all speed meter 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.830
 four revolutions and the kilos of air 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:43.930
 and that yellow light that lights up is 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.930
 of the engine brake looks at a retarder 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.500
 that's the apology is the day of the clock 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:59.400
 to all 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.580
 and cried and these would be the classes with 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.660
 Julián Piña, I hope you understand 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.660
 It's me
