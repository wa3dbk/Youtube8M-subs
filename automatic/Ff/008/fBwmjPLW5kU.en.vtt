 hello fabien rose tree you are 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.629
 press officer of ducati west europe 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.639

 a new panigale can you we 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.590
 say a little more hello the new 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.320
 not legal and this is not equal 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.080
 superleggera it's a bike it's 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.710
 the ultimate panigal the most accomplished the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.080
 the more the most expensive technology 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.880
 also because with the materials to 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.029
 because of the materials with which she has 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.410
 been manufactured the design did 65 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.090
 thousand euros there will be only five hundred 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.719
 copies for the world it's already 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.629
 practically everything pre order it's 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.180
 a bike that announces enough numbers 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.870
 hallucinating kind 155 kg dry without the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.239
 177 kg liquid battery in order of 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.640
 walk for 200 horses minimum one 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:56.640
 report of 0 77 kg for a horse 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.280
 is is the use of the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 technology to sound 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.290
 the maximum with carbon titanium the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.330
 magnesium a magnesium frame 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.600
 magnesium wheels a fork of 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.280
 superbike with dice 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.370
 the fork legs cut into the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.090
 mass 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.190
 piece of 52 m super full ring 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.100
 things derived from the competition has for 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.630
 to better illustrate what the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.700
 competition and technology from 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.830
 the competition is illustrated also this 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.840
 that what we can do what we do 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.790
 can have in performance with with a 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.200
 technology like that you talk to us 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.480
 agreed a competition is what we 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.190
 ali will panic during superleggera 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.160
 and see some superbike next year 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.110
 or not then no what we have the 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.370
 version r which is already a sentence she 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.520
 is very accomplished which is used to 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.860
 the global homologation and this one of 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.340
 anyway will only be made 500 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.950
 copies 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.650
 so it's a bike that can not 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.230
 get back in whose regulation superbike 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.550
 because you need more in production 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.320
 here we are next to the second 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.580
 novelty that ducati presents on this 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.580
 living room with my 2013 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.110
 it seems like a monster yes 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.510
 absolutely it's a brand new monster 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.340
 big engine a 1200 cm 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:15.910
 cube with the engine of 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.860
 of the former 11 98 who enslaved finally who 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.140
 serves as the motor of the multistrada and 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.420
 devil with a different timing to 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.830
 wedging in 11 degrees it's a whole 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.410
 new motorcycle 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.260
 a little redraw completely new 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.660
 with a motor carrying elements 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.870
 quite noble an embedded electronics 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.820
 pretty important enough everything we 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.860
 can find a not matched by 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.400
 example there are two versions the version 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.520
 standard 135 horses 12 bet kg and the 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.010
 version equipped with dio the INSEE of the 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.320
 carbon and other top components of 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.470
 range of this kind which she makes 145 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.470
 horses 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.160
 is there a safety easter version or 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.500
 does the decline and two sets of 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.510
 series climb on this bike then 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.180
 everything is standard sirti pack of 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.100
 put of course in addition to a last abs 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.140
 coupled with the electronic throttle 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.670
 which allows to play with and mapping and 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.010
 to have different maps 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:18.620
 these are different elements of the 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.850
 new monobloc / / / the legends 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.160
 different on the leash a little bit more 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.680
 equipped but here is a bike more 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.830
 comfort than other monsters dedicating 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.850
 a little more to audio with a tank 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.770
 which has an increased capacity 7 8 5 and a 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.530
 brand new 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.410
 monster who is born who redefines a little 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.970
 the appearance of the ounce gold when the 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.740
 French bikers will they have the chance to 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.590
 to be able to try and buy this this 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.410
 motorcycle and at what rates then try and 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.520
 buy it will not be before spring 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.290
 normally April but in the spring 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.340
 here it is not for immediately 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.440
 it's a presentation in preview 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.700
 in the Milan salon but it will happen 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.650
 must be patient 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.300
 at the price level is what you have 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.750
 already forks or is the 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.670
 rate is already defined yes then the tariff 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:11.550

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.500
