the<00:00:15.419> first<00:00:15.690> thing<00:00:15.959> you<00:00:16.109> can<00:00:16.349> do<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.430> put<00:00:17.609> in

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
the first thing you can do is to put in

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.670 
the first thing you can do is to put in
a<00:00:17.820> college<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.390> temporary<00:00:18.900> plug<00:00:19.170> which<00:00:19.439> will

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
a college in temporary plug which will

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.920 
a college in temporary plug which will
dissolve<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.279> matter<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.699> few<00:00:20.910> days<00:00:21.150> to

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
dissolve in a matter of a few days to

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.109 
dissolve in a matter of a few days to
see<00:00:22.140> whether<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.500> patient<00:00:22.980> had<00:00:23.520> any<00:00:23.789> relief

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
see whether the patient had any relief

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.540 
see whether the patient had any relief
from<00:00:24.150> their<00:00:24.539> dry<00:00:24.720> symptoms<00:00:25.500> if<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.070> want<00:00:26.250> to

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
from their dry symptoms if you want to

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.939 
from their dry symptoms if you want to
put<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.270> plugs<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.410> first<00:00:28.650> thing<00:00:28.859> you

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
put in the plugs the first thing you

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.940 
put in the plugs the first thing you
need<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.129> do<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.520> apply<00:00:30.239> an<00:00:30.360> anaesthetic<00:00:30.950> you

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
need to do is apply an anaesthetic you

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.389 
need to do is apply an anaesthetic you
then<00:00:32.279> dilates<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.510> puncture<00:00:34.230> large<00:00:35.040> enough

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
then dilates the puncture large enough

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.670 
then dilates the puncture large enough
to<00:00:35.430> take<00:00:35.879> the<00:00:36.059> plug<00:00:36.300> with<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.020> old-fashioned

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
to take the plug with the old-fashioned

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.110 
to take the plug with the old-fashioned
plugs<00:00:37.980> used<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.610> measure<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.090> size

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
plugs used to have to measure the size

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.479 
plugs used to have to measure the size
of<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.719> puncture<00:00:40.289> to<00:00:40.469> find<00:00:40.920> out<00:00:41.070> what<00:00:41.250> size

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
of the puncture to find out what size

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.970 
of the puncture to find out what size
plug<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.000> order<00:00:42.480> but<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.199> the<00:00:43.320> smart<00:00:43.710> plugs

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
plug to order but with the smart plugs

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.340 
plug to order but with the smart plugs
then<00:00:44.550> they<00:00:44.730> expand<00:00:45.210> with<00:00:45.540> body<00:00:45.750> heat<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.260> you

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
then they expand with body heat so you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.830 
then they expand with body heat so you
don't<00:00:46.530> need<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.829> worry<00:00:47.040> about<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.720> with<00:00:48.720> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
don't need to worry about that with the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.750 
don't need to worry about that with the
collagen<00:00:49.440> plugs<00:00:49.800> they're<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.460> three

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
collagen plugs they're in three

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.319 
collagen plugs they're in three
millimeters<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.540> five<00:00:52.170> millimeters<00:00:53.149> so<00:00:54.149> that

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
millimeters and five millimeters so that

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.479 
millimeters and five millimeters so that
you<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:54.720> choose<00:00:55.170> two<00:00:55.380> different<00:00:55.410> sizes<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
you can choose two different sizes and

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.460 
you can choose two different sizes and
the<00:00:57.090> patient<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.630> tell<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.079> when<00:00:58.290> you've

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
the patient can tell you when you've

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.310 
the patient can tell you when you've
applied<00:00:58.829> them<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.430> it's<00:01:00.300> successful<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.170> they

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
applied them if it's successful and they

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.999 
applied them if it's successful and they
feel<00:01:01.530> better<00:01:01.940> you<00:01:02.940> dilate<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.079> punter<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
feel better you dilate the punter and

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.719 
feel better you dilate the punter and
then<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:06.119> put<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.049> plug<00:01:07.380> when<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.340> punter

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
then you put in the plug when the punter

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.550 
then you put in the plug when the punter
is<00:01:08.880> large<00:01:09.180> enough<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.509> take<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.170> push<00:01:10.380> it

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
is large enough to take it and push it

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.620 
is large enough to take it and push it
well<00:01:10.770> down<00:01:11.040> because<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:12.000> patient<00:01:12.390> will<00:01:12.509> get

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
well down because the patient will get

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.440 
well down because the patient will get
discomfort<00:01:13.380> when<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.649> anesthetic<00:01:13.890> wears<00:01:14.790> off

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
discomfort when the anesthetic wears off

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.510 
discomfort when the anesthetic wears off
if<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:16.110> punter<00:01:16.469> is<00:01:16.619> proud<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:16.979> you'll<00:01:17.340> need

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
if the punter is proud and you'll need

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.149 
if the punter is proud and you'll need
to<00:01:17.609> push<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.030> further<00:01:18.420> down<00:01:18.719> I'm<00:01:19.709> sure<00:01:19.979> they'll

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
to push it further down I'm sure they'll

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.889 
to push it further down I'm sure they'll
be<00:01:20.219> able<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.459> tell<00:01:20.789> you<00:01:20.969> later<00:01:21.209> when<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
be able to tell you later when the

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.870 
be able to tell you later when the
anesthetic<00:01:22.139> wears<00:01:22.560> off<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.130> punter<00:01:23.520> isn't

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
anesthetic wears off if the punter isn't

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.149 
anesthetic wears off if the punter isn't
pushed<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.240> enough<00:01:24.509> some<00:01:25.319> patients<00:01:25.709> get<00:01:25.829> a<00:01:25.859> lot

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
pushed in enough some patients get a lot

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.760 
pushed in enough some patients get a lot
of<00:01:26.340> relief<00:01:26.639> from<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.119> there<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.020> however<00:01:28.319> a

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
of relief from this there is however a

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.039 
of relief from this there is however a
biofeedback<00:01:29.369> system<00:01:30.119> which<00:01:30.509> means<00:01:30.749> that<00:01:30.929> over

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
biofeedback system which means that over

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.469 
biofeedback system which means that over
a<00:01:31.200> period<00:01:31.529> of<00:01:31.770> months<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.729> possible<00:01:33.359> that

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
a period of months it's possible that

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.289 
a period of months it's possible that
they'll<00:01:33.630> produce<00:01:33.899> less<00:01:34.499> aqueous<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
they'll produce less aqueous if the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.510 
they'll produce less aqueous if the
drainage<00:01:36.600> isn't<00:01:37.079> particularly<00:01:37.679> good<00:01:37.920> but

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
drainage isn't particularly good but

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.849 
drainage isn't particularly good but
certainly<00:01:38.999> for<00:01:39.659> about<00:01:39.869> 18<00:01:40.409> months<00:01:40.560> the

certainly for about 18 months the
patients<00:01:41.249> definitely<00:01:41.819> notice<00:01:42.179> an
