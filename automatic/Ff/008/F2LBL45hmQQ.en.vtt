curve it down alright so that will be

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.440 
curve it down alright so that will be
the<00:01:35.689> base<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.930> safe<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.640> next<00:01:39.030> part<00:01:39.270> we

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the base is safe and the next part we

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.340 
the base is safe and the next part we
can<00:01:39.630> draw<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> circle<00:01:41.360> big<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.720> go<00:01:42.899> for<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.170> eyes

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
can draw a circle big so go for the eyes

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.870 
can draw a circle big so go for the eyes
start<00:01:44.540> big<00:01:45.540> circle<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.409> ice<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:47.040> think<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
start big circle for the ice I think the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.300 
start big circle for the ice I think the
pic<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.270> single<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.140> putrid<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
pic of the single the putrid and the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.060 
pic of the single the putrid and the
frat<00:01:50.549> paper<00:01:50.970> yes<00:01:51.329> okay<00:01:52.079> then<00:01:52.350> we<00:01:52.439> got<00:01:52.590> our<00:01:52.920> eye

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
frat paper yes okay then we got our eye

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.399 
frat paper yes okay then we got our eye
pupil<00:01:53.729> right<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.060> okay<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.020> know<00:01:55.229> like

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
pupil right here okay so you know like

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.660 
pupil right here okay so you know like
this<00:01:56.509> and<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.990> next<00:01:58.290> part<00:01:58.680> mixer<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.369> nine

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
this and the next part mixer this nine

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.679 
this and the next part mixer this nine
is<00:01:59.969> kind<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.390> more<00:02:01.380> down<00:02:02.180> downward<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> eye

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
is kind of more down downward in the eye

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.740 
is kind of more down downward in the eye
so<00:02:04.469> be<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.670> try<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.969> big<00:02:06.270> mouse<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.990> him

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
so be so we can try a big mouse for him

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.390 
so be so we can try a big mouse for him
people<00:02:08.200> have<00:02:09.100> a<00:02:09.130> pretty<00:02:09.729> big<00:02:10.000> mouth<00:02:11.400> things
