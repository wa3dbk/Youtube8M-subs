sharpening<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.520> chisel<00:00:05.879> you<00:00:06.870> can<00:00:07.049> see<00:00:07.259> on<00:00:07.649> the

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
sharpening a chisel you can see on the

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.270 
sharpening a chisel you can see on the
diagram<00:00:08.250> there<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.480> chisel<00:00:09.980> NASA<00:00:10.980> is

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
diagram there this is the chisel NASA is

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.180 
diagram there this is the chisel NASA is
the<00:00:11.460> grinding<00:00:11.940> edge<00:00:12.590> that<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.860> honing

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
the grinding edge that is the honing

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.380 
the grinding edge that is the honing
edge<00:00:14.309> which<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.639> much<00:00:14.820> smaller<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:17.180> you<00:00:18.180> get

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
edge which is much smaller and you get

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.480 
edge which is much smaller and you get
that<00:00:18.539> angle<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.140> obviously<00:00:19.890> rubbish<00:00:20.220> up<00:00:20.340> and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
that angle and obviously rubbish up and

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.000 
that angle and obviously rubbish up and
down<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.699> stoner<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.150> sharpen<00:00:21.619> now<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.680> show

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
down the stoner to sharpen now to show

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.529 
down the stoner to sharpen now to show
you<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.189> real<00:00:23.640> chisel<00:00:24.029> here<00:00:25.939> as<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.359> can<00:00:27.390> see

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
you a real chisel here as you can see

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.009 
you a real chisel here as you can see
it's<00:00:28.199> ground<00:00:28.560> at<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:28.980> flat<00:00:29.340> level<00:00:29.640> there<00:00:30.019> so

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
it's ground at that flat level there so

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.010 
it's ground at that flat level there so
what<00:00:31.349> after<00:00:31.769> branding<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:33.149> next<00:00:33.450> job<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.690> to

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
what after branding the next job is to

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.799 
what after branding the next job is to
rub<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.469> stone<00:00:34.680> by<00:00:34.920> hand<00:00:35.600> to<00:00:36.600> put<00:00:36.780> a

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
rub it on the stone by hand to put a

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.330 
rub it on the stone by hand to put a
sharp<00:00:37.140> edge<00:00:37.320> on<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:38.160> edge<00:00:39.320> now<00:00:40.320> there<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.309> a

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
sharp edge on the edge now there is a

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.030 
sharp edge on the edge now there is a
traditional<00:00:41.940> way<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.149> do<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.040> there's

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
traditional way to do this and there's

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.990 
traditional way to do this and there's
some<00:00:44.219> variations<00:00:44.879> which<00:00:45.030> I'll<00:00:45.180> show<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.450> now

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
some variations which I'll show you now

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.920 
some variations which I'll show you now
here's<00:00:48.000> our<00:00:48.210> stone<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> H

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
here's our stone here and this is the H

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.590 
here's our stone here and this is the H
now<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.890> can<00:00:53.340> see<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.730> quite<00:00:53.940> plain<00:00:54.210> t<00:00:54.420> that

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
now you can see the quite plain t that

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.680 
now you can see the quite plain t that
that<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> flattest<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.530> flat<00:00:55.829> surface<00:00:56.100> and

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
that is the flattest a flat surface and

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.069 
that is the flattest a flat surface and
that<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:58.109> an<00:00:58.260> edge<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.129> back<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.579> an<00:00:59.730> age

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
that is an edge and the back is an age

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.870 
that is an edge and the back is an age
well<00:01:01.520> when<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.640> rub<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> cheese<00:01:03.270> along<00:01:04.880> when

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
well when you rub the cheese along when

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.490 
well when you rub the cheese along when
you<00:01:06.000> rub<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> different<00:01:06.869> surfaces<00:01:07.350> will

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
you rub it on a different surfaces will

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.530 
you rub it on a different surfaces will
make<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> different<00:01:08.100> sound<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.299> rub<00:01:09.510> it

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
make a different sound so if you rub it

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.450 
make a different sound so if you rub it
on<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> flat<00:01:10.020> surface<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.740> will<00:01:10.920> make<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> low

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
on a flat surface it will make a low

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.149 
on a flat surface it will make a low
sound<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.750> rub<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.200> an<00:01:13.320> edge<00:01:13.530> you'll

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
sound if you rub it on an edge you'll

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.520 
sound if you rub it on an edge you'll
make<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> high<00:01:14.640> pitch<00:01:14.909> sound<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.630> that's<00:01:16.110> what

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
make a high pitch sound and that's what

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.429 
make a high pitch sound and that's what
I<00:01:16.560> was<00:01:16.770> going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> use<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:18.299> help<00:01:18.479> me<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.350> adjust

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
I was going to use to help me to adjust

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.499 
I was going to use to help me to adjust
the<00:01:19.799> chisel<00:01:20.159> supposed<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.939> sharply<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the chisel supposed to be sharply on the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:35.560 
the chisel supposed to be sharply on the
edge<00:01:22.670> now<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.479> found<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.110> flat<00:01:25.380> age

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.600 

okay<00:01:36.470> you've<00:01:36.680> heard<00:01:36.890> that<00:01:36.920> time<00:01:37.340> now<00:01:37.550> i'm

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
okay you've heard that time now i'm

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.410 

and<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.080> can<00:01:58.290> do<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.410> pig<00:01:58.650> erase<00:01:58.980> or<00:01:59.940> item<00:02:00.270> to
