picked from the tree and go direct to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.850 
picked from the tree and go direct to
the<00:01:16.380> beds<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.950> dry<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.610> produce<00:01:17.759> naturals

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
the beds to dry to produce naturals

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.260 
the beds to dry to produce naturals
the<00:01:19.860> problem<00:01:20.130> with<00:01:20.220> Naturals<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.090> don't

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the problem with Naturals is you don't

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.450 
the problem with Naturals is you don't
have<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> assistance<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.350> any<00:01:22.470> machines<00:01:23.100> to

help remove under-ripe sore defective

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.429 
help remove under-ripe sore defective
fruit<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:27.210> everything<00:01:27.689> has<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.990> be<00:01:28.110> done<00:01:28.140> by

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
fruit so everything has to be done by

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.210 
fruit so everything has to be done by
hand<00:01:29.659> in<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.780> sense<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.229> fact<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.530> hand<00:01:32.009> labor

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
hand in a sense the fact that hand labor

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.460 
hand in a sense the fact that hand labor
is<00:01:32.430> cheap<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.850> Ethiopia<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.600> something<00:01:34.020> that

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
is cheap in Ethiopia is something that

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.859 
is cheap in Ethiopia is something that
we<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:34.860> benefit<00:01:35.340> from<00:01:35.400> not<00:01:36.299> everywhere<00:01:36.689> can

we all benefit from not everywhere can

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.280 
we all benefit from not everywhere can
afford<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.320> produce<00:01:37.530> naturals<00:01:39.140> those<00:01:40.140> were

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
afford to produce naturals those were

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.929 
afford to produce naturals those were
very<00:01:40.439> fresh<00:01:40.770> cherries<00:01:41.220> from<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.579> day<00:01:41.729> before

and here's coffee cherry from several
days<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.380> drawing<00:01:46.979> still<00:01:47.549> quite<00:01:47.820> well<00:01:51.979> it's

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
days of drawing still quite well it's

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.889 
days of drawing still quite well it's
important<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.610> keep<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.090> very<00:01:54.240> thin<00:01:54.630> layer<00:01:54.869> of

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
important to keep a very thin layer of

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.980 
important to keep a very thin layer of
fruit<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.100> bed<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:58.770> rotate<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.990> but

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
fruit on the bed and to rotate it but

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.080 
fruit on the bed and to rotate it but
again<00:02:01.290> these<00:02:01.770> these<00:02:02.130> pickers<00:02:02.549> are<00:02:02.700> doing<00:02:02.969> this

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
again these these pickers are doing this

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.810 
again these these pickers are doing this
mainly<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:03.719> show<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.490> wouldn't<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.610> their

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
mainly for show this wouldn't be their

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.999 
mainly for show this wouldn't be their
normal<00:02:06.270> labor<00:02:06.509> practice<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.320> rotating<00:02:07.920> the
