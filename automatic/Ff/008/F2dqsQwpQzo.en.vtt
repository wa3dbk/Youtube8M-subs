hey guys what's going on Resort here and
in<00:00:14.480> this<00:00:14.600> video<00:00:14.750> I'm<00:00:14.990> gonna<00:00:15.110> be<00:00:15.200> showing<00:00:15.410> you

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.560 
in this video I'm gonna be showing you

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.560 
in this video I'm gonna be showing you
the<00:00:15.740> character<00:00:16.100> customization<00:00:16.460> for<00:00:17.090> GTA

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
the character customization for GTA

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.260 
the character customization for GTA
online<00:00:17.870> and<00:00:18.620> it's<00:00:19.400> kind<00:00:19.640> of<00:00:19.670> disappointing

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
online and it's kind of disappointing

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.550 
online and it's kind of disappointing
you<00:00:20.390> don't<00:00:20.570> get<00:00:20.720> that<00:00:20.930> many<00:00:21.110> features<00:00:21.350> to

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
you don't get that many features to

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.170 
you don't get that many features to
actually<00:00:22.040> customize<00:00:22.430> your<00:00:22.580> character<00:00:22.940> but<00:00:23.150> I

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
actually customize your character but I

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.929 
actually customize your character but I
guess<00:00:23.360> it's<00:00:23.540> good<00:00:23.660> enough<00:00:23.900> for<00:00:24.939> something

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
guess it's good enough for something

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.210 
guess it's good enough for something
like<00:00:26.090> GTA<00:00:26.420> online<00:00:26.600> so<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:27.619> way<00:00:27.740> you<00:00:27.830> customize

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
like GTA online so the way you customize

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.589 
like GTA online so the way you customize
your<00:00:28.369> character<00:00:28.700> first<00:00:28.910> thing<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:29.240> do<00:00:29.390> is

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
your character first thing you do is

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.810 
your character first thing you do is
pick<00:00:29.810> your<00:00:29.869> mom's<00:00:30.349> mother<00:00:30.950> and<00:00:31.250> father<00:00:31.490> and

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
pick your mom's mother and father and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.340 
pick your mom's mother and father and
then<00:00:32.270> you<00:00:32.360> pick<00:00:32.540> your<00:00:32.660> dad<00:00:32.900> so<00:00:33.079> you<00:00:33.200> don't

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
then you pick your dad so you don't

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.990 
then you pick your dad so you don't
actually<00:00:33.470> get<00:00:33.770> to<00:00:33.890> pick<00:00:34.130> what<00:00:34.310> your<00:00:34.430> character

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
actually get to pick what your character

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.730 
actually get to pick what your character
looks<00:00:35.240> like<00:00:35.420> you<00:00:35.840> have<00:00:35.930> to<00:00:36.020> pick<00:00:36.140> what<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.500> mom

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:36.740 
looks like you have to pick what the mom

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.740 
looks like you have to pick what the mom
and<00:00:36.920> dad<00:00:37.040> look<00:00:37.310> like<00:00:37.520> in<00:00:37.730> a<00:00:37.760> way<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:38.270> that's

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
and dad look like in a way and that's

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.750 
and dad look like in a way and that's
what<00:00:38.989> your<00:00:39.230> character<00:00:39.739> kind<00:00:40.430> of<00:00:40.489> looks<00:00:40.700> like

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
what your character kind of looks like

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.630
