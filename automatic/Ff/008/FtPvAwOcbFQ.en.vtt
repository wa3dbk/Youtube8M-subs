00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.189
 Gameplay in the background is today 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.320
 knock out of me does not play much 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.910
 I just wanted something for the first time 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.590
 I finally have intro appeal 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.750
 finally he gets an intro , too 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.660
 It took about three four months to get there 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.600
 it worked once and it is bold 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.280

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.820

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.329
 designer manufacturer maker of k1 and 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.550
 definitely got really fat 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.840
 I also think so the colors and the 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.149
 music chose myself 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.110
 By the way, that's a song from Quelle 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.809
 So you probably know 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.940
 That's why you can like this other one 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.530
 has something for everyone and that is just what 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.780
 Also a song of her is hot and cold too 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.619
 a link in the description and me 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.229
 find in any case really cool 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.420
 succeeded really cool succeeded well 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.270
 So it should be really cool and successful 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.560
 and yes , thank you very much and then 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.390
 I want to get started now 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.270
 Gameplay is a song on express 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.009
 played like you probably already 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.140
 was able to identify with the power so 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.590
 flexible creates fast magazine w 23 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.299
 the perks were plunderers and hardliners 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.890
 I do not know anything and the spd from 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.380
 Country 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:37.189
 yes this is my first my first loud 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.630
 been so 30 0 1 ff kerbers long 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.330
 tried at that time already before three 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.730
 months at four months 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.800
 6 months ago than me 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.330
 still uphill played 2 and has 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.790
 always do not want to work yesterday 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.620
 had on 228 suisse and then right 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.620
 happily died once by the ksg 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.810
 yes very bad I have the promise 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.360
 He just came and got me 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.540
 killed and the other was with ballista 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:07.540
 muffler team just so on 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.890
 five meters so that's it for 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.780
 gameplay was not in the relative 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.620
 Of course , I've never had a vivid picture 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.720
 played 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.610
 Contador without a lobby is a lodge and 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.240
 Two places I thought now is over 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.640
 I'm dying it's happened to me me 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.410
 see the light at the end of the tunnel oh 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.570
 nee the end of the train here and now 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.490
 Everywhere is a little fun on 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.660
 In any case, I'll be short 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.550
 I actually wanted to address 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.440
 not a real topic today but me 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.880
 wanted to say that that 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.640
 probably first time last call of 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.550
 it is courting duty because is not 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.950
 more than a long way then comes far 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.390
 ahead are only five days I think 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.790
 you're pretty much done , though 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.140
 two days to play this because 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.400
 I then a week's vacation I was 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.230
 try video in these two days 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.340
 bring with you with a part of 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.410
 gameplay though likely 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.650
 youtube will be completely overcrowded 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.480
 keep up but it does not itch me 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.400
 happy 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.410
 and yes, let's see how it works 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.870
 Holiday will be like the world looks like 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.370
 and whether that arrives at all well since 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.950
 play and so on otherwise 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.050
 I would say it was like that 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.580
 from my side i hope the gameplay 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.440
 did you like that comments on 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.269
 A little bit planned were take that 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.740
 but I have to continue right away 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.560
 therefore 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:33.010
 excuse me if I'm the usual one 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.310
 miss quality so here's mine 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.830
 first 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.840
 I am glad that I am the time 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.760
 could and that one ran as well and 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.260
