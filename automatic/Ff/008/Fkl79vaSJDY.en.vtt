00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
take off this and that's how much we

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.429 
take off this and that's how much we
have<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.500> either<00:01:22.619> side<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.880> with<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.439> it's

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
have on either side but with it it's

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.980 
have on either side but with it it's
much<00:01:25.680> better<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.150> only<00:01:27.330> thing<00:01:27.450> that's

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
much better but the only thing that's

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.160 
much better but the only thing that's
wrong<00:01:28.320> about<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.799> thing<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.990> look<00:01:30.990> at<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
wrong about this thing is look at the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.819 
wrong about this thing is look at the
edge<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:32.369> how<00:01:32.520> blurry<00:01:33.360> these<00:01:34.259> sides<00:01:34.560> are

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
edge like how blurry these sides are

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.190 
edge like how blurry these sides are
very<00:01:36.170> blurry<00:01:37.170> it's<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.979> think<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.729> right

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
very blurry it's like I think like right

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.649 
very blurry it's like I think like right
see<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.470> see<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.220> clearly<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.299> right

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
see I see this clearly it's like right

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.319 
see I see this clearly it's like right
down<00:01:42.899> here<00:01:43.320> around<00:01:43.649> here<00:01:44.070> where<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.060> clear

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
down here around here where it's a clear

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.399 
down here around here where it's a clear
picture<00:01:45.659> um<00:01:47.600> otherwise<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.869> know<00:01:48.990> there's

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.490 
picture um otherwise you know there's
the<00:01:49.670> stair<00:01:50.670> set<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.840> i'll<00:01:52.079> be<00:01:52.110> reviewing

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the stair set that i'll be reviewing

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.800 
the stair set that i'll be reviewing
later<00:01:53.009> or<00:01:53.369> showing<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.909> guys<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.659> another

later or showing you guys in another
video<00:01:55.079> after<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.590> um<00:01:55.939> but<00:01:56.939> anyways<00:01:58.040> it<00:01:59.040> is

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
video after this um but anyways it is

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.859 
video after this um but anyways it is
kind<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.759> fish<00:01:59.939> right<00:02:00.090> oh<00:02:00.210> my<00:02:00.329> god<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.780> it

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
kind of a fish right oh my god and it

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.300 
kind of a fish right oh my god and it
won't<00:02:00.990> stay<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.320> that's<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.710> other<00:02:01.860> problem<00:02:02.070> I

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
won't stay on that's the other problem I

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.740 
won't stay on that's the other problem I
think<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> might<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:02.939> wary<00:02:03.090> stick<00:02:03.600> it

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
think I might have to be wary stick it

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.700 
think I might have to be wary stick it

on<00:02:13.239> but<00:02:14.239> anyways<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:15.849> mean<00:02:16.849> it<00:02:17.000> does<00:02:17.750> what's

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
on but anyways I mean it does what's

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.710 
on but anyways I mean it does what's
supposed<00:02:18.349> to<00:02:18.500> maybe<00:02:19.250> not<00:02:19.459> as<00:02:19.580> much<00:02:19.610> as<00:02:19.790> as<00:02:20.150> much

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
supposed to maybe not as much as as much

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.350 
supposed to maybe not as much as as much
as<00:02:20.930> its<00:02:21.080> supposed<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.470> um<00:02:21.739> but<00:02:22.730> it's<00:02:23.030> just<00:02:23.239> a

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
as its supposed to um but it's just a

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.540 
as its supposed to um but it's just a
real<00:02:23.870> trade-off<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.319> is<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:24.860> blurry<00:02:25.190> around

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
real trade-off that is so blurry around

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.780 
real trade-off that is so blurry around
the<00:02:25.640> edges<00:02:25.819> um<00:02:27.340> luckily<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.400> don't<00:02:28.489> have<00:02:28.610> to

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
the edges um luckily I don't have to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.690 
the edges um luckily I don't have to
zoom<00:02:29.000> in<00:02:29.239> at<00:02:29.330> all<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:30.620> get<00:02:30.769> it<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.130> can<00:02:31.340> zoom<00:02:31.550> out

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
zoom in at all to get it I can zoom out

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.160 
zoom in at all to get it I can zoom out
all<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.090> way<00:02:32.239> this<00:02:32.480> is<00:02:32.540> zooming<00:02:32.870> out<00:02:32.930> all<00:02:33.080> the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
all the way this is zooming out all the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.720 
all the way this is zooming out all the
weight<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:33.500> doesn't<00:02:33.800> show<00:02:34.370> up<00:02:34.400> on<00:02:34.610> the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
weight and it doesn't show up on the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.449 
weight and it doesn't show up on the
sides<00:02:34.970> like<00:02:35.239> fun<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:36.080> think<00:02:36.890> my<00:02:36.980> friend<00:02:37.280> has<00:02:37.430> one

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
sides like fun I think my friend has one

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.220 
sides like fun I think my friend has one
