00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
certainly getting better at that part

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.710 
certainly getting better at that part
but<00:01:13.020> um<00:01:13.670> you'll<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.850> me<00:01:15.000> make<00:01:15.150> some<00:01:15.360> bonehead

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
nature and it all really stems from me

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.249 
nature and it all really stems from me
just<00:01:22.890> playing<00:01:23.220> rode<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.640> show<00:01:23.850> non<00:01:24.509> stuff<00:01:24.930> you

you<00:01:27.509> don't<00:01:27.540> really<00:01:28.439> see<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> field<00:01:29.189> from<00:01:29.310> that

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670

other<00:01:29.909> angle<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.470> get<00:01:32.009> confused<00:01:32.220> I'm

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
other angle so I get confused I'm

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.130 
other angle so I get confused I'm
pressing<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> buttons<00:01:33.390> because<00:01:33.600> I'm<00:01:33.840> used<00:01:34.049> to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
pressing the buttons because I'm used to

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.390 
pressing the buttons because I'm used to
playing<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.530> outfield<00:01:34.590> where<00:01:35.189> you're

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
playing in the outfield where you're

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.700 
playing in the outfield where you're
facing<00:01:36.210> towards<00:01:36.840> home<00:01:37.079> plate<00:01:37.110> where<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
facing towards home plate where the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.130 
facing towards home plate where the
camera<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:39.090> game<00:01:39.360> mode<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> most

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
camera in this game mode for the most

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.469 
camera in this game mode for the most
part<00:01:40.380> faces<00:01:40.890> away<00:01:41.040> from<00:01:41.189> home<00:01:41.549> plate<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.210> I

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
part faces away from home plate so I

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.240 
part faces away from home plate so I
think<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.170> guys<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.530> play<00:01:43.680> road<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.040> show

think you guys that play road the show

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.240 
think you guys that play road the show
would<00:01:44.430> understand<00:01:44.939> what<00:01:45.149> I'm<00:01:45.270> saying<00:01:45.570> there

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.980 
would understand what I'm saying there
it's<00:01:47.250> not<00:01:47.399> an<00:01:47.549> excuse<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.630> know<00:01:48.659> I

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.080 
um obviously this is very early of when
the<00:01:56.520> game<00:01:56.670> first<00:01:56.700> came<00:01:57.210> out<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.899> people<00:01:59.090> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
the game first came out so people you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.880 
the game first came out so people you
know<00:02:00.210> really<00:02:00.600> know<00:02:00.869> what<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.229> skill<00:02:01.530> levels

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
know really know what the skill levels

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.280 
know really know what the skill levels
of<00:02:02.040> people<00:02:02.340> are<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.270> like<00:02:03.630> how<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.960> kind<00:02:04.140> of

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
of people are but I like how it kind of

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.779 
of people are but I like how it kind of
ranks<00:02:04.590> your<00:02:04.740> team<00:02:05.329> based<00:02:06.329> on

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
ranks your team based on

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.940 
ranks your team based on
how<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.850> play<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.149> game<00:02:09.300> as<00:02:09.750> far<00:02:09.960> as<00:02:10.200> like

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
how you play the game as far as like

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.100 
how you play the game as far as like
your<00:02:11.190> skill<00:02:11.520> level<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.970> all<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.540> get<00:02:12.810> a

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
your skill level and all that you get a

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.800 
your skill level and all that you get a
rank<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.860> then<00:02:14.550> when<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.300> go<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.510> search

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
rank and then when you go to search

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.930 
rank and then when you go to search
games<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.470> searches<00:02:16.620> for<00:02:17.130> people<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.760> are

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
games and searches for people that are

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.440 
games and searches for people that are
within<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.510> same<00:02:18.750> sort<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.460> rank<00:02:20.460> area<00:02:20.940> as<00:02:21.180> you

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
within the same sort of rank area as you

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.090 
within the same sort of rank area as you
so<00:02:21.750> you're<00:02:21.900> not<00:02:21.990> going<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.260> go<00:02:22.470> up<00:02:22.680> against

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
so you're not going to go up against

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.820 
so you're not going to go up against
some<00:02:23.280> guy<00:02:23.430> that's<00:02:23.760> just<00:02:23.820> completely<00:02:24.830> amazing

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
some guy that's just completely amazing

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.110 
some guy that's just completely amazing
at<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.250> game<00:02:26.430> when<00:02:26.640> you're<00:02:26.790> first<00:02:26.970> starting

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
at the game when you're first starting

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.060 
at the game when you're first starting
off<00:02:27.600> so<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.870> kind<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.170> like<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.530> they've<00:02:28.740> got

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
off so I kind of like that they've got

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.520 
off so I kind of like that they've got
some<00:02:29.370> sort<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.670> matchmaking<00:02:30.209> built<00:02:30.990> into<00:02:31.380> it

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
some sort of matchmaking built into it

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.530 
some sort of matchmaking built into it
we'll<00:02:31.650> have<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.860> see<00:02:32.010> how<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.280> goes<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:33.300> more

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
we'll have to see how that goes the more

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.470 
we'll have to see how that goes the more
people<00:02:33.690> play<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.290> um<00:02:35.270> you<00:02:36.270> know<00:02:36.360> how

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
people play this um you know how

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.480 
people play this um you know how
accurate<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.290> but<00:02:37.709> right<00:02:37.920> now<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.310> seems

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
accurate that is but right now it seems

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.140 
accurate that is but right now it seems
very<00:02:38.820> very<00:02:39.120> good<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:41.190> game<00:02:41.400> itself<00:02:41.730> plays

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
very very good the game itself plays

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.960 
very very good the game itself plays
really<00:02:42.420> well<00:02:42.570> online<00:02:43.280> there's<00:02:44.280> very<00:02:44.880> few

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
really well online there's very few

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.320 
really well online there's very few
times<00:02:45.570> where<00:02:45.870> there's<00:02:46.080> major<00:02:46.860> lag<00:02:47.220> issues<00:02:47.700> and

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
times where there's major lag issues and

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.000 
times where there's major lag issues and
typically<00:02:48.720> where<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.050> see<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.380> lag<00:02:49.590> issues

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
typically where you see the lag issues

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.460 
typically where you see the lag issues
is<00:02:50.160> not<00:02:50.370> during<00:02:50.970> pitching<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.540> hitting<00:02:51.660> so<00:02:52.380> it

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
is not during pitching and hitting so it

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.580 
is not during pitching and hitting so it
makes<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.860> game<00:02:53.010> playable<00:02:53.430> it's<00:02:53.760> more<00:02:54.060> during

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
makes the game playable it's more during

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.229 
makes the game playable it's more during
defensive<00:02:55.590> plays<00:02:55.830> or<00:02:56.130> let's<00:02:56.880> say<00:02:57.030> you're

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
defensive plays or let's say you're

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.280 
defensive plays or let's say you're
running<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.600> base<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:57.989> they're<00:02:58.110> playing

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
running the base and they're playing

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.740 
running the base and they're playing
defense<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:59.070> lot<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.310> times<00:02:59.640> when<00:03:00.480> there's<00:03:00.690> a

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
defense a lot of times when there's a

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.170 
defense a lot of times when there's a
lag<00:03:00.989> issue<00:03:01.260> you'll<00:03:02.100> see<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.340> guy<00:03:02.550> like<00:03:02.850> pick<00:03:03.060> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
lag issue you'll see a guy like pick the

lag issue you'll see a guy like pick the
ball<00:03:03.390> up<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.870> then<00:03:04.140> not<00:03:04.350> throw<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.010> you'll

catcher<00:04:58.880> you're<00:04:59.880> not<00:05:00.120> going<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.360> throw<00:05:00.480> people

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
catcher you're not going to throw people

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.000 
catcher you're not going to throw people
out<00:05:01.020> as<00:05:01.260> often<00:05:01.860> as<00:05:02.160> you<00:05:02.190> should<00:05:03.710> success<00:05:04.710> steal

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
out as often as you should success steal

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.370 
out as often as you should success steal
rate<00:05:05.250> should<00:05:05.430> be<00:05:05.490> way<00:05:05.850> less<00:05:06.120> than<00:05:06.180> that<00:05:06.450> right

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
rate should be way less than that right

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.659 
rate should be way less than that right
now<00:05:07.530> like<00:05:07.740> I<00:05:07.770> said<00:05:07.860> it's<00:05:08.160> probably<00:05:08.310> eighty

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
now like I said it's probably eighty

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.380 
now like I said it's probably eighty
percent<00:05:08.910> maybe<00:05:09.450> even<00:05:09.740> even<00:05:10.740> better<00:05:10.950> than<00:05:11.190> that

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
percent maybe even even better than that

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.880 
percent maybe even even better than that
so<00:05:12.390> they<00:05:12.510> need<00:05:12.660> to<00:05:12.750> fix<00:05:12.930> some<00:05:13.169> of<00:05:13.320> that<00:05:13.440> stuff<00:05:13.710> I

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
so they need to fix some of that stuff I

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.550 
so they need to fix some of that stuff I
don't<00:05:14.070> know<00:05:14.160> what<00:05:14.370> they<00:05:14.520> need<00:05:14.729> to<00:05:14.760> do<00:05:15.060> but<00:05:15.560> i

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
don't know what they need to do but i

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.500 
don't know what they need to do but i
don't<00:05:17.550> know<00:05:17.580> if<00:05:17.729> it's<00:05:17.880> just<00:05:17.970> making<00:05:18.240> the

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
don't know if it's just making the

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.870 
don't know if it's just making the
pitcher<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:19.050> catcher<00:05:19.430> get<00:05:20.430> out<00:05:20.580> of<00:05:20.610> there

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
pitcher and catcher get out of there

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.060 
pitcher and catcher get out of there
