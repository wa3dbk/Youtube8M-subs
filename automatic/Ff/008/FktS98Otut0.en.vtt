00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
definitely worth spending five seconds

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.839 
definitely worth spending five seconds
doing<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:54.650> yeah<00:02:54.829> that's<00:02:55.099> about<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.400> for<00:02:55.549> the<00:02:55.819> a

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
doing and yeah that's about it for the a

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.940 
doing and yeah that's about it for the a
bonfire<00:02:56.329> update<00:02:56.689> I<00:02:56.900> reckon<00:02:57.470> it's<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.739> pretty

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
bonfire update I reckon it's a pretty

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.949 
bonfire update I reckon it's a pretty
good<00:02:58.189> idea<00:02:58.310> because<00:02:59.120> before<00:02:59.599> training

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
good idea because before training

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.710 
good idea because before training
fire-making<00:03:00.530> was<00:03:00.680> incredibly<00:03:01.220> painful<00:03:01.720> now

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
fire-making was incredibly painful now

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.479 
fire-making was incredibly painful now
you<00:03:02.780> can<00:03:02.959> at<00:03:03.109> least<00:03:03.139> train<00:03:03.650> one<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.099> the<00:03:04.220> most

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
you can at least train one of the most

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.149 
you can at least train one of the most
useless<00:03:04.790> skills<00:03:05.299> in<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.540> game<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:06.159> semi

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
useless skills in the game and semi

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.220 
useless skills in the game and semi
bearable<00:03:07.609> way<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.090> it's<00:03:08.599> also<00:03:08.750> become<00:03:09.079> useful

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
bearable way and it's also become useful

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.990 
bearable way and it's also become useful
for<00:03:09.709> combat<00:03:10.700> situations<00:03:11.329> so<00:03:11.989> yeah<00:03:12.260> I<00:03:13.000> know
