00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.509
 getting age as well as is yours 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.529
 to speak German to do really well 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.260
 old yes yes I do not even know what 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.850
 I have it perfectly applied 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.670
 have found seven diamonds 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.580
 now you have 87 goalkeepers are sixth 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.420
 been young i mean and here is 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.420
 not deadly 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:45.440
 this know-how as well as me well why 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:48.300
 the dingsda does not rise like mine 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.570
 where is the ps number short under 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.010
 short time so there I am again 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.420
 now it is somehow fluid again 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.120
 I have to briefly once in between 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.750
 no idea what was with me 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.449
 never really tja award also 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.180
 Eventually sometime you get caught 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.140
 or others or somehow or whatever knows 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.140
 I do something at all 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.479
 so hot stone 8 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:43.520
 this is ours for we need 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:45.500
 but not because we know, yes, if 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.929
 then we do not have to break down the people 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.600
 we have a thumb down 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:57.229
 january under gives age last and 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:03.590
 i do not prefer diamonds or 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:10.179
 iron or coal or stone or dirt 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.179
 or meat 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:27.010
 okay what's the name of ok you have to 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.010
 again an admission 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:52.070
 so people here we are happy though 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:57.200
 somehow cross the record very much 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:01.400
 hot watch out that you're not a 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:05.860
 lethal lava kills me well 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.860
 try me there we still have coal 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.810
 After that it is exciting how one khol 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.810
 dismantle 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:39.880
 that is really exciting that is 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:44.290
 really has no exciting 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:49.230
 had the idea now comes in annually 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.230
 minecraft music of exciting things 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.010
 I do not really hear them very loud 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:13.070
 skype still makes the tower a bit 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:20.150
 quiet people contact again 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:22.550
 degree has short it goes on now runs 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.820
 no idea why this is so fluid 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.820
 is 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.110
 that was oh my god that was not with 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:47.240
 intention 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:49.760
 what is broken okay okay I play 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.190
 like the multiplayer on one 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.190
 wild server people and somehow has 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.330
 I think am a truck driver for time 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.310
 and must the gas stations through total 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.780
 changed 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.280
 and somehow it's just a trailer 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.700
 somehow fully flown through the air 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.230
 and so and now it is exploding 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:12.050
 Some people do advertising for the release 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:14.090
 server that said the name out now 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:19.220
 just said it is a thing but not 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:23.590
 which goes live on the real live 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:26.480
 server called we live by rudolf leuten 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.900
 But that's the name people say 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.900
 Honestly 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:41.699

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:46.310
 messed up where I have to go I have to 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:46.310
 I believe that here for a long time 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.600
 So here we believe there ever 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.600
 clarified 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:01.069
 then down there's nothing we can do 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:11.610
 again here 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:13.770
 it was here and here we are and 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.849
 my the ballroom goes back down to 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:22.020
 just people there we are again 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:24.719

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:28.979

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:34.529

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.229
 I'll say now I did next 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:41.520
 let me continue on what the problem is me 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:44.520
 can not say what's wrong with 10 fps 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.479
 No matter people until sometime I break 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.860
