what<00:00:08.660> you<00:00:09.049> hear<00:00:09.440> is<00:00:09.740> not<00:00:10.280> a<00:00:10.339> lot<00:00:11.169> plastic<00:00:12.169> photo

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:12.919 
what you hear is not a lot plastic photo

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.240 
what you hear is not a lot plastic photo
since<00:00:13.369> I<00:00:13.940> do<00:00:14.389> and<00:00:14.719> chemical<00:00:15.199> reaction<00:00:15.679> so<00:00:15.860> we

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
since I do and chemical reaction so we

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.030 
since I do and chemical reaction so we
can<00:00:16.550> breathe<00:00:16.820> oxygen<00:00:19.900> that's<00:00:20.900> why<00:00:21.200> he<00:00:21.560> was

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
can breathe oxygen that's why he was

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.040 
can breathe oxygen that's why he was
called<00:00:22.340> a<00:00:22.610> not<00:00:22.910> so<00:00:23.540> we<00:00:23.750> don't<00:00:24.200> saw<00:00:24.560> Kate<00:00:25.190> and

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
called a not so we don't saw Kate and

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.050 
called a not so we don't saw Kate and
plants<00:00:27.050> stabilize<00:00:27.650> and<00:00:27.980> secure<00:00:28.340> our<00:00:28.550> lives
