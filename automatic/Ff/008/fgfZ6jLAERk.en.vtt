00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.250
 now let's make an omelet 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.809
 French as simple as that but 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.289
 be careful with making a good tortilla 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.750
 French I think is one of the dishes 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.449
 that can follow us or more complicated if 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.789
 we want to make it really annotated to 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.039
 taste is clear that if you want to make it 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.359
 juices and is rich with pretty shape is not 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.679
 so simple to make a good tortilla 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.539
 French care 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:33.730
 let's do a normal and as always 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.730
 that fact we are going to proceed 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.340
 to beat eggs that of opening an egg 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.770
 with one hand is not so easy too many 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.790
 they get to try it at home you will see 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.830
 how our precision of some 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.180
 husk falls 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.730
 we beat the new ones 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.620
 a little salt is always tortilla 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.450
 specifically I did not like that either 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.010
 I like to beat the eggs but neither 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.450
 I liked to make a lot of eggs 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.790
 other tortillas that can be made from 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.890
 another way some coded tortillas that 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.750
 they are called making clear and then 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.330
 putting a little bit of yolk but it's 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.580
 so concrete i like to do it like that 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.140
 we throw a nonstick skillet 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.729
 very important to the pan the pan is 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.560
 you do not have to spend you have the posters 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.930
 and the knife can not be a house 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.840
 with a pan that sticks to one we can 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.000
 cook that is clear the pan has 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.350
 to be very hot a little bit of 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.369
 oil as you have seen social 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.680
 non-stick we throw the tortillita is 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.729
 specifically that it is a little egg we had 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.729
 a little quickie 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.009
 or search now let's rest I like 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.859
 leave it out of the fire and now 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.439
 we quietly turn it over 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:46.689
 we are in no hurry I tell them if the 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.000
 pan is good does not have to stick 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:53.380
 a lot is a droplet is not oil 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.380
 we put it in fried 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.940
 with the easy victory hand we are giving 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.010
 small taps taps here is worth 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.570
 It remains as rather tortilla 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.570
 she alone is going to turn around 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.140
 I would take it from the plate so that the 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.610
 tortilla inside this game if it is or 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.380
 If it's the way I like it, 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.050
 French tortillas can always be 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.110
 put that we want ham asparagus 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.470
 that depends on the taste of each person 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.470
 and to the plate
