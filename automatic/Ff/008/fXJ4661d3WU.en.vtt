the machine actually stands them up and
it<00:00:58.469> runs<00:00:58.649> through<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.070> belt<00:00:59.250> right<00:00:59.460> where<00:00:59.670> you

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
it runs through the belt right where you

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.990 
it runs through the belt right where you
saw<00:01:00.449> take<00:01:01.260> 60<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> bottle<00:01:02.489> they<00:01:02.820> don't

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000

capsule<00:01:07.650> count<00:01:08.100> bottle<00:01:08.430> then<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.000> Machine

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
capsule count bottle then the Machine

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.030 
capsule count bottle then the Machine
what<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> does<00:01:09.600> 88<00:01:09.900> up<00:01:10.049> at<00:01:10.260> council<00:01:10.680> capsules

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
what it does 88 up at council capsules

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.850 
what it does 88 up at council capsules
drop<00:01:11.670> some<00:01:11.850> into<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.240> into<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.900> bottle<00:01:13.530> right

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
drop some into the into the bottle right

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.770 
drop some into the into the bottle right
and<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:14.250> what<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.460> does<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:14.780> continues

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
and then what it does it just continues

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.480 
and then what it does it just continues
to<00:01:15.810> flow<00:01:16.110> into<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> next<00:01:16.619> machine<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> cat

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
to flow into the next machine with a cat

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.999 
to flow into the next machine with a cat
gets<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.110> goes<00:01:19.229> into<00:01:19.439> what<00:01:19.920> they

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
gets on and then it goes into what they

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.690 
gets on and then it goes into what they
call<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> heater<00:01:20.729> or<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.659> seals<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
call like a heater or it seals the

call like a heater or it seals the
bottle<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.180> goes<00:01:24.270> into<00:01:24.380> putting<00:01:25.380> on

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
bottle and then it goes into putting on

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.140 
bottle and then it goes into putting on
the<00:01:25.799> labels<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.460> gets<00:01:26.610> wrapped<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.030> there

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
the labels and it gets wrapped in there

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.240 
the labels and it gets wrapped in there
from<00:01:27.270> there<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.570> goes<00:01:27.689> into<00:01:27.950> packaging<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
from there it goes into packaging and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.830 
from there it goes into packaging and
putting<00:01:29.850> them<00:01:29.909> into<00:01:30.060> boxes<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> whole

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
putting them into boxes in the whole

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.870 
putting them into boxes in the whole
thing<00:01:31.020> right<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.409> seems<00:01:31.530> like<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> very<00:01:31.880> turnkey
