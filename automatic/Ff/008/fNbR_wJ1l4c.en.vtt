they've<00:00:09.690> done<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.930> track<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.940> think<00:00:11.940> good<00:00:12.240> you

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
they've done the track I think good you

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.789 
they've done the track I think good you
know<00:00:12.539> of<00:00:12.660> course<00:00:12.840> they<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.230> biggest<00:00:13.559> thing<00:00:13.680> is

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
know of course they the biggest thing is

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.709 
know of course they the biggest thing is
they<00:00:13.889> brought<00:00:14.070> an<00:00:14.250> extra<00:00:14.490> soil<00:00:14.879> to<00:00:15.270> mix<00:00:15.539> in

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
they brought an extra soil to mix in

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.330 
they brought an extra soil to mix in
there<00:00:15.869> so<00:00:16.020> now<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.230> tracks<00:00:16.619> getting<00:00:16.860> deeper

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
there so now the tracks getting deeper

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.550 
there so now the tracks getting deeper
and<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:18.060> Roose<00:00:18.270> doesn't<00:00:18.690> hurt<00:00:18.839> nearly<00:00:19.050> as<00:00:19.230> bad

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
and the Roose doesn't hurt nearly as bad

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.859 
and the Roose doesn't hurt nearly as bad
so<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.970> that's<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.240> good<00:00:21.390> thing<00:00:21.599> you<00:00:21.779> know

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
so that that's a good thing you know

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.900 
so that that's a good thing you know
they<00:00:22.080> added<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.500> couple<00:00:22.699> couple<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.789> little

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
they added a couple couple of little

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.630 
they added a couple couple of little
things<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.660> sometimes<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.800> only<00:00:25.949> add<00:00:26.249> too

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
things but sometimes you only add too

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.029 
things but sometimes you only add too
much<00:00:26.880> if<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.660> turns<00:00:28.080> into<00:00:28.169> a<00:00:28.349> one-line<00:00:28.710> track

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
much if it turns into a one-line track

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.249 
much if it turns into a one-line track
so<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.429> think<00:00:29.579> you<00:00:30.300> know<00:00:30.449> they<00:00:30.810> have<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.079> play

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
so I think you know they have to play

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.590 
so I think you know they have to play
with<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> little<00:00:31.589> bit<00:00:32.150> you<00:00:33.150> know<00:00:33.240> yes<00:00:33.420> it

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
with it a little bit you know yes it

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.569 
with it a little bit you know yes it
does<00:00:33.720> need<00:00:33.900> to<00:00:33.990> be<00:00:34.079> more<00:00:34.260> busy<00:00:34.650> needs<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.399> be<00:00:35.550> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
does need to be more busy needs to be a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.220 
does need to be more busy needs to be a
little<00:00:35.760> bit<00:00:35.940> more<00:00:36.090> technical<00:00:36.329> but<00:00:36.809> sometimes

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
little bit more technical but sometimes

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.200 
little bit more technical but sometimes
you<00:00:37.410> can<00:00:37.860> go<00:00:38.010> overboard<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.789> there's<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.000> fine

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
you can go overboard it there's a fine

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.880 
you can go overboard it there's a fine
line<00:00:39.239> there<00:00:39.660> but<00:00:40.199> you<00:00:40.469> know<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> think<00:00:40.770> they're

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
line there but you know I think they're

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.880 
line there but you know I think they're
on<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:42.300> right<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.780> right<00:00:42.960> path<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.620> that

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
on to the right the right path for that

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.860 
on to the right the right path for that
and<00:00:44.070> they<00:00:44.160> don't<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.550> be<00:00:44.699> completely<00:00:45.449> set

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
and they don't have to be completely set

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.229 
and they don't have to be completely set
with<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.170> design<00:00:46.500> till<00:00:46.770> September<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.550> yeah

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239
