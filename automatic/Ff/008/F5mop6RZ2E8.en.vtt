00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.670

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.619

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:22.970
 enlightened that means again this white 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.560

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.760
 or the balloon 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.130
 coat and stick on so you have 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.470
 the two will be the situation now 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.020

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.960
 Remove the balloon 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:43.190

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.330
 So two layers left here on the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.629

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:09.230
 again a situation with the second

 transparent paper on history 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.720

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.769
 standards in addition and above the edge 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.769
 brush with butter 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.410
 only a few stones throw outside 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:44.629
 glitter denies that is how you set 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.629
 just certain points and accents 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.530
