00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.059
 yes those days are gone when our sites 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.219
 disfigured 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.150
 heterogeneous homemade greenhouses from 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.550
 what horrible 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.250
 now almost all installed 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.830
 wonderful polycarbonate deed 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.710
 excellent material for such purposes 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:29.480
 as you have not installed it is easy 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:32.930
 fixable 9000 Siberians chose greenhouses 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.210
 from now to k this greenhouse all 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.579
 provided for ease of care 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.370
 vegetables and in order to be able 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.570
 do not believe we get a wonderful harvest 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.760
 Now we will tell you everything and show that 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.710
 ensures the reliability of our fortress 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.980
 greenhouses in the first place of course 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.260
 frame name is soto makes frames 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.710
 one-piece special metal 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.170
 pipes whose thickness reaches one and a half 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.170
 millimeters because it is so important we know in 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.960
 Siberia to a greenhouse withstand huge 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.570
 snow loads sometimes heavy winds 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.760
 it is also important considering all this to 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.130
 the frame was very well painted to 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.700
 he was not threatened by corrosion and atmospheric 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.500
 exposure photos paint their pipes 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.750
 polymer way hot stoves it 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.479
 when imported paint is very good 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.000
 applied literally welded to 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.390
 metal in this way and practically 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.659
 nothing threatens a very long time 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.549
 collect the frame with the help of such 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.970
 galvanized clamps wall thickness 2 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:41.570
 millimeter this design is much 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.420
 tougher and more flexible welded we 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.880
 we know that where there was welding 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.460
 after pressure with loads can 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.440
 breakages occur precisely in places of seams and 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.870
 if we use which 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.090
 some bolted connections 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.160
 have to deal with drilled 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.790
 a pipe that also harms 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.210
 Fortress connection here such clamps this 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.760
 optimal design solution 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.150
 so our frame is very durable pay 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.090
 attention to how the greenhouse debts are located in 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.610
 one meter apart this 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.110
 enhances its reliability but no 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.660
 limit to perfection 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.520
 it turns out you can still additionally 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.910
 strengthen and such a design 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.240
 there are options for greenhouses 100 selenium and sata 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.140
 luxury in such greenhouses provided for more 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.870
 Here is such a special strut top 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.080
 parts of the arc of spacers are called 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.420
 transverse amplifier this method 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.620
 Mounts is patented 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.830
 the invention of the factory court and if will 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.860
 even a very strong snow load 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.790
 this design will stand and hold 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.060
 our greenhouse 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.200
 unscathed is an iron fact he checked 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.120
 experimentally at a science institute 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.230
 Soto plant not only works for 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.239
 profits he makes greenhouses with love 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.060
 the factory improves its products on 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.820
 over seven years given the slightest 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.690
 wish or claim your 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.870
 consumers 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.110
 designed so many small useful 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.160
 trivia that will help vegetable growers in 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.320
 the battle for the harvest 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.650
 but look at the convenient one 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.150
 clever suspension system 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.070
 which allows no longer 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.780
 bother and not invent yourself 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.630
 some options with improvised 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.120
 means you can put the internal 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.519
 partition in the greenhouse which will allow 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.720
 you grow cucumbers in the same room 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.640
 and tomatoes at different at different modes 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.410
 agricultural engineering or here look at this 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.100
 additional window 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:55.010
 This is an automatic smart pore. she herself 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.459
 will open if the temperature in the greenhouse 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.650
 will rise above 24 degrees and at 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.420
 lowering the temperature will be smooth 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.849
 go down 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.599
 you probably paid attention to the door 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:11.060
 at the same time is a pane of tact 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.790
 pizza is designed at both ends 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.400
 Well, finally, in my opinion a wonderful 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.250
 the advantage of our greenhouse here is 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.799
 wide open passage and wide 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.040
 the door here is convenient to bring a box of 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.280
 seedlings and go out with buckets 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.840
 filled with ruddy ripe beauty 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.600
 so that the door does not deform in 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.330
 the operation of the doorway 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.680
 strengthened look at how reliable 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.930
 metal pipe 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.370
 here it holds here provided 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.160
 windproof planochka which is not 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.250
 will let s seep seep into 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.220
 greenhouse if we close it 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.800
 so that the door does not slam spontaneously 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.350
 did not walk back and forth provided 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.950
 comfortable system of bolt-ons of the outside and 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.840
 inside 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.880
 but they do top off saying that the plant 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.979
 soto carries real warranty 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.380
 obligations for the quality of their greenhouses 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.600
 term from one to three years 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.140
 it depends on the type you choose 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.419
 greenhouses all greenhouses are certified 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.760
 matching which confirms them 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.880
 the quality is so wonderful 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.140
 our greenhouse soto honestly even 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.140
 I don't want to leave
