00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
because it for years they thought of

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.260 
because it for years they thought of
slice<00:00:37.710> them<00:00:37.890> secret<00:00:38.340> formula<00:00:38.879> goes<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.239> no

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
slice them secret formula goes like no

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.130 
slice them secret formula goes like no
just<00:00:39.840> practice<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:41.300> you<00:00:42.300> mix<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> combine

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
just practice and you mix the combine

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.229 
just practice and you mix the combine
that<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.620> god-given<00:00:44.010> talent<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.670> here

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
that was just god-given talent and here

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.700 
that was just god-given talent and here
you<00:00:45.360> are<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.780> think<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.170> does<00:00:46.289> nothing<00:00:46.590> but

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
you are so I think it does nothing but

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.150 
you are so I think it does nothing but
gives<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.730> good<00:00:48.000> jolt<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.920> helps<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.980> kids

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
gives it a good jolt and helps the kids

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.390 
gives it a good jolt and helps the kids
over<00:00:50.460> there<00:00:50.579> believe<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.059> they<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.360> come<00:00:51.600> in

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
over there believe that they can come in

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.100 
over there believe that they can come in
and<00:00:53.400> make<00:00:53.970> a<00:00:54.000> significant<00:00:54.510> impact<00:00:54.630> and<00:00:54.989> don't

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
and make a significant impact and don't

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.799 
and make a significant impact and don't
have<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.410> be<00:00:55.560> y'all<00:00:55.950> being<00:00:56.220> size<00:00:56.460> or<00:00:56.820> yeast
