 7 articles 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.849
 to note that once

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.340
 and the standby stage 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.200
 and finally he loses 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.530
 while some 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.530

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.800
 it is rather simple 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.150
 the season

 that did not do for me 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.900
 the big apple 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.670

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.780

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.350
 it goes through this gold mine 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.350
 no worries 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.320
