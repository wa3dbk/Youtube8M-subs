00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.860
 A whole week has passed since 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.410
 bitter 1 2 defeat against the fsv 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.330
 Frankfurt one week in the hard-hitting 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.289
 analyzed and above all tough 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.029
 was worked 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.950
 for all legitimate criticism of the 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.470
 team performance the focus is on the 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.420
 play on saturday at fc st pauli die 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.009
 mission is reparation on 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.320
 Millerntor for defender Patrick 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.790
 Fabian was the game against the fsv here 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.230
 maybe even something like that 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.420
 cleansing thunderstorm 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.129
 yes i just think that this is us 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.800
 game against frankfurt now hopefully 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.870
 a lesson was so I think we have 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.210
 worked the week over focused 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.120
 and clear words were also dropped 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.110
 on the part of the trainer of the board 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.789
 but is also among each other in the 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:58.199
 that it does not work that way 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:02.109
 we can not occur so that we 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.320
 much more venomous bilious and one 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:07.539
 piece far too dirty to play 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.160
 and you have to do everything for the three 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:12.490
 points stop whether in home game 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.490
 away from home just play with us 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.340
 keep that against Frankfurt 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.549
 the opponent was made easy 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.860
 victory 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.229
 and I think if we fix it 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.329
 then we have all possibilities because 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.280
 We can play soccer that knows that 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.770
 me and then this season often needs 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.670
 shown only we must not forget 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.670
 to retrieve the basics and also want to 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.070
 if we are aware of it 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.110
 has become hopefully by the by 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.450
 The defeat last week then I am 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.890
 very optimistic that we too in 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.799
 Hamburg can score points 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.329
 the optimism is so unbroken and 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.460
 The week also eased 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.930
 the little vfl lazarett a little bit 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.890
 Muscle Cat is full again in the 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.110
 Team training has its 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.880
 capsule irritation in the joint overcome 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.040
 likewise felix bastians of the under 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.380
 week because of a gastrointestinal infection 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.610
 It did not have to be fit 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.920
 Lukas Sinkewitz with knee problems 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.509
 jantscher with muscular problems and 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.640
 Jonas activist apa 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.070
 he too is laboring at one 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.290
 gastrointestinal infection , we dedicate ourselves to the 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.639
 opponent patrick fabian knows what him and 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.680
 his teammates in the 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:23.560
 hansestadt awaits 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.260
 mobile team so you roche 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.620
 their very much they pay attention to each other 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.510
 In the processes I never will 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.859
 I believe that two games happen 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.150
 standing in one spot or getting into one 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.430
 Direction move so the know 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.680
 exactly what they are doing right now 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.680
 midfield many nimble nimble 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.670
 players as I said there a lot 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.010
 Traveling safely is extremely important 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.739
 agile and we just have to look 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:55.359
 that we already use these circles in the beginning 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.590
 somehow contain it and not at all 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.739
 to develop it 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.939
 and that's up to us, I think so 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:06.310
 We are absolutely in the position we have 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:08.349
 Defensive work is actually up 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.989
 now has almost consistently seen 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.450
 can because we have something we need 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.159
 start and then try again and again 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.310
 forwards hold the decisive 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:22.750
 to set a course and if we all that 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:25.470
 so pauli then wake up 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.489
 any case also defensively vulnerable 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.680
 they did it against 2 2 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.690
 played many good actions here 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.269
 but also had the one or the other 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.220
 other weaknesses we who we know 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.199
 which we simply have to take advantage of 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.760
 proper bochumer defensive in the 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:42.280
 remaining for four games away without 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.019
 Go ahead against the creative and 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.299
 midfield the hamburger we play 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.979
 expect an exciting game and look forward 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.389
 Of course we will see each other again 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:52.540
 with the ex bochum philipp heerwagen 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.889
 and marc rzatkowski has to the latter 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.109
 patrick fabian of course already 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.419
 contacted namely with a 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.620
 clear fight announcement 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.939
 if the saturday somehow celebrate too 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.079
 then you can 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.319
 forget because the three points take 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.319
 we with
