00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
to mention the fact that you're also

for that turf rest and growth in
addition<00:01:39.580> clippings<00:01:40.090> also<00:01:40.450> are<00:01:40.570> a<00:01:40.600> great

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
addition clippings also are a great

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.660 
addition clippings also are a great
source<00:01:41.049> of<00:01:41.229> organic<00:01:41.799> matter<00:01:41.950> when<00:01:42.460> you<00:01:42.549> add

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
source of organic matter when you add

source of organic matter when you add
organic<00:01:43.180> matter<00:01:43.390> to<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.570> soil<00:01:43.659> it<00:01:44.080> increases

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
organic matter to the soil it increases

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.469 
organic matter to the soil it increases
the<00:01:44.650> soil<00:01:44.920> health<00:01:45.159> it<00:01:45.640> also<00:01:45.790> increases<00:01:46.240> the

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
the soil health it also increases the

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.240 
the soil health it also increases the
capacity<00:01:46.990> for<00:01:47.140> that<00:01:47.229> soil<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.890> be<00:01:48.040> more

capacity for that soil to be more

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.550 
capacity for that soil to be more
aerated<00:01:48.820> making<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.240> turf<00:01:49.450> healthier<00:01:49.990> also

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
aerated making the turf healthier also

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.289 
aerated making the turf healthier also
it<00:01:50.710> helps<00:01:50.950> with<00:01:51.100> moisture<00:01:51.520> retention<00:01:51.939> as<00:01:52.240> well

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
it helps with moisture retention as well

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.630 
it helps with moisture retention as well
as<00:01:53.140> moisture<00:01:53.409> loss<00:01:53.799> so<00:01:54.040> you're<00:01:54.220> actually<00:01:54.369> it's

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
as moisture loss so you're actually it's

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.060 
as moisture loss so you're actually it's
a<00:01:54.729> great<00:01:55.180> water<00:01:55.479> conservation<00:01:55.960> technique<00:01:56.740> to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
a great water conservation technique to

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.100 
a great water conservation technique to
leave<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.430> clippings<00:01:57.820> on<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.030> surface<00:01:58.689> one

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
of the big big myths out there is that

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.940 
of the big big myths out there is that
if<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.270> don't<00:02:01.509> pick<00:02:01.659> your<00:02:01.869> clippings<00:02:02.229> up<00:02:02.439> that

if you don't pick your clippings up that

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.830 
if you don't pick your clippings up that
you<00:02:03.070> actually<00:02:03.250> contribute<00:02:03.909> to<00:02:04.030> that<00:02:04.270> well<00:02:04.720> as

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
you actually contribute to that well as

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.210 
you actually contribute to that well as
long<00:02:05.020> as<00:02:05.140> you<00:02:05.229> follow<00:02:05.409> that<00:02:05.710> magical

contribute to thatch and actually even

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.309 
contribute to thatch and actually even
wanted<00:02:10.239> that<00:02:10.329> on<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.569> occasional<00:02:10.959> time<00:02:11.139> when

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
wanted that on the occasional time when

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.289 
wanted that on the occasional time when
perhaps<00:02:11.439> you<00:02:12.069> do<00:02:12.219> cut<00:02:12.459> more<00:02:12.669> than<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.909> third<00:02:13.090> off

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
perhaps you do cut more than a third off

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:13.770 
perhaps you do cut more than a third off
the<00:02:13.450> turf

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
not only organic matter but also

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.479 
not only organic matter but also
nutrients<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.500> makes<00:02:38.680> for<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:38.890> great

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
nutrients so it makes for a great

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
possibility and it's a good idea to do

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.050 
possibility and it's a good idea to do
that<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.860> other<00:02:41.890> bottom<00:02:42.459> line<00:02:42.640> is<00:02:42.850> is<00:02:43.030> that

that the other bottom line is is that
