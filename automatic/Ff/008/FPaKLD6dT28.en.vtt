00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
program and that because of the

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.960

would feel elated for a period of time

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.580 
would feel elated for a period of time
just<00:05:35.790> because<00:05:35.970> I<00:05:36.120> wasn't<00:05:36.510> so<00:05:36.660> drugged<00:05:37.020> out<00:05:37.260> so

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
just because I wasn't so drugged out so

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.409 
just because I wasn't so drugged out so
I<00:05:37.650> thought<00:05:37.919> I<00:05:37.950> was<00:05:38.220> feeling<00:05:38.490> well<00:05:38.880> but<00:05:39.150> it<00:05:39.270> was

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
I thought I was feeling well but it was

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.320 
I thought I was feeling well but it was
almost<00:05:39.900> bordering<00:05:40.740> on<00:05:40.919> Matt<00:05:41.220> a<00:05:41.490> manic

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
almost bordering on Matt a manic

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.920 
almost bordering on Matt a manic
behavior<00:05:42.600> I<00:05:43.050> just<00:05:43.410> felt<00:05:43.680> I<00:05:43.950> felt<00:05:44.910> so<00:05:45.150> good<00:05:45.419> and

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
behavior I just felt I felt so good and

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.460 
behavior I just felt I felt so good and
that<00:05:46.440> and<00:05:46.860> then<00:05:47.040> I<00:05:47.280> would<00:05:47.430> crash<00:05:47.880> so<00:05:48.840> nobody

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
that and then I would crash so nobody

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.260 
that and then I would crash so nobody
was<00:05:49.560> really<00:05:49.830> ready<00:05:50.160> or<00:05:50.460> willing<00:05:51.030> to<00:05:51.150> believe
