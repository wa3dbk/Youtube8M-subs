00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
stretch is called pelvic Rock with tilt

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.690 
stretch is called pelvic Rock with tilt
and<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.689> purpose<00:00:04.049> of<00:00:04.170> that<00:00:04.319> stretch<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:05.040> to

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
and the purpose of that stretch is to

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.860 
and the purpose of that stretch is to
increase<00:00:06.569> hip<00:00:07.080> abduction<00:00:08.480> external<00:00:09.480> rotation

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
increase hip abduction external rotation

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.730 
increase hip abduction external rotation
and<00:00:10.230> flexion<00:00:11.750> it's<00:00:12.750> an<00:00:12.929> amazing<00:00:13.440> stretch

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
and flexion it's an amazing stretch

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.060 
and flexion it's an amazing stretch
because<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:15.509> position<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.260> I'm<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.500> here

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
because the position that I'm in here

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.359 
because the position that I'm in here
it's<00:00:20.070> essentially<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.000> same<00:00:21.390> as<00:00:21.680> I'm<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.949> here

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
it's essentially the same as I'm in here

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.700 
it's essentially the same as I'm in here
and<00:00:23.640> when<00:00:24.390> I'm<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.779> bottom<00:00:24.930> position<00:00:25.560> of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
and when I'm in the bottom position of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.220 
and when I'm in the bottom position of
the<00:00:25.830> squad<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.970> very<00:00:27.180> very<00:00:27.269> specific

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
the squad so it's a very very specific
