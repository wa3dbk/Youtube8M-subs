Hello evgeryone, i'm Amy

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.950
Mother's day is coming

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:24.553
So today i want to teach you guys how to cook 
 a sweet soup for your family, it's super easy!

00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:27.003
And for your mom, HAHA

00:00:29.348 --> 00:00:31.348
Snow fungus jujubes sweet soup

00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:34.351
Here are the ingredients

00:00:34.898 --> 00:00:37.800
All of the ingredients are good for your health

00:00:40.077 --> 00:00:43.000
First you need to put the snow fungus in to the water

00:00:43.206 --> 00:00:45.206
For half hour

00:00:45.604 --> 00:00:48.000
then you can remove the seeds of the red jujubes

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:50.402
cut in half

00:00:53.122 --> 00:00:55.122
and remove the seed

00:00:56.794 --> 00:00:58.794
a little bit difficult

00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:05.252
and so on

00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:11.300
put it into the water and clean it when you finished

00:01:12.556 --> 00:01:14.556
Cut into three pieces

00:01:21.362 --> 00:01:23.362
After half hour...

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.770
the snow fungus is bigger than before (mean it's ready to cook)

00:01:27.976 --> 00:01:32.976
remove the core of the snow fungus, which is solid 
 and we won't eat it (the yellow part)

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:36.881
(Be careful of using scissors )

00:01:51.397 --> 00:01:56.400
After that, you can break it into pieces

00:02:04.867 --> 00:02:06.870
Then put the snow fungus

00:02:07.365 --> 00:02:09.360
red jujubes

00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:14.660
and water into the bowl, boil the water in medium heat

00:02:14.185 --> 00:02:18.180
Small tips: place a chopstick before you cover the lid

00:02:18.095 --> 00:02:21.100
it can avoid the boiled water to overflow

00:02:23.218 --> 00:02:26.220
turn to low heat when the water boiled

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.760
continue to cook it for 20 minutes

00:02:33.382 --> 00:02:35.380
After 20 minutes...

00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:38.380
You can add the Rock candy into the sweet soup

00:02:39.236 --> 00:02:43.240
Stir it and continue to cook for 10 minutes

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.070
And now is done ~

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.190
