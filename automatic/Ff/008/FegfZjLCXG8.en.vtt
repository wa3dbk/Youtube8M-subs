00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
there's two double crochets into the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.590 
there's two double crochets into the
fifth<00:00:40.739> chain<00:00:41.070> then<00:00:41.879> we're<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.180> work<00:00:42.300> two

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
fifth chain then we're going to work two

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.420 
fifth chain then we're going to work two
more<00:00:42.809> double<00:00:42.989> crochets<00:00:43.469> right<00:00:43.829> into<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> next

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
more double crochets right into the next

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:53.540 
more double crochets right into the next
chain<00:00:46.250> one<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:48.500> two<00:00:51.500> then<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.920> skip<00:00:53.250> two

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
chain one and two then we skip two

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.910 
chain one and two then we skip two
chains<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:54.420> two<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.379> work<00:00:55.620> two<00:00:55.800> double

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
chains one two and work two double

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.900 
chains one two and work two double
crochets<00:00:56.399> into<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.940> next<00:00:56.969> chain

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.760 

and<00:01:03.910> then<00:01:04.390> just<00:01:04.870> as<00:01:04.990> before<00:01:05.290> two<00:01:05.560> double

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
and then just as before two double

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.570 
and then just as before two double
crochets<00:01:06.100> right<00:01:06.430> into<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.730> very<00:01:06.910> next<00:01:07.150> chain

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
crochets right into the very next chain

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.650 
crochets right into the very next chain
so<00:01:09.580> you<00:01:09.640> can<00:01:09.760> see<00:01:09.880> we're<00:01:10.030> working<00:01:10.060> groupings

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
so you can see we're working groupings

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.750 
so you can see we're working groupings
of<00:01:10.840> four<00:01:11.140> double<00:01:11.440> crochets<00:01:11.860> worked<00:01:12.190> into<00:01:12.490> two

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
of four double crochets worked into two

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.520 
of four double crochets worked into two
chains<00:01:14.340> followed<00:01:15.340> by<00:01:16.140> skipping<00:01:17.140> two<00:01:17.260> chains

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
chains followed by skipping two chains

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.040 
chains followed by skipping two chains
skip<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:18.070> next<00:01:18.190> two<00:01:18.480> two<00:01:19.480> double<00:01:19.570> crochets

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
skip the next two two double crochets

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.270 
skip the next two two double crochets
and<00:01:20.230> then<00:01:20.290> each<00:01:20.470> of<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.680> next<00:01:20.860> two<00:01:21.040> chains

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
and then each of the next two chains

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.430 
and then each of the next two chains
you're<00:01:22.090> going<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.360> continue<00:01:22.690> across<00:01:22.930> with

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
you're going to continue across with

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.840 
you're going to continue across with
however<00:01:23.680> many<00:01:23.890> you're<00:01:24.100> making<00:01:24.370> until<00:01:24.670> there

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
however many you're making until there

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.890 
however many you're making until there
are<00:01:24.970> two<00:01:25.240> chains<00:01:25.660> left<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:28.420> there's<00:01:28.630> two

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
are two chains left so there's two

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.500 
are two chains left so there's two
double<00:01:29.200> crochets<00:01:29.530> in<00:01:29.740> that<00:01:29.890> chain<00:01:30.270> work<00:01:31.270> two

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
double crochets in that chain work two

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:41.190 
double crochets in that chain work two
double<00:01:31.840> crochets<00:01:32.350> in<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:32.830> next<00:01:33.130> chain<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
double crochets in the next chain and

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.630 
double crochets in the next chain and
there<00:01:41.350> are<00:01:41.470> just<00:01:41.680> those<00:01:41.860> two<00:01:42.100> chains<00:01:42.400> left

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
there are just those two chains left

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.430 
there are just those two chains left
we're<00:01:43.000> going<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.240> skip<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.690> last<00:01:43.840> chain<00:01:44.200> and

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
we're going to skip the last chain and

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.280 
we're going to skip the last chain and
work<00:01:45.160> a<00:01:45.369> single<00:01:45.880> double<00:01:46.030> crochet<00:01:46.510> right<00:01:46.990> into

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
work a single double crochet right into

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.690 
work a single double crochet right into
the<00:01:47.380> very<00:01:47.590> last<00:01:47.650> chain<00:01:49.500> now<00:01:50.500> this<00:01:51.010> skip<00:01:51.460> one

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
the very last chain now this skip one

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.190 
the very last chain now this skip one
and<00:01:51.910> work<00:01:52.150> at<00:01:52.300> single<00:01:52.630> double<00:01:52.840> crochet

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
and work at single double crochet

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.630 
and work at single double crochet
mirrors<00:01:53.590> what<00:01:53.770> we<00:01:53.800> did<00:01:53.979> at<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.130> beginning<00:01:54.430> by

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
mirrors what we did at the beginning by

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.940 
mirrors what we did at the beginning by
skipping<00:01:54.910> those<00:01:55.180> four<00:01:55.540> at<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.440> beginning<00:01:56.500> we

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
skipping those four at the beginning we

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.370 
skipping those four at the beginning we
had<00:01:57.160> those<00:01:58.030> four<00:01:58.479> counting<00:01:58.900> as<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.050> double

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
had those four counting as a double

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.430 
had those four counting as a double
crochet<00:01:59.470> and<00:01:59.920> one<00:02:00.130> skipped<00:02:00.490> chain<00:02:01.360> so<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:02.229> can

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
crochet and one skipped chain so you can

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.650 
crochet and one skipped chain so you can
see<00:02:02.619> we<00:02:02.860> have<00:02:03.070> our<00:02:03.820> three<00:02:04.119> sets<00:02:04.360> of<00:02:04.479> twin

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
see we have our three sets of twin

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.630 
see we have our three sets of twin
stitches<00:02:05.050> here<00:02:05.260> to<00:02:05.860> begin<00:02:05.979> row<00:02:06.280> two<00:02:06.340> and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
stitches here to begin row two and

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.609 
stitches here to begin row two and
actually<00:02:07.179> every<00:02:07.660> row<00:02:07.810> after<00:02:08.020> that<00:02:08.320> because

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
actually every row after that because

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.260 
actually every row after that because
row<00:02:08.890> two<00:02:08.950> is<00:02:09.130> worked<00:02:09.429> exactly<00:02:09.880> like<00:02:10.030> every

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
row two is worked exactly like every

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.900 
row two is worked exactly like every
other<00:02:10.390> row<00:02:10.980> very<00:02:11.980> easy<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.310> repeat<00:02:12.640> we're

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
other row very easy to repeat we're

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.790 
other row very easy to repeat we're
gonna<00:02:13.030> start<00:02:13.300> with<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.450> chain<00:02:13.660> three<00:02:13.990> which

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
gonna start with a chain three which
