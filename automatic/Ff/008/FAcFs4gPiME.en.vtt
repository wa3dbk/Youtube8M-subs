00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello everyone my name is pour sasha 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.200
 versions also kumiko five by five my y 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.380
 chong come white box 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.230
 Lennochka in Chinese characters better 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.269
 the structure is felix and lies inside 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.130
 paper on one side 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.070
 how to put together the other side is 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.070
 daddy lineup we saved go 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.500
 through the medium of the audience and compare well in 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.269
 you cipher 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.550
 studied for fashion on a smeared there shock show 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.989
 tcm 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.480
 for now let 's postpone the cup comparison 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:40.200
 I also want to note what he put 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.739
 standard for my present and stickers in 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.160
 Unlike 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.170
 but they carried ufa before the time expired 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.590
 constantly bear in mind a 3 portfolio 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.550
 anything 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.239
 I can not throw a simple sticker 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.719
 erased 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:00.510
 lie to me un slightly erased spark 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.219
 my fault i was too curious i 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.930
 I thought it was some kind of film 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.760
 leave stomp withdrawal here goes turned out 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.110
 logos and he began to tie so but 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.590
 comparable standard 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:19.520
 again on 5 shows in the first dimensions he 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:22.979
 marked as nice style 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.220
 also what i want to mark in my cubes and 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.409
 not so fed in general they are not very 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.079
 vary greatly over time but 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.049
 of course when you make 1040 there 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.170
 compare with the original state will 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.479
 suitable I want to quickly but it 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.110
 incomparable to even gone took 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.320
 sheng shou chan &amp; lojaz you scared 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:49.530
 refused need to put in put make 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.420
 thousand dollars then he already becomes 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:57.350
 enjoyable fast or we start 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.350
 rejoice and 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.860
 we take silence 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.910
 well maybe here she look there when he 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.100
 out of the box, and all I do not even faced 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.200
 the fact that you spread them and I certainly 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.580
 rebuilt night was useless 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:19.770
 Equally returned to what was 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:21.690
 initially tuned through mousse well 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.660
 about the newsletter, I probably got excited 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.370
 now maybe there will happen 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.140
 what cant they be you either 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.680
 too much too tight 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.280
 but mostly what cubes and not 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.720
 twisted 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.530
 out of the box they were very good 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.160
 tuned so well if in principle 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:46.020
 the saudov now savchenko ishim walked out 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.060
 boxes then this sky heaven and earth as it were 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:54.480
 here the teacher wins in all respects 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:03:19.860
 he is more pleasant faster and yes he is better 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:20.519
 Gloria kept well, so I said that 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.120
 usually him 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:29.010
 eyepiece in your show with and tuned 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.110
 oiled club 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.260
 I still tend to have a better tank 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.989
 than cowards but still not chinchillas 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:45.500
 probably forget about it very much 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:45.500
 very good piece 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.730
 but the tank has one 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:05.920
 undoubted plus well, at least personally 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:13.989
 does not change his style yes I will explain what it is 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:13.989
 so big and not very fast 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.549
 about the same 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:41.479
 such a kind of chik-chik-chik 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:49.130
 fooling still love his sound well 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:50.540
 let us now trawler structure of spider 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.510
 mane is basically the same 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:58.010
 40 small kite shows and heâ€™s to milk 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:11.870
 Onions under as this problem still would solve 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:14.090
 develop the developers of our show i 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.729
 I think there are few who really 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.000
 understands the essence of the structure that 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.740
 what and how in all the details well, just 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.430
 need to look from the outside like this 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.740
 looks just in the eye look at these 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.350
 Circuits and see what we see here 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.220
 some kind of torpedoes q 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:36.860
 here. rounded here more rude then I 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.940
 that is, shirshov as a whole is rude 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:44.539
 despite the mod like even madina 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:49.470
 Circuits immediately cut down I'm here too wide 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:52.560
 All was originally 1 to the nice also here 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:58.890
 I like very much the base to the lair 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:06:03.060
 jackdaw is flat in contrast to this here 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:05.700
 just like the denture why am I nice 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.660
 Yes, that's even trying lametry that 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:15.570
 talked a little 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:19.040
 edgewise as we see longer here 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.040
 there is some stairs all 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:31.010
 smoothly everything is fine and because 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:34.290
 any gone from standing up when i have them 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:36.930
 I modify and disassemble the corner 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:41.090
 huge sound of all in all 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:45.330
 corners a huge burr just 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.980
 I hate him so I can not imagine how 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.960
 can be diced 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.390
 on the details in such a huge burr 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.030
 this is exactly the sound of the light detail when 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.650
 pour them open several at once 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.530
 this more material when it 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.510
 tear off there is a small burr and in 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:05.540
 the cube is very well felt here 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:05.540
 there is nothing like that 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:14.520
 also seen a place where to be this and strengthen 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:16.229
 he is even tidy but quite small here 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.930
 see the same money hole that with this 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:21.440
 burr had no effect on torsion 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:25.760
 dice 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.760
 so there was a big 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:35.640
 so but I think I will explain to you by the ears that 

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:39.930
 is shin show experience compared scientists shock 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.310
 shock okay principle make your own choices I 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:44.220
 I think there will be people who 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:46.350
 Still, the noise of the show will be etched but I teach 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:52.980
 people who like your hands i think 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:54.140
 there will be more he will also decide the structure here 

00:07:52.980 --> 00:08:05.460
 scope 

00:07:54.140 --> 00:08:09.170
 here the scope just go for it all 

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.170
 Thank you all for your attention.
