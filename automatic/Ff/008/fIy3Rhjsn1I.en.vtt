00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:02.510 

so<00:00:01.290> let's<00:00:01.469> look<00:00:01.560> at<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:01.740> next<00:00:01.890> one<00:00:02.070> well<00:00:02.280> I'm

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
so let's look at the next one well I'm

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.490 
so let's look at the next one well I'm
pretty<00:00:02.700> new<00:00:02.909> at<00:00:03.060> this<00:00:03.210> but<00:00:03.449> here<00:00:03.659> goes<00:00:03.689> I<00:00:04.110> see<00:00:04.470> a

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
pretty new at this but here goes I see a

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.570 
pretty new at this but here goes I see a
gravel<00:00:04.950> bar<00:00:05.100> on<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.460> inside<00:00:05.910> Bend<00:00:06.240> good<00:00:06.779> catch

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
gravel bar on the inside Bend good catch

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.520 
gravel bar on the inside Bend good catch
that<00:00:08.580> would<00:00:08.760> be<00:00:08.910> collecting<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.660> gold<00:00:09.870> so<00:00:10.230> we

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
that would be collecting the gold so we

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.410 
that would be collecting the gold so we
have<00:00:10.679> this<00:00:10.830> gravel<00:00:11.340> bar<00:00:11.490> forming<00:00:12.090> on<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
have this gravel bar forming on the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.259 
have this gravel bar forming on the
inside<00:00:12.870> edge<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.349> Bend<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.889> yes<00:00:14.580> if<00:00:14.910> is

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
inside edge of this Bend and yes if is

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.880 
inside edge of this Bend and yes if is
going<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.719> be<00:00:15.809> one<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.199> places<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.590> catch

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
going to be one of the places that catch

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.260 
going to be one of the places that catch
gold<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.640> has<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.940> do<00:00:18.060> with<00:00:18.150> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
gold and that has to do with the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.390 
gold and that has to do with the
sweeping<00:00:18.690> motion<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.740> helical<00:00:20.189> water

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
sweeping motion of the helical water

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.000 
sweeping motion of the helical water
flow<00:00:20.670> when<00:00:20.970> when<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> storm<00:00:21.810> hits<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.920> is

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
flow when when a storm hits and that is

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.560 
flow when when a storm hits and that is
there's<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.250> corkscrew<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.970> sweeps<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
there's a corkscrew that sweeps the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.390 
there's a corkscrew that sweeps the
water<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.170> inside<00:00:25.710> edge<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.160> bend

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
water to this inside edge of the bend

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.179 
water to this inside edge of the bend
when<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.240> happens<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:28.230> goal<00:00:28.500> gets<00:00:28.890> stuck

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
when that happens the goal gets stuck

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.339 
when that happens the goal gets stuck
underneath<00:00:29.580> these<00:00:29.849> gravels<00:00:30.420> now<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.080> other

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
underneath these gravels now the other

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.810 
underneath these gravels now the other
thing<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.619> happens<00:00:32.070> that's<00:00:32.250> going<00:00:32.520> on<00:00:32.610> is

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
thing that happens that's going on is

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.090 
thing that happens that's going on is
that<00:00:32.940> as<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.510> water<00:00:33.809> really<00:00:34.140> flows<00:00:34.590> these

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
that as this water really flows these

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.860 
that as this water really flows these
gravels<00:00:35.670> are<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.030> agitated<00:00:36.750> then

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
gravels are going to be agitated then

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.780 
gravels are going to be agitated then
bouncing<00:00:37.500> around<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> gold<00:00:38.370> will<00:00:38.579> sift

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
bouncing around and the gold will sift

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.869 
bouncing around and the gold will sift
to<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> bottom<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:40.079> bedrock<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.460> remember

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
to the bottom to bedrock so remember

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.330 
to the bottom to bedrock so remember
that<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.540> bedrock<00:00:43.020> very<00:00:43.829> important<00:00:44.250> to

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
that to bedrock very important to

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.340 
that to bedrock very important to
capture<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.879> notion<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.960> only<00:00:46.140> time<00:00:46.320> that

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
capture that notion the only time that

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.139 
capture that notion the only time that
it<00:00:46.500> won't<00:00:46.739> go<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.980> bedrock<00:00:47.430> will<00:00:47.730> be<00:00:47.910> when

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
it won't go to bedrock will be when

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.110 
it won't go to bedrock will be when
there<00:00:48.300> are<00:00:48.360> layers<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.899> flour<00:00:49.620> gold<00:00:50.039> stuck<00:00:50.940> in

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
there are layers of flour gold stuck in

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.360 
there are layers of flour gold stuck in
layers<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.660> silt<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.110> sands<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.770> don't<00:00:53.070> see<00:00:53.219> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
layers of silt and sands I don't see to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.250 
layers of silt and sands I don't see to
any<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.610> those<00:00:53.670> right<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.270> but<00:00:54.930> if<00:00:55.050> there<00:00:55.199> are

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
any of those right here but if there are

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.930 
any of those right here but if there are
silts<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.620> sands<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.129> these<00:00:56.250> leading<00:00:56.579> edges

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
silts and sands on these leading edges

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.580 
silts and sands on these leading edges
it's<00:00:57.149> worthy<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.840> looking<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> leading

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
it's worthy of looking on the leading

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.200 
it's worthy of looking on the leading
edge<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.100> trailing<00:00:59.160> edge<00:00:59.730> of<00:01:00.030> these

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
edge and the trailing edge of these

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.270 
edge and the trailing edge of these
things<00:01:00.480> because<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.500> that's<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.070> place<00:01:02.250> where

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
things because that that's a place where

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.280 
things because that that's a place where
gold<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.940> kind<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.390> trapped<00:01:03.750> if<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.170> a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
gold can kind of get trapped if it's a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.850 
gold can kind of get trapped if it's a
light<00:01:04.500> particle<00:01:07.400> let's<00:01:08.400> see<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:10.560> particular

in a big flood as easily as the smaller
ones<00:01:30.810> will<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.259> they<00:01:31.380> will<00:01:31.530> tend<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.829> trap<00:01:32.100> more

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
ones will so they will tend to trap more

ones will so they will tend to trap more
gold<00:01:32.579> underneath<00:01:32.880> them<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.229> pretty

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
gold underneath them it can be pretty

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.289

tricky if not dangerous to go underneath

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.420 
tricky if not dangerous to go underneath
these<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> place<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.740> will<00:01:37.829> trap<00:01:38.189> a

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
these but it is a place that will trap a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.080
