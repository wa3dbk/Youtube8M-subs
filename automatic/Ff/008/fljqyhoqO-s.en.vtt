there's<00:01:00.030> from<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> side<00:01:00.750> view<00:01:01.520> looks<00:01:02.520> pretty

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
there's from the side view looks pretty

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.780 
there's from the side view looks pretty
good<00:01:03.199> in<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.589> back<00:01:04.830> view<00:01:05.159> when<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.580> see

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
good in the back view when you see

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.480 
good in the back view when you see
solder<00:01:06.150> there<00:01:06.510> if<00:01:07.290> they<00:01:07.470> remember<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.159> there

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
solder there if they remember to there

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.750

to<00:01:08.939> remove<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> rubber<00:01:10.369> seal<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.400> there

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
to remove the rubber seal on there

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.750 
to remove the rubber seal on there
because<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> waterproof<00:01:13.040> watch<00:01:14.040> I

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
because this is a waterproof watch I

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.969 
because this is a waterproof watch I
doubt<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.299> waterproof<00:01:15.540> anymore<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
doubt it's waterproof anymore but the

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.590 
doubt it's waterproof anymore but the
piece<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.369> rubber<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.820> there<00:01:18.060> inside<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
piece of rubber in there inside the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.929 
piece of rubber in there inside the
crown<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.380> remove<00:01:19.939> because

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
crown that you have to remove because

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.990 
crown that you have to remove because
not<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:22.200> will<00:01:22.350> melt<00:01:22.680> when<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.220> apply<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.670> heat

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
not it will melt when you apply the heat

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.499 
not it will melt when you apply the heat
to<00:01:24.210> do<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.509> soldering<00:01:25.880> so<00:01:26.880> that's<00:01:27.270> the

anything<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.950> grip<00:03:17.159> on<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.989> but<00:03:18.989> now<00:03:20.419> it<00:03:21.419> works

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:21.689 
anything to grip on to but now it works

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.559 
anything to grip on to but now it works
good<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.639> think<00:03:23.639> I'm<00:03:23.700> going<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:23.879> do<00:03:24.060> now<00:03:24.269> with

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
good I think I'm going to do now with

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.539 
good I think I'm going to do now with
maybe<00:03:25.079> make<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.739> little<00:03:25.889> bit<00:03:26.069> smaller<00:03:26.310> in

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
maybe make it a little bit smaller in

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.580 
maybe make it a little bit smaller in
diameter<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:27.419> then<00:03:27.540> I'm<00:03:27.810> going<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:27.989> file<00:03:28.230> some

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
diameter and then I'm going to file some

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.619 
diameter and then I'm going to file some
ridges<00:03:29.010> on<00:03:29.159> there<00:03:29.430> so<00:03:29.639> it<00:03:29.700> gives<00:03:29.970> me<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.209> better

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
ridges on there so it gives me a better

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.909 
ridges on there so it gives me a better
gripping<00:03:31.400> but<00:03:32.400> that's<00:03:33.030> how<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.500> rebuild<00:03:34.500> the

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
gripping but that's how you rebuild the

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.599 
gripping but that's how you rebuild the
watch<00:03:35.099> crown<00:03:35.519> on<00:03:35.879> the<00:03:36.239> cheap<00:03:36.510> way<00:03:37.310> this<00:03:38.310> case

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
watch crown on the cheap way this case

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.170 
watch crown on the cheap way this case
has<00:03:38.819> really<00:03:38.849> seen<00:03:39.389> better<00:03:39.659> days<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:42.030> good

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
has really seen better days and a good

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.050 
has really seen better days and a good
good<00:03:42.329> be<00:03:42.569> able<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.780> grew<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.940> got<00:03:44.940> little

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
good be able to grew and got little

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.629 
good be able to grew and got little
weights<00:03:45.449> on<00:03:45.659> the<00:03:45.840> balance<00:03:46.530> which<00:03:47.129> means<00:03:47.159> it's

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
weights on the balance which means it's

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:53.180 
weights on the balance which means it's
I<00:03:48.090> guess<00:03:48.750> an<00:03:48.900> early<00:03:49.260> one<00:03:51.470> watch<00:03:52.470> ones<00:03:52.919> pretty

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
I guess an early one watch ones pretty

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.650 
I guess an early one watch ones pretty
good<00:03:54.260> unsatisfied<00:03:55.260> with<00:03:55.290> it

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
good unsatisfied with it

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.220 
good unsatisfied with it
so<00:03:57.500> that's<00:03:57.770> all<00:03:57.980> for<00:03:58.160> now
