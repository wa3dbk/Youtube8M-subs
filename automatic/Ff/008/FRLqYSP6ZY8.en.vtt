 my hundredth video of my small reviews 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.160
 collection and this video I decided to do 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.030
 such here show you a small 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.830
 the conversion I did and what I wanted

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:27.269
 in such a body it was originally 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:31.160
 Shabak's model of my first video 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:35.969
 just now i'm telling 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.450
 This model has several models in this 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.670
 bodywork 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:45.329
 and here is one of them i redid what was 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:50.700
 made it was modified front 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.989

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.289
 made from transparent plastic and added 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.609
 such a small range below were 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.719
 wheel rims replaced 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:07.979
 I did not find the original discs, but 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.310
 tried to do something like that 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.729
 if only because they are the originals 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.369
 made daisies i don't have such i 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.729
 put at least asterisks was also 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.060
 modified rear bumper made 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.970
 muffler model was painted black 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.049
 color is the original color of mercedes u 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.710
 I was mercedes cl 500 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:38.610
 that's the same color it's 197 if not 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:43.610
 wrong code so I decided to paint such 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.479
 same color interior has been repainted in 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.759
 original model he was 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.820
 Light made in black was 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.780
 painted wheel imitation wood was 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.979
 I also tried to paint the motor 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.070
 like the original machine itself 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:08.700
 motor black block and 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:13.860
 With such red more precisely on block red 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:17.340
 all hinged black i'm sorry you all everything 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.870
 the rest principle remains as in 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.840
 the original model that is who wants 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.490
