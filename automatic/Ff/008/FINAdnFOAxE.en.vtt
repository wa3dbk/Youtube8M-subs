00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.469 
build up lock ice block ice and then you
just<00:01:53.729> do<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.329> all<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.659> way<00:01:56.240> actually<00:01:57.240> see

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
just do that all the way actually see

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.870 
just do that all the way actually see
this<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.780> gonna<00:01:58.369> actually<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.520> won't<00:01:59.729> mess

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
this is gonna actually that won't mess

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.719 
this is gonna actually that won't mess
it<00:02:00.030> up<00:02:00.090> that'll<00:02:00.360> be<00:02:00.420> fine<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.460> block<00:02:02.460> ice

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
it up that'll be fine and block ice

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.060 
it up that'll be fine and block ice
block<00:02:03.119> ice<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.930> again<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.320> survival<00:02:04.770> it's<00:02:04.890> not

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
block ice so again on survival it's not

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.310 
block ice so again on survival it's not
that<00:02:05.219> hard<00:02:05.430> much<00:02:05.729> easier<00:02:06.180> way<00:02:06.390> than<00:02:06.750> making<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
that hard much easier way than making a

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.199 
that hard much easier way than making a
well<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.069> mean<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.759> minecart<00:02:09.149> elevator

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
well I mean I like the minecart elevator

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.330 
well I mean I like the minecart elevator
but<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.770> gonna<00:02:10.950> be<00:02:11.009> way<00:02:11.310> easier

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
but this is gonna be way easier

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.520 
but this is gonna be way easier
resource-wise

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
resource-wise

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:24.080 
resource-wise
block<00:02:14.100> ice<00:02:14.370> block<00:02:14.850> ice<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:23.490> there<00:02:23.820> you<00:02:23.910> go<00:02:24.060> so

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
block ice block ice and there you go so

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.180 
block ice block ice and there you go so
once<00:02:24.420> you've<00:02:24.600> made<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:25.020> like<00:02:25.260> that<00:02:25.470> you're

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
once you've made that like that you're

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.980 
once you've made that like that you're
most<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.910> way<00:02:27.030> done<00:02:27.300> notice<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:27.780> one

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
most of the way done notice this one

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.320 
most of the way done notice this one
down<00:02:28.140> here<00:02:28.380> has<00:02:28.530> melted<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.970> what<00:02:30.210> you're

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
down here has melted so what you're

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.180 
down here has melted so what you're
gonna<00:02:30.480> want<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.810> do<00:02:30.960> next<00:02:31.260> guys<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.770> go<00:02:32.070> ahead

gonna want to do next guys is go ahead
and<00:02:32.400> delete<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.480> blocks<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:33.990> between<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> ice

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.550 

not<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.900> guy<00:02:41.360> just<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.570> blocks<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:43.110> between

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
not that guy just the blocks in between

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.590 
not that guy just the blocks in between
the<00:02:43.710> ice<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.150> again<00:02:45.150> what<00:02:45.360> you're<00:02:45.480> gonna

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
you don't want any blocks registering in

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.160 
you don't want any blocks registering in
so<00:03:07.080> first<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.040> all<00:03:08.130> go<00:03:08.190> ahead<00:03:08.490> and<00:03:08.760> throw<00:03:09.170> still

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.470 
so first of all go ahead and throw still
some<00:03:10.320> glowstone<00:03:10.770> up<00:03:10.950> here<00:03:11.220> do<00:03:11.430> not<00:03:11.460> put<00:03:12.360> it

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
some glowstone up here do not put it

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.150 
some glowstone up here do not put it
right<00:03:12.630> next<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.140> but<00:03:13.380> as<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.710> can<00:03:13.830> see<00:03:13.890> we're

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
right next to but as you can see we're

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.620 
right next to but as you can see we're
gonna<00:03:14.220> do<00:03:14.490> that<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.940> then<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.270> other<00:03:15.390> thing

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
gonna do that and then the other thing

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.660 
gonna do that and then the other thing
you're<00:03:15.750> gonna<00:03:15.870> do<00:03:16.140> guys<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.560> on<00:03:16.770> the<00:03:16.920> diagonal

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
you're gonna do guys is on the diagonal

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.760 
you're gonna do guys is on the diagonal
see<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.300> diagonal<00:03:18.810> corner<00:03:21.470> put<00:03:22.470> them<00:03:22.590> down

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
see this diagonal corner put them down

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.900 
see this diagonal corner put them down
like<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:24.950> there<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.070> go<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:26.520> as<00:03:26.730> you've

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
like this and there you go so as you've

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.630 
like this and there you go so as you've
done<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.300> now<00:03:27.570> you<00:03:27.630> can<00:03:27.900> see<00:03:28.310> what<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.430> have

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
done that now you can see what you have

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.180 
done that now you can see what you have
created<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.780> ladder<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.380> need<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:31.890> notice

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
created is the ladder you need so notice

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.190 
created is the ladder you need so notice
the<00:03:32.340> top<00:03:32.550> has<00:03:32.730> turned<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.120> water<00:03:33.420> so<00:03:33.810> once<00:03:34.020> that

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
the top has turned to water so once that

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.229 
the top has turned to water so once that
happens<00:03:34.590> we<00:03:34.739> can<00:03:34.770> get<00:03:35.340> rid<00:03:35.520> of<00:03:35.580> this<00:03:35.900> and

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
happens we can get rid of this and

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.729 
happens we can get rid of this and
you'll<00:03:39.239> notice<00:03:39.540> slowly<00:03:39.930> but<00:03:40.170> surely<00:03:40.200> these

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
you'll notice slowly but surely these

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.320 
you'll notice slowly but surely these
ones<00:03:40.950> here<00:03:41.130> are<00:03:41.310> not<00:03:41.489> gonna<00:03:41.640> take<00:03:41.880> very<00:03:41.940> long

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
ones here are not gonna take very long

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.030 
ones here are not gonna take very long
but<00:03:42.660> they're<00:03:42.870> gonna<00:03:42.989> turn<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.440> water<00:03:43.590> -<00:03:43.830> it's

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
but they're gonna turn to water - it's

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.690 
but they're gonna turn to water - it's
kind<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.430> glitch<00:03:44.750> in<00:03:45.800> the<00:03:46.800> game<00:03:46.830> that<00:03:47.400> lets

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
kind of a glitch in the game that lets

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.690 
kind of a glitch in the game that lets
the<00:03:47.910> water<00:03:48.090> kind<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.600> hold<00:03:48.840> up<00:03:48.989> like<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.700> but

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
the water kind of hold up like that but

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.490 
the water kind of hold up like that but
as<00:03:50.820> you<00:03:50.970> can<00:03:51.120> see<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.420> works<00:03:51.630> super<00:03:52.080> good<00:03:52.260> is

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
as you can see it works super good is

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.229 
as you can see it works super good is
this<00:03:52.800> super<00:03:53.190> cool<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.640> know<00:03:53.760> instead<00:03:54.180> of

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
this super cool you know instead of

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.600 
this super cool you know instead of
having<00:03:54.360> glass<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.320> signs<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:56.040> all<00:03:56.160> this<00:03:56.340> jazz

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
having glass and signs and all this jazz

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.580 
having glass and signs and all this jazz
so<00:03:59.610> as<00:03:59.820> you<00:04:00.060> see<00:04:00.239> as<00:04:00.480> they<00:04:00.810> melt<00:04:00.989> down<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.410> can

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
so as you see as they melt down you can

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.630 
so as you see as they melt down you can
bus<00:04:01.800> them<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:03.380> just<00:04:04.380> leave<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.950> ones<00:04:05.130> closest

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
bus them I just leave the ones closest

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.759 
bus them I just leave the ones closest
to<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.880> water<00:04:09.140> you'll<00:04:10.140> see<00:04:10.350> you<00:04:10.500> have<00:04:10.530> your

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
to the water you'll see you have your

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.100 
to the water you'll see you have your
lighter<00:04:10.980> very<00:04:11.370> soon<00:04:11.700> again<00:04:12.300> totally<00:04:12.870> doable

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
lighter very soon again totally doable

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.680 
lighter very soon again totally doable
and<00:04:13.380> survival<00:04:13.970> works<00:04:14.970> really<00:04:15.209> cool<00:04:15.510> it

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
and survival works really cool it

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.050 
and survival works really cool it
actually<00:04:15.989> looks<00:04:16.200> really<00:04:16.500> nice<00:04:16.910> when<00:04:17.910> you

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
actually looks really nice when you

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.270 
actually looks really nice when you
really<00:04:18.359> break<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:18.570> down<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:19.019> it<00:04:19.140> so<00:04:19.470> let's<00:04:20.040> get

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
really break it down to it so let's get

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.480 
really break it down to it so let's get
rid<00:04:20.489> of<00:04:20.549> this<00:04:20.970> guy<00:04:21.239> right<00:04:21.450> here

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
rid of this guy right here

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.200 
rid of this guy right here
almost<00:04:23.490> there

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.290 

shouldn't<00:04:30.210> be<00:04:30.270> very<00:04:30.570> long<00:04:31.550> but<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:32.880> works<00:04:33.150> like

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
shouldn't be very long but it works like

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.450 
shouldn't be very long but it works like
honestly<00:04:33.900> super<00:04:34.380> handy<00:04:34.770> look<00:04:34.980> out<00:04:35.100> look<00:04:35.310> how

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
honestly super handy look out look how

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.390 
honestly super handy look out look how
tight<00:04:35.700> that<00:04:35.820> is<00:04:36.410> very<00:04:37.410> tight<00:04:37.770> way<00:04:37.950> to<00:04:38.010> get<00:04:38.250> up

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
tight that is very tight way to get up

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.980 
tight that is very tight way to get up
something<00:04:38.790> all<00:04:38.970> you<00:04:39.090> got<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.300> do<00:04:39.420> is<00:04:39.540> just<00:04:39.570> jump

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
something all you got to do is just jump

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.290 
something all you got to do is just jump
in<00:04:40.140> and<00:04:40.410> go<00:04:40.920> for<00:04:41.100> the<00:04:41.190> ride<00:04:41.370> you<00:04:41.940> don't<00:04:42.030> have<00:04:42.210> to

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
in and go for the ride you don't have to

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.850 
in and go for the ride you don't have to
worry<00:04:42.480> about<00:04:42.600> breathing<00:04:43.020> because<00:04:43.560> you<00:04:43.710> have

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
worry about breathing because you have

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.760 
worry about breathing because you have
holes<00:04:44.130> in<00:04:44.370> between<00:04:44.700> each<00:04:44.910> one<00:04:45.230> I<00:04:46.230> haven't

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
holes in between each one I haven't

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.410 
holes in between each one I haven't
quite<00:04:46.950> figured<00:04:47.190> out<00:04:47.400> how<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.610> put<00:04:47.910> this<00:04:48.060> into<00:04:48.300> a

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
quite figured out how to put this into a

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.210 
quite figured out how to put this into a
mob<00:04:48.690> farm<00:04:48.990> yet<00:04:49.200> just<00:04:49.410> cuz<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.800> mobs<00:04:50.040> would

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
mob farm yet just cuz the mobs would

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.190 
mob farm yet just cuz the mobs would
probably<00:04:50.550> move<00:04:50.730> left<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:51.120> right<00:04:51.240> which<00:04:52.020> is

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
probably move left and right which is

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.140 
probably move left and right which is
something<00:04:52.410> that'll<00:04:52.770> throw<00:04:52.980> me<00:04:53.310> off<00:04:53.520> so<00:04:53.910> I

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
something that'll throw me off so I

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.970 
something that'll throw me off so I
think<00:04:54.450> I'll<00:04:54.930> just<00:04:55.200> use<00:04:55.380> this<00:04:55.530> for<00:04:55.800> personal

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
think I'll just use this for personal

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.870 
think I'll just use this for personal
use<00:04:56.430> for<00:04:56.670> now<00:04:57.170> and<00:04:58.190> let's<00:04:59.190> go<00:04:59.370> over<00:04:59.550> here<00:04:59.820> and

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
use for now and let's go over here and

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.700 
use for now and let's go over here and
let's<00:05:00.120> see<00:05:00.300> what<00:05:00.450> we<00:05:00.540> could<00:05:00.690> do<00:05:00.900> you<00:05:01.110> could

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
let's see what we could do you could

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.610 
let's see what we could do you could
actually<00:05:02.510> speed<00:05:03.510> this<00:05:03.690> process<00:05:03.930> up<00:05:04.320> if<00:05:04.500> you

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
actually speed this process up if you

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.140 
actually speed this process up if you
really<00:05:04.920> wanted<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.310> as<00:05:05.460> long<00:05:05.490> as<00:05:05.820> you<00:05:05.940> do<00:05:06.120> not

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
really wanted to as long as you do not

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.380 
really wanted to as long as you do not
update<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.900> blocks<00:05:07.230> right<00:05:07.380> next<00:05:08.100> right<00:05:09.060> next

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
update the blocks right next right next

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.300 
update the blocks right next right next
is<00:05:09.510> if<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:09.840> put<00:05:10.080> a<00:05:10.110> block<00:05:10.380> right<00:05:10.710> next<00:05:10.920> to<00:05:11.190> it

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
is if you put a block right next to it

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.970 
is if you put a block right next to it
it's<00:05:11.520> gonna<00:05:11.670> open<00:05:11.940> the<00:05:12.210> source<00:05:12.390> of<00:05:12.600> water<00:05:12.980> but

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
it's gonna open the source of water but

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.770 
it's gonna open the source of water but
if<00:05:14.130> you<00:05:14.280> really<00:05:14.520> wanted<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.000> say<00:05:15.300> speed<00:05:15.570> it<00:05:15.660> up

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
if you really wanted to say speed it up

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.110 
if you really wanted to say speed it up
you<00:05:15.930> could<00:05:16.170> put<00:05:16.440> these<00:05:16.590> ones<00:05:16.860> here<00:05:17.040> see<00:05:17.370> those

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
you could put these ones here see those

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.880 
you could put these ones here see those
ones<00:05:18.360> there<00:05:18.540> won't<00:05:18.840> affect<00:05:19.200> it<00:05:19.320> but<00:05:19.650> if<00:05:19.770> you

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890
