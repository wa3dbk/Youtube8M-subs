00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:12.150
 once again I come to bring you a trick 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:15.780
 revealed this brings a little story 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.660
 given the letters they use 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.029
 and I hope to summarize the enough because if 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.060
 already as a general rule it is only explaining 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.320
 or I roll more than the account then with 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.699
 your story can be something 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.699
 good epicor 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.780
 now you need for this game 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.050
 you need to have placed 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.420
 the king the range of hearts 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.870
 the king at the bottom of the deck 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.430
 and the lady in tenth position of top or 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.960
 be two three four five six seven 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.870
 eight nine well I wanted when the letters 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.420
 will be in this position in tenth and in 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.120
 last 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.059
 to get to these positions you can 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.589
 doing it in two ways one is already having 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.049
 prepared letters and make a 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.890
 series of false accounts you can 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.770
 found on my channel 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.110
 or deceive your viewers your 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.040
 spectators your audience 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.370
 while you speak you are manipulating the 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.160
 letters you extract them and put the lady in the 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.890
 top of the king in the part of 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.200
 down and to continue fooling your audience 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.630
 It is performed as a false mixture that is 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.240
 a mixture with a control 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.049
 american mix you drop the first 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.960
 on the right that is the king you deposit the 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:41.340
 top letter 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.640
 the last and until here you have a first 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.070
 control 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.400
 and now while you're still talking to your 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.530
 public you make a mix like I've already 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.570
 said of 10 cards can take you to 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.610
 the bottom with a break them 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.250
 you explain that you are going to make a story of 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.580
 love you need a spectator fits 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.830
 say and while holding is the break 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.360
 then at a certain moment short and you 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.479
 you take to the top now 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.430
 you have the lady in tenth position and the 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:15.100
 King in last thing said for this game 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.850
 you will need a lady or lady 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.620
 questions that if you remember your first love 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.140
 we have all had a first love a 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.450
 first infatuation to one of the 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.470
 early 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.240
 and you say what 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.640
 there are people who can get anemones 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.770
 even up to the early age of 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.290
 10 years normal between 10 and 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.030
 20 is when you fall in love it 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.740
 conditions the person who chooses a 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.930
 age between the numbers that 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.610
 you just gave that ultimately you're going to 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:48.060
 do a control on account of 10 to 20 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.670
 with the one that indicates you 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.970
 therefore proceed to comment that and 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.280
 I gave him and you tell him yes I remember the 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.020
 age suppose yes and that the lady 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.819
 a Mr. vidal indicates that he fell in love 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.770
 first time at fourteen since you 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:07.590
 you say look you almost chosen the number 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:11.280
 14 agree 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.550
 and 14 we extract 14 letters from 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.900
 these of these 14 people will do what 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:22.049
 what you need is to simplify the 14 for 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.290
 get to the lady we have it placed 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:29.069
 between medium and how is a control by 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:33.209
 numerical account will simplify the 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:35.700
 14-14 how the sums are simplified on the 1st and 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.239
 the 4 needs the two digits hence 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.160
 always this game or this type of games 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.890
 require that the chosen number be 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.319
 chosen superior is greater than 10 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.280
 because two numbers have to be added 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:53.920
 well 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:57.069
 tell the lady that there is an age in 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:01.720
 which one has knowledge of sex 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.730
 of the opposite sex and to determine that 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.390
 age as we do not know for sure 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.209
 you're going to do it by simplifying your age of 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:14.770
 falling in love and you're going to make a sum of 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:17.669
 the two numbers one plus 45 is the excuse 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.630
 perfect to carry out said mixture 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.490
 obviously you will not find a little 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:26.819
 possibly bizarre but 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.729
 it is necessary you sell it like that 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:31.050
 accounts 1 2 3 4 and the fifth letter the 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.180
 you leave soldier 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.400
 the fifth letter is already the lady of 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.410
 hearts opening casino the samples 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.979
 you keep a lot of cards in your hand 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.050
 left and left the deck aside 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:46.830
 you need to place the deck on top 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.580
 of the tube 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.490
 a lot and the rest of the letters that 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.200
 they are not good for anything on the deck 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.970
 you tell me that obviously when there was a 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.310
 infatuation at his young age of 14 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:07.950
 years there was a king 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:12.410
 she is a lady and her king in love 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:15.630
 you ask if it existed and if you remember the 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.880
 age of your lover that maybe not 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.590
 It corresponded but well suppose 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.800
 What does it say to you? 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.110
 for example, he was 15 years old 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.120
 so you can do exactly what 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:36.510
 same but this time with the letters of 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:39.850
 face and you do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 14 15 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:42.390
 taking the voice the same example as in 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.390
 Their case 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.560
 are you going to do the simplification again 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.010
 he had knowledge of the opposite sex to 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.800
 some concrete age and we extract it 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.570
 adding the 1 plus the circus that gives 6 for 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.280
 proceed to count six letters because 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.780
 now it will appear from every so 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.480
 before proceeding with the 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:08.940
 history and they indicate you 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:13.260
 look how nice it would be for your king 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.670
 I was in love I still remembered you from 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:21.870
 What way can we know it? 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:25.980
 you do 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 of all is known 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:29.180
 that the symbol of the heart is the one 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:32.900
 It represents love King 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:35.080
 He has always been with his lady of 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.139
 hearts 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.190
 then you can present as I say before 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:43.900
 a lady 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.650
 and depending on what 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:50.090
 well 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:52.669
 during the possibility of thank you very much 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.180
 I hope you liked it until 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.180
 next video
