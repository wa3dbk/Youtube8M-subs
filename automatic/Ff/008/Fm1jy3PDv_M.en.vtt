00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
not fresh at all I think it's like

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.950 
not fresh at all I think it's like
twenty<00:04:47.699> eight<00:04:47.880> percent<00:04:48.120> something<00:04:48.630> like<00:04:48.780> that

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
twenty eight percent something like that

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.320 
twenty eight percent something like that
there's<00:04:49.349> a<00:04:49.440> film<00:04:49.860> that<00:04:50.160> is<00:04:50.789> I<00:04:51.000> think<00:04:51.060> it's

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
there's a film that is I think it's

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.760 
there's a film that is I think it's
called<00:04:51.449> the<00:04:51.539> last<00:04:51.750> legion<00:04:52.319> or<00:04:52.410> something<00:04:52.650> like

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
called the last legion or something like

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.200 
called the last legion or something like
that<00:04:52.919> that<00:04:53.039> came<00:04:53.190> out<00:04:53.310> a<00:04:53.340> few<00:04:53.400> years<00:04:53.580> ago<00:04:53.880> and

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
that that came out a few years ago and

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.450 
that that came out a few years ago and
it's<00:04:54.330> at<00:04:54.449> 16%<00:04:54.990> of<00:04:55.560> so<00:04:55.770> that's<00:04:55.919> that's<00:04:56.250> really

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
it's at 16% of so that's that's really

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.830 
it's at 16% of so that's that's really
bad<00:04:56.759> but<00:04:56.849> he<00:04:56.970> gave<00:04:57.120> it<00:04:57.240> a<00:04:57.270> hell<00:04:57.419> of<00:04:57.449> an<00:04:57.599> effort

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
bad but he gave it a hell of an effort

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.080 
bad but he gave it a hell of an effort
because<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.080> King's<00:04:58.440> Speech<00:04:58.620> is<00:04:59.009> his<00:04:59.759> number

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
because the King's Speech is his number
