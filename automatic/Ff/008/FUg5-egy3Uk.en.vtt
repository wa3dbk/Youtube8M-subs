00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 every woman has a way of thinking 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.259
 act and clear to dress 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.380
 thinking about this fashion can be divided 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.650
 in up to 7 sports styles 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.379
 elegant romantic is sexy modern or 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.439
 creative you know your style 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.990
 distracted, fun, I'm more casual 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.880
 I use or what I think it is 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.949
 that looks good on me one more thing 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.859
 I'm comfortable, I'm comfortable. 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.560
 more chic jumps and such I like 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.130
 classic old parts that are not 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.200
 expensive expensive bills that have a 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.030
 more contemporary proposal like 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.219
 to study I think my style depends 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.680
 a lot of the day of my mood however well 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.510
 versatile of the most fashionable little girls 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.649
 I can put a different part with a 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.340
 different shoe with a different voice 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.559
 another piece of branding and the show 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.469
 classic but at the same time I try to be 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.590
 not to look like a 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.820
 little younger than the girl as 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.870
 woman can find her own 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.250
 style 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.930
 good first you have to understand 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.939
 What is the lifestyle she has today? 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.040
 it is not what type of transport 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.110
 public she uses she has not even if she is 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.850
 emagrecendo is not dress code of 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.920
 work is also very important 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.650
 the other way she also has to think 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.240
 How does she feel about that outfit then? 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.729
 if she is happy she feels 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.680
 comfortable thus adding the two she 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.799
 Can you figure out her style? 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.670
 women feel more secure and 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.720
 when they are using their 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.700
 own style 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.259
 yes yes when you arrive in an environment 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.270
 which is below adequate and only 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.250
 feeling super beautiful super beautiful 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.259
 with those clothes and has 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.400
 not be self-confident right 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.530
 and what are the main 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.070
 characteristics of each style 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.210
 well everyone with any style has a 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.670
 several characteristics that it can 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.610
 talk that you can talk about 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.680
 Wear Color Shape Using 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.229
 colors and textures when we talk 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.880
 sports woman natural woman she she 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.520
 usually she wants to get the image of 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.399
 a comfortable friendly woman is not 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.619
 so she will always wear clothes 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.530
 more natural speaking than natural is what 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.810
 she in the tissues with more trim 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.390
 natural and trim too little 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.730
 Larguinho then a knock 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.370
 a less adjusted mesh not so 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.350
 of the body and how it speaks in color 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.600
 she will always work with the colors or 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.209
 monochrome or those more 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.080
 similar to those in the 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.700
 Colors 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.520
 usually when they print 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.520
 striped xadres but always trying 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.250
 following this coloring a shoe is also 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.140
 always turned everything to the comfort that 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.170
 arrived from the woman is the traditional style 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.780
 which is classic contemporary is that 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.670
 kind of woman who does not like to draw 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.590
 attention she likes to fit into the 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.720
 environment that she is all generally she 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.080
 will wear what more classic clothes an 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.810
 a little piece of cardboard 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.519
 More cool monochromatic colors too 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.440
 not to draw so much attention she does not 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.690
 want to undo and with that she can 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.180
 to pass on the image that it is more 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.560
 trustworthy understood this is the truth and 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.630
 which is adequate 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.540
 no she does not want to draw attention the 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.489
 style is refined elegant is the style 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.989
 of that really refined woman she 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.360
 wants to pass that woman that she is 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.340
 impeccable that she cares 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.920
 but that she does not make an effort 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.260
 So that's how you use the clothes. 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.160
 again it comes with more 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.010
 noble is not much tailoring and so 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.690
 the most basic pencil skirt pieces one 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.579
 pants waiting for jeans plus 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.769
 cut a straight shirt more 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.440
 structured is not and with more look 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.420
 monochrome not to be so one 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.560
 monotonous in this type of look 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.200
 We always tell us to use 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.230
 textures like what we put together here 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.579
 You have the right texture in the pencil skirt 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.090
 monochrome color coordination 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:52.100
 neutral but differentiated is not the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.890
 black with black black with white 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.989
 we have a woman's style later 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.200
 to romantic woman she likes 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.660
 to get the attention of the man she wants 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.390
 show that she is beautiful that she is the 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.040
 beauty of her there then I like to call 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.299
 Attention this way then it will not 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.549
 wear clothes also in the more colors 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:17.900
 but it will assign the 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.940
 type of tissue and render more fluid FuÃ¡ 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.580
 also always this cartel of colors 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.139
 much closer to the romantic spoon that 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.849
 she has doll face 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.650
 It's a doll house and a plait in the 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:30.199
 hair usually the romantic woman 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.360
 that way the woman sex is that 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.669
 woman who wants to show the body is that 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.770
 You think it's beautiful that you hold that look. 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.689
 woman then she will always use a 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.960
 shorter clothing with longer necklines 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:45.379
 deep good animal transparency 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.740
 print uses a lot too and she's going to go 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:50.870
 for golden glow clothing applications 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.090
 stones etc. 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.189
 the dramatic woman we're talking about today 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.710
 of the dramatic woman that the modern 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:05:00.710
 Urban because we called that because 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.439
 she last she wears the clothes of shapes 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.300
 but if you stop to think more about 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:08.449
 architecture and theologians the most 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.000
 closed from black to black or one piece 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.919
 more asymmetrical type medical shorts one 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.080
 sweater with a collar 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.080
 but always everything much more 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.389
 monochrome and without much visual brightness 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.580
 cleaner but more geared towards 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.650
 this kind of impact it will reach 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.300
 everyone will notice her attention 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.279
 only in this type of focus 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.930
 Do you know the woman who buys the party? 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:31.610
 parade baffle that nobody uses 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.849
 then this is the modern woman and 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.740
 dramatic mix of prints is very strong 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.110
 in the creative woman when she goes 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.139
 to dress she has fun with that she does not 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.279
 It's there for that clothes and thinking 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.259
 the other is not there because it is 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:49.129
 playing and playful she puts on a floral 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:51.139
 Chess with lace uses a 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:53.149
 Totally bug that no one use and 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:55.219
 she draws the attention of that woman very much 

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:59.139
 who likes to call the attention of being 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:59.139
 noticed but because it is different 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.130
 no matter what your style the 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:25.169
 important is you feel good 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.169
 comfortable and clear self-assured
