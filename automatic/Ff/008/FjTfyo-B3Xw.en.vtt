00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.890
 hello how in this video are you going to learn how to make the point 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.549
 slipping a hoist point regularly is used when 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.940
 we have a finished garment let's imagine that these are the points of 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.070
 our finished garment this is 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.429
 to L 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.519
 if you learn it in the way 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.519
 complicated 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.940
 well a point of view we do not always start it with a chain 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.480
 this chain 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.490
 i'm going to take the machine does not want us 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.280
 our position 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.199
 covers all these points this one 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.180
 we are going to weave then a chain 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.530
 and we're going to start the spot we're going to take the point but now it's not 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.680
 the point below 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.090
 let's take the point above 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.380
 here 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.679
 the point from above we put out 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.840
 and we get out 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.880
 again 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.469
 punctuated we do not do any race simply 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.540
 I'm afraid our hook a part of the point above 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.770
 we put it in place and take it out, that's why it's called sliding 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.680
 because leguizamón this hook up outside 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.680
 again 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.740
 in the next point by the top we put out 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.100
 out 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.000
 This visa point can also help you to join garments 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.960
 that's why it's important to know 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.350
 we take out 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.210
 let's go slowly china zhang 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.730
 without asad 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.840
 we put in the following point for the part above 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.580
 we take out 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.580
 and disdains masters 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.270
 next point that are on the top 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.910
 we take out 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.220
 here you can observe percent success in the types so go 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.720
 watching as I move my hand 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.809
 so that you can see my fingers where they are going when I make this point 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:13.039
 same in the previous points 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:14.699
 I put here 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.009
 my hand they give me is a little 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:19.029
 sacco 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:23.260
 I slime these fingers to guarantee he was going to help me and slide the easiest 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:25.729
 again 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:29.519
 I sometimes move I'm there not 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.839
 rather this hand and the tour a bit 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:33.959
 sacco 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.469
 I compose my fingers will match the fabric and slid out the other option 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:42.050
 is the previous one that I did that new the right hand instead of moving the 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.359
 left 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.849
 put point 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.589
 new resign done I did not move I think two o'clock at night good 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:51.949
 maybe grabbed set 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:58.059
 you support yourself in your hands which easiest front remove 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:01.129
 will pay the fabric chalk basket outside 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.129
 Here we are leaving the point of view that if they are really fixed 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.009
 it looks like a chain on another 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:12.159
 at this point of visa on a chain helps us to make cordoncillos 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.219
 per cent that can be used for garments 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.219
 that we have 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.969
 already at some point I will put a video with some project of these 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:26.119
 this is our last point that we are going to take your 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:30.739
 these tactically is not teaching them a second round because the 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.360
 point of view is always 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.339
 to join garments 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:39.409
 to put the end of the return of hanin from one of our garments 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.060
 also give a finished 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.930
 so 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.449
 this is basically 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:45.609
 how we made the visa point no 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.939
 luck and they will agree to salgán squealed that is very interesting until the 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:50.129
 next
