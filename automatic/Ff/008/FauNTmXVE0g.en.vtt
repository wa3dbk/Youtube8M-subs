hi<00:00:09.300> I'm<00:00:10.300> Keith<00:00:10.690> and<00:00:11.020> this<00:00:11.950> is<00:00:12.130> Keith<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:14.670> today

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
hi I'm Keith and this is Keith and today

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.010 
hi I'm Keith and this is Keith and today
we<00:00:16.059> are<00:00:16.240> going<00:00:16.450> to<00:00:16.570> be<00:00:16.780> talking<00:00:17.050> about<00:00:17.340> planes

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
we are going to be talking about planes

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.109 
we are going to be talking about planes
RC<00:00:20.020> airplanes<00:00:20.590> and<00:00:21.340> what<00:00:21.670> makes<00:00:21.850> them

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
RC airplanes and what makes them

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.300 
RC airplanes and what makes them
different<00:00:22.180> from<00:00:22.920> any<00:00:23.920> other<00:00:24.340> airplane<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:27.189> you

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
different from any other airplane do you

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.900 
different from any other airplane do you
know<00:00:27.429> what<00:00:27.640> RC<00:00:27.970> airplanes<00:00:28.390> need<00:00:28.660> to<00:00:28.779> fly<00:00:29.910> wings

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
know what RC airplanes need to fly wings

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.080 
know what RC airplanes need to fly wings
air<00:00:31.689> and<00:00:32.349> such<00:00:34.470> that's<00:00:35.470> right<00:00:35.740> yes<00:00:36.460> and<00:00:36.820> they

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
air and such that's right yes and they

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.270 
air and such that's right yes and they
also<00:00:37.300> need<00:00:37.720> an<00:00:37.960> RC<00:00:38.590> transmitter<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:40.180> fly<00:00:41.280> right

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
also need an RC transmitter to fly right

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.630 
also need an RC transmitter to fly right
not<00:00:42.550> all<00:00:42.579> airplanes<00:00:43.149> are<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.629> same<00:00:44.280> some<00:00:45.280> are

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
not all airplanes are the same some are

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.959 
not all airplanes are the same some are
built<00:00:46.270> for<00:00:46.510> flight<00:00:47.140> longevity<00:00:47.760> others<00:00:48.760> are

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
built for flight longevity others are

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:55.170 
built for flight longevity others are
built<00:00:49.210> for<00:00:50.100> speed<00:00:53.579> right<00:00:54.579> where<00:00:54.820> thrust

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
built for speed right where thrust

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.119 
built for speed right where thrust
produces<00:00:55.750> differential<00:00:56.440> pressure<00:00:56.739> around

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
produces differential pressure around

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.180 
produces differential pressure around
the<00:00:57.340> wing<00:00:57.579> and<00:00:58.079> aerodynamic<00:00:59.079> lift<00:00:59.350> is<00:00:59.590> created

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
the wing and aerodynamic lift is created

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.760 
the wing and aerodynamic lift is created
at<00:01:00.340> high<00:01:00.489> velocity<00:01:01.829> um<00:01:03.660> yeah<00:01:04.770> that's

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
at high velocity um yeah that's

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:14.070 
at high velocity um yeah that's
absolutely<00:01:06.160> correct<00:01:12.659> hey<00:01:13.659> that<00:01:13.840> one<00:01:13.990> over

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
absolutely correct hey that one over

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.920 
absolutely correct hey that one over

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
there is nice do you want to go fly I'm

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:27.580 
there is nice do you want to go fly I'm
sure<00:01:17.229> I'll<00:01:18.159> get<00:01:18.369> a<00:01:18.400> fresh<00:01:18.640> battery<00:01:18.930> great

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:37.319

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
over at flight test do an amazing job

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.940 
over at flight test do an amazing job
but<00:01:43.729> there<00:01:43.909> are<00:01:43.999> see<00:01:44.240> videos<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.810> because<00:01:45.740> of

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
my way to my first fpv flight I thought

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.609 
my way to my first fpv flight I thought
I<00:01:52.009> would<00:01:52.249> show<00:01:52.490> my<00:01:52.670> appreciation<00:01:52.759> by<00:01:53.630> what

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
I would show my appreciation by what

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.039 
I would show my appreciation by what
else<00:01:54.799> making<00:01:55.310> fun<00:01:55.459> of<00:01:55.490> them<00:01:55.759> a<00:01:55.819> little<00:01:55.969> bit<00:01:56.179> so

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049
