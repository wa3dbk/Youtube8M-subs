00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.220
 category so we'll start with 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:23.330
 both times 2 i have 2 1 dyan 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.580
 es18 eden I strongly prefer the oit 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.800
 eden and realizes that she had received 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:36.170
 in order to yes any type c yes all he 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.460
 is really fine he is very much in this 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.460
 concerning the dai hành it is also 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.329
 nice and I 'm coming this is the small version 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.370
 pts of 46 mm so if you want to take 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.690
 at two times two I advise you when 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.730
 even the dalian and in 50 mm then for 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.220
 the three fake 3 there are three brands that 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.890
 stands out the most so he go there 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:04.640
 dyan with this look too they are very 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.060
 well really great students 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.579
 youtube and also the eight students so the 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.159
 even marc de foy of me I do not have 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.360
 but they are pretty good and there is 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.439
 also a new brand that comes from 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.780
 go out that's called moe ue 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.740
 so here I have more sticker but 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.200
 it's a world is now alone 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.639
 occupies the teaser in competition it's 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.460
 really the word utah is really the 

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:30.709
 faster 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.319
 so here's for the 3 x 3 we pass 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.909
 now to the biggest cube 4 x 4 5 x 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:38.179
 5.6 x 6 and 7 x 7 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.590
 there I do not have this time 7 may I 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.779
 advise you the same brand for the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.310
 simple 5 and 6 x 6 on 4 4 

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:51.619
 I advise you either the pamper the 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.630
 place by 4 is really great and if not 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.049
 there is also the 4 x 4 core that comes from 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.049
 go out 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.349
 and apparently he's better than the 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:05.689
 shenzhou otherwise in 5 x 5.6 x 6 and 7 x 7 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:08.830
 that I do not have and me the fields where 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:13.940
 are really the best for me 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.650
 they are really very fast and 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.020
 so here I greet you and every day 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.520
 for larger cubes then for 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.460
 Cubans a little more special like 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.700
 the mirror cube mine it's a leader 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:29.240
 mirror show cube and that's really the 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.320
 better I tested another included 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.660
 gilles seems to me that they were 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.980
 not so good so for 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.460
 cameras I advise you the chains 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:42.670
 play for pyramix getac g 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:45.470
 inclusive but the pyramix scrunchies 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.440
 are also of better quality and 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.870
 turns anyway faster with regard to 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.710
 regards the month megamix the agent j 1 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.320
 from iam with the little stuff that we 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.900
 do not help turn here 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.250
 and then that it is very much me I 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.620
 loved him I love them very much he is 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.130
 fast there are also the likes of who leak 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.460
 are good in megamix but frankly 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.040
 I advise you the dai hành in this 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:17.600
 that concerns my time m it's a tac 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.420
 matt aut generation iii and that's a 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.300
 pod stage so how does it work 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.360
 take on we go we go there we put 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.420
 the hands the lights turn on the 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.140
 chrono starts here here we stop 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:36.739
 ah bah like 2.2 and is repeated and 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.959
 then in peace both for the lubricant 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.580
 I recommend the mar lô the ubs it is 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.920
 really cheap and there is really 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.900
 very very powerful 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.540
 many take the lumix but it is 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.670
 almost five times more expensive for the 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.160
 same quantity so I advise you 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.360
 really the mar in the bulb 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.190
 so that's this video is over 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.630
 I hope you liked it and we 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.630
 find for other videos hi
