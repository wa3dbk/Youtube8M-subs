let's<00:03:06.909> upgrade<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.599> or<00:03:07.780> out<00:03:08.109> west<00:03:08.379> cause<00:03:09.250> the

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
let's upgrade to or out west cause the

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.430 
let's upgrade to or out west cause the
tunnels<00:03:09.879> have<00:03:10.120> their<00:03:10.420> crest<00:03:11.290> metal

tunnels have their crest metal

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.150 
tunnels have their crest metal
so<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.710> drains<00:03:12.980> both<00:03:13.400> ways

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
so it drains both ways
