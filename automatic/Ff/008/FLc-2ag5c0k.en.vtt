truck well now this is the bomb tank it
works<00:00:18.270> quite<00:00:18.630> well<00:00:18.660> but<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.230> have<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.529> do<00:00:19.650> it

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
works quite well but you have to do it

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.679 
works quite well but you have to do it
slightly<00:00:20.010> differently<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.150> fit<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.510> have

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
slightly differently so the fit we have

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.140 
slightly differently so the fit we have
here<00:00:21.960> has<00:00:22.199> got<00:00:22.410> evo<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.550> sticking<00:00:23.910> what

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
here has got evo is just sticking what

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.029 
here has got evo is just sticking what
six<00:00:24.480> seven<00:00:24.570> remote<00:00:25.080> explosives<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.769> front

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
six seven remote explosives to the front

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.519 
six seven remote explosives to the front
and<00:00:26.220> you'll<00:00:26.849> notice<00:00:27.029> there<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.330> also<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.750> front

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
and you'll notice there is also a front

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.800 
and you'll notice there is also a front
turret<00:00:29.490> as<00:00:29.699> well<00:00:29.910> that's<00:00:30.150> quite<00:00:30.359> important

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
turret as well that's quite important

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.020 
turret as well that's quite important
because<00:00:30.840> why<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:31.830> not<00:00:31.949> not<00:00:32.309> necessarily

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
because why it's not not necessarily

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.160 
because why it's not not necessarily
important<00:00:33.360> if<00:00:33.420> you've<00:00:33.510> got<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> good<00:00:33.840> comms

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
you'll be fine but here we go here's our

you'll be fine but here we go here's our
prospective<00:00:36.390> first<00:00:36.690> customer<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.710> rush<00:00:38.040> him

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
prospective first customer we rush him

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.430 
prospective first customer we rush him
and<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.940> didn't<00:00:39.270> shoot<00:00:39.480> at<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.809> point<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:40.290> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
and I didn't shoot at this point just to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.709 
and I didn't shoot at this point just to
kind<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.680> prove<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> concept<00:00:41.390> but<00:00:42.390> look<00:00:42.570> at

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
kind of prove the concept but look at

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.520 
kind of prove the concept but look at
that<00:00:43.070> he<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.190> there<00:00:44.399> now<00:00:45.090> he's<00:00:45.270> gone

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
that he was there now he's gone

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.450 
that he was there now he's gone
literally<00:00:46.530> that's<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.890> simple<00:00:47.010> as<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
literally that's as simple as that and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.889 
literally that's as simple as that and
that's<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> beauty<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.450> trick<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.750> just

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
that's the beauty of this trick is just

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.690 
that's the beauty of this trick is just
rammed<00:00:49.410> them<00:00:49.620> with<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.950> remote<00:00:50.160> explosives

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
rammed them with the remote explosives

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.700 
rammed them with the remote explosives
call<00:00:51.420> your<00:00:51.660> buddy<00:00:51.870> who's<00:00:52.110> got<00:00:52.140> who<00:00:52.440> else<00:00:52.590> you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
call your buddy who's got who else you

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.529 
call your buddy who's got who else you
planted<00:00:53.100> them<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.520> then<00:00:53.670> they<00:00:53.820> fire<00:00:54.090> them<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
planted them and then they fire them and

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.350 
planted them and then they fire them and
then<00:00:54.750> boom<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.920> disappears<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.149> works

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
then boom it disappears and this works

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.670 
then boom it disappears and this works
quite<00:00:57.660> well<00:00:57.690> now<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.379> also<00:00:58.530> something

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
quite well now this is also something

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.299 
quite well now this is also something
that<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.760> can<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.000> for<00:01:00.180> multiple<00:01:00.719> different

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
that you can do for multiple different

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.470 
that you can do for multiple different
vehicles<00:01:02.309> as<00:01:02.460> well<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.120> actually<00:01:03.300> do

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
vehicles as well so you can actually do

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.149 
vehicles as well so you can actually do
this<00:01:03.600> for<00:01:03.719> infantry<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.409> well<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:05.010> can

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
this for infantry as well you can

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.280 
this for infantry as well you can
actually<00:01:05.460> put<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.869> your<00:01:07.049> team<00:01:07.260> members

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the corner of each of your tank and then

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.620 
the corner of each of your tank and then
you<00:01:11.460> basically<00:01:11.610> know<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.450> remember

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
you basically know we have to remember

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.600 
you basically know we have to remember
who<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.380> then<00:01:13.500> say<00:01:13.710> right<00:01:13.979> okay<00:01:14.280> evo

who but you can then say right okay evo

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.060 
who but you can then say right okay evo
blow<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.150> then<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.780> guy<00:01:15.990> he<00:01:16.619> presses<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
blow and then that guy he presses the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.380 
blow and then that guy he presses the
button<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.490> will<00:01:17.520> kill<00:01:17.700> any<00:01:17.880> infantry

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
button and it will kill any infantry

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.270 
button and it will kill any infantry
around<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.170> quarter<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.740> tank<00:01:19.950> as<00:01:20.130> well

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
around that quarter of the tank as well

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.950 
around that quarter of the tank as well
so<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.540> with<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> bit<00:01:21.930> of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
so you know it with a bit of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.480 
so you know it with a bit of
coordination<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.920> actually<00:01:23.220> not<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.430> bad

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
coordination it's actually not a bad

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.240 
coordination it's actually not a bad
tactic<00:01:24.119> at<00:01:24.270> all<00:01:24.530> at<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.650> point<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> map

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
tactic at all at this point in the map

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.760 
tactic at all at this point in the map
as<00:01:26.430> well<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:27.060> were<00:01:27.210> bit<00:01:27.720> bored<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.409> thought

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
as well we were bit bored so we thought

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.499 
as well we were bit bored so we thought
we<00:01:29.040> are<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.490> thought<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.790> saw<00:01:30.060> them<00:01:30.240> call<00:01:30.390> it

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
we are we I thought I saw them call it

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.490 
we are we I thought I saw them call it
though<00:01:30.630> there<00:01:30.780> we<00:01:30.869> go<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.990> calling<00:01:31.290> something

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
though there we go to calling something

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.260 
though there we go to calling something
in<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.950> thought<00:01:32.100> rights<00:01:32.400> kiddies<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:33.119> go

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
in and I thought rights kiddies just go

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.929 
in and I thought rights kiddies just go
for<00:01:33.420> whatever<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.930> we'll<00:01:34.110> blow<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.350> up<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
for whatever it is we'll blow it up and
