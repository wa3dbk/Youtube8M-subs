00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.750 

we'd<00:00:39.980> be<00:00:40.070> on<00:00:40.190> stage<00:00:40.519> to<00:00:40.850> stage<00:00:41.449> two<00:00:41.899> will<00:00:42.199> be

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.660 

as<00:00:56.470> you<00:00:56.590> can<00:00:56.680> tell<00:00:56.740> the<00:00:56.980> lighting<00:00:57.250> in<00:00:57.310> gym<00:00:57.520> has

as you can tell the lighting in gym has

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.400 
as you can tell the lighting in gym has

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
turned him into zombie mode can't really

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.110 
turned him into zombie mode can't really
talk<00:01:05.560> right<00:01:05.620> now<00:01:05.800> but<00:01:06.220> I<00:01:06.250> know<00:01:06.280> he'd<00:01:06.580> say<00:01:06.610> that

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
talk right now but I know he'd say that

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.700 
talk right now but I know he'd say that
after<00:01:07.330> doing<00:01:07.600> all<00:01:07.720> these<00:01:07.870> crunch<00:01:08.170> moves<00:01:08.440> where

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
after doing all these crunch moves where

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.620 
after doing all these crunch moves where
it<00:01:08.830> compresses<00:01:09.190> on<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.520> body<00:01:09.729> this<00:01:10.390> is<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.479> good

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
it compresses on the body this is a good

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.180 
it compresses on the body this is a good
move<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:10.840> have<00:01:11.170> where<00:01:11.410> it<00:01:11.470> stretches<00:01:11.830> his<00:01:11.920> abs

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
move to have where it stretches his abs

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.540 
move to have where it stretches his abs
he<00:01:13.830> also<00:01:14.830> likes<00:01:15.070> doing<00:01:15.250> these<00:01:15.430> after<00:01:15.760> squats

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
he also likes doing these after squats

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:30.940 
he also likes doing these after squats
tells<00:01:18.550> me<00:01:18.640> all<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:18.790> time

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.530 

again<00:01:31.950> really<00:01:32.250> focusing<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.880> using<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.210> core

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
again really focusing on using that core

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.760 
again really focusing on using that core
so<00:01:33.780> you're<00:01:33.900> never<00:01:34.049> going<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.260> like<00:01:34.380> kick<00:01:34.619> up

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
so you're never going to like kick up

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:46.030 
so you're never going to like kick up
with<00:01:34.950> your<00:01:35.100> legs<00:01:35.280> or<00:01:35.520> your<00:01:35.549> hips

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.220 

page<00:01:46.670> 3

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.180 

oh<00:01:53.290> yeah

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
oh yeah

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.120 
oh yeah
hot<00:01:55.820> out<00:01:56.000> of<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.090> camera<00:01:56.330> view<00:01:56.710> so<00:01:57.710> knee

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
hot out of the camera view so knee

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.650 
hot out of the camera view so knee
raises<00:01:58.400> a<00:02:00.460> lot<00:02:01.460> of<00:02:01.670> these<00:02:01.790> moves<00:02:02.060> I<00:02:02.330> believe

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
raises a lot of these moves I believe

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.610 
raises a lot of these moves I believe
are<00:02:02.780> derived<00:02:03.110> from<00:02:03.350> rob<00:02:03.770> riches<00:02:04.010> and<00:02:05.620> he

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
are derived from rob riches and he

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.469 
are derived from rob riches and he
recommends<00:02:07.160> using<00:02:07.340> knee<00:02:07.790> raises<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.330> step

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
recommends using knee raises and step

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.100 
recommends using knee raises and step
leg<00:02:08.810> ups<00:02:09.050> because<00:02:09.290> if<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:09.890> use<00:02:10.070> leg<00:02:10.310> ups<00:02:10.550> you

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
leg ups because if you use leg ups you

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
leg ups because if you use leg ups you
require<00:02:12.110> too<00:02:12.290> much<00:02:12.410> force<00:02:12.710> from<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.920> hip

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
require too much force from the hip

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.100 
require too much force from the hip
flexors<00:02:13.550> this<00:02:14.360> way<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.600> can<00:02:14.660> keep<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:14.990> nice

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.950 

a<00:02:36.660> repeat<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.620> his<00:02:38.010> most<00:02:38.220> infamous<00:02:39.180> recent

but<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.510> final<00:03:28.780> move<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:29.080> this<00:03:29.230> round<00:03:29.440> we're

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
but the final move of this round we're

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:40.580
