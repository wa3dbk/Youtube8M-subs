going to be even more powerful next up
we<00:03:44.810> got<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:45.050> jelly<00:03:45.350> par<00:03:45.709> profile<00:03:46.430> system<00:03:46.820> and

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
we got the jelly par profile system and

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.900 
we got the jelly par profile system and
when<00:03:47.660> they<00:03:47.750> say<00:03:47.989> jelly<00:03:48.560> profile<00:03:49.220> I'm<00:03:49.430> assuming

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
when they say jelly profile I'm assuming

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.420 
when they say jelly profile I'm assuming
that's<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.360> plastic<00:03:50.989> thing<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.890> also<00:03:52.040> glows

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
that's the plastic thing that also glows

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.699 
that's the plastic thing that also glows
along<00:03:52.730> with<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.000> light<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:53.450> then<00:03:54.230> they<00:03:54.470> have

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
along with the light and then they have

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.580 
along with the light and then they have
the<00:03:55.040> Ruby<00:03:55.730> Royale<00:03:56.120> looks<00:03:57.020> like<00:03:57.110> another<00:03:57.380> new
