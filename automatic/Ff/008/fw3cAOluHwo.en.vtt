00:00:08.437 --> 00:00:10.759
 How come no one has ever tried to become a superhero? 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.955
 I don't know. Probably because it's impossible. 

00:00:12.956 --> 00:00:15.958
 Putting on a mask and helping people is impossible? 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.703
 Dude, if someone seriously tried it, he'd get hold of it. 

00:00:19.704 --> 00:00:22.739
 "But nothing. I'm just standing here." 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.055
 No, I'm not! 

00:00:25.298 --> 00:00:28.024
 - I was just an ordinary boy. - Hello handsome. - Hi. 

00:00:28.025 --> 00:00:31.767
 My only super power was invisibility for girls. 

00:00:32.423 --> 00:00:34.082
 It was wrong in comics. 

00:00:34.083 --> 00:00:36.759
 You don't need any special ability to be a superhero. 

00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:39.194
 - Let him. - It is not your business. 

00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:40.733
 But is! 

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:44.474
 There's a man out there who looks like a superhero, and shakes with a bunch of guys. 

00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:47.507
 Who are you? 

00:00:47.508 --> 00:00:49.601
 I'm Kick-Ass. 

00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:52.692
 Kick-Ass is the latest internet hit. 

00:00:52.693 --> 00:00:53.808
 This is great. 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.492
 He's pretty good. 

00:00:55.493 --> 00:00:58.462
 He should be named Ass-Kick. 

00:00:58.727 --> 00:01:01.639
 He inspired a wave of superheroes from the people. 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.277
 End of fun, sweetheart. 

00:01:03.278 --> 00:01:05.398
 It's time to kick a few ugly masters. 

00:01:06.668 --> 00:01:08.476
 Who wants to go to fight crime? 

00:01:08.477 --> 00:01:10.844
 So show off. 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.434
 - The guy came out of nowhere. - And he looked like Batman? 

00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:19.709
 Are you telling me he's done all my guys himself? 

00:01:20.062 --> 00:01:24.553
 We have to prove to people that being a superhero is harmful to them. 

00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:26.519
 DO NOT SEE SKRZ HERE 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.328
 So you want to play? 

00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:33.322
 Who you are? 

00:01:33.323 --> 00:01:34.505
 I'm Hit-Girl. 

00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:36.445
 And this is Big Daddy. 

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:38.033
 NEUMÍ LÉTAT 

00:01:38.034 --> 00:01:39.714
 Kick-Assi! 

00:01:40.012 --> 00:01:41.325
 Red Miste! 

00:01:41.426 --> 00:01:43.178
 Au, it hurt pretty much. 

00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:47.859
 BUT YOU CAN LOAD YOU 

00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:54.633
 I probably love her, buddy. 

00:01:54.634 --> 00:01:56.798
 Close it here. 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.089
 No one can go in or out. 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.898
 She's a little girl. 

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:03.244
 SUMMER ON SERIES 

00:02:07.413 --> 00:02:08.798
 CAN SUPER 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.851
 So show up! 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.149
 GO TO HELL 

00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:19.432
 You're not catching up, huh? 

00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:26.044
 Right, we're superheroes. You love us.
