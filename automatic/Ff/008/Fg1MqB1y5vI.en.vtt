I think you can do this actually from

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.640 
I think you can do this actually from
the<00:01:14.760> back<00:01:14.939> end<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.540> all<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.990> from<00:01:16.350> the

get the domain name to point to the
proper<00:05:24.790> wordpress<00:05:25.790> install<00:05:26.450> you<00:05:26.930> have<00:05:27.080> to<00:05:27.230> add

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
proper wordpress install you have to add

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.910 
proper wordpress install you have to add
it<00:05:27.920> as<00:05:28.040> a<00:05:28.070> server<00:05:28.430> alias<00:05:28.940> to<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:29.890> to<00:05:30.890> the

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
it as a server alias to the to the

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.370 
it as a server alias to the to the
virtual<00:05:31.310> host<00:05:31.700> so<00:05:32.390> if<00:05:32.510> you<00:05:32.630> look<00:05:32.780> here<00:05:32.990> this

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
virtual host so if you look here this

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.990 
virtual host so if you look here this
might<00:05:33.590> be<00:05:33.680> unfamiliar<00:05:34.100> to<00:05:34.160> you<00:05:34.400> now<00:05:34.820> i<00:05:34.850> think

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
that you can just park a domain if

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.660 
that you can just park a domain if

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
you're using a shared host it gives you

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.630 
you're using a shared host it gives you
the<00:05:40.790> ability<00:05:40.880> to<00:05:41.210> park<00:05:41.840> domains<00:05:42.640> i'm

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:20.879 
camera advice a wild card then I'll be

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:22.670

able<00:06:20.909> to<00:06:21.150> actually<00:06:21.330> add<00:06:21.689> multi<00:06:22.080> I'll<00:06:22.469> be<00:06:22.590> able

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
able to actually add multi I'll be able

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.010 
able to actually add multi I'll be able
to<00:06:22.830> add<00:06:22.949> websites<00:06:23.879> to<00:06:24.150> digital<00:06:24.539> camera<00:06:24.810> advice

to add websites to digital camera advice

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.809 
to add websites to digital camera advice
also<00:06:25.289> so<00:06:25.530> as<00:06:25.710> you<00:06:25.860> can<00:06:25.949> see<00:06:26.099> you<00:06:26.189> can<00:06:26.340> chain<00:06:26.610> it

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:26.819 
also so as you can see you can chain it

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.790 
also so as you can see you can chain it
and<00:06:27.000> it<00:06:27.389> can<00:06:27.569> just<00:06:27.689> keep<00:06:28.020> growing<00:06:28.349> and<00:06:28.680> growing

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
and it can just keep growing and growing

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.230 
and it can just keep growing and growing
and<00:06:29.099> growing<00:06:29.189> so<00:06:29.610> you<00:06:29.729> can<00:06:29.849> actually<00:06:29.969> make

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
and growing so you can actually make

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.890 
and growing so you can actually make
multiple<00:06:30.840> networks<00:06:31.370> from<00:06:32.370> one<00:06:32.550> install<00:06:33.060> so

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
multiple networks from one install so

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.100 
multiple networks from one install so
I'm<00:06:33.990> actually<00:06:34.110> going<00:06:34.289> to<00:06:34.439> do<00:06:34.590> that<00:06:34.800> and<00:06:35.990> did<00:06:36.990> it

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
I'm actually going to do that and did it

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.839 
I'm actually going to do that and did it
too<00:06:37.259> so<00:06:37.949> digital<00:06:38.250> I'm<00:06:38.430> going<00:06:38.550> to<00:06:38.610> give<00:06:38.729> it<00:06:38.759> the

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
too so digital I'm going to give it the

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.369 
too so digital I'm going to give it the
wild<00:06:39.330> card<00:06:39.569> then<00:06:39.870> i'm<00:06:39.960> going<00:06:40.050> to<00:06:40.139> type<00:06:40.229> it

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:40.379 
wild card then i'm going to type it

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:50.749 
wild card then i'm going to type it
again<00:06:46.189> and<00:06:47.189> that<00:06:47.969> should<00:06:48.150> do<00:06:48.210> it<00:06:48.240> so<00:06:48.750> just<00:06:49.759> save
