 the apple store for your computer 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.039

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.940
 that they are nice to know eh ben 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.210

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.460
 here we are 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.690
 top August 10 to an account is good so 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.460
 now we are going to arrive about the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.960
 everything that is as you saw in 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.840
 the title how to finally win how 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.590
 that's how to improve performance 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.490
 of his mac 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.520
 so that 's going to be with one 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.049
 application that will be but not rice 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.170
 China 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.950
 you take the first that this one he 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.740
 is free 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.150
 you see me alain who costs who sees 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.549
 in the expensive and free ones so you 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.290
 the install you need password and 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.390
 trick of your user otherwise you 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.860
 are not the main account you 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.960
 install it learns very little time 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.970
 it will spread out if you are on mac 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.460
 os x like me flying up on it not 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.040
 you will go get them 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.360
 course and his machine has memory 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.680
 that's how the software looks 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.990
 it's software that will make you 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.110
 gain some memory 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:56.090
 so before each video after during 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.380
 each during each 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.080
 download youtube or taste them 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.870
 other changes before that makes you a 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.960
 little clip stands out so you see his 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.330
 charges his 27 38 40 40 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.890
 there it's actually going to clean up the memory 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.230
 life that is not used to put it 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.660
 in the vermont memory to use and 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.180
 so increase your abilities see we 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:23.880
 went from 1.49 to 2 24 of 22 gb so 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.040
 see how that makes us win 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.650
 speed of memory vote everything that 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.270
 you want so this is an app 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.430
 as I say simple shipping to 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.200
 download so I recommend it to you 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.490
 there is absolutely no risk for 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.240
 some that the rapper for their 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.820
 personal files 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.410
 it does not destroy any siv file 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.250
 just memory that is only used to 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.350
 nothing in useful memory so on this tutorial 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.210
 is over I hope he will have you 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.430
 longer we 'll meet again soon 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.430
 for a new title to the awakening of the world
