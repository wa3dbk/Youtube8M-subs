00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
convenient now second thing is the slice

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.139 
convenient now second thing is the slice
and<00:00:29.880> dice<00:00:30.060> tool<00:00:30.679> you<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:31.949> slice<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.520> dice<00:00:32.669> go

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
and dice tool you just slice and dice go

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.120 
and dice tool you just slice and dice go
from<00:00:33.420> one<00:00:33.600> end<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.930> other<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.770> cuts<00:00:34.980> it

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
from one end to the other and it cuts it

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.959

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
press triangle you know that's pretty

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.790 
press triangle you know that's pretty
cool<00:00:44.420> now<00:00:45.420> these<00:00:45.629> next<00:00:46.079> three<00:00:46.110> things<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
cool now these next three things the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.639 
cool now these next three things the
first<00:00:47.039> ones<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.399> speed<00:00:47.760> sensor<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.649> rotator

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
first ones a speed sensor a rotator

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.470 
first ones a speed sensor a rotator
sensor<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.370> an<00:00:51.000> angle<00:00:51.960> sensor<00:00:53.420> they<00:00:54.420> do

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
sensor and an angle sensor they do

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.689 
sensor and an angle sensor they do
exactly<00:00:54.930> what<00:00:55.170> they<00:00:55.320> say<00:00:55.649> they<00:00:56.160> sent<00:00:56.489> some

exactly what they say they sent some

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.080 
exactly what they say they sent some
things<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.859> once<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.010> gets<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.370> exactly<00:00:59.699> right

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
things and once it gets it exactly right

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.660 
things and once it gets it exactly right
then<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:01.410> know<00:01:01.559> whatever<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.399> want

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
only activate it by pressing X so that's

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.899 
only activate it by pressing X so that's
actually<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:30.299> neat

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909
