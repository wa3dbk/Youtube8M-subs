00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.330

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.710
 channel this time we are in a 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.260
 Call of duty exclusive information 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.570
 advanced war park first of all 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.570
 connect that the information that I'm going to 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.820
 to speak next is the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.640
 regarding the exclusive weapons that 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.230
 they came out that leaked and all that the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.370
 gameplay say that the belly of the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.290
 weapons I will not be able to 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.150
 I'm not going to put on the screen but what 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.550
 you will have a link in the description and 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.829
 that I could get a strike on the channel 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.930
 and you can see it would close not so 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.090
 that is delivered in the description as well 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.730
 that there's no problem I'll put it there already 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.550
 can you are there slim and it will take you 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.440
 a link to twitter so let's go to 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.360
 start for in the beginning gameplay 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.730
 that you are seeing from funds is a 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.370
 rachita playing with the average weapon of 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.799
 the six hundred downs of the real acb 3 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.840
 terrace map so you'll have it there 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.020
 background is pretty cool we're going to 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.600
 begin first with what to comment that 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.320
 the belly that you will see that the link is 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.080
 of three weapons the of 744 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.900
 the sniper called sv or if not 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.870
 I remember badly and the blanc der vaart is a 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.030
 small clip about 15 seconds but I 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.970
 gives to see everything about how he will kill 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.729
 the gun and sidear without mark and all that 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.010
 the stc let's start with the first 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.500
 weapon that you will see in the gameplay is a 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.990
 weapon that looks like it's going to be a 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.060
 Tiny butler but cucumber is because 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.280
 I think it increases the model of 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.020
 legendary a little bit of cadence and 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.030
 another the precision and this makes the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.130
 weapon be pretty but pretty 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.259
 precise so do not worry because 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.509
 I think it's going to be soft enough 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.090
 was the gun is in the 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.460
 category of assault rifles so 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.560
 let's continue with the next weapon sv 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.890
 or return to sender I think it was called 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.810
 the model of the legendary and good as 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.080
 you can see in the gameplay what you see 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.390
 is that the weapon to kill an uncle yes 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.700
 happens then if you give the rod above 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.960
 of the hip or chest as you see in 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.330
 whoever enters 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.520
 it will not give who it marks but never like that 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.340
 that I can say that it is not going to be 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.690
 type sv we could say that it can be 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.740
 a barret guy but he did not confirm insurance 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.100
 but well let's go for the next 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.740
 video gun the last weapon is the 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.410
 cndr bascopÃ© is like that type carpet and wing 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.270
 breivik and is a weapon that if we can 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.160
 buy one of the vanguards could 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.120
 say easily that you can buy 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.070
 with the l w12 the truth that I would prefer 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.170
 a weapon that was a little more cited 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.050
 but I do not think that that weapon is removed by 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.530
 what you see more than a shot but is that 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.870
 said type is the type of ww you shoot 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.300
 have to wait a while to put it 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.340
 your ideal weight and it took me quite well 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.290
 what good people up here the video of 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.580

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.050
 new that I had not seen in the 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.360
 Spanish community will have the gameplay 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.860
