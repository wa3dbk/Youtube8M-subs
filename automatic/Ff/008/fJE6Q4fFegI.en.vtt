00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.810 
handy compact no i don't own any of
these<00:02:25.990> so<00:02:26.350> i<00:02:26.590> thought<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.250> was<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.400> good<00:02:27.550> way<00:02:27.760> to

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
these so i thought it was a good way to

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.370 
these so i thought it was a good way to
purchase<00:02:28.510> them<00:02:28.720> all<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.350> it<00:02:29.620> costs<00:02:29.950> 40<00:02:30.340> pounds

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
purchase them all and it costs 40 pounds

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.990 
purchase them all and it costs 40 pounds
but<00:02:32.380> i<00:02:32.650> think<00:02:33.130> that's<00:02:33.250> really<00:02:33.490> reasonable

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
but i think that's really reasonable

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.610 
but i think that's really reasonable
because<00:02:34.210> I<00:02:34.360> would<00:02:34.510> never<00:02:34.660> ever<00:02:34.870> use<00:02:35.020> up<00:02:35.410> a

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
because I would never ever use up a

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.370 
because I would never ever use up a
whole<00:02:35.860> one<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.160> anything<00:02:36.580> anything<00:02:37.150> say<00:02:37.540> got

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
whole one of anything anything say got

whole one of anything anything say got
it<00:02:38.470> all<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:38.620> one<00:02:38.950> say<00:02:39.430> that's<00:02:39.790> blush<00:02:40.360> sausage
