 apparently graphics aside seems a 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.709
 stock version of android but turning to 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.630
 the various menus you realize the 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.009
 many small improvements that have been 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.130
 introduced by the community of

 autonomy measured with our test 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.270
 intensive and about 9 and a half hours e 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.220
 this means that you can use it for 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.920
 a whole working day without 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.700
 no problem while using less 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.100
 intensive the two days are insured 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.800
 the 13 megapixel camera generates 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.220
 satisfactory shots without scoring any 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.050
 new record while the software allows 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.420
 to easily check all 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.940
 shooting parameters is not 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.910
 particularly creative if you want to do 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.590
 nice shots you will have to rely on one 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.540
 of the many applications present in the 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.480
 play store 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.790
 missing a micro sd card reader e 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.640
 also the headset which is not included 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:08.340
 in the one plus one package convinces 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.450
 in many respects but the price is the 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.150
 main novelty in fact it is sold to 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:19.140
 269 ​​euros in the 16 gigabyte version is 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.980
 only 30 euros more ie 299 euros in the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.170
 64 gigabyte version at this price 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.500
 one plus one is the desire of every 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.910
 passionate and should be 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.860
 preferable to any other model of 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.510
 high end on the market 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.030
 simply because savings 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.250
 cheap is too high to choose one 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.380
 another phone that maybe offers some 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.460
 additional but double feature 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.720
 of the price or more 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.300
 however not everyone can buy 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.280
 this smartphone in fact only if you are 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.590
 invited by another user who already has 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.920
 once purchased , you can buy one 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.020
 one is also superimposed 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.460
 you will see a link that will give you more 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.710
 information 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.260
 alternatively you can rely on a 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:08.030
 retailer who will however propose this 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.030
 smartphone has a higher price 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.940
 if however you will have the opportunity to 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.940
 buying it will be a real bargain
