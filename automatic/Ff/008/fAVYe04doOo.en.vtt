00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
was seven and a half by seven and a half

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.450 
was seven and a half by seven and a half
and<00:00:44.670> then<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.690> scored<00:00:46.320> two<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.489> half<00:00:48.320> inches

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
half and five okay so what that gives me

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.490 
half and five okay so what that gives me
is<00:00:59.070> nine<00:00:59.340> squares<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.359> are<00:01:00.840> two<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> half

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
is nine squares that are two and a half

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.729 
is nine squares that are two and a half
by<00:01:01.680> two<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.980> half<00:01:02.600> then<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.379> see<00:01:04.559> that

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
by two and a half then you can see that

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.830 
by two and a half then you can see that
I<00:01:04.769> cut<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.970> one<00:01:06.840> side<00:01:07.640> flipped<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.790> over<00:01:08.939> cut

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
I cut in on one side flipped it over cut

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.090 
I cut in on one side flipped it over cut
in<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.500> other<00:01:12.200> folded<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.500> now<00:01:13.830> this

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
in on the other folded it and now this

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.640 
in on the other folded it and now this
gives<00:01:14.400> me<00:01:14.580> my<00:01:14.939> box<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.540> folded<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.259> you'll<00:01:16.470> see

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.370 
the shape come alive okay so you can see
that's<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> box<00:01:23.570> of<00:01:24.570> course<00:01:24.840> i<00:01:24.930> would<00:01:25.110> use

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
that's the box of course i would use

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.179 
that's the box of course i would use
some<00:01:25.710> sticky<00:01:26.040> strip<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.610> put<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.970> together

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
some sticky strip to put that together

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.609 
some sticky strip to put that together
okay<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:30.479> that's<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> box<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.259> then<00:01:31.409> what<00:01:31.590> i

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
okay so that's the box and then what i

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.980 
okay so that's the box and then what i
did<00:01:31.920> was<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.880> make<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.240> opening<00:01:33.450> because<00:01:33.869> i

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
did was to make the opening because i

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.390 
did was to make the opening because i
actually<00:01:34.140> have<00:01:34.409> an<00:01:34.530> opening<00:01:34.950> there<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.280> you

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
actually have an opening there that you

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.940 
actually have an opening there that you
can<00:01:35.549> see<00:01:35.700> through<00:01:35.970> i<00:01:36.259> chose<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> sides

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
can see through i chose one of the sides

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.920 
can see through i chose one of the sides
that<00:01:38.340> as<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.360> see<00:01:39.570> it's<00:01:39.930> only<00:01:40.259> one<00:01:40.500> level

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
that as you can see it's only one level

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.910 
that as you can see it's only one level
so<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.110> would<00:01:43.290> be<00:01:43.380> my<00:01:43.530> front<00:01:44.689> and<00:01:45.689> i<00:01:46.530> took<00:01:46.590> my

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
so this would be my front and i took my

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.300 
so this would be my front and i took my
one<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.340> three<00:01:47.610> four<00:01:47.880> pinch<00:01:48.119> punch<00:01:49.040> came<00:01:50.040> in

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
one in three four pinch punch came in

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.569 
one in three four pinch punch came in
and<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:51.659> punch<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> circle<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:52.950> there<00:01:53.100> try

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
and just punch the circle in there try

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.620 
and just punch the circle in there try
to<00:01:53.640> get<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.060> bus<00:01:54.210> center<00:01:55.310> simple<00:01:56.310> enough

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.109 

okay<00:01:59.350> so<00:01:59.680> you<00:01:59.740> see<00:02:00.040> that'll<00:02:00.310> be<00:02:00.430> my<00:02:00.549> front<00:02:00.880> of

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
okay so you see that'll be my front of

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.440 
okay so you see that'll be my front of
my<00:02:01.329> box<00:02:01.570> there<00:02:02.100> then<00:02:03.100> as<00:02:03.460> for<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.850> texturizing

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
my box there then as for the texturizing

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.999 
my box there then as for the texturizing
I<00:02:06.450> could<00:02:07.450> not<00:02:07.659> fit<00:02:07.990> this<00:02:08.170> whole<00:02:08.440> piece<00:02:08.860> of

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
I could not fit this whole piece of

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.130 
I could not fit this whole piece of
paper<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.970> seven<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.420> half<00:02:10.450> by<00:02:10.720> seven<00:02:11.050> and

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
paper the seven and a half by seven and

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.370 
paper the seven and a half by seven and
a<00:02:11.200> half<00:02:11.310> through<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.489> big<00:02:12.670> shot<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.930> what<00:02:14.349> I

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
a half through the big shot so what I

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.650 
a half through the big shot so what I
did<00:02:14.620> instead<00:02:14.800> was<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.910> cut<00:02:17.069> for<00:02:18.420> two<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.630> half

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
did instead was I cut for two and a half

by two and a half pounds okay so here's

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.140 
by two and a half pounds okay so here's
a<00:02:24.370> cut<00:02:24.610> panel<00:02:25.000> out<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.780> craft<00:02:26.430> then<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.730> sent

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
a cut panel out of the craft then I sent

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.970 
a cut panel out of the craft then I sent
it<00:02:28.300> through<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.599> big<00:02:28.810> shot<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:29.290> sent<00:02:29.590> each<00:02:29.769> one

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
it through the big shot I sent each one

of the sheets and actually i could

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.930 
of the sheets and actually i could
probably<00:02:31.599> get<00:02:31.989> about<00:02:32.110> four<00:02:32.560> on<00:02:32.590> there<00:02:33.040> through

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
texture plate and this is part of the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.320 
texture plate and this is part of the
texture<00:02:41.830> plate<00:02:42.040> kit<00:02:42.340> number<00:02:42.640> four<00:02:43.090> I've

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
texture plate kit number four I've

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.150 
texture plate kit number four I've
talked<00:02:43.930> about<00:02:44.170> how<00:02:44.349> to<00:02:44.410> use<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.799> texture

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
talked about how to use the texture

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.949 
talked about how to use the texture
place<00:02:45.370> before<00:02:45.790> so<00:02:45.970> look<00:02:46.120> at<00:02:46.209> one<00:02:46.360> of<00:02:46.390> my<00:02:46.569> older

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
place before so look at one of my older

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.009 
place before so look at one of my older
videos<00:02:46.989> for<00:02:47.530> this<00:02:48.269> after<00:02:49.269> it<00:02:49.360> came<00:02:49.510> out<00:02:49.569> you

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
videos for this after it came out you

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.289 
videos for this after it came out you
know<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.260> looks<00:02:50.440> nice<00:02:50.680> but<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.730> still<00:02:51.910> kind

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
know it looks nice but it's still kind

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.000 
know it looks nice but it's still kind
of<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:53.530> know<00:02:53.560> flat<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.940> i<00:02:55.329> took<00:02:55.959> my<00:02:56.709> creamy

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
of you know flat so i took my creamy

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.069 
of you know flat so i took my creamy
caramel<00:02:57.400> ink<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:59.790> i<00:03:00.790> took<00:03:01.030> my<00:03:01.209> textured<00:03:01.840> side

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
caramel ink and i took my textured side

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.069 
caramel ink and i took my textured side
and<00:03:02.440> i<00:03:02.799> just<00:03:03.040> ran<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.400> across<00:03:03.489> there<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:04.930> can

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
and i just ran it across there you can

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.360 
and i just ran it across there you can
see<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:05.350> starts<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.709> pick<00:03:05.890> up<00:03:06.040> some<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.310> the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
see it starts to pick up some of the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.039 
see it starts to pick up some of the
color<00:03:06.579> and<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.239> me<00:03:07.390> that<00:03:07.569> started<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:07.959> look

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
color and to me that started to look

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.160 
color and to me that started to look
more<00:03:08.319> like<00:03:08.380> wood<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:10.090> i<00:03:10.120> just<00:03:10.150> did<00:03:10.540> that<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.780> all

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
more like wood so i just did that to all

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.800 
more like wood so i just did that to all
of<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.590> sides<00:03:14.519> until<00:03:15.519> i<00:03:15.730> was<00:03:15.940> happy<00:03:16.359> with<00:03:16.569> the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
of the sides until i was happy with the

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:24.059 
of the sides until i was happy with the
way<00:03:16.959> that<00:03:17.109> it<00:03:17.260> looked<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:22.630> then<00:03:22.930> i<00:03:23.200> use<00:03:23.650> sticky

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
way that it looked and then i use sticky

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.610 
way that it looked and then i use sticky
strip<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:25.090> hear<00:03:25.359> this<00:03:25.569> to<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.170> side<00:03:26.380> of<00:03:26.440> my

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
strip to hear this to the side of my

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.199 
strip to hear this to the side of my
boxes<00:03:29.519> okay<00:03:30.519> now<00:03:31.510> for<00:03:32.079> this<00:03:32.230> front<00:03:32.560> opening

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
boxes okay now for this front opening

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.150 
boxes okay now for this front opening
once<00:03:34.209> i<00:03:34.359> adhered<00:03:34.780> it<00:03:34.900> i<00:03:35.109> put<00:03:35.709> sticky<00:03:35.980> strip

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
once i adhered it i put sticky strip

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.150 
once i adhered it i put sticky strip
around<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.519> edge<00:03:36.730> I<00:03:37.120> lined<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.600> up<00:03:38.010> turned<00:03:39.010> it

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
around the edge I lined it up turned it

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.220 
around the edge I lined it up turned it
over<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.700> just<00:03:40.060> lined<00:03:40.359> up<00:03:40.510> my<00:03:40.630> punch<00:03:40.900> again

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
over and just lined up my punch again

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.860 
over and just lined up my punch again
and<00:03:41.829> went<00:03:42.130> over<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.489> circle<00:03:42.910> so<00:03:43.480> then<00:03:43.660> that

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
and went over the circle so then that

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.569 
and went over the circle so then that
gave<00:03:44.109> me<00:03:44.410> my<00:03:44.590> opening<00:03:45.190> through<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:47.579> textured

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
gave me my opening through the textured

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.300 
gave me my opening through the textured
side<00:03:48.790> as<00:03:49.030> well<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:50.590> that's<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.920> base<00:03:51.069> of<00:03:51.250> the

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
side as well so that's the base of the

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.550 
side as well so that's the base of the
box<00:03:51.519> pretty<00:03:52.120> simple<00:03:52.540> pretty<00:03:52.750> easy<00:03:54.000> okay<00:03:55.560> so

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
box pretty simple pretty easy okay so

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.900 
box pretty simple pretty easy okay so
let's<00:03:56.859> talk<00:03:57.010> about<00:03:59.609> the<00:04:00.609> top

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
let's talk about the top

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.440 
let's talk about the top
so<00:04:02.720> like<00:04:03.200> I<00:04:03.320> said<00:04:03.380> this<00:04:03.770> is<00:04:03.830> actually<00:04:04.370> you<00:04:05.330> know

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
so like I said this is actually you know

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.860 
so like I said this is actually you know
a<00:04:05.600> box<00:04:05.900> lid<00:04:06.880> so<00:04:07.880> I<00:04:07.910> started<00:04:08.390> with<00:04:08.570> a<00:04:08.600> piece<00:04:08.840> of

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
a box lid so I started with a piece of

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.480 
a box lid so I started with a piece of
paper<00:04:09.170> that<00:04:09.620> is<00:04:10.510> three<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:11.870> a<00:04:12.590> half<00:04:12.620> by<00:04:13.190> three

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
paper that is three and a half by three

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.730 
paper that is three and a half by three
and<00:04:13.610> a<00:04:13.670> half<00:04:13.700> let's<00:04:14.690> look<00:04:14.780> at<00:04:14.960> my<00:04:15.080> notes<00:04:15.290> I<00:04:15.560> get

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
and a half let's look at my notes I get

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.320 
the right size okay three and a half by
three<00:04:18.290> and<00:04:18.350> a<00:04:18.410> half<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:18.860> then<00:04:19.400> I<00:04:19.549> scored<00:04:20.120> a

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
three and a half and then I scored a

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.080 
three and a half and then I scored a
half<00:04:20.720> inch<00:04:21.019> in<00:04:21.260> on<00:04:21.620> all<00:04:22.130> four<00:04:22.730> sides<00:04:23.530> all<00:04:24.530> right

really<00:04:42.290> pretty<00:04:42.500> easy<00:04:42.770> and<00:04:43.510> then<00:04:44.510> I<00:04:44.630> just<00:04:44.810> put<00:04:44.900> a

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
really pretty easy and then I just put a

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.220 
really pretty easy and then I just put a
little<00:04:45.140> bit<00:04:45.470> of<00:04:46.690> sticky<00:04:47.690> strip<00:04:47.930> right<00:04:48.140> there

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
little bit of sticky strip right there

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:56.160 
little bit of sticky strip right there
folded<00:04:51.230> it<00:04:51.350> in<00:04:51.500> to<00:04:51.770> meet<00:04:51.950> the<00:04:51.980> sides<00:04:53.530> get<00:04:54.530> that

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
folded it in to meet the sides get that

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.510 
folded it in to meet the sides get that
did<00:04:57.170> that<00:04:57.320> for<00:04:57.500> all<00:04:57.620> four<00:04:57.890> sides<00:04:58.100> and<00:04:58.400> that

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
did that for all four sides and that

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.810 
did that for all four sides and that
then<00:04:59.030> gives<00:04:59.210> me<00:04:59.450> my<00:04:59.780> box<00:04:59.990> lid<00:05:00.290> ok<00:05:01.040> now<00:05:01.490> we<00:05:01.610> fit

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
right on top of here oh and I should say

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.950 
right on top of here oh and I should say
actually<00:05:06.290> the<00:05:06.770> size<00:05:06.980> i<00:05:07.190> started<00:05:07.610> with<00:05:07.730> was

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
actually the size i started with was

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.720 
actually the size i started with was
just<00:05:08.960> a<00:05:09.140> little<00:05:09.530> bit<00:05:09.800> more<00:05:10.130> than<00:05:10.400> three<00:05:10.610> and<00:05:10.700> a

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
just a little bit more than three and a

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.090 
just a little bit more than three and a
half<00:05:10.760> by<00:05:11.060> three<00:05:11.300> and<00:05:11.360> a<00:05:11.450> half<00:05:11.510> so<00:05:12.500> if<00:05:12.830> you're

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
half by three and a half so if you're

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.930 
half by three and a half so if you're
using<00:05:13.370> your<00:05:13.850> fiskars<00:05:14.420> cut<00:05:15.460> go<00:05:16.460> to<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:16.760> three

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
using your fiskars cut go to the three

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.600 
using your fiskars cut go to the three
and<00:05:17.060> a<00:05:17.120> half<00:05:17.150> and<00:05:17.570> then<00:05:17.660> the<00:05:17.810> next<00:05:18.610> little

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
and a half and then the next little

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.640 
and a half and then the next little
space<00:05:19.940> over<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.360> next<00:05:20.630> notch<00:05:20.840> that's<00:05:21.410> what<00:05:21.620> I

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
space over the next notch that's what I

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.790 
space over the next notch that's what I
cut<00:05:22.570> so<00:05:23.570> that<00:05:23.600> made<00:05:24.080> sure<00:05:24.350> that<00:05:24.530> it<00:05:24.650> was<00:05:24.680> a

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
cut so that made sure that it was a

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.440 
cut so that made sure that it was a
little<00:05:25.100> bit<00:05:25.310> larger<00:05:25.580> than<00:05:25.820> the<00:05:25.970> box<00:05:26.240> so<00:05:26.419> that

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
little bit larger than the box so that

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.270 
little bit larger than the box so that
it<00:05:26.690> would<00:05:26.840> go<00:05:26.990> on<00:05:27.260> and<00:05:27.290> off<00:05:27.680> without<00:05:27.919> any

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
it would go on and off without any

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:36.750 
it would go on and off without any
problem

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.820
