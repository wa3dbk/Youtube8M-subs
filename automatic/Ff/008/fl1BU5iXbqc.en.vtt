00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hut obama and three nights turned to 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.259
 congress we again heard old songs 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.570
 about the main quote of the Russian economy 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.860
 torn to pieces in the morning for a speech 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.170
 american president started 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.880
 respond domestic policy the most 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.789
 hard expression came from power 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.240
 government bloc aha broke like a tuzik 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.699
 heating pad but the softest heard from 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.920
 economic president barack obama 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:30.359
 Peter is mistaken blue-eyed master speech 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.710
 the White House and the reaction to it with such 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.840
 the excitement is usually juvenile bullies 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.880
 telling peers in the yard what 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.559
 broke a window in the doorway and here the president 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.020
 such a big and influential country 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.210
 barrack Obama happily promises Russia 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.219
 new challenges and have taken on a bone 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.780
 exaggerated emphasizing its 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.520
 significance last year we did 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.320
 hard work together with our 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.719
 sanction allies 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.090
 It turned out that today America is strong and 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.609
 united with its allies russia 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.949
 paralyzed her economy torn in 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.750
 shreds and this is at least strange in its 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.339
 US president's speech like 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.080
 expected should have been above all 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.659
 bragging about us 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.729
 but it turned out the spirit, see them more 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.320
 worse but the congress hall to strangers 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.090
 troubles were all happy 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.580
 but in the Russian State Duma in the statement 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.110
 Obama today were outraged yes from Russia 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.680
 there are economic problems but they 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.450
 caused by 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.360
 objective adverse factors 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.490
 Obama and then where is he that the price of oil 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.500
 Obama is apparently trying to cover his 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.900
 foreign policy failures trying 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.630
 currently there is merit that it 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.909
 really not having it too when pivas 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.950
 Obama makes such statements but to 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.470
 sorry for reality have no 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.750
 relations Russian economists too in 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.820
 in amazement, Obama is advised to teach materiel 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.590
 for someone who knows a little bit 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.630
 The situation with the Russian economy is clear 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.189
 aggressive US policy here gently 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.770
 saying not the main factor 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.070
 photoguide to this inward for inner 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.020
 enjoy this speech none of the serious 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.969
 people do not read read will never be 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.860
 she for congress 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.020
 but saying the american president 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.790
 does well and tangible reputation 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.680
 Russia official response 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.450
 authorized bodies was just 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.069
 Russian mid response needed 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.540
 followed quickly today just here 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.010
 held a big press conference on 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.230
 the outcome 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.480
 last year but also a new statement by Obama 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.709
 about russia sergey laurels of course could not t 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.420
 comment on the words of american 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.220
 President, he analyzed 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.810
 in terms of philosophy these 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.849
 statements according to the head of department 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.459
 well chosen us course 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:32.239
 on the confrontation speech of the president 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:37.159
 Obama shows that the United States 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:39.859
 still want to dominate the world they 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:43.299
 be even first among equals 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:46.280
 they are more such an aggressive philosophy 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.319
 foreign policy seems to me it 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.209
 will be the topic of relations between Russia and the United States 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.129
 quite predictably became one of 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.200
 key at this press conference as well as 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.359
 Ukraine 's themes are still difficult here 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.280
 but Sergey Lavrov noted there are small 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.349
 shifts sometimes perform part 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.400
 arrangements still manage now 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:06.530
 we come close to not 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.560
 depending on the conservation of the disputed plot 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.639
 on the line of contact 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.209
 regardless of this still solve 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:16.250
 the main problem is to secure the peaceful 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.970
 population of cities and other populated 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.519
 items for this need to take heavy 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.379
 armament and the dead from the attacks of Kiev 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.359
 security officials civilians in the east 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.250
 Ukraine hut obama by the way in his 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.799
 speech never once mentioned 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.989
 as if they are not there or there but in the us 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.519
 they are not interested in this detail 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.280
 Twitter indicated the head of the State Duma Committee 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.590
 International Affairs Alexei Guns in 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.599
 addressing the nation obama said a lot 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.269
 but completely forgot four thousand 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.440
 eight hundred killed Kiev civilians 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.810
 in the east of Ukraine 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.250
 igil killed less people problems 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.010
 Russian economy of US presidents 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.230
 apparently more important than the thousands of dead civilians 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.919
 Ukrainian citizens have a little 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.480
 take pride 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:58.459
 some american political science is already 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.680
 noted the speech of the hut obama before 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.199
 congress was full of posturing while 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.989
 important topics for his country in it 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:09.639
 barely touched Viktor snow Oleg derkach 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.639
