00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.930
 Welcome to video guide Sports Betting Bonus Push 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.190
 I drew in a simple trick who a sports betting bonus of 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.330
 a total of 130 euros comes without risk from Saxony 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.579
 Here is a small example 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:18.449
 bet365 offers one hundred percent and up to 100 euros 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.660
 that it pays 400 euros gets the 100 euros on top 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.829
 This bonus amount must be paid before actually paying six times 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.089
 but these sales conditions can be avoided 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.070
 First, it must register with bet365 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.070
 You will receive the one hundred percent bonus up to 100 Euro 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.580
 if you have the bonus on why bet365 4 2 on it sign up with Betfair 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.440
 if you go to Betfair through the page Sports Betting Bonus Point EBU 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.090
 you still a bonus worth 30 euros 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.880
 This Betfair bonus can be paid directly after a bet of at least 30 Euro 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.180
 be paid 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.870
 The link to mocked bonus point EU can be found on the right side 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.060
 such as when bet365 and two accounts at different vendors 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.910
 Betfair 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.900
 our goal is to withdraw the one hundred euro bonus from bet365 without one 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.630
 Take risk 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.390
 For this we bet bet365 the entire balance on a bet with two 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.610
 possible went out 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.100
 The odds should be as close to two decimal points as possible 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.159
 at Betfair we bet the same amount on the same game though 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.250
 the opposite exit 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.940
 is important as I said that the quotas of both providers as possible 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.620
 close to two decimal zero 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.530
 So you have to search a bit 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.120
 The best times were the time over five goals or under 2 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.360
 Kor 5 goals in football 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.780
 here's an example 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.140
 at bet365 often put under two bones store at the game Bayern against Nuremberg 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.370
 At Betfair we often set the same amount more than 2000 tours 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.200
 So now, two bets run once 200 euros on over two turns 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.260
 CTO at Petra the 65th 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.680
 here is the quota 2 point zero 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.759
 and once 200 euros on under second on five goals at Betfair 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.479
 the quota here is as Commander night 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.889
 in total, the experts have placed worth 400 euros 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.469
 have paid yourself over 300 euros 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.579
 Of course, the whole works with smaller amounts 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.729
 what happens after game exit 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:25.099
 There are two ways either we win at Bet365 or at Betfair 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.689
 should we win at betfair we have 400 euros right on the bed for 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:30.649
 account- 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:34.809
 this drives Euro we can directly pay off the bonus terms of 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:38.859
 Weather net 65 you now yes no matter because with these providers we lost everything 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:43.489
 Conclusion about 100 Euro profit Â«Plus the 30 Euro bonus from Betfair 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.909
 if we did not win at Betfair we have the Trailer 65 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:48.899
 won 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:53.319
 then let us withdraw the 200 euros won there and be back with them 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.769

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.249

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.379
 to repeat again and then have the sales terms of bet365 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.899
 completely fulfilled 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:15.759
 Either way, we have a hundred to 130 euros secure profit we are off 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:16.829
