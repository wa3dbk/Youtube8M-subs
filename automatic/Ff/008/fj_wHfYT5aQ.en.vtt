with<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.420> brickwork<00:03:05.050> and<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.590> thought<00:03:05.830> well

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
with the brickwork and I thought well

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.699 
with the brickwork and I thought well
let's<00:03:06.970> just<00:03:07.270> give<00:03:07.420> it<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.630> try<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.350> not<00:03:08.590> only

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
let's just give it a try and not only

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.610 
let's just give it a try and not only
that<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.430> might<00:03:09.910> actually<00:03:10.180> work<00:03:10.720> out<00:03:11.230> quicker

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
that it might actually work out quicker

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.510 
that it might actually work out quicker
than<00:03:11.950> doing<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:12.730> in<00:03:12.850> plastic<00:03:13.300> art<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:14.709> I<00:03:15.010> set

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
than doing it in plastic art so I set

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.000 
than doing it in plastic art so I set
about<00:03:15.610> designing<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.630> building<00:03:17.050> on<00:03:17.950> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
about designing the building on the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.880 
about designing the building on the
computer<00:03:18.970> using<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.840> Adobe<00:03:20.140> Illustrator

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
computer using the Adobe Illustrator

computer using the Adobe Illustrator
program<00:03:22.709> unfortunately<00:03:23.709> time<00:03:24.010> doesn't

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
program unfortunately time doesn't

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.160 
program unfortunately time doesn't
really<00:03:24.700> allow<00:03:25.120> for<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.540> fully<00:03:25.900> detailed

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
really allow for a fully detailed

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.930 
really allow for a fully detailed
description<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:27.160> how<00:03:27.310> this<00:03:27.519> is<00:03:27.700> done<00:03:28.000> but

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
description of how this is done but

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.229 
description of how this is done but
taking<00:03:30.940> it<00:03:31.060> basically<00:03:31.720> we<00:03:32.650> start<00:03:32.980> off<00:03:33.250> by

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
taking it basically we start off by

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.370 
taking it basically we start off by
making<00:03:34.959> measurements<00:03:35.769> of<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.040> building

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
making measurements of the building

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.800 
making measurements of the building
working<00:03:38.380> out<00:03:38.739> say<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:39.790> sizes<00:03:40.269> from<00:03:40.450> bricks

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
working out say the sizes from bricks

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.570 
working out say the sizes from bricks
and<00:03:41.320> things<00:03:41.709> that<00:03:41.799> we<00:03:42.010> should<00:03:42.220> know<00:03:42.400> the

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
and things that we should know the

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.680 
and things that we should know the
actual<00:03:42.910> dimensions<00:03:43.600> of<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:44.190> then<00:03:45.420> making<00:03:46.420> the

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
actual dimensions of and then making the

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.490 
actual dimensions of and then making the
shape<00:03:46.930> on<00:03:47.200> our<00:03:47.830> computer<00:03:48.430> screen<00:03:49.110> we<00:03:50.110> then<00:03:50.290> add

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
shape on our computer screen we then add

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.710 
shape on our computer screen we then add
the<00:03:51.070> details<00:03:51.549> I<00:03:52.140> will<00:03:53.140> start<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.650> bricks<00:03:54.720> and

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
the details I will start the bricks and

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.680 
the details I will start the bricks and
then<00:03:55.870> on<00:03:56.140> top<00:03:56.320> of<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.560> bricks<00:03:57.420> we<00:03:58.420> do<00:03:58.570> the

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
then on top of the bricks we do the

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.930 
then on top of the bricks we do the
windows<00:03:59.940> window<00:04:00.940> ledges<00:04:02.130> in<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.459> case<00:04:03.700> of

it<00:04:23.320> will<00:04:23.440> say<00:04:23.650> Sydney<00:04:24.220> Street<00:04:24.700> Station

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
it will say Sydney Street Station

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.830 
it will say Sydney Street Station
when<00:04:26.500> everything<00:04:26.919> is<00:04:27.039> finished<00:04:27.630> we<00:04:28.630> then

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
when everything is finished we then

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.430 
when everything is finished we then
simply<00:04:29.190> put<00:04:30.190> it<00:04:30.310> through<00:04:30.460> to<00:04:30.550> print<00:04:31.289> and<00:04:32.289> hey

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
simply put it through to print and hey

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.740 
simply put it through to print and hey
presto<00:04:32.470> we've<00:04:33.400> got<00:04:33.550> basically<00:04:34.150> a<00:04:34.479> card<00:04:35.110> kids

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
presto we've got basically a card kids

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.990 
presto we've got basically a card kids
you<00:04:37.750> can<00:04:37.960> print<00:04:38.229> out<00:04:38.410> more<00:04:38.830> than<00:04:39.009> one<00:04:39.220> copy<00:04:39.520> and

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
you can print out more than one copy and

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.700 
you can print out more than one copy and
that<00:04:40.979> allows<00:04:41.979> us<00:04:42.009> to<00:04:42.910> be<00:04:43.030> able<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.419> paste<00:04:44.259> one

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
that allows us to be able to paste one

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.370 
that allows us to be able to paste one
on<00:04:45.009> top<00:04:45.280> of<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.610> other<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.210> therefore<00:04:46.960> add

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
on top of the other and therefore add

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.420 
on top of the other and therefore add
more<00:04:47.650> relief<00:04:48.039> more<00:04:48.490> detail<00:04:49.830> so<00:04:50.830> once<00:04:51.190> you've

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
more relief more detail so once you've

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.460 
more relief more detail so once you've
printed<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.910> sheets<00:04:52.150> out<00:04:52.419> it's<00:04:53.080> just<00:04:53.350> the

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
printed the sheets out it's just the

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.450 
printed the sheets out it's just the
case<00:04:53.680> getting<00:04:54.520> them<00:04:54.699> onto<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:55.090> cutting<00:04:55.300> board

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
case getting them onto the cutting board

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.969 
case getting them onto the cutting board
cutting<00:04:57.460> them<00:04:57.789> out<00:04:58.320> laying<00:04:59.320> them<00:04:59.530> on<00:04:59.620> in

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
cutting them out laying them on in

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.150 
cutting them out laying them on in
relief<00:05:00.430> and<00:05:00.930> then<00:05:01.930> we're<00:05:02.110> ready<00:05:02.320> to<00:05:02.949> actually

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
relief and then we're ready to actually

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:11.450 
relief and then we're ready to actually
construct<00:05:03.789> our<00:05:04.150> building<00:05:09.330> there<00:05:10.330> is<00:05:10.599> our<00:05:10.990> main

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
construct our building there is our main

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.969 
construct our building there is our main
section<00:05:12.460> other<00:05:13.270> said<00:05:13.630> we<00:05:13.780> do<00:05:13.990> need<00:05:14.229> to<00:05:14.710> add

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
section other said we do need to add

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.050 
section other said we do need to add
relief<00:05:15.940> detail<00:05:16.630> and<00:05:17.410> I<00:05:17.500> mentioned<00:05:18.039> the<00:05:18.400> North

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
relief detail and I mentioned the North

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.969 
relief detail and I mentioned the North
London<00:05:19.270> railway<00:05:19.690> panels<00:05:22.080> normally<00:05:23.080> if<00:05:23.440> I<00:05:23.740> was

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
London railway panels normally if I was

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.700 
London railway panels normally if I was
actually<00:05:24.750> building<00:05:25.750> this<00:05:25.900> as<00:05:26.110> a<00:05:26.259> finished

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
actually building this as a finished

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.649 
actually building this as a finished
model<00:05:27.130> I<00:05:27.660> would<00:05:28.660> very<00:05:29.139> very<00:05:29.520> carefully<00:05:30.659> go

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:31.659 
model I would very very carefully go

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:36.600 
model I would very very carefully go
around<00:05:31.990> the<00:05:32.169> edge<00:05:32.500> of<00:05:33.240> this<00:05:35.280> with<00:05:36.280> a<00:05:36.310> black

the next thing to do is cut out the
windows<00:05:57.439> cutting<00:05:58.439> out<00:05:58.620> windows<00:05:59.159> is<00:05:59.779> always<00:06:00.779> a

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:00.809 
windows cutting out windows is always a

window ledges and I would put in these
moldings<00:06:35.490> here<00:06:35.999> and<00:06:36.180> then<00:06:37.080> when<00:06:37.229> it's

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:37.379 
moldings here and then when it's

moldings here and then when it's
finished<00:06:37.710> all<00:06:38.430> being<00:06:38.849> well<00:06:39.199> it<00:06:40.199> would<00:06:40.439> look

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:40.589 
finished all being well it would look

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:42.200 
finished all being well it would look
like<00:06:40.770> the<00:06:40.979> version<00:06:41.399> that<00:06:41.520> we<00:06:41.669> built<00:06:41.909> for<00:06:42.120> the

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
like the version that we built for the

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:54.610 
like the version that we built for the
layout

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.480 

that's<00:06:55.620> roughly<00:06:56.250> how<00:06:57.020> these<00:06:58.020> buildings<00:06:58.560> were

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
that's roughly how these buildings were

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.150 
that's roughly how these buildings were
originated<00:07:00.450> and<00:07:00.710> after<00:07:01.710> you've<00:07:01.800> had<00:07:01.890> a<00:07:01.950> bit<00:07:02.130> of

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 
originated and after you've had a bit of

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.950 
originated and after you've had a bit of
practice<00:07:02.670> I'm<00:07:02.850> sure<00:07:03.030> you<00:07:03.150> have<00:07:03.360> lots<00:07:03.570> of<00:07:03.690> fun

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 
practice I'm sure you have lots of fun

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.470 
practice I'm sure you have lots of fun
and<00:07:04.350> the<00:07:04.770> rewards<00:07:05.250> are<00:07:05.400> definitely<00:07:05.940> there<00:07:06.120> as

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.480 
and the rewards are definitely there as

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.150 
and the rewards are definitely there as
you<00:07:06.750> can<00:07:06.900> see<00:07:07.050> on<00:07:07.170> the<00:07:07.260> layout<00:07:07.590> we're<00:07:07.800> happy

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 
you can see on the layout we're happy

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.660 
you can see on the layout we're happy
with<00:07:08.280> it

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:08.670 
with it

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.210 
with it
I<00:07:09.020> think<00:07:10.020> the<00:07:10.170> important<00:07:10.530> thing<00:07:10.560> with<00:07:10.860> rowing

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 
I think the important thing with rowing

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.070 
I think the important thing with rowing
modeling<00:07:11.550> as<00:07:11.700> long<00:07:12.120> as<00:07:12.270> we<00:07:12.450> are<00:07:12.480> happy

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
modeling as long as we are happy

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.900 
modeling as long as we are happy
ourselves<00:07:13.860> with<00:07:14.100> the<00:07:14.190> standards<00:07:14.670> that<00:07:14.730> we

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:14.910 
ourselves with the standards that we

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.390 
ourselves with the standards that we
achieve<00:07:15.240> then<00:07:16.170> I<00:07:16.470> think<00:07:16.710> we've<00:07:16.890> achieved<00:07:17.010> our

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 
achieve then I think we've achieved our

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.640 
achieve then I think we've achieved our
goal
