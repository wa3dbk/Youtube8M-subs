00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:29.989 
fail every time so to do it to get a

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.610 
fail every time so to do it to get a
team<00:00:30.289> loop<00:00:30.439> aligned<00:00:30.829> properly<00:00:32.290> you<00:00:33.290> need<00:00:33.440> to

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
team loop aligned properly you need to

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.680 
team loop aligned properly you need to
if<00:00:34.370> you<00:00:34.430> look<00:00:34.670> at<00:00:34.790> our<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:35.120> best<00:00:35.329> thing<00:00:35.450> to<00:00:35.480> do

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
if you look at our the best thing to do

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.479 
if you look at our the best thing to do
is<00:00:35.960> to<00:00:36.079> start<00:00:36.379> by<00:00:36.559> looking<00:00:36.710> at<00:00:37.010> where<00:00:37.280> your

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
is to start by looking at where your

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.729 
is to start by looking at where your
market<00:00:37.940> is<00:00:38.090> in<00:00:38.420> this<00:00:38.539> case<00:00:38.780> if<00:00:38.960> I'm<00:00:39.079> doing<00:00:39.710> a

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
market is in this case if I'm doing a

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.650 
market is in this case if I'm doing a
switchback<00:00:40.090> I'm<00:00:41.090> not<00:00:41.239> going<00:00:41.390> to<00:00:41.450> change

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
switchback I'm not going to change

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.770 
switchback I'm not going to change
direction<00:00:42.399> so<00:00:43.399> I'm<00:00:43.670> going<00:00:43.789> to<00:00:43.850> cast<00:00:44.120> me<00:00:44.390> where

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
direction so I'm going to cast me where

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.619 
direction so I'm going to cast me where
my<00:00:44.899> mind<00:00:45.170> is<00:00:45.260> language<00:00:45.739> so<00:00:46.670> if<00:00:46.760> I<00:00:46.850> call<00:00:47.059> that<00:00:47.120> 12

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
my mind is language so if I call that 12

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.260 
my mind is language so if I call that 12

I'm going to lead with the bundle rod

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:56.040 
I'm going to lead with the bundle rod
around<00:03:51.340> make<00:03:52.340> my<00:03:52.519> past

I'm<00:03:56.620> going<00:03:56.770> to<00:03:56.830> do<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.040> next<00:03:57.220> cast<00:03:57.520> a<00:03:57.730> little

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
I'm going to do the next cast a little

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.460 
I'm going to do the next cast a little
bit<00:03:58.060> faster<00:03:58.600> just<00:03:58.630> so<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:58.960> can<00:03:59.110> go<00:03:59.230> through<00:03:59.260> the

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
bit faster just so I can go through the

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.320 
bit faster just so I can go through the
move<00:03:59.650> motion<00:04:00.070> a<00:04:00.100> little<00:04:00.370> smoother<00:04:02.580> so<00:04:03.580> again

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
move motion a little smoother so again

is that rod I'm going to over rotate the
rods<00:04:54.410> not<00:04:54.650> going<00:04:54.830> to<00:04:54.889> load<00:04:55.009> well<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.430> cast<00:04:55.699> is

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
rods not going to load well the cast is

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.689

short stroke weight at 4:30 you can hit
that<00:05:04.010> stroke<00:05:04.430> right<00:05:04.610> there<00:05:04.669> the<00:05:05.660> forward<00:05:05.990> cast

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
that stroke right there the forward cast

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.890 
that stroke right there the forward cast
becomes<00:05:06.590> very<00:05:06.800> easy<00:05:07.000> and<00:05:08.000> in<00:05:08.150> future<00:05:08.449> segments

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
becomes very easy and in future segments

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.879 
becomes very easy and in future segments
here<00:05:08.960> we're<00:05:09.139> gonna<00:05:09.229> be<00:05:09.350> talking<00:05:09.650> about<00:05:09.680> the

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
here we're gonna be talking about the

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.430 
here we're gonna be talking about the
floor<00:05:10.100> cast<00:05:10.460> as<00:05:10.669> well<00:05:10.880> but<00:05:11.510> for<00:05:11.690> now<00:05:11.840> that's

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
floor cast as well but for now that's

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.370 
floor cast as well but for now that's
how<00:05:12.650> you<00:05:12.680> line<00:05:12.949> up<00:05:12.979> your<00:05:13.190> deep
