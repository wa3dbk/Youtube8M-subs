00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.589
 alexander hello today I'll show you 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.720
 just in all mountain bikes is 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.940
 from 2006 is a canon tor 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.230
 I have a few people 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.360
 they wanted a bit more 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.549
 on the subject of mountain bike knowledge equipment 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.180
 partie and so on is but because 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.380
 that I have to be almost the last year 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.920
 not at all or no mountain bike at all 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.680
 I am driving a bit more 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.580
 of date so not so up to date 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.579
 yet for you it shows everyone 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.640
 in old tractor here and only one time 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.440
 little thing I liked so much 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.850
 busy tuned bit changed 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.100
 that 's why I'm going out of the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.480
 shows you the first camera out and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.530
 device that gives the device good here 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.579
 Vollmann had only once back 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.710
 Wheelset is a certain sexual de 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.390
 whether today through eight years later 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.120
 still there can not tell you 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.829
 but we are ultra brutal and stable 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.809
 get started on a dare 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.969
 in the past an enduro story really good 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.770
 So these are not commonly known 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.320
 can go wrong fake everything 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.729
 very stiff sooner than next time 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.610
 kidnapped albert I used to have one 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.920
 big baby on it or martina one 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.830
 continuously big thick mature 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.350
 from that 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.540
 But the climate is often brutal 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.390
 Do not make fun a bit regularly 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.299
 Space travel if you keep the course 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.900
 down the hill and you want to go clubbing 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.090
 then he makes it more beautiful 232 3 5 or 24 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.990
 on after the technical six-digit 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.759
 Areas of force are approximately the same 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.329
 about 70 kilo was heading to 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.430
 driving fits very well 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.409
 whole times people split on it but 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.210
 as far as switzerland against the rim has none 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.180
 have arguments as these French 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.150
 right there then have as a key 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.630
 package first eleven 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:07.340
 30 as far as the plan is a rate standard xt 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.860
 will be perfect kinokette xt and 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.690
 that there is nothing 0 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.730
 The short version of credit would have to 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.690
 So be careful no extreme sounds 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.050
 to make stories and thus more 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.050
 trust 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.690
 it does not seem so cool to him 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.500
 the old style which is why it's a bit rough 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.500
 scopia this newer shimano circuit 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.860
 falke forgot the things again 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.020
 We are not those things out the back 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.450
 that's just me in case of the case 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.459
 cool because the richest language world 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.980
 therefore a good development 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.500
 then you see it's a form 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.620
 brake i had animal problems with 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.620
 the backlash of unemployed the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.080
 simply works here , of course 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.300
 maybe for 8 90 euro than not 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.910
 full of money just use a formula 1 with 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.360
 Brems brought is a small standard model 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.190
 Once freedom , this works 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.459
 history here therefore time machine 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.530
 Brakes type on it we just wear 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.580
 writes concurrently from the moment 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.040
 fit with the tight then the next 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:31.130
 always a bit higher up with the 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:34.700
 middle pair quite a bit I stand so hole 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.800
 unfold a hollow sphere in it 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.400
 overstepped slowly standard xt 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.080
 Umwerfer also okay here coherent tune 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.360
 i have this shimano the xp dahle 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.950
 On top of that they have a big cage 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.860
 Incidentally, there is still profit in the market 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.570
 same moment here exactly the same 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.310
 construction produced eight years later 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.799
 I'm cool in there 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.019
 plastic crates beneficial to opponent 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:01.160
 metal cage that you do not then 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:03.769
 the metal spit into the meat quite cree 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.569
 has purely bangs that quite well and 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.319
 anyway I have the pad for 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:14.379
 for your shoe and content totally 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:14.379
 happy I can not do so well 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:21.620
 we have the upper area in the 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:25.940
 middle area times too whole 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:29.720
 normal things slrg a saddle one 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.280
 Space support of all standards as 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.919
 good compromise of easy and of 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.979
 robust from stable and in the middle 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.630
 have my fox fox derigs in yourself 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.180
 her wonderful with 15 different ones 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.660
 possibilities to adjust the team 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.370
 sky has only one disadvantage the team has 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.289
 not really a lockout 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.389
 that means who wanted to block the block 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.789
 you want to do your internship as 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.190
 Hospital turn was like that back then 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.110
 in the meantime have changed it but one 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.180
 must also remember that mountain bike is 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.169
 Fish had one either or 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.960
 history where I then either he 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:10.190
 So down you go because you really ne 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.229
 nice cool figure so you can me 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.360
 so guys knows exactly how it is 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.460
 but you guys can do something here 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.500
 has the account in front of me there you can 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.940
 fragrance rein pump was in the air pure to 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.310
 me and download here 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.120
 she really could do it all 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.570
 to adjust 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.430
 still has the 160 mm in front 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.580
 behind and I always thought that was cool 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.650
 super smaller jumps over and over 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:45.710
 then we go forward sometimes 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:48.770
 the front before it again free 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:52.729
 slow down I think find 200 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.770
 Write the first real reserve 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:56.990
 in it we'll keep you down like stop 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.840
 I'm stuck with hundreds of fork 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.210
 is really great is a foxman with too 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.210
 all possible 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.100
 knickknacks but is still white 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.210
 run back in town 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:12.699
 responsiveness really good if 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.009
 she would be a bit too far 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.389
 just make a serious mistake and 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:20.289
 then we can stay up there too 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:22.720
 I know how that's called the 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:24.910
 regulate pre-tension stop and that has 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.199
 also 1000 function you can in kaster 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.940
 then it can be something else 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.349
 trainings it can turn something else so 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.250
 is a nice sensitive has 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:37.330
 Just pack it in and the top is here 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.979
 small reiser the porch which is already 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.990
 he feels pretty cool with it 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:42.550
 you can not drive there 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:47.020
 Break the handlebars forwards 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:49.360
 putting back the tigers is too 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:53.590
 great super fast very nice 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:56.349
 I really like history and man 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.180
 So have fun with your darling 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:07.240
 drive and then I just take the 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:09.039
 camera for not paying attention to the white 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.070
 But I could do it from scratch 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:17.860
 See that you can see the whole camera 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:20.710
 Part of the front is the size m 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:24.849
 So for me with single table or 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.330
 Sufficient fits makes fun then 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:27.610
 drive 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.490
 the chair depending on what kind of setup 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.500
 have more above 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.400
 okay what brutal down drives like me 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.330
 the tires last a bit longer 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.340
 to adjust 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.349
 but if it is rather comfortable by 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.949
 say the fed ahlbeck you good good 

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:43.509
 fig and a little bit of what to look for 

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:46.750
 what tire profile you to use 

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:49.659
 otherwise you think that will allow you 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:53.820
 have liked a bit what 

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:53.820
 seen and then I'll tell you one more time 

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:00.280
 exactly and then ciao here
