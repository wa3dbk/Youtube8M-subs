 stir and set on fire and i 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.160
 I use pectin because confiture with 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.579
 they cook it very fast which means we 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.679
 save all the vitamins and taste and except 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.679
 addition pectin gives a pleasant jelly 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.030
 texture 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:54.640
 first put the berries on a small fire 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.420

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.300
 burned 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.870
 and as soon as they give the juice 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.300
 can increase 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.580
 bringing the berries was boiling like 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.810

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:19.050
 stir once per kilogram of peeled 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.160
 berries need a kilo of sand 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.620

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.340
 all the sugar has already been added up to 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.100
 very strong boil when confiture 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.310

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.040
