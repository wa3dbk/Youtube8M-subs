way to install this bag is to undo these
webbing<00:00:56.730> loops<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.390> then<00:00:57.750> kind<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.260> lace<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
webbing loops and then kind of lace the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.160 
webbing loops and then kind of lace the
bag<00:00:59.699> onto<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.149> rack<00:01:00.329> but<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.809> takes<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
bag onto the rack but that takes a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.889 
bag onto the rack but that takes a
little<00:01:01.289> while<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.609> find<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.300> much<00:01:03.449> easier

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
little while and I find it's much easier

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.130 
little while and I find it's much easier
just<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.350> lace<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.799> bag<00:01:05.210> onto<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> rack<00:01:06.540> so

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
just to lace the bag onto the rack so

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.850 
just to lace the bag onto the rack so
line<00:01:07.439> everything<00:01:07.799> back<00:01:08.040> up<00:01:08.070> again<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.860> it's

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
line everything back up again and it's

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.179 
line everything back up again and it's
