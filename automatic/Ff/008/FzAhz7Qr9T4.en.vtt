00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
in-house movements and we neglect to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.100 
in-house movements and we neglect to
mention<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.489> fact<00:01:02.639> that<00:01:02.819> that<00:01:03.449> all<00:01:03.749> Seiko

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
mention the fact that that all Seiko

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.730 
mention the fact that that all Seiko
watches<00:01:04.470> are<00:01:04.589> in-house<00:01:04.970> which<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.740> quite

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
watches are in-house which is quite

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.789 
watches are in-house which is quite
quite<00:01:07.979> quite<00:01:08.759> impressive<00:01:09.299> actually

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
quite quite impressive actually

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.389 
quite quite impressive actually
so<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:11.909> has<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.170> five<00:01:13.170> hour<00:01:13.409> 66

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
so this one here has the five hour 66

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.999 
so this one here has the five hour 66
Spring<00:01:15.270> Drive<00:01:15.420> movement<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.079> it<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.770> that's

the the spring drive movement with the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.100 
the the spring drive movement with the
GMT<00:01:19.770> complication<00:01:20.700> as<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.689> can<00:01:21.780> see<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
GMT complication as you can see the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.139 
GMT complication as you can see the
movement<00:01:22.649> is<00:01:22.710> quite<00:01:22.829> impressive<00:01:23.189> they've

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
movement is quite impressive they've

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.749 
movement is quite impressive they've
finished<00:01:24.719> the<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.710> movement<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.579> this

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
finished the the movement on the on this

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.730 
finished the the movement on the on this
and<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.210> watch<00:01:27.390> better<00:01:27.780> than<00:01:28.049> any<00:01:28.320> other

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
and this watch better than any other

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.740 
and this watch better than any other
watch<00:01:29.130> I've<00:01:29.369> seen<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.820> $4,000<00:01:30.539> price

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
watch I've seen in the $4,000 price

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.240 
watch I've seen in the $4,000 price
range<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.170> think<00:01:31.200> these<00:01:31.439> retail<00:01:32.009> for<00:01:32.159> about

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
range I think these retail for about

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.179 
range I think these retail for about
4300<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:34.109> that's<00:01:34.320> that's<00:01:34.619> that's<00:01:34.979> pretty

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
4300 and that's that's that's pretty

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.639 
4300 and that's that's that's pretty
impressive<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.850> me<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.229> circular

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
impressive to me the the the circular

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.130 
impressive to me the the the circular
graining<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.280> fine<00:01:38.609> and<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.899> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
graining is so fine and and the the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.349 
graining is so fine and and the the
rotor<00:01:40.320> has<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> bit<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.219> a<00:01:41.310> gunmetal<00:01:41.729> finish<00:01:41.909> to

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359 
rotor has a bit of a gunmetal finish to

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.889 
rotor has a bit of a gunmetal finish to
it<00:01:42.390> which<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.600> really<00:01:42.930> cool<00:01:43.289> I<00:01:44.750> really<00:01:45.750> like

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
it which is really cool I really like

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.660 
it which is really cool I really like
the<00:01:46.049> way<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.799> movement<00:01:47.159> looks<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.609> I

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the way that the movement looks and I

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.240 
the way that the movement looks and I
like<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> way<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.119> rotor<00:01:48.329> looks<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.109> it<00:01:49.770> neat

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
like the way the rotor looks and it neat

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.520 
like the way the rotor looks and it neat
watching<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.759> move<00:01:50.939> because<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.929> doesn't<00:01:52.320> have

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
watching it move because it doesn't have

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.130 
watching it move because it doesn't have
the<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.429> same<00:01:53.640> type<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.060> escapement<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.990> you

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
the the same type of escapement that you

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.510 
the the same type of escapement that you
normally<00:01:55.469> see<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.679> watches<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.189> one<00:01:56.369> just

one<00:05:57.300> that<00:05:57.449> turns<00:05:57.719> the<00:05:57.960> the<00:05:58.819> GMT<00:05:59.819> hand<00:06:00.210> because

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
one that turns the the GMT hand because

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.300 
one that turns the the GMT hand because
the<00:06:01.259> local<00:06:01.589> time<00:06:01.770> is<00:06:01.800> what<00:06:02.039> you're<00:06:02.159> going<00:06:02.250> to

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
the local time is what you're going to

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.379 
the local time is what you're going to
be<00:06:02.430> changing<00:06:02.819> the<00:06:02.909> most<00:06:03.089> when<00:06:03.300> you're

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
be changing the most when you're

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.079 
be changing the most when you're
traveling<00:06:03.870> right<00:06:04.279> the<00:06:05.279> GMT<00:06:05.550> can<00:06:05.789> be<00:06:05.879> set<00:06:06.060> to

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:06.089 
traveling right the GMT can be set to

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:09.110 
traveling right the GMT can be set to
home<00:06:06.330> time<00:06:07.190> so<00:06:08.190> that's<00:06:08.430> that's<00:06:08.669> kind<00:06:08.969> of<00:06:09.000> a

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
home time so that's that's kind of a

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.640 
home time so that's that's kind of a
nice<00:06:09.270> feature<00:06:09.300> there

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650
