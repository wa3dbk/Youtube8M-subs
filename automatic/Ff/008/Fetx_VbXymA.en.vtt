you<00:00:14.340> got<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.520> microwave<00:00:14.880> door<00:00:15.210> here<00:00:15.570> that's

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
you got a microwave door here that's

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.480 
you got a microwave door here that's
hard<00:00:15.930> to<00:00:16.080> watch<00:00:16.110> we'll<00:00:16.619> show<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.040> how<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.369> get

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
hard to watch we'll show you how to get

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:26.330 
hard to watch we'll show you how to get
this<00:00:17.670> guy<00:00:21.710> on<00:00:22.939> this<00:00:23.939> sound<00:00:24.180> here<00:00:24.920> is<00:00:25.920> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
this guy on this sound here is the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.729 
this guy on this sound here is the
mechanism<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.630> pushing<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.529> door<00:00:29.460> here

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:30.739 
mechanism and pushing the door here

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:37.280 
mechanism and pushing the door here
causes<00:00:31.739> push<00:00:32.460> up<00:00:33.230> inside<00:00:34.230> here<00:00:35.780> see<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.930> pushes

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
causes push up inside here see it pushes

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.220 
causes push up inside here see it pushes
up<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:37.500> bottom<00:00:37.950> one<00:00:38.300> so<00:00:39.300> basically<00:00:39.899> I'm<00:00:40.110> going

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
up the bottom one so basically I'm going

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.840 
up the bottom one so basically I'm going
to<00:00:40.320> do<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.620> spray<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> little<00:00:41.250> bit<00:00:41.399> grade

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
to do is spray a little bit grade

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.610 
to do is spray a little bit grade
silicone<00:00:42.450> spray<00:00:42.739> right<00:00:43.739> inside<00:00:44.269> that<00:00:45.269> first

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
silicone spray right inside that first

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.830 
silicone spray right inside that first
feel<00:00:46.620> where<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> lever<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.539> and<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.690> will

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
feel where the lever is and this will

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.849 
feel where the lever is and this will
dry<00:00:52.789> and<00:00:53.789> then<00:00:54.449> I'll<00:00:54.600> clean<00:00:54.899> off<00:00:55.109> both<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
dry and then I'll clean off both of the

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.389 
dry and then I'll clean off both of the
peg<00:00:56.730> posts

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.960 

right<00:01:01.940> here<00:01:03.339> now<00:01:04.339> should<00:01:04.610> restore<00:01:06.970> our

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
right here now should restore our

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.410 
right here now should restore our
microwave<00:01:11.560> with<00:01:12.560> one<00:01:12.799> point<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.970> silicon

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
microwave with one point and the silicon

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.510 
microwave with one point and the silicon
is<00:01:14.600> 100<00:01:14.930> percent<00:01:15.229> silicon<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:16.040> it'll<00:01:16.280> dry

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
is 100 percent silicon so it'll dry

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.050 
is 100 percent silicon so it'll dry
maintain<00:01:17.119> a<00:01:17.150> food<00:01:17.479> feed<00:01:18.229> safe<00:01:18.550> for<00:01:19.550> use<00:01:19.700> but<00:01:20.030> I

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
maintain a food feed safe for use but I

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.760 
maintain a food feed safe for use but I
can<00:01:20.240> want<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.479> let<00:01:20.630> it<00:01:20.750> dry<00:01:20.930> completely<00:01:20.960> before

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
can want to let it dry completely before

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.120 
can want to let it dry completely before
using<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.550> microwave<00:01:22.850> again<00:01:23.649> it's<00:01:24.649> a<00:01:24.800> big

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
using the microwave again it's a big

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.789 
using the microwave again it's a big
stick<00:01:25.700> indoor<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:30.200> only<00:01:30.320> takes<00:01:30.619> a<00:01:30.740> little

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
stick indoor and it only takes a little

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.950 
stick indoor and it only takes a little
bit<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:32.420> get<00:01:32.570> it<00:01:32.630> go<00:01:33.610> we're<00:01:34.610> all<00:01:34.759> fixed<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:35.600> wait

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
bit to get it go we're all fixed so wait

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:54.510 
bit to get it go we're all fixed so wait
24<00:01:36.440> hours<00:01:36.470> before<00:01:36.710> use<00:01:37.100> it<00:01:37.310> did<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:37.970> go

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:07.120
