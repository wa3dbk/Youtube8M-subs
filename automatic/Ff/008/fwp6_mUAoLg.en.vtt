00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.050 
and I guess my paintbrush is kind of
tipped<00:04:30.830> it<00:04:31.160> like<00:04:31.370> a<00:04:31.400> almost<00:04:32.240> a<00:04:32.650> 45-degree

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
tipped it like a almost a 45-degree

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:43.059 
tipped it like a almost a 45-degree
angle<00:04:35.060> so<00:04:35.270> I<00:04:35.330> can<00:04:35.599> see<00:04:35.870> exactly<00:04:38.169> where<00:04:42.069> where

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.069 
angle so I can see exactly where where

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.980 
angle so I can see exactly where where
the<00:04:43.449> brush<00:04:44.449> is<00:04:44.930> going<00:04:45.770> to<00:04:45.949> land<00:04:46.810> you<00:04:47.810> could

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
also use an angle brush but since this

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.110
