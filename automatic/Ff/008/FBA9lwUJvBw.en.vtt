00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello I'm a reader germanman of 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.649
 teltarif and I have this for you today 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.800
 galaxy s of samsung the galaxy s 5 ought to 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.679
 the sequel of the galaxy s 4 as new 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.089
 flagship of samsung compete 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.880
 From the format you can see that the galaxy 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.369
 s 5 is slightly larger, namely exactly 0 1 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.080
 inch display diagonal and it is too 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.769
 again a little more angular so gone 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.939
 to the galaxy s2 style of the back 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.269
 but you can see the biggest 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.820
 change during the galaxy s 4 yet 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.160
 a high gloss surface had on 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.649
 samsung has this at the back 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.290
 galaxy s 5 completely redesigned 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.390
 similar to the galaxy note 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.510
 was made shows now one 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.420
 structure-like surface of the matte 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.680
 appears until shimmering in the mother of pearl 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.120
 and the galaxy s 5 also less prone 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.719
 makes you slip out of hand when you go out of hand 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.190
 it stops now we show the one 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.079
 the new function namely the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.480
 fingerprint sensor of the device 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.140
 should unlock if you do it on 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.270
 you will be asked for the fingerprint 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.640
 to pull over the display and even 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.500
 over the power button 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.150
 the surface of galaxy s 5 is something 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.720
 redesigned now in flat 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.340
 design 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.750
 This one recognizes particularly well if 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.759
 to make the notification to 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.290
 bottom pulls in the form of new own 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:29.670
 symbols or in the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.850
 Settings menu st one sees that it 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.920
 everything is completely new 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.990
 was divided and at the beginning 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.490
 maybe something is difficult 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.229
 to get along in it because the whole 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.229
 division is completely new, as I said 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.750
 technically you actually need 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.659
 Not to say anything is moving 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.229
 the galaxy s 5 in terms of performance quite far 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.530
 above 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.490
 the new snapdragon 801 makes for one 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.280
 liquid operation 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.520
 which we then also in the benchmark test 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.070
 can show and also when scrolling has 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.990
 no problems at all 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.420
 another new feature is the pulse 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.899
 fair to go about sf of samsung 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.400
 reached and the heart rate and around 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.900
 you have to measure this on the back 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.310
 Led lightning lay your finger 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.980
 then it looks a bit red 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.769
 it lights up that means it's light 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.680
 penetrates the finger and measures the 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.019
 pulse and has this again right away 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.360
 on a count 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.549
 because you can then save on the app 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.930
 like the pulse rate over different 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.590
 days and thus his overview 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.659
 to keep 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.659
 in my eight case it is 86
