00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 chocolate cake bunny is typical 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.210
 Viennese dessert 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.250
 as well as one of the popular varieties in 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.630
 world first made meeting 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.190
 eight hundred and thirty second 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.190
 otherwise if not fall on costs 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.030
 let's start by separating proteins and 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.030
 yolks 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.980
 whites until the refrigerator in order to 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.380
 they whipped well room oil 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:53.400
 temperature stir sugar on escudo 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.400
 after all invented a little and rubbish 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.630
 now because add yolks have time 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.420
 oil mixtures need to add tickling 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:16.830
 free 125 grams of dark chocolate 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.830
 melt in a water bath 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.070
 further pour bitch 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.569
 but also a mixture and using a mixer 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.569
 stir until smooth 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.770
 it's time for the proteins get them out 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.960
 cooler and whip add sugar 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.039
 at the same time in a minute and continue 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.039
 beat until steady peaks 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.130
 steady peaks are when 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.310
 put mixer blades whipped protein 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.250
 forms the elastic big which does not settle 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.110
 further protein must be mixed with chocolate on 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.100
 oil mixture for this will require 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.930
 silicone or wood spatula is better 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.520
 total squirrels add in three runs 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.230
 and you need to mix neat 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.739
 I wrap conductive movements 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.739
 in this way 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.189
 brought to homogeneity now add 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.189
 flour and neatly placed as well 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:10.820
 the form is covered with baking paper and 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:14.350
 my washing vegetable brand test 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.350
 we spread and distributed 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.370
 you need to bake 45 minutes at a temperature 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.620
 180 degrees after the oven no no give 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.890
 cool down after 15 minutes get out of shape and 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:47.879
 cut into two pieces left on 4 6 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:49.739
 hours and closer at night for the filling 250 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.980
 gram of apricot jam bring to 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:58.129
 boiling add 2 tablespoons not that 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.129
 or rum and stir for 3 more minutes 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.859
 half still hot jam 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:11.190
 we spread on the lower biscuit and 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:14.909
 distributed over the entire surface then 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:18.060
 we put the second sponge cake 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:21.590
 remnants of jam and also distribute by 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.590
 whole surface and around the edges 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.650
 it only remains to cover the chocolate cake 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.940
 version for this 150 grams of chocolate 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.919
 grind with a knife 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.870
 already start adding a tablespoon 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:47.479
 sunflower oil and then a small 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.620
 the amount of merchant is now shuffled 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.620
 until chocolate is completely dissolved 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.550
 pour icing on the cake carefully 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.550
 snag it from all sides 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.270
 Of course it is far from level 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:31.960
 confectioners master however I hope that 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:34.180
 this video will be why you cake 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.750
 turned out amazing taste and serve 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.870
 it is recommended with whipped cream 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.870
