00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
LS intake it has a supercharger on it

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.430 
LS intake it has a supercharger on it
they<00:00:41.280> wanted<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.609> install<00:00:41.909> a<00:00:41.989> direct<00:00:42.989> port<00:00:43.140> kit

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
they wanted to install a direct port kit

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.860 
they wanted to install a direct port kit
inside<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.399> manifold<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.600> going<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.839> a

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
inside the manifold it's going to be a

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.090 
inside the manifold it's going to be a
tight<00:00:46.109> fit<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.440> everything<00:00:46.799> we<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.039> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
tight fit on everything we have to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.279 
tight fit on everything we have to
disassemble<00:00:47.609> it<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.789> once<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:48.870> get<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.079> apart

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
disassemble it and once we get it apart

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.660 
disassemble it and once we get it apart
we'll<00:00:49.679> figure<00:00:50.010> out<00:00:50.129> how<00:00:50.280> we're<00:00:50.429> going<00:00:50.549> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
we'll figure out how we're going to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.759 
we'll figure out how we're going to
install<00:00:50.909> it<00:00:51.320> all<00:00:52.320> right<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.559> got<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
install it all right we got the

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.410 
install it all right we got the
supercharger<00:00:53.339> ready<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.609> come<00:00:53.789> off<00:00:55.219> in<00:00:56.420> where

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
supercharger ready to come off in where

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.789 
supercharger ready to come off in where
that<00:00:57.570> thing<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.350> won't<00:00:58.439> spray<00:00:58.649> another

00:00:58.789 --> 00:00:58.799 
that thing is it won't spray another

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:00.439 
that thing is it won't spray another
hundred<00:00:59.129> seventy-five<00:00:59.519> to<00:00:59.820> make<00:01:00.089> up<00:01:00.210> for<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
hundred seventy-five to make up for the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.750 
hundred seventy-five to make up for the
weight<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.869> thing<00:01:01.519> all<00:01:02.519> right<00:01:02.609> we're
