00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.550
 welcome to androidworld.it friends 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.930
 very quick test to show you what it is 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.300
 and how the link works dvr 730 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.529
 able the names a bit robotic that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.540
 seems to be in front of a 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.150
 little robot of Star Wars with 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.829
 similar is quite easy to understand in 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.259
 what I'm talking about 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.880
 is a portable router to watch the 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.489
 size of my hand on the box 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.200
 makes you understand already lost the dimensions 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.360
 we're talking about 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.600
 a router that practically works 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.870
 inserting a sim card inside it 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:46.010
 full sim not nano sim not micro sim 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.930
 therefore the old ones are now regular 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.450
 therefore compatible with the h spa network more 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.200
 nothing you have inserted from his 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:58.260
 internal and the router goes to create a network 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.910
 wireless 802 11 year old to connect to 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.010
 all your ideal devices 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.860
 precisely for the holidays or for a 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.799
 particularly long car journey 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.009
 there is not even a micro slot as a bonus 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.869
 sd in which precisely you can memorize 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.869
 your data and via the USB cable 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.810
 otg provided this which then precisely 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.789
 download them or load new ones 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.950
 on the micro sd just inserted 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.749
 within our role it is portable 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.079
 I'll show you the 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:30.600
 contents of the package that includes 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:34.240
 one of the very old was so much 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.040
 that I didn't see them mini manual cd 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.590
 adobe reader installation guide 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.649
 we can also do a little less for the 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.290
 moment maybe other manuals 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.189
 this time fortunately in version 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.350
 paper then below we really have 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.659
 very small if I can get it out 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.860
 from plastic 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.780
 the router with small front display 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.110
 power button key to connect 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:07.179
 automatic micro door devices 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:09.100
 usb here on this side we have the micro 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.709
 sd as I told you before 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.340
 you see I almost think I hope you read micro 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:18.519
 sd on the back we have password and ssd 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:23.170
 of the network that does inside as vi 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:25.600
 I said sim in full format plus 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:30.580
 under this point there is only the 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:35.950
 battery 2380 milian why go 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:38.829
 meanwhile immediately to insert close e 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.560
 turn it on and I'll show you below 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:45.910
 the classic micro usb usb cable is 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.769
 instead the one or tg I mentioned earlier 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.650
 we are all the various for a moment 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.750
 manuals and wait a moment for it 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:58.570
 start the link logo I would say it is 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:00.760
 quite self-explanatory welcome by now 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.739
 we should be there 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.829
 at this point I bring under the 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.920
 camcorder or po n 1 which as you see is 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:11.709
 no sim card 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.500
 obviously I also turned off the wifi in the 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.500
 meanwhile ok then right now is 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.700
 connected to the office wireless that 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.160
 by now you may have already learned 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.370
 from its characteristic name here in the 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.849
 meanwhile we see that the router is 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:33.800
 started is connected see h more with a 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:37.130
 good signal but also created just one 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:42.560
 new wireless network we force a moment 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:48.170
 scan and see if it finds it 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:52.930
 here it comes from out of reach or 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.930
 arrived croissants 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.540
 ok so connected at this point the 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.239
 Our device is connected to the network 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.440
 wireless generated by the router and we can 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:12.549
 quietly surf the internet 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.930
 we open a random article just not 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.120
 i'm not even sure that i actually 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.579
 took the click anyway I said that 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.919
 we can surf the internet using it 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.520
 precisely the connection set up 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.840
 from the router with our sim card 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.840
 typical usage scenario just like 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.810
 I was saying the holiday one is that of a 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:36.419
 trip we are still of her in the home 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.419
 that he was slowly loading it on me 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.810
 however, of course, the speed is 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.050
 clear that they become at the speed of 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.410
 connection of your card also 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.060
 sim 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.940
 in short from the goodness of the signal but 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.949
 however as you see if the signal is good 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.460
 then also the loading of articles 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:56.979
 long as our review does not 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.840
 they give great problems and soon 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.160
 and we loaded the same principle yes 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.440
 apply for any other type 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.539
 device devices is none other than 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.639
 precisely a router that is in the palm of 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.090
 a hand and for this our brief test 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.090
 it's all a nicola ii gas salute for 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.090
