 video sponsored by power planet 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.649
 online.com hello guys how are you 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.660
 welcome to a box min 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.509
 today I bring you the yes or my network mid 2 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.849
 first we go with the unboxing and 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.529
 we found the typical the terminal as 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.430
 It is logical instruction manual 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.350
 charger and usb cable to micro usb in 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.930
 the physical aspect we find a size 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.840
 successful 4.7 inches in the part 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.400
 right all the buttons both the 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.800
 volume control like the button on the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.230
 on lower part entrance 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.239
 microusb and in the top connection 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.149
 jack in the buttons section 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.670
 tactile not be called and we see it with 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.739
 that red color a little weird if we open 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.739
 the back cover we found the entrance to 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.820
 micro sd and dual sim plus the battery is 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.620
 of 2200 milliamps if we go to youtube 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.770
 in smart that gives us a score that 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.449
 gives us about 19 thousand points something that is 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.460
 really good for the price that it has 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.710
 the terminal and looking at 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.159
 technical specifications we found 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.930
 which has a 4.7 inch screen 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.930
 ips with a resolution 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:16.200
 of 1280 x 720p a cpu snapdragon 410 to 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.290
 1.2 gigahertz a gig of ram memory 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.770
 8 GB of internal memory and we can also 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.280
 put a micro sd card up to 64 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.479
 gigas 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.880
 We have dual sim 4.4 point 4 kitkat 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.270
 although it will surely be updated to 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.100
 android 5.0 lollipop in the future in the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.500
 section of the cameras the camera 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.619
 front of 2 megapixels and the back of 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.560
 8 megapixels with omnivision sensor and the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.659
 battery is 2200 milliamps 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.509
 now let's do a tour of the terminal 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.030
 the launcher of my wii reminds us a lot 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.680
 to the apple operating system if 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.420
 we click on the screen 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.119
 will open some options to edit the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.580
 desktop we can change the effects 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.649
 of sliding the screen too 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.720
 we can change the wallpaper and 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.729
 we can also add widgets and a 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.890
 very good option to be able to move all 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.440
 the terminal applications and leave it 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.840
 as we want, we can also 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.930
 add desks and best of all 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.640
 we can also remove desktops a 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.830
 option that we find is that of the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.080
 themes to be able to customize to the fullest 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.630
 our terminal for example I have 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.790
 chosen this we select apply and already 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.430
 we have our new theme installed in 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.980
 our launcher now we go to the section 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.500
 of the front camera camera with very 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.390
 good quality instant focus and with 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.700
 additions that complete even more this 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.470
 camera where we can select effects 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.290
 and select the settings that most 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.970
 we need the camera at every moment 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.010
 front has a wide angle and 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.780
 we found almost the same options as 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.970
 with the rear camera 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.520
 and now I leave you a few seconds so 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.520
 see and hear the terminal 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.080
 I am the key 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.520
 bye 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.520
 so much with whoever when 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.730
 and good guys, let's go with my opinion 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.070
 personal about this boy my truth my 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.040
 two and we're going to start by looking 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.900
 physical the physical aspect I think that 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.350
 personally he has a very very good 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.790
 finished we also have several several 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.670
 colors to choose the yellow rose 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.200
 green whatever we want the keypad is 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.570
 on the right side something that to me 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.220
 like although the buttons below 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.370
 Tactiles are not backlit 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.970
 some point against those who 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.000
 they are backlit that more the 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.040
 size the size seemed right 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.470
 picture plus 7 inches something that feels 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.600
 well in the hand is not too big and 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.000
 we can put a quad in almost 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.420
 any pocket that will not bother us 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.430
 in the camera section the camera 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.890
 back I think for the price that 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.330
 has this mobile the back has a 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.910
 very good quality of more we have those 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.920
 additions of the effects we can 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.140
 configure it as we want in addition the 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.009
 approach is very very fast the quality is 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.259
 Excellent 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.259
 on the front the front camera 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:49.629
 has a wide angle that will make 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:52.089
 we can make our ours to the fis 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:55.409
 with all our friends in the in the 

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:58.569
 camera so let's get out very handsome tubes 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:02.199
 besides part of the software of the 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:04.689
 launcher lancer me hui v5 a launcher 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:08.439
 very customizable we put you have already 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:12.490
 seen that we can choose an immensity 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:14.909
 of topics for this launcher in addition to 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:19.180
 all those who see us come from 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:21.069
 iphone terminals or to use ios ipad 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.199
 and others will be very comfortable the 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:26.469
 experience in these mobiles since the 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.490
 launcher looks a lot like them and 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:30.460
 also what I say that the 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.689
 customization is very good and the good 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.729
 is that we continue on android we can 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:35.529
 add launchers as a new launcher and 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.820
 Also, it is true that this 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:41.880
 launcher sins a little 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.820
 it weighs too much and sometimes when it has 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.020
 little battery the terminal can stay 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.150
 a little but nothing far from normal 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.550
 and in the part of the battery 2200 1000 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:57.420
 amps I think this mobile has a 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:06:00.060
 battery, I think I 'm fairly fair, I'm not 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.410
 a very active user on the mobile 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.310
 normally I am always between 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:08.070
 computer but I guess if you're a 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.210
 user that uses a lot the mobile is going 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.780
 to last until the end 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.120
 of the day without problem but that yes eye 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.570
 Beware that the battery is not the best 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.270
 of the world and apart one of the very things 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.890
 good in the section of chayo me is that 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.010
 here in Spain at least we have a 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.560
 back community as is my wii 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:31.800
 point is an excellent forum where we have 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:35.610
 tutorials guides rooms and others for 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:38.220
 power to be able to put our wyoming 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.920
 a day without having any problems and power 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:43.230
 ask all the doubts that arise 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.590
 something that is a very favorable point in this 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:49.860
 section of the Spanish community 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.850
 and well where can we buy this me 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.430
 I will go 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:57.110
 we can buy it two first in power 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:07:02.100
 planet dotcom by planet online.com 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:04.440
 for a price of 170 euros a price 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.850
 quite affordable but if we do not like it 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.060
 buy in this store for example 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:11.940
 we can buy it in Amazon that costs 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.500
 135 euros with free shipping costs 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.300
 really recommended to buy from a 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.310
 amazon basically because it is more 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.660
 cheap and so on but if you do not notice 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.570
 amazon you can buy a planet power 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.890
 online.com you already know all the information 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.320
 until down in the box 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.300
