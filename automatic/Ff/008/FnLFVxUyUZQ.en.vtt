00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
kind of an R so let's just make a big

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.479 
kind of an R so let's just make a big
droopy<00:00:30.199> piece<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.650> there<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.309> we'll

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
droopy piece to that there and we'll

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.500 
droopy piece to that there and we'll
come<00:00:32.669> around<00:00:32.940> here<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:35.329> kind<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.480> some

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
come around here and kind of do some

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.780 
come around here and kind of do some
cool<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.800> M<00:00:37.920> like<00:00:38.219> that

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
cool of the a with the M like that

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.639 
cool of the a with the M like that
the<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:42.079> just<00:00:43.079> use<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.500> as<00:00:43.590> an<00:00:43.680> outline<00:00:44.129> to

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
the a just use that as an outline to

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:53.330 
the a just use that as an outline to
draw<00:00:47.750> our<00:00:48.750> flowing<00:00:49.350> shape<00:00:51.860> and<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.010> lets<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
draw our flowing shape and that lets a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.430 
draw our flowing shape and that lets a
tear<00:00:53.610> drop<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.940> little<00:00:54.239> more<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> think<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.320> I

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
tear drop a little more I think and I

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.990 
tear drop a little more I think and I
can<00:00:55.620> fit<00:00:55.890> right<00:00:56.280> into<00:00:56.610> there<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:58.850> develop<00:00:59.850> this

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
can fit right into there I develop this

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.070 
can fit right into there I develop this
as<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.329> go<00:01:01.730> off<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.760> there<00:01:04.070> bulb<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.369> there<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
as we go off on there bulb on there and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.660 
as we go off on there bulb on there and
this<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> big<00:01:08.100> group<00:01:08.310> right<00:01:08.939> there

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
this can be a big group right there

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.370 
this can be a big group right there
alright<00:01:11.670> now<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.780> course<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.110> going<00:01:13.290> to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
alright now that of course is going to

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.770 
alright now that of course is going to
be<00:01:13.729> pretty<00:01:14.729> easy<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.090> work<00:01:15.240> with<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:15.630> we're

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
be pretty easy to work with but we're

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.270 
be pretty easy to work with but we're
gonna<00:01:15.869> let<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:18.080> droop<00:01:19.080> down<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.979> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
gonna let this droop down like that and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.130 
gonna let this droop down like that and
we'll<00:01:20.400> work<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.820> other<00:01:21.689> letters<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.380> match

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.410 

just<00:01:28.140> keep<00:01:28.320> reworking<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.430> letters<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.240> much

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420

on<00:07:34.420> this<00:07:34.540> design<00:07:34.960> because<00:07:35.640> letters<00:07:36.640> are

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:36.790 
on this design because letters are

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.830
