00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
all the wires already ran through this

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.400 
all the wires already ran through this
head<00:06:05.900> unit<00:06:06.400> came<00:06:07.400> with<00:06:07.550> a<00:06:07.580> USB<00:06:08.120> adapter<00:06:08.380> it's<00:06:09.380> a

head unit came with a USB adapter it's a
pretty<00:06:09.560> long<00:06:09.740> cable<00:06:10.160> it's<00:06:10.250> like<00:06:10.340> a<00:06:10.720> six<00:06:11.720> foot

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
pretty long cable it's like a six foot

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.420 
pretty long cable it's like a six foot
cable<00:06:12.080> I<00:06:12.260> believe<00:06:12.500> a<00:06:12.650> foot<00:06:12.920> cable<00:06:13.100> and

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
cable I believe a foot cable and

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.660 
cable I believe a foot cable and
actually<00:06:13.940> ran<00:06:14.150> that<00:06:14.360> through<00:06:15.610> the<00:06:16.610> dash<00:06:17.560> and<00:06:18.670> I

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670 
actually ran that through the dash and I

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.170 
actually ran that through the dash and I
have<00:06:20.330> it<00:06:20.480> coming<00:06:20.930> out<00:06:21.080> of<00:06:21.380> where<00:06:22.190> the<00:06:22.400> the<00:06:23.000> cup

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
have it coming out of where the the cup

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.880 
have it coming out of where the the cup
holder<00:06:23.480> is<00:06:23.630> and<00:06:24.380> that<00:06:24.470> little<00:06:24.710> pocket

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
holder is and that little pocket

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.610 
holder is and that little pocket
underneath<00:06:25.220> there<00:06:25.660> took<00:06:26.660> a<00:06:26.720> lotta<00:06:26.960> figure<00:06:27.440> out

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
underneath there took a lotta figure out

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:35.440 
underneath there took a lotta figure out
how<00:06:27.830> to<00:06:27.890> do<00:06:28.040> that<00:06:28.190> but<00:06:28.400> I<00:06:30.370> did<00:06:31.370> it<00:06:31.400> so<00:06:34.240> so<00:06:35.240> right

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450 
how to do that but I did it so so right

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.240 
how to do that but I did it so so right
now<00:06:35.600> like<00:06:36.020> I<00:06:36.110> said<00:06:36.320> what<00:06:36.770> I'm<00:06:36.830> having<00:06:36.950> a<00:06:37.100> hard

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
now like I said what I'm having a hard

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.250 
now like I said what I'm having a hard
time<00:06:37.310> is<00:06:37.550> figuring<00:06:37.970> out<00:06:38.030> where<00:06:38.240> the<00:06:38.480> satellite

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260 
time is figuring out where the satellite

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.530 
time is figuring out where the satellite
stuff<00:06:39.440> goes<00:06:39.650> all<00:06:40.550> the<00:06:40.730> satellite<00:06:41.060> components

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
stuff goes all the satellite components

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.370 
stuff goes all the satellite components
but<00:06:41.770> so<00:06:42.770> that's<00:06:42.950> it<00:06:43.160> so<00:06:43.880> then<00:06:44.140> when<00:06:45.140> you<00:06:45.200> want

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
but so that's it so then when you want

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.870 
but so that's it so then when you want
to<00:06:45.410> put<00:06:45.560> this<00:06:45.680> back<00:06:45.860> in<00:06:48.250> do<00:06:49.250> not<00:06:49.430> forget

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
to put this back in do not forget

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.700 
to put this back in do not forget
because<00:06:50.720> I<00:06:50.930> did<00:06:51.110> a<00:06:51.140> couple<00:06:51.290> times<00:06:51.590> already

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
because I did a couple times already

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.220 
because I did a couple times already

obviously your head unit needs to be

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.990 
obviously your head unit needs to be
plugged<00:07:07.070> in<00:07:07.270> in<00:07:08.270> the<00:07:08.360> bottom<00:07:09.490> there'll<00:07:10.490> be<00:07:10.520> one

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000
