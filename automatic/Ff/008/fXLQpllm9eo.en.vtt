with<00:00:47.250> our<00:00:47.370> with<00:00:47.789> Liverpool<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.230> it's

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
with our with Liverpool and I think it's

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.720 
with our with Liverpool and I think it's
definitely<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.890> don't<00:00:50.070> know<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> must-win

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
definitely I don't know this a must-win

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.420 
definitely I don't know this a must-win
game<00:00:51.149> for<00:00:51.690> either<00:00:51.930> team<00:00:52.350> but<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:53.010> think<00:00:53.280> it's

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
game for either team but I think it's

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.000 
game for either team but I think it's
definitely<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.910> momentum<00:00:54.750> builder<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:55.469> chassis

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
definitely a momentum builder if chassis

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.490 
definitely a momentum builder if chassis

always find a way to pick up points and
win<00:01:52.140> matches<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> fact<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.189> Chelsea<00:01:53.820> are

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
win matches so the fact that Chelsea are

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.910

doing<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.360> at<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.990> moment<00:01:55.049> I'm<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:55.649> much<00:01:55.799> as

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
doing that at this moment I'm as much as

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.959 
doing that at this moment I'm as much as
it's<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.100> bad<00:01:56.280> thing<00:01:56.490> because<00:01:56.640> we're

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
it's a bad thing because we're

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.580 
it's a bad thing because we're
struggling<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.840> fact<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.110> were<00:01:58.229> only<00:01:58.380> two

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
struggling the fact that were only two

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.440 
struggling the fact that were only two
points<00:01:58.799> behind<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.250> leaders<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.880> just<00:02:00.210> shows

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
points behind the leaders it just shows

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.510 
points behind the leaders it just shows
that<00:02:00.500> you<00:02:01.500> know<00:02:01.619> we're<00:02:02.009> picking<00:02:02.250> up<00:02:02.310> points

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
that you know we're picking up points

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.580

with Juan Mata Fernando Torres and aspen

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.059 
with Juan Mata Fernando Torres and aspen
equator<00:02:07.140> where<00:02:07.380> they<00:02:07.469> basically<00:02:07.619> said<00:02:08.009> I

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
equator where they basically said I

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.229 
equator where they basically said I
don't<00:02:08.129> they<00:02:08.310> don't<00:02:08.429> think<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.789> must<00:02:09.030> win

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
don't they don't think it's a must win

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.660 
don't they don't think it's a must win
but<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.629> big<00:02:09.899> game<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:11.039> think<00:02:11.520> it's

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
but it is a big game and I think it's

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.850 
but it is a big game and I think it's
everything<00:02:12.270> but<00:02:12.690> that's<00:02:13.170> way<00:02:13.290> they<00:02:13.440> think

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
everything but that's way they think

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.770 
everything but that's way they think
is<00:02:14.070> everything<00:02:14.610> but<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.910> must-win<00:02:15.390> game<00:02:15.600> them

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
is everything but a must-win game them

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.270 
is everything but a must-win game them
because<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.800> know<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.920> think<00:02:17.010> it's<00:02:17.190> definitely

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
because you know I think it's definitely

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.650 
because you know I think it's definitely
again<00:02:17.760> like<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.000> said<00:02:18.030> before<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.510> make<00:02:18.600> a

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
again like I said before to make a

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.540 
again like I said before to make a
statement<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.380> put<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.770> know<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.070> show<00:02:20.370> that

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
statement to put you know to a show that

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.070 
statement to put you know to a show that
we<00:02:20.640> are<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:21.060> this<00:02:21.210> total<00:02:21.570> race<00:02:21.720> because<00:02:22.050> I

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
we are in this total race because I

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.930 
we are in this total race because I
think<00:02:22.230> up<00:02:22.470> until<00:02:22.620> now<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.010> think<00:02:23.370> we've<00:02:23.520> been<00:02:23.700> so

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
think up until now I think we've been so

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.240 
think up until now I think we've been so
far<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.540> consistent<00:02:25.290> now<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:26.010> know<00:02:26.100> I<00:02:26.130> don't

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
far and consistent now you know I don't

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.890 
far and consistent now you know I don't
think<00:02:26.550> any<00:02:26.760> champion<00:02:27.210> could<00:02:27.360> beat<00:02:27.480> up<00:02:27.630> but<00:02:27.780> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
think any champion could beat up but the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.270 
think any champion could beat up but the
only<00:02:27.990> problem<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.680> season<00:02:29.070> so

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
only problem is that this season so

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.160 
only problem is that this season so
shocking<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:29.880> so<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.450> know<00:02:30.480> ass-backwards

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
shocking and so you know ass-backwards

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.770 
shocking and so you know ass-backwards
that<00:02:31.770> everybody<00:02:32.370> seems<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.540> know<00:02:33.660> be

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
that everybody seems to a you know be

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.210 
that everybody seems to a you know be
dropping<00:02:34.170> points<00:02:34.500> in<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.770> don't<00:02:35.010> really<00:02:35.100> think

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
dropping points in I don't really think

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.250 
dropping points in I don't really think
there's<00:02:35.340> any<00:02:35.720> consistent<00:02:36.720> teams<00:02:36.930> ate<00:02:37.110> there

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
there's any consistent teams ate there

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.930 
there's any consistent teams ate there
apart<00:02:37.500> from<00:02:37.530> probably<00:02:37.860> Arsenal<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.760> top

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
apart from probably Arsenal and the top

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.140 
apart from probably Arsenal and the top
of<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.150> table<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:40.350> um<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:41.700> know<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> big

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
of the table so um you know it's a big

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.030 
of the table so um you know it's a big
game<00:02:42.330> Liverpool<00:02:42.900> now<00:02:43.080> obviously<00:02:43.680> with<00:02:43.800> Luis

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
game Liverpool now obviously with Luis

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.280 
game Liverpool now obviously with Luis
Suarez<00:02:44.520> signed<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:44.940> new<00:02:45.060> contract<00:02:45.540> obviously

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
Suarez signed a new contract obviously

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.020 
Suarez signed a new contract obviously
they're<00:02:46.709> going<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.890> be<00:02:46.980> uh<00:02:47.010> pushing<00:02:47.370> for<00:02:47.940> the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
they're going to be uh pushing for the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.310 
they're going to be uh pushing for the
end<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.270> title<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:48.630> i<00:02:48.660> think<00:02:48.780> both<00:02:49.290> teams

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
end of the title so i think both teams

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.630 
end of the title so i think both teams
really<00:02:49.770> shouldn't<00:02:50.100> need<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.220> win<00:02:50.430> this<00:02:50.550> game

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
really shouldn't need to win this game

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.440 
really shouldn't need to win this game
so<00:02:50.970> what<00:02:51.150> do<00:02:51.270> I<00:02:51.330> really<00:02:51.360> want<00:02:51.810> chassis<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.380> do

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
so what do I really want chassis to do

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.210

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
them and I were just really think that

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.620

more<00:03:45.630> than<00:03:45.750> likely<00:03:45.900> war<00:03:46.170> start<00:03:46.530> but<00:03:47.310> for<00:03:47.489> me<00:03:47.580> I

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
more than likely war start but for me I

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.360 
more than likely war start but for me I
would<00:03:47.970> probably<00:03:48.180> like<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.840> be<00:03:49.190> Willie<00:03:50.190> an

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370

with Gary Cahill and John Terry just

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.940 
with Gary Cahill and John Terry just
because<00:04:00.989> you<00:04:01.080> need<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.230> be<00:04:01.380> as<00:04:01.560> solid<00:04:01.739> as

possible at the back the right back is
going<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.100> be<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.220> van<00:04:05.519> of<00:04:05.549> itch<00:04:05.790> but<00:04:05.970> for<00:04:06.120> me<00:04:06.209> I

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
going to be a van of itch but for me I

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.000 
going to be a van of itch but for me I
would<00:04:06.600> still<00:04:06.780> play<00:04:06.930> Aspen<00:04:07.380> equator<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.860> right

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
would still play Aspen equator it right

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.949 
would still play Aspen equator it right
back<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.489> actually<00:04:09.000> call<00:04:09.299> it<00:04:09.330> that<00:04:09.570> fact<00:04:09.810> but

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
back and actually call it that fact but

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.440 
back and actually call it that fact but
hosing<00:04:10.320> arenal<00:04:10.650> decides<00:04:11.310> that<00:04:11.489> uh<00:04:11.549> as<00:04:12.090> pill

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
hosing arenal decides that uh as pill

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.759 
hosing arenal decides that uh as pill
equator<00:04:12.720> is<00:04:12.840> going<00:04:12.989> to<00:04:13.049> be<00:04:13.140> playing<00:04:13.290> left<00:04:13.590> back

equator is going to be playing left back

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.229 
equator is going to be playing left back
and<00:04:13.920> I<00:04:13.950> think<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.220> he<00:04:14.310> has<00:04:14.489> been<00:04:14.760> very<00:04:15.060> good

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
and I think that he has been very good

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.300 
and I think that he has been very good
there<00:04:15.480> but<00:04:15.660> in<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.500> gaming<00:04:16.650> at<00:04:16.799> Sunderland<00:04:17.220> II

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
there but in the gaming at Sunderland II

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.130 
there but in the gaming at Sunderland II
they<00:04:17.820> were<00:04:17.880> talking<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.450> cut<00:04:18.810> you<00:04:19.019> know

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
they were talking a cut you know

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.420 
they were talking a cut you know
targeting<00:04:19.620> us<00:04:19.739> stay<00:04:19.890> in<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.040> left<00:04:20.220> hand<00:04:20.340> side

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
targeting us stay in the left hand side

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.210 
targeting us stay in the left hand side
so<00:04:20.790> I<00:04:21.140> mean<00:04:22.140> our<00:04:22.320> left<00:04:22.500> hand<00:04:22.650> side<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.010> we<00:04:23.099> need

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
so I mean our left hand side so we need

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.589 
so I mean our left hand side so we need
to<00:04:23.310> make<00:04:23.430> sure<00:04:23.490> that<00:04:23.640> that<00:04:24.210> doesn't<00:04:24.270> happen

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
to make sure that that doesn't happen

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.260 
to make sure that that doesn't happen
because<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.349> know<00:04:25.440> Ramsey<00:04:25.950> you<00:04:26.490> know<00:04:26.610> oziel

take our opportunities now what could

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.530 
take our opportunities now what could
happen<00:04:40.949> you<00:04:41.400> never<00:04:41.610> know<00:04:41.729> all<00:04:42.090> these

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
happen you never know all these

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.420 
happen you never know all these
opportunities<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:43.650> we've<00:04:43.740> had<00:04:43.830> maybe<00:04:44.070> it's

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
opportunities that we've had maybe it's

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.250 
opportunities that we've had maybe it's
all<00:04:44.580> coming<00:04:45.000> at<00:04:45.150> once<00:04:45.210> and<00:04:45.600> we<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:46.110> know<00:04:46.169> we

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
all coming at once and we you know we

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.770 
all coming at once and we you know we
score<00:04:46.530> a<00:04:46.560> lot<00:04:46.680> of<00:04:46.740> goals<00:04:46.949> but<00:04:47.280> I<00:04:47.729> think<00:04:48.690> it's

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
score a lot of goals but I think it's

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.689 
score a lot of goals but I think it's
going<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:48.930> be<00:04:49.020> very<00:04:49.080> very<00:04:49.320> open<00:04:49.919> I<00:04:50.070> think<00:04:50.610> it's

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
going to be very very open I think it's

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.070 
going to be very very open I think it's
going<00:04:50.790> to<00:04:50.850> be<00:04:50.940> very<00:04:51.000> much<00:04:51.360> similar<00:04:51.600> to<00:04:51.780> the

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
going to be very much similar to the

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.320 
going to be very much similar to the
game<00:04:52.260> Manchester<00:04:53.220> sit<00:04:53.370> at<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:53.699> etihad

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
game Manchester sit at the etihad

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.670 
game Manchester sit at the etihad
stadium<00:04:54.360> between<00:04:54.900> Arsenal<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:55.620> Manchester

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
stadium between Arsenal and Manchester

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.920 
stadium between Arsenal and Manchester
City<00:04:56.220> I<00:04:56.460> think<00:04:56.940> it's<00:04:57.030> going<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.180> be<00:04:57.240> well<00:04:57.479> but<00:04:57.840> I

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
City I think it's going to be well but I

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.060 
City I think it's going to be well but I
think<00:04:57.960> it's<00:04:58.139> going<00:04:58.199> to<00:04:58.290> be<00:04:58.350> who<00:04:58.500> basically<00:04:58.830> who

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
think it's going to be who basically who

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.210 
think it's going to be who basically who
takes<00:04:59.340> their<00:04:59.490> opportunities<00:05:00.120> um<00:05:01.100> you<00:05:02.100> know

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
takes their opportunities um you know

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.860 
takes their opportunities um you know
the<00:05:02.400> two<00:05:02.580> second<00:05:02.910> defensive<00:05:03.210> midfielders<00:05:03.690> for

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
the two second defensive midfielders for

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.740 
the two second defensive midfielders for
me<00:05:03.960> I<00:05:04.110> would<00:05:04.889> go<00:05:05.040> in<00:05:05.190> with<00:05:05.340> make<00:05:06.240> out<00:05:06.450> and

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
me I would go in with make out and

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.800 
me I would go in with make out and
Ramirez<00:05:07.260> but<00:05:08.160> we<00:05:09.000> have<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.300> wait<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:09.540> see<00:05:09.600> but

I<00:05:09.870> would<00:05:10.139> try<00:05:10.380> to<00:05:10.410> make<00:05:10.740> it<00:05:10.770> as<00:05:10.950> defensive<00:05:11.370> as

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
I would try to make it as defensive as

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.650 
I would try to make it as defensive as
possible<00:05:11.850> because<00:05:11.970> we<00:05:12.150> are<00:05:12.270> away<00:05:12.450> from<00:05:12.510> home

possible because we are away from home

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.240 
possible because we are away from home
