going through the hunters for example of

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.690 
going through the hunters for example of
you've<00:00:29.470> recently<00:00:29.740> dish<00:00:30.130> Marty<00:00:30.460> you're<00:00:30.550> going

you've recently dish Marty you're going

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.459 
you've recently dish Marty you're going
back<00:00:30.850> to<00:00:30.880> focus<00:00:31.390> that's<00:00:31.960> one<00:00:32.140> of<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.289> big<00:00:32.439> ones

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
back to focus that's one of the big ones

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:33.840 
back to focus that's one of the big ones
that<00:00:32.770> I've<00:00:32.860> noticed<00:00:33.039> why<00:00:33.340> have<00:00:33.489> you<00:00:33.579> made<00:00:33.610> that

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
that I've noticed why have you made that

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.090 
that I've noticed why have you made that
chance<00:00:34.120> sure<00:00:34.360> well<00:00:35.020> we<00:00:35.350> really<00:00:35.469> felt<00:00:35.739> like<00:00:35.829> the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
chance sure well we really felt like the

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.920 
chance sure well we really felt like the
mana<00:00:36.399> gameplay<00:00:37.000> wasn't<00:00:37.360> working<00:00:37.600> out<00:00:37.690> for<00:00:37.870> the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
mana gameplay wasn't working out for the

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.059 
mana gameplay wasn't working out for the
hunter<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.410> way<00:00:38.530> that<00:00:38.680> we'd<00:00:38.800> hoped

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:39.069 
hunter the way that we'd hoped

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:40.500 
hunter the way that we'd hoped
originally<00:00:39.850> back<00:00:40.059> when<00:00:40.239> we<00:00:40.329> made<00:00:40.480> that

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
originally back when we made that

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.799 
originally back when we made that
decision<00:00:40.929> seven<00:00:41.499> years<00:00:41.530> ago<00:00:41.739> or<00:00:42.039> so<00:00:42.539> we<00:00:43.539> felt

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
decision seven years ago or so we felt

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.349 
decision seven years ago or so we felt
like<00:00:43.899> hunters<00:00:44.739> would<00:00:45.190> benefit<00:00:45.609> more<00:00:45.819> from<00:00:45.879> the

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
like hunters would benefit more from the

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:48.719 
like hunters would benefit more from the
resource<00:00:46.899> that<00:00:47.140> comes<00:00:47.350> back<00:00:47.589> more<00:00:47.829> quickly<00:00:48.100> so

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:48.729 
resource that comes back more quickly so

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:50.250 
resource that comes back more quickly so
that<00:00:48.760> they<00:00:48.969> can<00:00:49.120> manage<00:00:49.420> a<00:00:49.539> resource<00:00:49.929> a<00:00:50.050> little

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
that they can manage a resource a little

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.590 
that they can manage a resource a little
bit<00:00:50.350> more<00:00:50.469> tightly<00:00:50.850> generally<00:00:51.850> speaking<00:00:51.999> the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
bit more tightly generally speaking the

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.119 
bit more tightly generally speaking the
dynamics<00:00:53.139> of<00:00:53.199> the<00:00:53.319> mana<00:00:53.499> bar<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.949> way<00:00:54.039> it

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
dynamics of the mana bar the way it

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:55.739 
dynamics of the mana bar the way it
works<00:00:54.280> is<00:00:54.489> you<00:00:54.519> know<00:00:54.909> you<00:00:55.030> start<00:00:55.269> with<00:00:55.359> a<00:00:55.420> full

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:55.749 
works is you know you start with a full

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:57.299 
works is you know you start with a full
bar<00:00:56.019> and<00:00:56.319> then<00:00:56.409> you<00:00:56.499> just<00:00:56.679> kind<00:00:56.800> of<00:00:56.889> work<00:00:57.039> away

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
bar and then you just kind of work away

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.399 
bar and then you just kind of work away
plow<00:00:58.149> your<00:00:58.299> way<00:00:58.420> through<00:00:58.629> it<00:00:58.780> ignoring<00:00:59.319> it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
plow your way through it ignoring it

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.349 
plow your way through it ignoring it
entirely<00:00:59.739> until<00:01:00.100> it's<00:01:00.219> all<00:01:00.280> gone<00:01:00.489> and<00:01:00.909> then

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
entirely until it's all gone and then

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.509 
entirely until it's all gone and then
because<00:01:02.199> it<00:01:02.289> comes<00:01:02.440> back<00:01:02.620> very<00:01:02.649> slowly<00:01:02.979> or

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
because it comes back very slowly or

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:04.860 
because it comes back very slowly or
like<00:01:03.940> trying<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.269> figure<00:01:04.449> out<00:01:04.540> what<00:01:04.659> to<00:01:04.690> do

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
like trying to figure out what to do

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.740 
like trying to figure out what to do
about<00:01:04.989> it<00:01:05.229> at<00:01:05.320> that<00:01:05.379> point<00:01:05.500> so<00:01:06.220> it<00:01:07.150> seemed<00:01:07.570> like

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
about it at that point so it seemed like

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.810 
about it at that point so it seemed like
a<00:01:07.780> natural<00:01:08.290> class<00:01:08.740> because<00:01:09.159> it's<00:01:09.340> not<00:01:09.549> as

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
a natural class because it's not as

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.600 
a natural class because it's not as
magic<00:01:10.570> oriented<00:01:11.320> of<00:01:11.469> a<00:01:11.530> class<00:01:11.770> to<00:01:12.280> base<00:01:12.460> it

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
magic oriented of a class to base it

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.340 
magic oriented of a class to base it
around<00:01:12.670> mana<00:01:13.030> seemed<00:01:13.479> like<00:01:13.509> a<00:01:13.659> good<00:01:13.750> candidate

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
around mana seemed like a good candidate

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.190 
around mana seemed like a good candidate
to<00:01:14.409> do<00:01:14.680> something<00:01:15.009> fresh<00:01:15.579> and<00:01:15.610> different<00:01:15.880> but

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
to do something fresh and different but

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.609 
to do something fresh and different but
why<00:01:17.200> not<00:01:17.380> energy<00:01:18.090> well<00:01:19.090> we<00:01:19.479> really<00:01:20.140> in<00:01:20.530> a<00:01:20.590> lot

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
why not energy well we really in a lot

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.590 
why not energy well we really in a lot
of<00:01:20.740> ways<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.039> focus<00:01:21.369> is<00:01:21.579> a<00:01:21.610> lot<00:01:22.000> like<00:01:22.210> energy

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
of ways the focus is a lot like energy

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.749 
of ways the focus is a lot like energy
it's<00:01:22.810> really<00:01:23.079> an<00:01:23.289> energy<00:01:23.979> bar<00:01:24.159> that

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
it's really an energy bar that

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.999 
it's really an energy bar that
recuperates<00:01:25.509> on<00:01:25.780> its<00:01:26.109> own<00:01:26.259> a<00:01:26.289> little<00:01:26.740> bit<00:01:26.859> more

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
recuperates on its own a little bit more

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.980 
recuperates on its own a little bit more
slowly<00:01:27.250> than<00:01:27.430> energy<00:01:27.759> but<00:01:28.539> then<00:01:28.719> by<00:01:28.960> using

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
slowly than energy but then by using

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.920 
slowly than energy but then by using
steady<00:01:29.710> shot<00:01:30.009> it<00:01:30.369> comes<00:01:30.850> back<00:01:31.060> at<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.719> rate<00:01:31.899> a

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
steady shot it comes back at a rate a

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.209 
steady shot it comes back at a rate a
little<00:01:32.200> bit<00:01:32.380> more<00:01:32.500> quickly<00:01:32.740> so<00:01:32.979> you<00:01:33.039> have<00:01:33.189> a

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
little bit more quickly so you have a

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.880 
little bit more quickly so you have a
slightly<00:01:33.909> I<00:01:34.359> guess<00:01:34.719> a<00:01:34.990> little<00:01:35.229> bit<00:01:35.409> more<00:01:35.530> spiky

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
slightly I guess a little bit more spiky

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.310 
slightly I guess a little bit more spiky
energy<00:01:36.429> regeneration<00:01:36.670> curve<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:38.109> only

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
energy regeneration curve the only

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.810 
energy regeneration curve the only
reason<00:01:38.439> we<00:01:38.649> did<00:01:38.799> make<00:01:38.979> it<00:01:39.009> energy<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.520> because

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
reason we did make it energy is because

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.370 
reason we did make it energy is because
it<00:01:39.939> behaves<00:01:40.240> a<00:01:40.329> little<00:01:40.630> bit<00:01:40.719> differently<00:01:41.079> with

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
it behaves a little bit differently with

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.260 
it behaves a little bit differently with
the<00:01:41.530> interaction<00:01:42.070> with<00:01:42.219> steady<00:01:42.460> shot<00:01:42.729> we

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
the interaction with steady shot we

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.490 
the interaction with steady shot we
didn't<00:01:43.450> want<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:43.630> confuse<00:01:43.780> people<00:01:44.320> into

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
didn't want to confuse people into

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
much we we go through a little bit of

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.520 
much we we go through a little bit of
change<00:01:59.950> in<00:02:00.100> terms<00:02:00.310> of<00:02:00.490> trying<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.820> refine<00:02:01.149> our

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
stat system and in this case we provide

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.499 
stat system and in this case we provide
the<00:02:05.740> stat<00:02:05.950> system<00:02:06.399> by<00:02:06.579> eliminating<00:02:07.179> some<00:02:07.479> of

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
the stat system by eliminating some of

the stat system by eliminating some of
the<00:02:07.630> ones<00:02:07.810> that

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
the ones that

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.580 
the ones that
that<00:02:08.580> didn't<00:02:09.269> really<00:02:09.390> work<00:02:09.750> out<00:02:10.170> as<00:02:10.349> well<00:02:10.470> as

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
that didn't really work out as well as

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.890 
that didn't really work out as well as
we'd<00:02:10.769> hoped<00:02:11.150> adding<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.180> master<00:02:12.599> East<00:02:12.720> at

we'd hoped adding the master East at
which<00:02:13.230> we<00:02:13.890> hope<00:02:14.129> will<00:02:14.159> work<00:02:14.549> out<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:15.030> well<00:02:15.239> as

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
which we hope will work out as well as

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.130 
which we hope will work out as well as
we<00:02:15.510> hope<00:02:16.250> only<00:02:17.250> time<00:02:17.400> will<00:02:17.459> tell<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.750> then

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
we hope only time will tell and then

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.830 
we hope only time will tell and then
also<00:02:19.950> by<00:02:20.400> just<00:02:20.790> trying<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.120> streamline<00:02:21.420> some

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
also by just trying to streamline some

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.000 
also by just trying to streamline some
of<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:21.989> other<00:02:22.110> parts<00:02:22.379> of<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.500> game<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.890> go

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
of the other parts of the game to go

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.910 
of the other parts of the game to go
along<00:02:23.220> with<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:24.360> in<00:02:24.480> this<00:02:24.569> case<00:02:24.780> we

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
along with it and in this case we

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.530 
along with it and in this case we
converted<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.190> intellect<00:02:26.730> stat<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.299> pay<00:02:27.510> a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
converted the intellect stat to pay a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.539 
converted the intellect stat to pay a
lot<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.019> way<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.530> spell<00:02:28.890> power<00:02:29.069> did<00:02:29.370> in

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
lot of the way that spell power did in

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.670 
lot of the way that spell power did in
past<00:02:29.870> part<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:30.989> thinking<00:02:31.170> behind<00:02:31.379> that

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
past part of the thinking behind that

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.270 
past part of the thinking behind that
was<00:02:32.159> that<00:02:32.549> it<00:02:33.060> was<00:02:33.180> strange<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.720> us<00:02:33.750> that

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
was that it was strange to us that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.289 
was that it was strange to us that
intellect<00:02:35.280> was<00:02:35.430> one<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.700> your<00:02:35.819> primary

intellect was one of your primary

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.559 
intellect was one of your primary

sheet<00:02:39.840> for<00:02:40.019> your<00:02:40.110> character<00:02:40.379> but<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.069> really

sheet for your character but it really

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.190

the<00:02:43.349> casters<00:02:43.829> didn't<00:02:44.579> have<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:45.209> primary<00:02:45.629> stat

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
the casters didn't have a primary stat

the casters didn't have a primary stat
that<00:02:46.579> really<00:02:47.579> felt<00:02:47.790> like<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.150> was<00:02:48.239> very

decisions with my reconsider but for now
that<00:04:11.020> that<00:04:11.560> model<00:04:11.710> doesn't<00:04:11.980> make<00:04:12.190> sense<00:04:12.340> for

us now the game is over five years old
it<00:04:15.970> recently<00:04:16.510> celebrated<00:04:16.720> its<00:04:17.020> birthday<00:04:17.530> I'm

it recently celebrated its birthday I'm
guessing<00:04:18.459> you're<00:04:18.580> hoping<00:04:18.820> that's<00:04:19.060> going<00:04:19.180> to

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
guessing you're hoping that's going to

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.360 
guessing you're hoping that's going to
be<00:04:19.330> around<00:04:19.510> at<00:04:19.690> least<00:04:19.870> another<00:04:20.110> five<00:04:20.410> how<00:04:21.100> can

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
be around at least another five how can

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.740 
be around at least another five how can
we<00:04:21.459> expect<00:04:21.700> the<00:04:21.850> game<00:04:21.970> to<00:04:22.030> evolve<00:04:22.450> over<00:04:22.600> the

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
we expect the game to evolve over the

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.800 
we expect the game to evolve over the
next<00:04:23.080> couple<00:04:23.290> of<00:04:23.410> years<00:04:23.550> um<00:04:24.550> I<00:04:25.180> think<00:04:25.420> that

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
next couple of years um I think that

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.470 
next couple of years um I think that
we'll<00:04:25.990> see<00:04:26.620> continued<00:04:27.340> refinement<00:04:28.030> of<00:04:28.180> the

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
we'll see continued refinement of the

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.870 
we'll see continued refinement of the
game's<00:04:28.840> mechanics<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:29.830> then<00:04:30.040> also<00:04:30.250> will<00:04:30.700> try

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
game's mechanics and then also will try

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.000 
game's mechanics and then also will try
to<00:04:30.940> hone<00:04:31.210> in<00:04:31.390> more<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:31.780> more<00:04:31.870> over<00:04:32.290> time<00:04:32.440> on

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
to hone in more and more over time on

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.180 
to hone in more and more over time on
what<00:04:33.880> activities<00:04:34.480> players<00:04:34.990> really<00:04:35.410> enjoy<00:04:35.860> at

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
that so it you know it's hard to say I

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.620 
that so it you know it's hard to say I
think<00:04:57.250> that<00:04:57.400> you<00:04:57.670> know<00:04:57.760> two<00:04:58.000> expansions<00:04:58.540> for

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
think that you know two expansions for

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.210 
think that you know two expansions for
now<00:04:58.870> or<00:04:59.170> something<00:04:59.350> like<00:04:59.560> that<00:04:59.620> we<00:05:00.010> may<00:05:00.190> have
