00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.190
 because I want the legs to sharpen 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.660

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.230

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.430
 rubles and 180 rubles transfer that is 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.490
 all I gave for them is three hundred 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.280
 seventy plus 180 is in my opinion 550 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.070
 rubles if I am not mistaken in general friends 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.200
 mine I now went here looked at 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.930
 itself in the laptop well, that's climbed to the site 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.390
 ebay and copied here what is written here 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.170
 Well, how to say something well in the description of the goods 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.180
 In short, well, the name to give chips and 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.430
 copied to the translator and he gave me 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.420
 that this taste is shorter, I'll tell you now 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.110
 why don't you just be scared by this taste 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.119
 frog legs with garlic butter 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.370
 some nafig frog legs 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.400
 cycle to garlic butter pancake i if 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.830
 honestly did not think it was frog legs 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.510
 in general, okay not try 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:25.290
 now with garlic butter but it seems yes 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.069
 here it looks as if some 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.920
 cheesecake 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:33.739
 I do not know in general, so here these 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.860
 Fluted chips here should be 77 grams 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:42.599
 or 75 grams does not matter 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:46.170
 70 grams with something important let's 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.629
 open shorter at least pleases one 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.980
 that there are not real frog legs 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:54.569
 because well, there all sorts of spices all about 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.900
 in general, guys honestly, I don't want them 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.900
 already 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.220
 I wish I had not read yet 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:10.609
 give 550 rubles for frog legs 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.510
 can only slow down 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.510
 something smells incomprehensible 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:23.390
 nyusha 10 so okay don't pay attention 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.769
 the fact that there is Dr. Pepper on the left is worth 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.440
 it's just me coming from 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.420
 the previous review he remained in general 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.910
 there stands so for beauty in general 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.980
 it doesn't matter in general 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:39.140
 well smell smell like something so strange 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.060
 specific that is attacking well by the nose 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.480
 I don't know such a smell yet 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.310
 Generally such here 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.010
 chips and grooved but in principle ordinary 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.569
 chips like chips let's get some 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.569
 I'll try a little 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.280
 Well, honestly no frog legs 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.599
 i didn't feel felt here 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.910
 the taste of what's so garlic yes but in 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.850
 In principle, I did not try as it were 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:21.109
 frog and therefore I do not know them 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:24.020
 taste but felt in a course of garlic 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.470
 oil that is here meant garlic 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.630
 butter 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.630
 as if soaked with something like that 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.599
 garlic and so you know a little bit so 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.919
 here is a little bit 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.919
 pronounced taste of his garlic 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.290
 it feels like a mixture of paprika 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.170
 here's a little bit of paprika and garlic here 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.260
 something like that I don't know how anymore 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.570
 describe this taste 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:01.080
 In general, here and so my friends are here 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.840
 the chips we had on the review cheesecakes with 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.320
 somehow i don't know it's not clear what 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.080
 drawn cheesecake and some kind of shell 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.830
 In general, I do not know smoothly not all reception 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.160
 wish 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.980
 eat a lot of frog legs all to 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.970

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.970
 while you had an affair
