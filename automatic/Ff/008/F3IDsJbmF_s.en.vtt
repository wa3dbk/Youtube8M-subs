00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
about some jazz drum fills

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.490 
about some jazz drum fills
now<00:00:09.300> these<00:00:09.450> fills<00:00:09.750> are<00:00:09.929> all<00:00:10.019> based<00:00:10.260> off<00:00:10.469> of

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
now these fills are all based off of

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.589 
now these fills are all based off of
eighth<00:00:10.830> note<00:00:11.040> triplets<00:00:11.550> which<00:00:12.090> are<00:00:12.240> counted

these<00:00:29.160> fills<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.210> use<00:00:30.420> various<00:00:30.960> stick

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
these fills we can use various stick

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.170 
these fills we can use various stick
patterns<00:00:31.619> whether<00:00:32.070> it's<00:00:32.340> single<00:00:32.759> stroke<00:00:32.940> roll
