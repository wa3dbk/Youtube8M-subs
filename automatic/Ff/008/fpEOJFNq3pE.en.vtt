tried a deadlift I would say that you

tried a deadlift I would say that you

going to be the one your best bill for

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.920

it's<00:02:31.520> not<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.700> perfect<00:02:31.910> world<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.420> lot<00:02:32.570> of<00:02:32.720> people

start<00:02:33.260> lifting<00:02:33.650> one<00:02:33.980> way<00:02:34.130> obviously<00:02:34.550> I<00:02:34.760> pull

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
start lifting one way obviously I pull

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.810 
start lifting one way obviously I pull
sumo<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:36.250> reason<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.400> always<00:02:37.550> say

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
sumo and the reason that I always say

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.200 
sumo and the reason that I always say
that<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.150> because<00:02:38.180> I'm<00:02:38.540> built<00:02:38.780> more<00:02:38.930> for<00:02:38.990> it

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
that is because I'm built more for it

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.120 
that is because I'm built more for it
generally<00:02:41.210> a<00:02:41.450> shorter<00:02:42.020> stockier<00:02:42.380> lifter<00:02:42.890> and

generally a shorter stockier lifter and

generally a shorter stockier lifter and

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
this is very general blanket

this is very general blanket
generalization<00:02:45.650> here<00:02:45.800> is<00:02:46.610> going<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.850> have<00:02:47.030> an

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
generalization here is going to have an

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.990 
generalization here is going to have an
easier<00:02:47.360> time<00:02:47.390> pulling<00:02:47.960> conventional<00:02:48.590> while<00:02:49.580> a

link not necessarily taller but a lifter

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.180

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
shorter torso would have an easier time

with<00:02:59.840> a<00:03:00.140> sumo<00:03:00.620> pull<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:02.120> reason<00:03:02.450> for<00:03:02.600> that<00:03:02.630> is

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
with a sumo pull the reason for that is

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.820 
with a sumo pull the reason for that is
just<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.440> leverages<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:05.500> way<00:03:06.500> that<00:03:06.740> your

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
just the leverages the way that your

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.610 
just the leverages the way that your
strength<00:03:07.190> is<00:03:07.310> distributed<00:03:07.970> as<00:03:08.120> is<00:03:09.050> your<00:03:09.320> start

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
strength is distributed as is your start

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.920 
strength is distributed as is your start
strength<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:10.100> would<00:03:10.250> say<00:03:10.400> also<00:03:11.000> plays<00:03:11.600> a<00:03:11.630> role

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
strength I would say also plays a role

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.100 
strength I would say also plays a role
in<00:03:11.960> that<00:03:12.230> if<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.800> are<00:03:13.520> if<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.600> haven't<00:03:14.840> you

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
pain I kind of got the idea that if I

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.490 
pain I kind of got the idea that if I
strengthen<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.550> muscles<00:04:38.880> around<00:04:38.970> my<00:04:39.330> knee

strengthen the muscles around my knee
that<00:04:40.500> it<00:04:40.650> might<00:04:40.860> help<00:04:41.160> build<00:04:41.880> stability<00:04:42.450> and

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
that it might help build stability and

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.410 
that it might help build stability and
those<00:04:43.310> in<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.460> tendons<00:04:44.790> and<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.000> ligaments

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
those in the tendons and the ligaments

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.170 
those in the tendons and the ligaments
in<00:04:45.690> my<00:04:45.750> knee<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.170> so<00:04:47.070> I<00:04:47.370> started<00:04:47.460> doing<00:04:47.820> calf

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
in my knee and so I started doing calf

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.430 
in my knee and so I started doing calf
raises<00:04:48.480> and<00:04:49.280> um<00:04:50.280> some<00:04:50.940> isolated<00:04:51.870> quad<00:04:52.200> work

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
raises and um some isolated quad work

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.200 
raises and um some isolated quad work
like<00:04:52.890> a<00:04:52.920> single<00:04:53.430> leg<00:04:53.520> extension<00:04:54.060> with<00:04:54.180> a

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
like a single leg extension with a

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.240 
like a single leg extension with a
really<00:04:54.450> lightweight<00:04:54.690> and<00:04:55.170> just<00:04:55.740> focusing<00:04:56.220> on

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
really lightweight and just focusing on

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.730 
really lightweight and just focusing on
holding<00:04:56.940> attractions<00:04:57.570> and<00:04:57.780> I<00:04:57.990> found<00:04:58.260> that<00:04:58.590> the

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
holding attractions and I found that the

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.280 
holding attractions and I found that the
combination<00:04:59.280> of<00:04:59.340> those<00:04:59.460> two<00:04:59.520> things

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
combination of those two things

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.900 
combination of those two things
generally<00:05:01.290> help<00:05:02.040> to<00:05:02.160> prevent<00:05:02.400> my<00:05:02.550> knee<00:05:02.610> pain

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
and I know after I figured that out kind

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.190 
and I know after I figured that out kind
of<00:05:06.870> on<00:05:07.020> my<00:05:07.140> own<00:05:07.170> I<00:05:07.590> asked<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:08.340> friend<00:05:08.520> who

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
of on my own I asked a friend who

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.830 
of on my own I asked a friend who
interns<00:05:10.200> at<00:05:10.350> a<00:05:10.410> chiropractic<00:05:10.950> office<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:11.840> he

interns at a chiropractic office and he

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.870 
interns at a chiropractic office and he
told<00:05:13.260> me<00:05:13.530> you<00:05:14.220> know<00:05:14.250> some<00:05:14.910> scientific

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
told me you know some scientific

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.070 
told me you know some scientific
basically<00:05:17.880> the<00:05:17.970> anatomical<00:05:18.540> reasons<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:19.020> the

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
basically the anatomical reasons and the

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.660 
basically the anatomical reasons and the
physiological<00:05:19.620> reasons<00:05:19.920> why<00:05:20.160> that<00:05:20.520> was

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
physiological reasons why that was

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.780 
physiological reasons why that was
helping<00:05:21.030> I<00:05:21.890> can't<00:05:22.890> really<00:05:23.070> repeat<00:05:23.460> it<00:05:23.580> to<00:05:23.700> you

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
helping I can't really repeat it to you

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.460 
helping I can't really repeat it to you
because<00:05:23.970> it<00:05:24.330> was<00:05:24.360> it<00:05:24.870> was<00:05:25.050> pretty<00:05:25.230> heady

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
because it was it was pretty heady

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.900 
because it was it was pretty heady
pretty<00:05:25.800> wordy<00:05:26.010> and<00:05:27.000> just<00:05:27.990> I<00:05:28.230> found<00:05:29.190> that<00:05:29.670> if

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
pretty wordy and just I found that if

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.700 
pretty wordy and just I found that if
you<00:05:30.030> strengthen<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.720> muscles<00:05:31.050> around<00:05:31.170> a

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
you strengthen the muscles around a

you strengthen the muscles around a
joint<00:05:32.040> the<00:05:32.310> joint<00:05:32.340> reacts<00:05:33.210> better<00:05:33.540> same<00:05:33.930> thing

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
joint the joint reacts better same thing
