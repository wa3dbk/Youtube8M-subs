00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.780 

let's<00:00:10.750> do<00:00:10.990> a<00:00:11.020> test<00:00:11.350> and<00:00:11.770> see<00:00:11.950> what<00:00:12.370> channels

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790 
let's do a test and see what channels

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.000 
let's do a test and see what channels
missed<00:00:13.389> antenna<00:00:13.750> picks<00:00:13.990> up<00:00:14.290> first<00:00:14.590> we<00:00:14.740> power

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.010 
missed antenna picks up first we power

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.700 
missed antenna picks up first we power
our<00:00:15.250> antenna<00:00:15.930> and<00:00:16.930> when<00:00:17.050> you<00:00:17.140> power<00:00:17.380> on<00:00:17.410> the

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
our antenna and when you power on the

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:25.120 
our antenna and when you power on the
antenna<00:00:17.920> there's<00:00:18.220> a<00:00:18.279> blue<00:00:18.900> glow

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.560 

the<00:00:26.260> application<00:00:27.260> I'll<00:00:28.000> turn<00:00:29.000> all<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:29.420> way<00:00:29.480> to

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
the application I'll turn all the way to

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:39.060 
the application I'll turn all the way to
max<00:00:33.430> it<00:00:34.430> will<00:00:34.610> start<00:00:34.880> to<00:00:35.000> scan

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.100 

this<00:00:39.610> will<00:00:39.760> take<00:00:39.880> a<00:00:39.940> little<00:00:40.180> bit<00:00:40.329> so<00:00:40.930> we'll

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
this will take a little bit so we'll

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:51.639 
this will take a little bit so we'll
speed<00:00:41.530> through<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:43.450> scanning<00:00:43.720> process

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:59.840 

time<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.800> found<00:00:53.040> 53<00:00:53.610> channels

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.780 

and<00:01:00.060> see<00:01:00.750> let's<00:01:01.350> jump<00:01:02.070> through<00:01:02.310> the<00:01:02.430> channels

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
and see let's jump through the channels

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.630 
and see let's jump through the channels
and<00:01:03.120> see<00:01:03.270> what<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.480> picks<00:01:03.690> up<00:01:03.810> all<00:01:04.519> of<00:01:05.519> these

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
and see what it picks up all of these

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.700 
and see what it picks up all of these
picked<00:01:05.940> up<00:01:07.640> 14

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.870 

looks<00:01:18.380> like<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:18.740> amplification<00:01:19.070> really<00:01:19.700> does

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
looks like the amplification really does

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.630 
looks like the amplification really does
help<00:01:20.090> out<00:01:20.299> a<00:01:20.510> lot

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
help out a lot

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.580 
help out a lot
local<00:01:23.510> channels<00:01:24.190> even<00:01:25.390> far<00:01:26.390> away<00:01:26.420> in<00:01:26.750> San

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
local channels even far away in San

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:41.590 
local channels even far away in San
Francisco<00:01:28.130> picked<00:01:28.430> up

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:51.480 

which<00:01:42.050> is<00:01:42.200> pretty<00:01:42.470> good

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:05.010 

so<00:01:51.909> just<00:01:52.330> get<00:01:52.479> through<00:01:52.690> a<00:01:52.750> few<00:01:52.960> more

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.840

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
in short this Philips antenna receives

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.609 
in short this Philips antenna receives
many<00:02:08.119> channels<00:02:08.450> even<00:02:08.810> those<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.289> are<00:02:09.410> more

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
many channels even those that are more

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.430 
many channels even those that are more
