00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.509
 Tell me, I'm here to show you here. 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.090
 It's been practically 24 hours here. 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.880
 began to circulate the aquarium 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.590
 in the previous video as I had spoken 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.049
 here with you 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.910
 see the problem in the led farthest 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.900
 early in the morning I went there and touches without 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.340
 problems 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.430
 the middle saw ok, it's prefect, I bought 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.429
 today the thermostat that also in the corner 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.740
 thermometer also on the side here and 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.780
 I bought two seedlings this plant too. 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:40.440
 that that name is one cable I think I'm 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.090
 realizing here that a led strip 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.670
 I dreamed it was a little dark 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.309
 mainly for those two plants 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.520
 The younger I put today, 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.890
 I believe they do not need 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.520
 more lighting 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.190
 so I also fill this one 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.260
 clear that it had not filled to the limit 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.780
 And I put this black ribbon here to 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.400
 hide a little shaved led 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.100
 I 'm going to turn out the light a little to see 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:17.820
 How can you see how it runs but now? 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:19.560
 we take that case so the filter is 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.140
 quite silent 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.189
 I did not think it would be so quiet 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.830
 like this 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.689
 then I filled in and the waterfall that she 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.189
 walked on life does not work 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.479
 practically none 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.900
 I realize that the nubia is the fern 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.420
 are well lit until those beyond 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.159
 after that I did not forget the name too 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.860
 lamps and the two lamps that remained on the 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.850
 middle and bottom of the aquarium ends up 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.210
 slightly dark 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.689
 If I realize that she's getting 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.509
 Brakes the way I'm going to buy 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.030
 another led tape and place one on 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.350
 bottom of the court and I saw I put the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.290
 daughter in the extension of the two 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.740
 sides and front 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.630
 then there doing almost 24 hours cycling 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.140
 water is clean but I realized that it 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.039
 stayed 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.440
 some white a little milky so I 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.510
 I think it's already cycling 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.660
 happening the accelerator effect 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.550
 and then throughout the day 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.880
 output differential or 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.880
 posting more days here read the arm
