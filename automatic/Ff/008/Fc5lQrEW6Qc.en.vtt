 also that is also in 2012 the 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.799
 that to speak good places 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:20.920
 bring that song to yourself 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.970
 to copyright not mesh with infractions 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:29.140
 that's why the menu is good and the menu 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.730
 different to local 2012 good we have 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.900
 here that what is good here the 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.900
 calendar be different 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.430

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.070
 Brazilian 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.810
 it seems rough there that the 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.540
 Brazilian with us 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.459
 it is healthy 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.159

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.360
 today they are called am to one realizes what 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.290
 what happens in europe and not what happens in 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.669
 America there in 2000 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.709
 13 well that I do not know but I think 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.610
 as more bacán to be occupied motivates me more to 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:26.419
 play this 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.740
 comes with all this 2013 in the palette I 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.460
 the Brazilian league appears 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.220
 well that other good league is in others 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.529
 tournaments there are those of international 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.800
 good 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:41.650
 good is the league ranking 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.220
 --teams 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.220
 good 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.620
 to see what else we see here 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.270
 marvel 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.700
 good we see here to next 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.810
 but I preferred 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.810
 what is this 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.180
 with the players 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.449
 well that 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:12.919
 the alignment remains the same 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.919
 the training 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.739
 like the truth 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.950
 good here is to change the dorsal 

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:25.020
 of the players 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.020
 and this will be dirt 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:33.139
 because it was great one must be something 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:35.569
 participate I think 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.490
 good to see what else is here good here 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:40.340
 When they have signed players, the 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.610
 percent the chances I think 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.610
 but 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.659
 that the percentage appears not to know 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:49.840
 who is the one who has the possibility of 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:53.430
 energy to the team and those who are not good 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:57.620
 here to find the players 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.620
 to finance those who sponsor 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.470
 the one that over here 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.380

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.639

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.939
 why not 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:44.580

 is a legend that brings the league the 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:12.610
