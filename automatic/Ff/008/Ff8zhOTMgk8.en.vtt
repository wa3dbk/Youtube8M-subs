00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:00.749 
here how affected this play is this

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:03.439 
here how affected this play is this
really<00:01:01.050> consistent<00:01:01.589> play<00:01:01.800> works<00:01:02.609> almost

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
really consistent play works almost

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.900 
really consistent play works almost
around<00:01:04.080> 95%<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.160> time<00:01:05.370> and<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.640> get<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
around 95% of the time and you get the

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.490 
around 95% of the time and you get the
coverage<00:01:06.210> right<00:01:06.480> and<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.200> guys<00:01:07.290> can<00:01:07.440> see

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
coverage right and as you guys can see

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.410 
coverage right and as you guys can see
here<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.920> passed<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.670> right<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.270> don't

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
here we passed it to the right you don't

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.940 
here we passed it to the right you don't
even<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.810> put<00:01:10.260> anybody<00:01:10.470> else<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
even have to put anybody else on the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.440 
even have to put anybody else on the
drag<00:01:11.130> that's<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> basic<00:01:11.940> setup<00:01:12.300> you

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
drag that's just like a basic setup you

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.030 
drag that's just like a basic setup you
could<00:01:12.570> change<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.810> setup<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.290> want<00:01:13.500> but

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
could change the setup as you want but

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.170 
could change the setup as you want but
just<00:01:14.070> make<00:01:14.310> sure<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.550> block<00:01:14.730> the<00:01:14.910> running

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
just make sure you block the running

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.460 
just make sure you block the running
back<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.570> right<00:01:15.780> here<00:01:15.960> we're<00:01:16.110> throwing<00:01:16.290> it

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
back and right here we're throwing it

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.930 
back and right here we're throwing it
this<00:01:16.560> time<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> lab<00:01:17.130> now<00:01:17.310> what<00:01:17.460> makes<00:01:17.790> this

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
this time to lab now what makes this

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.750 
this time to lab now what makes this
play<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.660> effective<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.230> that<00:01:19.260> where<00:01:20.220> we

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
play really effective is that where we

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.490 
play really effective is that where we
could<00:01:20.940> flip<00:01:21.120> the<00:01:21.240> plate<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> left<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.230> it

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
could flip the plate to the left and it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.350 
could flip the plate to the left and it
looks<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> same<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.280> both<00:01:23.490> sides<00:01:23.550> so<00:01:24.180> as<00:01:24.270> you

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
looks the same on both sides so as you

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.000 
looks the same on both sides so as you
guys<00:01:24.480> can<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:24.690> here<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.620> time<00:01:25.770> we're<00:01:25.890> going

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
guys can see here this time we're going

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.500 
guys can see here this time we're going
to<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.280> right<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.760> looks<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> same<00:01:27.330> my

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
to the right it looks the same my

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.700 
to the right it looks the same my
opponents<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:27.930> gonna<00:01:28.110> know<00:01:28.290> whether<00:01:28.500> we're

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
opponents not gonna know whether we're

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.990 
opponents not gonna know whether we're
going<00:01:28.830> to<00:01:28.980> the<00:01:29.100> right<00:01:29.310> or<00:01:29.340> left<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:29.910> gonna

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
going to the right or left so it's gonna

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.330 
going to the right or left so it's gonna
be<00:01:30.180> really<00:01:30.390> hard<00:01:30.690> play<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.080> defend<00:01:31.620> against

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
be really hard play to defend against

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.020 
be really hard play to defend against
man<00:01:32.550> coverage<00:01:33.000> now<00:01:33.240> again<00:01:33.930> zone<00:01:34.350> coverage

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
man coverage now again zone coverage

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.490 
man coverage now again zone coverage
it's<00:01:36.030> not<00:01:36.330> that<00:01:36.540> bad<00:01:36.750> either<00:01:36.780> man<00:01:37.290> it's

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
it's not that bad either man it's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.080 
it's not that bad either man it's
basically<00:01:38.010> the<00:01:38.190> same<00:01:38.370> thing<00:01:38.640> now<00:01:38.820> you're
