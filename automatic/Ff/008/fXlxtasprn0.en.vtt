00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:08.460
 hello how about friends I'm elkin and in 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.660
 this time I'm going to show you that 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.119
 the relationship to the watermark is a 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.610
 art that is made with a paper 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:21.940
 rolled 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.940
 and with which different forms are made 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.050
 for example 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.050
 for example flowers like that 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.900
 the paper is rolled with 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.640
 with a tool like this that brings 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.640
 that bring the lowest 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.610
 the idea is to put the monk in the middle of 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.610
 the following needles to roll up 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.910
 develop 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.930
 we press 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.439
 and they see that more have been left as a 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.310
 a form that then with some movements 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.950
 or with some pinching we can elaborate 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.170
 ways for example how this little mouse 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.050
 that we become active then by 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.159
 at least to elaborate the head of 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.649
 that mouse 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.009
 we take the piece of paper that we just 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.009
 roll up 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.910
 obviously you have to hit the end 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.790
 so that it does not come off 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.180
 we take the little angel and we do 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.280
 yes 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.280
 and we have at least the little head 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.830
 by the way we are looking for that 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.680
 way we are going to develop many drawings 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.810
 and many ways and obviously there are other 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.470
 techniques for example how to elaborate 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.630
 one a flower like this 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.120
 as to make a rose like 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.680
 is 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.680
 with paper yes 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.950
 these drawings or these forms because 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.130
 we have a doll then 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.200
 later we put them in a 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.629
 card on a blank paper 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.510
 and we leave a space for later 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.250
 customize the card then as 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.150
 you can do an infinite number of drawings 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.510
 infinity of forms 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.659
 and we can throw free rein to the 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.659
 imagination 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.180
 beautiful compositions with paper 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.599
 rolled up the paper that is used is 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.940
 colorful iris paper that allows when 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.400
 when it is short or thin, it does not lose 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.430
 I do not want the color because it's all the fault 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.349
 of the paper is one color 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.170
 Well I hope you like the video 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.090
 forget to subscribe to the channel to support me 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.329
 with the likes later 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.790
 we will be uploading videos of how to do 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:08.600
 some forms of all generic forms 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.210
 the town I'm going to leave you some 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.040
 know images of some forms 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.500
 basic that can be developed and how 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.370
 develop them with on this train wait 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.530
 to summer 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.870
 and not being more than I bless you 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.870
 all a strong hug and chau chau
