with different levels of biodiversity

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.729 
with different levels of biodiversity
they<00:00:57.180> measure<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.600> growth<00:00:57.840> rate<00:00:58.109> by<00:00:58.379> taking

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
they measure the growth rate by taking

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.830 
they measure the growth rate by taking
measurements<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> trees<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.660> this

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
measurements on the trees to do this

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.599 
measurements on the trees to do this
they<00:01:01.140> need<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.440> know<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> diameter<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.250> all<00:01:02.489> of

they need to know the diameter of all of

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.709 
they need to know the diameter of all of
the<00:01:02.699> tree<00:01:02.910> trunks<00:01:03.270> at<00:01:03.390> breast<00:01:03.629> height

the tree trunks at breast height

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.500 
the tree trunks at breast height
referred<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> dbh<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:06.090> tells<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
referred to as the dbh this tells the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.420 
referred to as the dbh this tells the
research<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.080> how<00:01:07.229> large<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.799> trees<00:01:08.010> are<00:01:08.220> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
research is how large the trees are and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.070 
research is how large the trees are and
thus<00:01:08.640> allows<00:01:08.939> them<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.180> calculate<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.900> total

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
thus allows them to calculate the total

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.100 
thus allows them to calculate the total

like this we can later on in the lab

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:39.159 
like this we can later on in the lab
analyze<00:02:35.329> the<00:02:36.109> pictures<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:38.169> estimations

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:39.169 
analyze the pictures and estimations

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.819 
analyze the pictures and estimations
about<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:40.069> structure<00:02:40.939> of<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.389> canopy<00:02:42.319> and

also about the amount of leaves and the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.129 
also about the amount of leaves and the

most important one the distribution of
the<00:02:48.319> leaves<00:02:48.469> also<00:02:49.030> i<00:02:50.030> can<00:02:50.299> show<00:02:50.599> you<00:02:50.629> now<00:02:50.870> i

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
the leaves also i can show you now i

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.439 
the leaves also i can show you now i
will<00:02:51.769> make<00:02:51.889> a<00:02:51.919> picture<00:02:52.189> therefore<00:02:52.939> i<00:02:52.969> have<00:02:53.120> to

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:53.449 
will make a picture therefore i have to

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:55.869 
will make a picture therefore i have to
take<00:02:53.959> care<00:02:54.319> that<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.769> camera<00:02:55.159> is<00:02:55.340> very<00:02:55.639> hard

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
take care that the camera is very hard

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.539 
take care that the camera is very hard
horizontally<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:56.989> at<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.829> same<00:02:58.010> time<00:02:58.069> i<00:02:58.459> will

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
horizontally and at the same time i will

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.110 
horizontally and at the same time i will
make<00:02:59.000> a<00:02:59.209> picture<00:02:59.449> on<00:02:59.810> the<00:03:00.290> head<00:03:00.469> of<00:03:00.769> 2.5<00:03:01.609> meter

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
diversity in natural forests in doing so

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.930 
diversity in natural forests in doing so
they<00:03:11.349> need<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.560> bear<00:03:11.830> one<00:03:12.040> thing<00:03:12.099> in<00:03:12.370> mind<00:03:12.489> and

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
they need to bear one thing in mind and

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.610 
they need to bear one thing in mind and
that<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.299> that<00:03:13.690> there<00:03:13.840> are<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:14.019> lot<00:03:14.230> of<00:03:14.260> other

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
that is that there are a lot of other

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.589 
that is that there are a lot of other
confounding<00:03:15.129> factors<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:15.940> influence<00:03:16.420> this

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
confounding factors that influence this

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.899 
confounding factors that influence this
relationship<00:03:17.260> for<00:03:17.470> example<00:03:18.159> the<00:03:18.489> amount<00:03:18.790> of

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
relationship for example the amount of

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.789 
relationship for example the amount of
light<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.810> problem<00:03:20.200> with<00:03:20.349> this<00:03:20.500> is<00:03:20.680> that

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
light the problem with this is that

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.470 
light the problem with this is that
these<00:03:21.159> other<00:03:21.400> factors<00:03:21.670> are<00:03:22.000> beyond<00:03:22.299> their

these other factors are beyond their

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.110 
these other factors are beyond their
control<00:03:22.659> thus<00:03:23.590> they're<00:03:24.159> conducting<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.760> pilot

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
control thus they're conducting a pilot

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.910 
control thus they're conducting a pilot
experiment<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.870> investigate<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.500> effect<00:03:26.799> of
