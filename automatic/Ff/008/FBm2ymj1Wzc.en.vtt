00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.420
 open this file I do not know why 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:43.059
 they try to open files so they do not 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:46.660
 it may not be installed so I'll 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.920
 give control to copy and paste it 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.720

 and we're in the game it takes a 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.760
 little in charge 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.760
 but good 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.850
 the mode is an object that can be 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.900
 buy and for that we're going to enter 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.440
 buy mode 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.440
 obviously 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.420
 let's sort it by a function and we 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.329
 we go to entertainment and hobbies 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.310

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.340
 it costs 500 pesos nothing else is very 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.650
 cheap the truth 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:44.780
 let's place it anywhere 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.780

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.270
 they want the skill level to be 10 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.970
 they go to master and if they want to select 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.009
 or some sort of level is more 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.479
 collection assumes 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.479
