still<00:01:25.440> safe

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.220 

that<00:01:29.860> shouldn't<00:01:30.190> be<00:01:30.280> safe<00:01:30.570> there<00:01:31.570> we<00:01:31.690> go<00:01:31.890> okay

so now we have a move shows you the
input<00:01:40.800> frames<00:01:41.800> on<00:01:42.010> block<00:01:42.540> started<00:01:43.540> frames<00:01:43.780> for

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
input frames on block started frames for

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.700

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
the move damage and the range as in is

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.150 
the move damage and the range as in is
it<00:01:47.860> highs<00:01:48.100> it<00:01:48.730> is<00:01:48.910> low<00:01:49.440> no<00:01:50.440> so<00:01:50.590> you<00:01:50.680> can<00:01:50.860> duck

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
it highs it is low no so you can duck

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.940 
it highs it is low no so you can duck
the<00:01:51.340> highest<00:01:51.760> crush<00:01:52.060> loads<00:01:52.450> whatever<00:01:52.900> yeah<00:01:53.740> so

then it also shows you what your guide
choose<00:01:57.360> have<00:01:58.360> that<00:01:59.260> can<00:01:59.500> punish<00:01:59.770> that<00:02:00.070> move

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
choose have that can punish that move

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.290 
choose have that can punish that move
this<00:02:01.510> only<00:02:01.780> works<00:02:02.140> frame<00:02:02.530> wise<00:02:02.770> doesn't<00:02:03.520> take

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
this only works frame wise doesn't take

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.200 
this only works frame wise doesn't take
ranges<00:02:05.230> into<00:02:05.500> account<00:02:05.800> or<00:02:06.670> push<00:02:06.970> back

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
ranges into account or push back

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.640 
ranges into account or push back
whatever<00:02:08.820> but<00:02:09.820> still<00:02:10.360> there's<00:02:10.960> really<00:02:11.230> useful

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
whatever but still there's really useful

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.740 
whatever but still there's really useful
you'll<00:02:12.030> shouldn't<00:02:13.030> make<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.300> mistake<00:02:13.600> too

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
you'll shouldn't make the mistake too

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.060 
you'll shouldn't make the mistake too
many<00:02:13.930> times<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:15.100> basically<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:17.380> does<00:02:17.710> of

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
many times so basically it does of

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.870 
many times so basically it does of
course<00:02:18.100> list<00:02:18.670> your<00:02:18.820> Punishers<00:02:19.330> first<00:02:20.490> your<00:02:21.490> NC

course list your Punishers first your NC

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.400 
course list your Punishers first your NC
strings<00:02:22.890> then<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.340> also<00:02:24.700> shows<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.570> your

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
strings then it also shows you your

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.920 
strings then it also shows you your
other<00:02:26.620> moves<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.130> can<00:02:27.280> use<00:02:27.810> example<00:02:28.810> I'm

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
other moves you can use example I'm

Heihachi gone forward one two and head

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.040 
Heihachi gone forward one two and head

but it but it's also fun yeah okay so
obviously<00:02:51.180> sometimes<00:02:52.180> going<00:02:52.930> through<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.320> move

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
obviously sometimes going through a move

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.350 
obviously sometimes going through a move
list<00:02:53.770> like<00:02:53.920> this<00:02:54.160> just<00:02:54.580> to<00:02:54.700> get<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:55.030> one<00:02:55.150> move

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
list like this just to get to one move

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.670 
list like this just to get to one move
and<00:02:55.540> see<00:02:56.250> what's<00:02:57.250> going<00:02:57.550> on<00:02:58.410> isn't<00:02:59.410> all<00:02:59.650> that

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
and see what's going on isn't all that

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.180 
and see what's going on isn't all that
much<00:03:00.010> fun<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:00.520> we<00:03:00.640> added<00:03:00.820> another<00:03:01.030> feature<00:03:02.190> a

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
much fun so we added another feature a

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.420 
much fun so we added another feature a
column<00:03:03.850> view<00:03:04.500> we<00:03:05.500> can<00:03:05.940> pick<00:03:06.940> one<00:03:07.150> character

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
column view we can pick one character

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.310 
column view we can pick one character
let's<00:03:09.430> say<00:03:09.610> Lisa<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:13.540> basically<00:03:13.750> get<00:03:14.080> all

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
let's say Lisa and you basically get all

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.390 
let's say Lisa and you basically get all
