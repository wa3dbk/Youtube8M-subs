00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
like gears three years one was really

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.609 
like gears three years one was really
fast<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:29.600> we<00:01:29.659> slowed<00:01:30.020> down<00:01:30.140> gears<00:01:30.440> to<00:01:30.590> a

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
fast and we slowed down gears to a

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.290 
fast and we slowed down gears to a
little<00:01:30.890> bit<00:01:31.010> in<00:01:31.190> terms<00:01:31.520> of<00:01:31.700> trying<00:01:31.909> to<00:01:32.090> again

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
little bit in terms of trying to again

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.690 
little bit in terms of trying to again
to<00:01:32.869> make<00:01:33.110> it<00:01:33.200> more<00:01:33.320> accessible<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:33.920> we<00:01:34.520> felt

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
to make it more accessible and we felt

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.250 
to make it more accessible and we felt
like<00:01:34.729> it<00:01:35.030> you<00:01:35.240> know<00:01:35.330> I<00:01:35.659> think<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:36.020> lot<00:01:36.110> of

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
like it you know I think a lot of

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.480 
like it you know I think a lot of
feedback<00:01:36.470> we've<00:01:36.740> gotten<00:01:36.770> from<00:01:36.950> players<00:01:37.280> is

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
feedback we've gotten from players is

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.070 
feedback we've gotten from players is
that<00:01:37.610> we<00:01:37.700> felt<00:01:37.910> like<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.090> pendulum<00:01:38.660> swung<00:01:38.840> too

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
that we felt like the pendulum swung too

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.320 
that we felt like the pendulum swung too
far<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:40.040> we've<00:01:40.490> found<00:01:40.850> this<00:01:41.030> middle

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
far and so we've found this middle

00:01:41.330 --> 00:02:00.590 
far and so we've found this middle
ground<00:01:41.570> I<00:01:43.930> think<00:01:44.930> we<00:01:44.990> found<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.259> sweet<00:01:45.350> spot

there as you've seen it we want to put a
gear<00:02:11.200> spin<00:02:11.590> on<00:02:11.739> it<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.280> it's<00:02:12.400> actually<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.819> pool

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
gear spin on it so it's actually a pool

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.839 
gear spin on it so it's actually a pool
of<00:02:13.239> lives<00:02:13.989> that<00:02:14.230> each<00:02:14.500> team<00:02:14.800> has<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.550> take<00:02:15.730> out
