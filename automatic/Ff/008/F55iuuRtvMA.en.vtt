i'm sure you guys will like him for a
bit<00:02:26.020> of<00:02:26.140> pace<00:02:26.320> but<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.680> team<00:02:26.860> itself<00:02:27.130> actually

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
bit of pace but the team itself actually

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.460 
bit of pace but the team itself actually
played<00:02:27.760> quite<00:02:28.000> well<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.960> one<00:02:29.110> thing<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.320> did

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
played quite well the one thing I did

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.870 
played quite well the one thing I did
notice<00:02:29.500> though<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.100> was<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.430> strength<00:02:30.730> from

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
notice though it was the strength from

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.550 
notice though it was the strength from
the<00:02:31.030> side<00:02:31.210> especially<00:02:31.690> in<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:31.990> midfield<00:02:32.170> that

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
the side especially in the midfield that

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.810 
the side especially in the midfield that
recline<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:32.860> getting<00:02:33.100> pushed<00:02:33.310> off<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.520> ball

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
recline and getting pushed off the ball

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.060 
recline and getting pushed off the ball
but<00:02:34.210> saying<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.690> halina<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.350> really<00:02:35.920> nice

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
but saying that halina a really nice

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.890 
but saying that halina a really nice
player<00:02:36.340> recommend<00:02:37.120> trying<00:02:37.300> him<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.630> think<00:02:37.810> this

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
player recommend trying him I think this

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.600 
player recommend trying him I think this
is<00:02:38.050> like<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.470> second<00:02:38.830> time<00:02:38.950> using<00:02:39.250> him<00:02:39.490> and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
is like the second time using him and

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.520 
is like the second time using him and
he's<00:02:39.700> always<00:02:39.760> stepped<00:02:40.150> up<00:02:40.360> in<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.600> game<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:41.110> go

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
he's always stepped up in the game so go

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.680 
he's always stepped up in the game so go
check<00:02:41.770> him<00:02:41.890> out<00:02:42.010> in<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.250> Brazilian<00:02:42.850> or<00:02:43.000> BPL<00:02:43.420> or

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
check him out in a Brazilian or BPL or

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.660 
check him out in a Brazilian or BPL or
even<00:02:44.110> this<00:02:44.260> team<00:02:44.470> in<00:02:44.650> fact<00:02:44.890> but<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.280> build<00:02:45.610> the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
even this team in fact but I build the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.370 
even this team in fact but I build the
team<00:02:45.850> it's<00:02:46.030> not<00:02:46.120> too<00:02:46.209> bad<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.630> have<00:02:46.990> given<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.320> a

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
team it's not too bad I have given it a

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.320 
team it's not too bad I have given it a
4<00:02:47.620> out<00:02:47.650> of<00:02:47.830> 5<00:02:48.040> star<00:02:48.340> rating<00:02:48.370> though<00:02:48.850> something

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
4 out of 5 star rating though something

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.850 
4 out of 5 star rating though something
is<00:02:49.420> lacking<00:02:49.720> with<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.140> side<00:02:50.350> that<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.560> don't
