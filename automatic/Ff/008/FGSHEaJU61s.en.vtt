stage<00:00:38.090> as<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.210> lot<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> people<00:00:40.070> throughout<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
stage as a lot of people throughout the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.370 
stage as a lot of people throughout the
past<00:00:42.060> couple<00:00:42.330> years<00:00:42.450> have<00:00:42.840> told<00:00:43.080> me<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.200> I

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
past couple years have told me that I

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.680 
past couple years have told me that I
sucked<00:00:43.830> and<00:00:44.130> that<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.400> was<00:00:44.670> done<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.660> I

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
sucked and that I was done and that I

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.830 
sucked and that I was done and that I
could<00:00:46.020> no<00:00:46.170> longer<00:00:46.430> be<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> thriving<00:00:48.090> force<00:00:48.570> and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
could no longer be a thriving force and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.290 
could no longer be a thriving force and
power<00:00:48.990> lifting<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:50.490> think<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> be<00:00:50.970> on<00:00:51.120> that

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
power lifting and I think to be on that

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.750 
power lifting and I think to be on that
stage<00:00:51.510> would<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.830> know<00:00:52.950> kind<00:00:53.640> of

attempts there I think Danny proved in
March<00:01:05.570> that<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.140> better<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.619> smart

to open very light very safe take smart

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.539 
to open very light very safe take smart
jumps<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:12.990> my<00:01:13.109> second<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.710> if<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.280> take

know<00:01:19.170> Danny<00:01:19.469> set<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.829> precedent<00:01:20.399> of<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:21.479> very

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
know Danny set a precedent of a very
