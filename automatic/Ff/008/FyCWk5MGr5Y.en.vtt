00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
morally thorns doing is cutting a piece

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.410 
morally thorns doing is cutting a piece
of<00:02:21.440> life<00:02:21.680> are<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.580> feeling

all<00:02:35.360> right<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:41.440> what<00:02:42.440> find<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.340> sign<00:02:43.549> to<00:02:43.700> go<00:02:43.849> with

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
all right so what find a sign to go with

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.940 
all right so what find a sign to go with
this<00:02:44.239> method<00:02:44.720> so<00:02:44.930> we'll<00:02:45.140> see<00:02:45.290> how<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.560> goes<00:02:45.590> and

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
this method so we'll see how it goes and

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.800 
this method so we'll see how it goes and
I'll<00:02:46.040> let<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.340> know<00:02:46.660> all<00:02:47.660> right

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.089 

this<00:02:50.810> is<00:02:50.959> kind<00:02:51.230> of<00:02:51.290> why<00:02:51.470> we're<00:02:51.709> going<00:02:51.799> to<00:02:51.920> use

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
this is kind of why we're going to use

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.690 
this is kind of why we're going to use
type<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:52.910> f<00:02:53.060> -<00:02:53.420> B<00:02:53.450> it's<00:02:54.380> proof<00:02:54.799> for<00:02:55.069> right<00:02:55.280> the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
type you f - B it's proof for right the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.089 
type you f - B it's proof for right the
right<00:02:55.819> burial<00:02:56.360> so<00:02:57.079> you<00:02:57.200> put<00:02:57.500> that<00:02:57.620> right<00:02:57.890> in

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
right burial so you put that right in

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.569 
right burial so you put that right in
the<00:02:58.190> run<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.930> don't<00:02:59.930> have<00:03:00.079> a<00:03:00.110> problem<00:03:00.579> that's

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
the run and don't have a problem that's

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.220 
the run and don't have a problem that's
