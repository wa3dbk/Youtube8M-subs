00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.530
 to remove the security code if you 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.130
 ask for mail pin or 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:14.200
 or the fingerprint of a galaxy s 6 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.840
 this is the fact 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.600
 what they have to do good if they 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.120
 they forget what they have to do 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.000
 is to turn it off 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.270
 then press the volume button 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.780
 up the middle one and the one 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.350
 turned on all at once 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.560
 once they turn on they release only 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.920
 the one on the power button and the others 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.410
 eyes 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.810
 they keep pressing him 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.870
 we are going to extend this option we have to 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.030
 wait a few minutes until it's not the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.590
 recovery option 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.629
 and we can reset it reminds us that 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.000
 is this procedure erases all the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.000
 internal memory of the phone 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.660
 the truth is that it is a very nice phone 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.180
 I have the wireless charger also 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.580
 what has come with this is that 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.310
 new boxed and a good now we have 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.570
 the options to download we use the 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.409
 volume we go down where it says factory reset 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.830
 and we select with the ignition 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.120
 we go down where it says yes 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.830
 we select 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.260
 there is beginning to erase all the 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.070
 information and then reset we go back to 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.070
 restart the computer 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.570
 if they have in that set they want to release 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.060
 because some projects come not 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.180
 they come unlocked they can send me a 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.160
 message and I gave them the code to 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.390
 that can free him so he is free 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.390
