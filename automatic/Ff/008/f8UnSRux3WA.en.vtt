it's<00:05:13.820> kind<00:05:14.090> of<00:05:14.150> cliche<00:05:14.539> when<00:05:14.690> people<00:05:14.900> say<00:05:15.080> that

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
it's kind of cliche when people say that

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.120 
it's kind of cliche when people say that
but<00:05:15.620> I<00:05:15.680> think<00:05:15.949> that<00:05:16.220> great<00:05:16.910> art<00:05:17.180> should<00:05:18.020> be

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
but I think that great art should be

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.980 
but I think that great art should be
dangerous<00:05:19.130> it<00:05:19.400> should<00:05:19.699> evoke<00:05:20.659> strong

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
dangerous it should evoke strong

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.310 
dangerous it should evoke strong
emotions<00:05:21.650> anger<00:05:22.340> sadness<00:05:22.639> outrage<00:05:23.449> as<00:05:23.780> long

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
emotions anger sadness outrage as long

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.409 
emotions anger sadness outrage as long
as<00:05:24.500> it's<00:05:24.650> true<00:05:24.949> as<00:05:25.310> long<00:05:25.340> as<00:05:25.669> it's<00:05:26.000> telling<00:05:26.330> the

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
as it's true as long as it's telling the

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.500 
as it's true as long as it's telling the
truth<00:05:26.690> I<00:05:26.930> think<00:05:27.260> we<00:05:27.440> shouldn't<00:05:28.210> back<00:05:29.210> away

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510
