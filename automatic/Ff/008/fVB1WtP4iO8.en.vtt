it's<00:00:28.240> hard<00:00:28.420> to<00:00:28.540> imagine<00:00:28.720> that<00:00:28.930> checkers<00:00:29.380> would

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
it's hard to imagine that checkers would

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.620 
it's hard to imagine that checkers would
work<00:00:29.770> as<00:00:29.980> a<00:00:30.010> video<00:00:30.340> game<00:00:30.700> and<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.120> 1980

2600 proves just that one problem is the

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.940 
2600 proves just that one problem is the
controls<00:00:37.239> and<00:00:37.630> you<00:00:37.930> think<00:00:38.170> to<00:00:38.260> yourself<00:00:38.590> how

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
controls and you think to yourself how

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.430 
controls and you think to yourself how
can<00:00:39.190> you<00:00:39.550> that<00:00:39.760> up<00:00:39.790> it's<00:00:40.150> checkers<00:00:40.660> well

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
can you that up it's checkers well

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.229 
can you that up it's checkers well
you<00:00:41.620> can<00:00:41.739> only<00:00:41.860> move<00:00:42.130> the<00:00:42.160> cursor<00:00:42.670> diagonally

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
you can only move the cursor diagonally

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.120 
you can only move the cursor diagonally
and<00:00:43.510> even<00:00:44.170> though<00:00:44.320> you're<00:00:44.559> using<00:00:44.739> a<00:00:44.890> joystick

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
and even though you're using a joystick

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.710 
and even though you're using a joystick
which<00:00:45.489> can<00:00:45.730> easily<00:00:45.910> be<00:00:46.150> moved<00:00:46.480> in<00:00:46.630> that

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
which can easily be moved in that

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.590 
which can easily be moved in that
direction<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:47.800> still<00:00:48.100> awkward<00:00:48.420> why<00:00:49.420> they

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
direction it's still awkward why they

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.910 
direction it's still awkward why they
couldn't<00:00:49.900> just<00:00:49.930> have<00:00:50.170> it<00:00:50.320> exist<00:00:50.620> out<00:00:50.830> of

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
couldn't just have it exist out of

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.250 
couldn't just have it exist out of
neutral<00:00:51.070> spaces<00:00:51.670> beyond<00:00:52.000> me<00:00:52.210> it's<00:00:53.050> not<00:00:53.200> like

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
neutral spaces beyond me it's not like

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.110 
neutral spaces beyond me it's not like
you<00:00:53.470> can<00:00:53.560> cheat<00:00:53.800> in<00:00:53.920> this<00:00:54.070> game<00:00:54.340> and<00:00:54.610> even<00:00:54.940> if

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
you can cheat in this game and even if

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.550 
you can cheat in this game and even if
it's<00:00:55.270> imperative<00:00:55.690> that<00:00:55.840> you<00:00:56.050> don't<00:00:56.260> move<00:00:56.410> the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
it's imperative that you don't move the

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.280 
it's imperative that you don't move the
cursor<00:00:56.980> on<00:00:57.010> inactive<00:00:57.850> spaces<00:00:58.329> god<00:00:58.810> forbid<00:00:59.170> you

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
cursor on inactive spaces god forbid you

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.870 
cursor on inactive spaces god forbid you
do<00:00:59.470> so<00:00:59.800> couldn't<00:01:00.310> you<00:01:00.370> just<00:01:00.579> move<00:01:00.730> the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
do so couldn't you just move the

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.340 
do so couldn't you just move the
joystick<00:01:01.090> up<00:01:01.450> and<00:01:01.600> down<00:01:01.720> and<00:01:01.900> skip<00:01:02.140> those

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
joystick up and down and skip those

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.140 
joystick up and down and skip those
blank<00:01:02.620> spots<00:01:02.980> it<00:01:03.550> would<00:01:03.700> just<00:01:03.850> make<00:01:03.940> things

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
blank spots it would just make things

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.990 
blank spots it would just make things
less<00:01:04.420> sluggish<00:01:04.920> an<00:01:05.920> even<00:01:06.190> bigger<00:01:06.340> problem<00:01:06.850> is

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
less sluggish an even bigger problem is

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.490 
less sluggish an even bigger problem is
how<00:01:07.180> long<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.600> takes<00:01:07.810> for<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.050> computer<00:01:08.410> to

how long it takes for the computer to

difficulties there are nine altogether
the<00:01:12.729> computer<00:01:13.180> takes<00:01:13.420> longer<00:01:13.810> to<00:01:13.930> think<00:01:13.960> and

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
the computer takes longer to think and

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.740 
the computer takes longer to think and

the most advanced mode it could take up

the most advanced mode it could take up
to<00:01:16.780> eight<00:01:16.990> minutes<00:01:17.259> how<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.310> hell<00:01:18.610> could<00:01:18.850> a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
smarter opponent supposedly take so long

I<00:01:23.170> guess<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.160> limited<00:01:24.460> hardware<00:01:24.880> of<00:01:25.149> the<00:01:25.179> 2600

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
I guess the limited hardware of the 2600

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.050 
I guess the limited hardware of the 2600
forces<00:01:26.410> the<00:01:26.560> AI<00:01:26.679> to<00:01:26.860> process<00:01:27.490> through<00:01:27.670> every

possibility before making its decision

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:31.950 
possibility before making its decision
whereas<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.910> dumber<00:01:31.119> opponent<00:01:31.630> doesn't<00:01:31.780> need

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
whereas the dumber opponent doesn't need

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.109 
whereas the dumber opponent doesn't need
to<00:01:32.020> worry<00:01:32.200> about<00:01:32.470> such<00:01:33.039> so<00:01:33.460> a<00:01:33.490> process<00:01:33.940> is

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
to worry about such so a process is

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.630 
to worry about such so a process is
much<00:01:34.270> faster<00:01:34.709> while<00:01:35.709> that's<00:01:35.890> understandable

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.460 
much faster while that's understandable
it<00:01:36.819> makes<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.270> game<00:01:37.479> at<00:01:37.690> these<00:01:37.899> difficulties

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
it makes the game at these difficulties

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.559 
it makes the game at these difficulties

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.469 

there<00:02:07.189> have<00:02:07.369> actually<00:02:07.460> been<00:02:07.759> a<00:02:07.880> decent<00:02:08.119> amount

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
there have actually been a decent amount

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.930 
there have actually been a decent amount
of<00:02:08.569> chess<00:02:08.959> video<00:02:09.319> games<00:02:09.619> but<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:10.190> 1978

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940

release<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.660> video<00:02:11.810> chess<00:02:12.200> may<00:02:12.410> be<00:02:12.470> the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
release of video chess may be the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.490 
release of video chess may be the
earliest<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:14.150> looks<00:02:14.360> like<00:02:14.870> mostly

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
earliest it looks like mostly

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.259 
earliest it looks like mostly
because<00:02:15.680> half<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.069> screen<00:02:16.489> is<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.790> board<00:02:17.030> and

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
because half the screen is the board and

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.809 
because half the screen is the board and
the<00:02:17.599> other<00:02:17.720> half<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.110> complete<00:02:18.470> blue<00:02:18.860> while

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
the other half is complete blue while

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.460 
the other half is complete blue while
the<00:02:19.879> pieces<00:02:20.300> don't<00:02:20.420> look<00:02:20.660> great<00:02:20.840> it's

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
the pieces don't look great it's

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.050 
the pieces don't look great it's
actually<00:02:22.010> amazing<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.459> they're<00:02:22.700> all<00:02:22.819> there

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
actually amazing that they're all there

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.660 
actually amazing that they're all there
as<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.629> 2600<00:02:24.349> had<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.560> limit<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.040> having<00:02:25.459> three

Whitehead thought outside the box and

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.970 
Whitehead thought outside the box and
alternated<00:02:32.780> each<00:02:32.930> pieces<00:02:33.230> position<00:02:33.799> by<00:02:33.920> the

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
how each piece looks slightly different

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.839 
how each piece looks slightly different
than<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.599> piece<00:02:38.810> across<00:02:39.230> from<00:02:39.530> it<00:02:39.640> now<00:02:40.640> while

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
that was a positive move there are still

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.130

issues<00:02:43.459> an<00:02:43.970> issue<00:02:44.239> with<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.480> computer<00:02:44.599> AI

I<00:02:49.910> guess<00:02:50.480> because<00:02:50.720> there's<00:02:50.840> a<00:02:50.900> lot<00:02:51.049> more<00:02:51.170> to

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
I guess because there's a lot more to

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.809 
I guess because there's a lot more to
think<00:02:51.440> about<00:02:51.560> in<00:02:51.799> chess<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.579> the<00:02:52.640> most

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
think about in chess and the most

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.610

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
advanced mode the computer could take up

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.819 
advanced mode the computer could take up
