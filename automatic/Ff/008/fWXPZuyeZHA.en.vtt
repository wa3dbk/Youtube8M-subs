00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.590 
you heard was dispensers and in those
dispensers<00:02:12.950> are<00:02:13.190> essentially<00:02:13.760> more<00:02:14.000> bags<00:02:14.239> and

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
dispensers are essentially more bags and

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.870 
dispensers are essentially more bags and
what<00:02:15.410> those<00:02:15.560> mobs<00:02:15.890> happen<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.400> be<00:02:16.489> villagers

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
what those mobs happen to be villagers

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.120 
what those mobs happen to be villagers
frisk<00:02:17.090> in<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.329> maintenance<00:02:17.870> room<00:02:18.109> so<00:02:18.980> that's

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
frisk in the maintenance room so that's

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.770 
frisk in the maintenance room so that's
quite<00:02:19.430> messy<00:02:19.639> redstone<00:02:20.150> Downey<00:02:20.329> so<00:02:20.600> caught

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
quite messy redstone Downey so caught

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.240 
quite messy redstone Downey so caught
the<00:02:20.870> law<00:02:21.019> over<00:02:21.290> here<00:02:21.470> which<00:02:21.620> is<00:02:21.769> making<00:02:22.010> that

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
the law over here which is making that

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.740 
the law over here which is making that
bubbling<00:02:22.669> noise

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
bubbling noise

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.440 
bubbling noise
but<00:02:24.370> essentially<00:02:25.370> what's<00:02:26.180> going<00:02:26.270> on<00:02:26.630> is<00:02:27.140> I

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
but essentially what's going on is I

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.910 
but essentially what's going on is I
once<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:29.570> press<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.840> button<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:30.230> pulse<00:02:30.530> goes

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
once I press the button a pulse goes

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.960 
once I press the button a pulse goes
through<00:02:31.190> this<00:02:31.430> redstone<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:33.670> hits<00:02:34.670> all<00:02:34.850> these

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
through this redstone and hits all these

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.310 
through this redstone and hits all these
dispensers<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:35.540> then<00:02:35.780> villagers<00:02:36.170> are

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
dispensers and then villagers are

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.050 
dispensers and then villagers are
spawned<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:36.770> they<00:02:36.830> get<00:02:36.980> suffocated<00:02:37.760> in<00:02:37.910> this

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
spawned and they get suffocated in this

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.400 
spawned and they get suffocated in this
one<00:02:38.300> block<00:02:38.660> area<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.750> once<00:02:41.750> they<00:02:41.930> suffocate

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
one block area and once they suffocate

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.620 
one block area and once they suffocate
and<00:02:42.620> once<00:02:42.770> they<00:02:42.890> eventually<00:02:43.040> die<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.630> smoke

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
and once they eventually die the smoke

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.420 
and once they eventually die the smoke
of<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.959> all<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.590> bubbles<00:02:45.800> whatever<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.310> want

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
of the all the bubbles whatever you want

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.420 
of the all the bubbles whatever you want
to<00:02:46.520> call<00:02:46.640> them<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:47.060> their<00:02:47.750> body<00:02:48.010> then<00:02:49.010> emerged

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
to call them of their body then emerged

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.010 
to call them of their body then emerged
through<00:02:50.000> these<00:02:50.240> blocks<00:02:50.570> because<00:02:50.870> they've

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
through these blocks because they've

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.480 
through these blocks because they've
been<00:02:51.140> glitched<00:02:51.470> through<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.800> blocks<00:02:52.040> which

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
been glitched through the blocks which

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.270 
been glitched through the blocks which
is<00:02:52.760> what<00:02:53.270> makes<00:02:53.570> our<00:02:53.750> bubble<00:02:54.080> effect<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:55.070> if<00:02:55.160> I

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
is what makes our bubble effect so if I

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.800 
is what makes our bubble effect so if I
use<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.610> repeater<00:02:55.970> bubbles<00:02:56.510> limiter<00:02:57.350> time

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
use the repeater bubbles limiter time

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.540 
use the repeater bubbles limiter time
you'll<00:02:59.810> hear<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.350> dispensers<00:03:01.070> constantly

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
you'll hear the dispensers constantly

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.640 
you'll hear the dispensers constantly
going<00:03:01.760> off<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.330> if<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:02.810> were<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:03.050> be<00:03:03.140> making<00:03:03.530> a

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
going off and if you were to be making a

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:12.699 
going off and if you were to be making a
video<00:03:04.340> like<00:03:06.370> life<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:07.760> very<00:03:08.720> good<00:03:11.709> steaming

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
video like life is very good steaming

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:13.690 
video like life is very good steaming
hot<00:03:12.950> tub

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
hot tub

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.229 
hot tub
I'm<00:03:14.270> just<00:03:14.930> life<00:03:15.440> is<00:03:15.800> just<00:03:16.040> brilliant<00:03:16.700> from<00:03:17.120> the

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
I'm just life is just brilliant from the

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.590 
I'm just life is just brilliant from the
older<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.660> sun's<00:03:18.110> rising<00:03:18.530> over<00:03:19.040> there<00:03:19.280> oh<00:03:19.600> no

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
older the sun's rising over there oh no

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.820 
older the sun's rising over there oh no
I<00:03:20.630> can<00:03:21.080> fly<00:03:21.700> better<00:03:22.700> yeah<00:03:23.530> now<00:03:24.530> there<00:03:24.680> is<00:03:24.800> one

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
I can fly better yeah now there is one

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.970 
I can fly better yeah now there is one
drawback<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:26.030> this<00:03:26.150> system<00:03:26.780> is<00:03:27.020> that<00:03:27.680> you

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
drawback to this system is that you

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.390 
drawback to this system is that you
can't<00:03:28.489> really<00:03:28.700> stop<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.320> I'm<00:03:30.320> just<00:03:30.500> gonna<00:03:30.620> stop

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
can't really stop it I'm just gonna stop

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.820 
can't really stop it I'm just gonna stop
this<00:03:31.549> and<00:03:32.480> let<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.560> villagers<00:03:36.560> sort

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
this and let the that the villagers sort

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.380 
this and let the that the villagers sort
of<00:03:36.890> eventually<00:03:37.580> die<00:03:37.760> off<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:38.030> can<00:03:38.150> see<00:03:38.269> them

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
of eventually die off you can see them

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.050 
of eventually die off you can see them
all<00:03:38.480> glitching<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.080> that's<00:03:40.070> probably<00:03:40.340> that's

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
all glitching and that's probably that's

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.580 
all glitching and that's probably that's
probably<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.660> only<00:03:41.780> other<00:03:41.870> drawback<00:03:42.380> is<00:03:42.560> that

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
probably the only other drawback is that

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.410 
probably the only other drawback is that
you<00:03:42.830> can<00:03:43.040> actually<00:03:43.220> see<00:03:43.610> them<00:03:43.850> but<00:03:44.000> that's<00:03:44.090> the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
you can actually see them but that's the

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.330 
you can actually see them but that's the
only<00:03:44.510> way<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.720> get<00:03:45.049> the<00:03:45.320> smoke<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:46.010> come

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
only way to get the smoke to come

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.360 
only way to get the smoke to come
through<00:03:46.640> these<00:03:46.790> blocks<00:03:47.739> so<00:03:48.739> that's<00:03:48.890> it<00:03:49.130> really

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
through these blocks so that's it really

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.520 
through these blocks so that's it really
that<00:03:50.060> is<00:03:50.209> the<00:03:50.390> showcase<00:03:50.630> so<00:03:51.110> if<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.320> wanted

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
that is the showcase so if you wanted

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.430 
that is the showcase so if you wanted
all<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.880> repeating<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.299> repeater<00:03:53.959> bubble

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
all the repeating the repeater bubble

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.860 
all the repeating the repeater bubble
time<00:03:54.739> thing<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.540> essentially<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.690> current

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
time thing is essentially the current

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.420 
time thing is essentially the current
comes<00:03:57.200> down<00:03:57.440> here<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:57.709> it<00:03:57.829> goes<00:03:58.010> into<00:03:58.250> this

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
comes down here and it goes into this

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.220 
comes down here and it goes into this
clock<00:03:58.730> because<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.180> repeaters<00:03:59.630> are<00:03:59.780> facing<00:04:00.170> a

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
clock because the repeaters are facing a

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.890 
clock because the repeaters are facing a
certain<00:04:00.590> way<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.940> signal<00:04:02.269> won't<00:04:02.570> travel

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
certain way the signal won't travel

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.890 
certain way the signal won't travel
through<00:04:03.260> here<00:04:03.730> but<00:04:04.730> it's<00:04:05.510> quite<00:04:05.720> awkward

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
through here but it's quite awkward

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.410 
through here but it's quite awkward
because<00:04:06.170> I<00:04:06.350> broke<00:04:06.560> in<00:04:06.820> so<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:07.940> signal<00:04:08.299> will

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
because I broke in so the signal will

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.250 
because I broke in so the signal will
travel<00:04:08.750> through<00:04:09.230> here<00:04:10.150> around<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:11.630> then<00:04:12.140> it

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
travel through here around and then it

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.960 
travel through here around and then it
will<00:04:12.350> go<00:04:12.470> through<00:04:12.500> into<00:04:13.100> all<00:04:13.160> of<00:04:13.190> that<00:04:13.430> circuit

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
will go through into all of that circuit

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.699 
will go through into all of that circuit
this<00:04:14.510> repeater<00:04:14.870> here<00:04:15.170> means<00:04:15.410> someone<00:04:15.680> I

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
this repeater here means someone I

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.949 
this repeater here means someone I
pressed<00:04:16.310> that<00:04:16.489> button<00:04:16.549> if<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.600> signal

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
pressed that button if the signal
