00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.190
 wood pellet is a product 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.619
 industrialist that was created to value 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.380
 sawdust a waste of syria that had 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.000
 few outlets 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.099
 the process consists in drying the 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.660
 sawdust then compact and high 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.120
 pressure additive without adhesive 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.010
 synthesis the finished product looks like 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.050
 solid noodles cut into a section of a 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.489
 half centimeter to fit 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.790
 bristles or power boilers 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.790
 automatic 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.920
 despite the extra cost of this fuel 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.810
 compared to its woodchips 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.460
 ease of use seduces some 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.460
 communities especially in urban areas 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:23.000
 okay also from normand has 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.260
 benefited from an energy audit for 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.900
 dwellings that have been built since 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.720
 the seventies there are 72 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.330
 housing that represents 4200 meters 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.010
 squares to heat up this audit has put in 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.990
 value of things like the boiler room 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.800
 pellet boiler voice and that's what 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.729
 wanted to do 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.800
 habitat north two sÃ¨vres so we had 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.820
 a local here that they did not know that 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.590
 we used for m and the boiler and 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.409
 the silo that stands behind that if they 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.509
 have tasted 32 tons the aids 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.880
 both by the feder in the council 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.060
 Regional Council and the General Council have 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.500
 helped of course to finance this equipment 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.109
 the helpers represent on 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.549
 wholesale installation 50% of 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:09.580
 investment only for what is 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:13.599
 not negligible but for the inhabitants 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.950
 at the level of the cost of heating 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.400
 condemned what they have over the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.200
 difference 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.690
 yes there is a difference there is a 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.879
 difference if we take the gas tariffs 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.610
 currently we are at about 16% 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.629
 savings for the lessee agree 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.160
 I therefore they are well seen 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.410
 directly concerned are directly 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.950
 concerned and ultimately is that your 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.590
 choice 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.140
 the choice of wood as energy was 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.209
 only economic decisions because 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.860
 that this is the only criterion that wants to give way 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.069
 our economic and ecological regions 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.079
 as the time since the granules 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.900
 are delivered here are manufactured is issued 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.870
 local woods it is in business of 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.180
 lined who takes his 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.900
 these softwoods in local forests 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.879
 Poitou Charentes it's just comfort 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.120
 and then the company that delivers us 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.129
 recovers ashes from combustion 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.849
 pellets and we have a sambre rate 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.799
 which is less than 0 5 and 0 5% and 0 5 % 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.599
 tonnage made in the summer knowing 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.810
 that we do between 120 and 130 tons according to 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.239
 various programs and after agreement 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.890
 it's dark we do what 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.069
 they recover and therefore they 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.150
 reacted it is nothing but postponement in 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.739
 the composts he delivers to 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.019
 farmers to increase the rate of 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.810
 phosphorus and potassium 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.609
 so it's an ecological product 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.030
 its human target formula and art to 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:35.640
 silo so that's actually happening al 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.650
 advantage of having a humility rate 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.799
 very very weak which gives him a 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.180
 significant calorific value by 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.480
 compared to more woods suffered rate 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.909
 humidity and 5 to 7% of which we have 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.099
 has a very high calorific value and 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:53.010
 there is a lot of energy in little 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.329
 volume so that we decided at 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.739
 smaller and an investment in 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.840
 departure of civil engineering or less 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.730
 important with wood systems 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.970
 shredded and in addition it's a product 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.139
 very very calibrated there is no 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.660
 surprise at the level of operation 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.520
 since the 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.590
 the small fats are of uniform size 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.210
 and in fact it's an operation that 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.720
 is quite close to the comfort level of 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.720
 that of fuel 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.070
 Oh 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.520
 the wood pellet to the other advantage 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.310
 to be a product with a small footprint 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.900
 for storage and its handling is 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.100
 clean 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.490
 that's why he's very interested in 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.940
 individuals who have chosen this mode of 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.910
 heating 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.950
 a wood pellet stove because 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.480
 when I did build this 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.540
 House 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.980
 recently I wanted to use a 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.960
 renewable energy 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:08.460
 my house is green and I wanted that 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.410
 my heating the maximum care then 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.530
 why pellet rather than wood 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:16.860
 for example because I'm 67 years old and that 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:20.220
 67 years old I do them but at 67 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.890
 years cut wood fetch the 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.380
 charges and bring them two more 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:28.260
 heavy and then otherwise the wood does 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.150
 not long ago was the fire he 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.520
 happened to us with this point of us 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.380
 absent four days by decreasing the 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.020
 temperature we wanted in the 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.470
 house despite the cold outside 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.240
 it worked very well all by itself 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.670
 for four days and so to our 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.680
 turn it was enough to increase it a little 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.440
 little and we found right away 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.450
 the sweet heat that we like it 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.460
 is entirely autonomous apart from the fact 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.980
 that we filling it up for there to be 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.540
 always pellets that bah I the 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.610
 cleans life you do when justin who is 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.569
 also necessary two days to little 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.699
 near 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.229
 obviously the outside temperature 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.659
 and the number of times she goes into 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:10.679
 place but it's not close to 24 hours 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:12.929
 well it is managed entirely alone 

00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:15.449
 ie the second do it 

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:17.759
 start when the temperature that I have 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:21.379
 fixed but more difficult 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:24.409
 it really is really convenient 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:28.669
 warm in every sense of the word 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:32.699
 easy and really I do not regret anything 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:34.080
 in summary despite its extra cost the granule 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:37.069
 the least wood fuel 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.149
 compelling for the user 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:42.240
 it is a low fuel 

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:43.740
 clutter and easy to free and the 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.509
 pellet systems have a very good 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.879
 yield and masters few pollutants 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:50.479
 they are well adapted to the building 

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:50.479
 in urban areas
