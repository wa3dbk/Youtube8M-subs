right now especially knowing t7s coming
up<00:01:11.540> I<00:01:11.720> think<00:01:12.440> his<00:01:12.560> mindset<00:01:12.860> is<00:01:13.010> going<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:13.220> be<00:01:13.310> to

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
up I think his mindset is going to be to

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.680 
up I think his mindset is going to be to
win<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.670> math<00:01:13.850> that<00:01:13.970> he<00:01:14.090> knows<00:01:14.240> he<00:01:14.390> can<00:01:14.540> win
