00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:16.219
 For Naju so that the camera dome to the opposite compa Why 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:21.020
 Maradona said that I shot it, but the subject came out a little red 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:23.580
 Example 2 : Capital is high in the sense that it is a little too big 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.509
 So to understand the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:33.690
 You used the lighting in your photo, but some of the tazs came out. 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:37.440
 Bad body shop eksiah What are you pour more color now Weta season as having also spoken Night 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.750
 Yeah, I'm too dogmatic. 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.920
 It's going out a lot. 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.160
 I did not have a world fan out but I see modeling. 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:52.399
 Come out. 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:55.430
 Do not have modeling, do not have a trumpet , 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:01:00.500
 I will go and explain it again. 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.729
 The color temperature is basically the color is thick when the calendar is low and the cabin is high 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.289
 Give it to me. 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:09.770
 When the waves are cleared, what birds should be mixed to make them white and white . 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:14.710
 The most common sense is to mix red. 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.710
 Yeah, well, it's gotta be attached to the camera. 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:24.900
 Can you think you just turn the tables Conversely No reason 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.000
 Now, the camera has to be set to make it white, 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.280
 I am so going to be protected, 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.740
 For if indeed in the situation I am in fact gotta red elder 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:41.720
 For example, in the vicinity of the situation and we will also set the camera edaga 3200 Calendar 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.720
 I guess it 's white. 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:50.010
 Oh yes 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:55.470
 So the camera because I'm a Table contrary they are bonded protection 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:58.080
 And then, in a situation where the picture is reddish, yes, Kelly. 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.220
 When you get caught in Sacheon 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:08.070
 Yes, so now it turns into a third white color. 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:10.050
 For example, to match that did not it yoge is why this table is flipped opposition 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.200
 The emotion I had received 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.200
 Yes 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.810
 Usually it's my only time. So after shooting, yes. 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.170
 It's not until after I've taken such nice rumors. 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:31.010
 4:00 I shed when I finish them 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.450
 For example, it is acceptable if such increases are literally in its Vista 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.610
 I went to Sinop 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:40.910
 There's nothing special about it because it's just been changed regularly. 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:46.250
 Depending on the performance of the camera's performance men 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.030
 Accepting as much as I can accept then changing the electrical signal about 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.020
 It's in status. 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:56.840
 Because it is a state that has changed, 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:03:01.100
 Whether it's the Nikon Capture or the Easy Fur, 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.270
 Also within the Photoshop program now, I ah this is the color temperature is 5 seconds Act 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.950
 Cabin Doggo 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.590
 So this is how the operation by eliminating some are doing something Court House and anbon 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.840
 I'll put that Regulation Yes 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:18.140
 It's basically set up at the second subsidy. 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.370
 That's right. You can learn basic settings from your armpit. 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.090
 It does not matter. 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.989
 But usually you just fit it in. 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:32.760
 Why do not you try to set up and set up the dye 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:37.240
 It's a little more professional, but its color changes 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.660
 If that is the case, the brightness of the exposure will vary 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:44.830
 For example, you took a picture in red. 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.720
 If you take in a little more bright and also a little bit more comfortably 1 photos itguyo 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.980
 Sometimes it looks dark . 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:56.020
 I do not shoot with exactly the same thing in my work. 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:04:00.310
 There can be a sure thing that the crocodile taken by grasping the exposed what the future 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.210
 Not once change in the microwave and continue also in fact seeing continuing stamped mud geotge 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.680
 I take it. 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:09.610
 But it is known that I see change in the high 54 jildap there 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.860
 That is also another bright nogada How is this yet another lowering Sohn much data is 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.850
 I'm in a state of being. 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:21.220
 There are dark cases where you have to use this for normal use . 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:25.570
 Most likely that would be easy even on top of wedding photography 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.570
 It is a product from the new album wedding date as a prostitute pure white is very white 5 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:33.070
 Gotta have my wife bomeo light Oh well 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:39.250
 Lots eotteotgetnya off her tight undertaken Then the it.I just a little light 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:40.870
 I told the ganghaedo dress very white and so is the little dong 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.930
 I'll write a script for a wedding studio. 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:48.280
 The original picture is very dark. 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.170
 Of course, I do not care about these guys because I'm busy 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.940
 However, 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:58.870
 The reason why the vehicle is dark is when it comes to the outside, 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.480
 If the oil is dark, I can save it all day. 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.900
 Your face is clear. Just calibrate. 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:08.290
 4 Anyway, it's time to do something . 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:13.180
 So you can fix it a little now, but you dress white. 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:17.710
 If you discard it, you will not be able to protect the data later . 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:21.520
 Most of the wedding straps are mother-of- pearl . 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:25.230
 4.5 Now that the professional has taken a picture like this, 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.230
 Is it because of the reason 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.820
 oo ah ah 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.820
 to a
