00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
there's actually see if I can get this

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.849 
there's actually see if I can get this
in<00:03:00.859> the<00:03:01.099> light<00:03:01.510> actually<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.560> fusion<00:03:03.560> reactor

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
in the light actually a fusion reactor

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:09.699 
in the light actually a fusion reactor
core<00:03:06.280> it's<00:03:07.280> not<00:03:07.459> happening<00:03:08.199> anyways<00:03:09.199> the<00:03:09.469> gun

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
core it's not happening anyways the gun

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:16.809 
core it's not happening anyways the gun
spins<00:03:10.159> 360<00:03:11.150> degrees<00:03:14.980> sorry<00:03:15.980> it's<00:03:16.189> pretty<00:03:16.280> new

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
spins 360 degrees sorry it's pretty new

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.300 
spins 360 degrees sorry it's pretty new
I'm<00:03:17.359> sure<00:03:17.629> bright<00:03:18.169> Sun<00:03:18.439> it'll<00:03:18.650> spin<00:03:18.919> easier

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
I'm sure bright Sun it'll spin easier

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.890 
I'm sure bright Sun it'll spin easier
goes<00:03:20.180> up<00:03:20.449> and<00:03:20.629> down<00:03:20.720> about<00:03:21.500> 90<00:03:21.889> degrees<00:03:22.900> these

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
goes up and down about 90 degrees these

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.520 
goes up and down about 90 degrees these
flaps<00:03:24.500> on<00:03:24.739> either<00:03:24.889> side<00:03:25.220> open<00:03:25.639> up<00:03:26.259> then<00:03:27.259> in<00:03:27.409> the

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
flaps on either side open up then in the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.599 
flaps on either side open up then in the
back<00:03:27.879> you<00:03:28.879> can<00:03:28.909> see<00:03:29.259> goes<00:03:30.259> up<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.930> uh<00:03:33.609> honestly

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
back you can see goes up so uh honestly

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.449 
back you can see goes up so uh honestly
I<00:03:34.759> think<00:03:34.909> for<00:03:35.479> the<00:03:35.599> play<00:03:35.840> aspect<00:03:36.409> of<00:03:36.590> it<00:03:36.739> put

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
I think for the play aspect of it put

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.479 
I think for the play aspect of it put
not<00:03:37.669> um<00:03:38.209> having<00:03:39.019> an<00:03:39.079> open<00:03:39.379> sides<00:03:39.590> nice<00:03:39.919> but<00:03:40.310> for

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
not um having an open sides nice but for

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.920 
not um having an open sides nice but for
display<00:03:40.849> aspect<00:03:41.329> I<00:03:41.449> think<00:03:41.479> would<00:03:41.750> have<00:03:41.840> been

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
display aspect I think would have been

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.259 
display aspect I think would have been
nice<00:03:42.109> of<00:03:42.319> them<00:03:42.439> to<00:03:42.500> at<00:03:42.739> least<00:03:42.909> include<00:03:43.909> another

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
nice of them to at least include another

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.420 
nice of them to at least include another
one<00:03:44.509> of<00:03:44.629> these<00:03:44.780> big<00:03:45.019> solid<00:03:45.530> side<00:03:45.739> pieces<00:03:46.069> just

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
one of these big solid side pieces just

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.319 
one of these big solid side pieces just
see<00:03:46.609> if<00:03:46.669> we<00:03:46.729> close<00:03:46.970> it<00:03:47.180> off<00:03:47.799> but<00:03:48.799> overall<00:03:49.329> I

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
see if we close it off but overall I

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.339 
see if we close it off but overall I
would<00:03:50.930> give<00:03:51.319> this<00:03:51.349> set<00:03:51.919> for<00:03:52.639> kids<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.509> 9<00:03:54.079> out<00:03:54.319> of

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
would give this set for kids a 9 out of

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.709 
would give this set for kids a 9 out of
10<00:03:54.680> there's<00:03:55.069> a<00:03:55.129> lot<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.340> playability<00:03:55.879> it's<00:03:56.599> not

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:56.719 
10 there's a lot of playability it's not

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.099 
10 there's a lot of playability it's not
easily<00:03:57.139> broken<00:03:57.259> and<00:03:58.540> for<00:03:59.540> adults<00:03:59.810> I'd

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
easily broken and for adults I'd

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.439 
easily broken and for adults I'd
probably<00:04:00.379> give<00:04:00.709> it<00:04:00.739> a<00:04:01.009> seven<00:04:01.430> out<00:04:01.639> of<00:04:01.669> 10<00:04:01.969> um

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:02.449 
probably give it a seven out of 10 um

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.749 
probably give it a seven out of 10 um
it's<00:04:03.349> very<00:04:03.469> good<00:04:03.680> for<00:04:03.739> display<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.549> only

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:04.759 
it's very good for display the only

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:06.369 
it's very good for display the only
problem<00:04:05.180> is<00:04:05.299> with<00:04:05.479> the<00:04:05.569> air<00:04:05.719> assault<00:04:06.139> gun

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
problem is with the air assault gun

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.849 
problem is with the air assault gun
there's<00:04:06.889> that<00:04:07.129> large<00:04:07.340> open<00:04:07.819> side<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.419> so<00:04:09.379> not

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
there's that large open side and so not

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.300 
there's that large open side and so not
great<00:04:10.069> for<00:04:10.430> display<00:04:11.090> for<00:04:11.419> adults<00:04:11.889> at<00:04:12.889> least<00:04:13.129> on

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
great for display for adults at least on

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.849 
great for display for adults at least on
the<00:04:13.400> air<00:04:13.549> assault<00:04:13.879> gun<00:04:14.090> part<00:04:14.329> of<00:04:14.449> it<00:04:14.859> overall

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
the air assault gun part of it overall

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.890 
the air assault gun part of it overall
for<00:04:15.889> all<00:04:16.459> ages<00:04:17.030> I'd<00:04:17.150> probably<00:04:17.389> give<00:04:17.690> this

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
for all ages I'd probably give this

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.699 
for all ages I'd probably give this
rating<00:04:18.620> of<00:04:18.769> eight<00:04:19.250> out<00:04:19.519> of<00:04:19.549> ten<00:04:19.880> 8.5<00:04:20.709> very

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
rating of eight out of ten 8.5 very

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.060 
rating of eight out of ten 8.5 very
great<00:04:22.039> set<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:22.840> they're<00:04:23.840> just<00:04:24.020> keep<00:04:24.800> getting

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
great set and they're just keep getting

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.320 
great set and they're just keep getting
a<00:04:25.130> lot<00:04:25.250> better<00:04:25.279> with<00:04:25.639> their<00:04:25.760> scopes<00:04:26.090> and

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
a lot better with their scopes and

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.800 
a lot better with their scopes and
everything

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
figures and so I have to say it's one of

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.860 
figures and so I have to say it's one of
my<00:04:30.620> favorite<00:04:31.040> sets<00:04:31.280> they've<00:04:31.520> made<00:04:31.870> please
