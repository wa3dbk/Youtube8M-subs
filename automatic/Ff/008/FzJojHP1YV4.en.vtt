you're holding toward the opponent or

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.130 
you're holding toward the opponent or
they're<00:01:02.820> actually<00:01:03.149> really<00:01:03.180> bad<00:01:03.719> they're

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
they're actually really bad they're

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.459

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
but they're just really really hard to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.160 
but they're just really really hard to
land<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:12.289> they're<00:01:13.289> just<00:01:13.560> not<00:01:13.709> useful<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:15.170> so

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170

do it with vladi because his strength so
that's<00:01:56.700> that's<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.389> good<00:01:57.569> thing<00:01:57.749> as<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.619> can

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
that's that's a good thing as you can

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.429 
that's that's a good thing as you can
see<00:01:58.859> I<00:01:58.889> lands<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.520> bomb<00:01:59.999> overhand<00:02:00.899> rights<00:02:01.200> and

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
see I lands to bomb overhand rights and

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.940 
see I lands to bomb overhand rights and
a<00:02:01.499> huge<00:02:02.209> Superman<00:02:03.209> right<00:02:03.479> there<00:02:03.719> rock<00:02:04.109> him<00:02:04.380> but

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
a huge Superman right there rock him but

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.889 
a huge Superman right there rock him but
the<00:02:05.069> round<00:02:05.369> oh<00:02:05.789> actually<00:02:06.179> the<00:02:06.389> round<00:02:06.569> wasn't

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
the round oh actually the round wasn't

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.210 
the round oh actually the round wasn't
coming<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.169> an<00:02:07.259> end<00:02:07.349> there<00:02:07.529> he<00:02:07.679> just<00:02:08.039> got<00:02:08.099> out

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
coming to an end there he just got out

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.979 
coming to an end there he just got out
of<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.580> because<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.789> was<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.000> first<00:02:09.239> rock<00:02:09.450> um

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
of that because I was the first rock um

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.640 
of that because I was the first rock um
I<00:02:11.480> think<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.690> other<00:02:12.810> thing<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.110> Vladimir

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
I think the other thing that Vladimir

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.340 
I think the other thing that Vladimir
has<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> really<00:02:14.730> high<00:02:15.030> submission<00:02:15.930> defense

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
has is a really high submission defense

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.820 
has is a really high submission defense
so

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
so

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.860 
so
that's<00:02:17.580> kind<00:02:17.850> of<00:02:17.940> good<00:02:18.090> there's<00:02:18.420> no<00:02:18.570> one<00:02:18.750> in

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
that's kind of good there's no one in

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.110 
that's kind of good there's no one in
light<00:02:19.140> heavyweight<00:02:19.710> who<00:02:19.980> has<00:02:20.430> like

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
light heavyweight who has like

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.960 
light heavyweight who has like
incredibly<00:02:21.960> crazy<00:02:22.470> submission<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:23.490> it's<00:02:23.730> not

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
incredibly crazy submission so it's not

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.270 
incredibly crazy submission so it's not
that<00:02:24.330> big<00:02:24.570> of<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.780> deal<00:02:24.930> but<00:02:25.200> it's<00:02:25.740> always<00:02:25.950> nice

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
that big of a deal but it's always nice

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.780 
that big of a deal but it's always nice
against<00:02:26.970> calf's<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.750> guess<00:02:28.260> if<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.680> if<00:02:29.520> you

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
against calf's I guess if you if you

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.780 
against calf's I guess if you if you
wanted<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.210> try<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.660> out<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:31.460> yeah<00:02:32.460> other

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
wanted to try that out but yeah other

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.350 
wanted to try that out but yeah other
than<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.720> is<00:02:34.020> his<00:02:34.400> stats<00:02:35.400> are<00:02:35.640> really<00:02:36.060> too

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
than that is his stats are really too

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.150 
than that is his stats are really too
crazy<00:02:36.930> but<00:02:37.350> that's<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.710> end<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.950> first

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
crazy but that's the end of the first

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.130 
crazy but that's the end of the first
round<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:38.910> we're<00:02:39.390> going<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.600> go<00:02:39.750> ahead<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.080> cut

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
round so we're going to go ahead and cut

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.050 
round so we're going to go ahead and cut
into<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.650> second<00:02:41.130> round<00:02:41.280> right<00:02:42.260> here<00:02:43.820> in<00:02:44.820> this
