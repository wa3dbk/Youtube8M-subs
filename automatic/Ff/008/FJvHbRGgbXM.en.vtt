00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.990
 I do not have any problems looking for me 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:11.649
 year 

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:17.179
 we can not fail to notice the size of the neck of graces when 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:18.890
 we detected a zoo 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.890
 but because they are almost as long 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:27.429
 necks and facts should not generate queues experience his client - like 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.529
 one preferably the highest leaves of the trees 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.550
 which are difficult for other animals other areas 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.570
 so can regattas that they can quietly explore 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.200
 leaves located more than three meters high 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.200
 without competitors 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.090
 and choose the best even in dry weather in the week 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.730
 when there is a shortage of resources 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.030
 only needy girls with length up to 40 centimeters 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.840
 then able to pick up leaves on the highest branches even in three large 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.340
 expenditures of acacias its main source of food in nature 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.840
 we can observe in the long neck help in the survival of the generations 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.749
 because it greatly reduces the competition for food in which they have grown 

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:19.240
 animals 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.060
 anarchists, the French naturalist who is evidently 44 years old has been 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.520
 stuck on 29 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.910
 explained the long neck of generation by theory 12 18 according to people 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.910
 the first generations had a short neck 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.410
 but as those who wore collars were the highest of the wta 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.000
 because it was the only element left in the field said skaf 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.390
 were strengthening and stretching the neck until it became well 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.730
 long 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.110
 This new feature acquired with much effort is so 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.010
 your puppies 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.010
 here they would be born with longer necks 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.829
 peter with me will this terrorist certain 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.840
 if it is correct then if you want artur son more muscular is just 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.560
 look a lot until you can see the muscles and then when your child 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.560
 born will already be muscular 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.879
 so if you want your arm and grow more 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.559
 to reach that cookie pack on the top of the cupboard this long 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:25.029
 fight every day 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:28.309
 until the desired size arrives 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:31.929
 milton you think the theory of lamarck the party 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.869
 probably you said no 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:43.029
 from the English naturalist who leads from 1809 to 1882 did not agree with the 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:47.409
 brand and proposed another explanation based on the theory of natural selection 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:54.010
 second w there were giraffes with necks the longest in others with the neck 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:56.909
 more goals than they lived together 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.120
 but in the time of food shortage when they charged the most 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.590
 tall trees that had the largest neck could feed themselves 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:10.230
 better and survive longer to make them more visible 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.209
 the pups then they would give the same characteristics of the parents most 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.969
 they would have a longer neck 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:23.509
 until after a time all that population in general transfer neck 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:26.749
 long 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:30.159
 and now the theory is right 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.839
 most scientists believe yes and this common way of thinking when 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.499
 we are talking about today's evolution
