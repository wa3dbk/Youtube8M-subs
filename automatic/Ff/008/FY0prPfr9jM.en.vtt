00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the battery goes right there probably an

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.670 
the battery goes right there probably an
older<00:01:30.240> adult<00:01:30.570> would<00:01:30.780> need<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.079> help<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.470> put

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840
