of products from a company called Orrico
so<00:00:06.660> basically<00:00:07.529> their<00:00:07.770> design<00:00:08.099> philosophy<00:00:08.670> is

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
so basically their design philosophy is

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.089 
so basically their design philosophy is
they<00:00:09.540> give<00:00:09.750> you<00:00:09.929> these<00:00:10.110> flat<00:00:10.500> sheets<00:00:10.889> of

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
they give you these flat sheets of

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.249 
they give you these flat sheets of
sturdy<00:00:11.790> polypropylene<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.690> they're<00:00:13.019> pre

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
sturdy polypropylene and they're pre

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.570 
sturdy polypropylene and they're pre
score<00:00:13.530> with<00:00:13.679> these<00:00:13.799> fold<00:00:14.070> marks<00:00:14.370> right<00:00:14.519> here

score with these fold marks right here
and<00:00:14.820> then<00:00:14.910> basically<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.480> use<00:00:16.020> origami<00:00:16.320> to

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
and then basically you use origami to

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.800 
and then basically you use origami to
fold<00:00:17.190> these<00:00:17.340> into<00:00:17.850> different<00:00:18.240> types<00:00:18.690> of

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
fold these into different types of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
these and I snatched not because they

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.479 
these and I snatched not because they
were<00:00:54.239> cheap<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.860> thought<00:00:56.100> I'd<00:00:56.219> should<00:00:56.370> this

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
were cheap and I thought I'd should this

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.260 
were cheap and I thought I'd should this
review<00:00:56.899> anyways<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:59.010> take<00:00:59.579> these<00:00:59.760> out<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
review anyways I just take these out and

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.099 
review anyways I just take these out and
fold<00:01:00.510> them<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:00.809> you

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
fold them for you

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.599 
fold them for you
these<00:01:01.379> are<00:01:01.500> actually<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> old<00:01:02.010> models<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.489> if

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
these are actually the old models so if

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.030 
these are actually the old models so if
you<00:01:02.730> look<00:01:03.030> at<00:01:03.270> say<00:01:03.780> Sierra<00:01:04.199> Trading<00:01:04.379> Post<00:01:04.559> and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
you look at say Sierra Trading Post and

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.190 
you look at say Sierra Trading Post and
other<00:01:05.460> websites<00:01:06.119> they're<00:01:06.570> gonna<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:06.840> moving

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
other websites they're gonna be moving

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.500 
other websites they're gonna be moving
out<00:01:07.290> these<00:01:07.590> older<00:01:08.010> versions<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:09.150> much

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
out these older versions for much

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.330 
out these older versions for much
cheaper<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.260> newer<00:01:10.470> versions<00:01:10.920> instead<00:01:11.250> of

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
cheaper the newer versions instead of

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.830 
cheaper the newer versions instead of
having<00:01:11.520> flaps<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.510> insert

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
having flaps that you have to insert

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.899 
having flaps that you have to insert
they'll<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.530> snaps<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.460> it'll<00:01:14.640> be<00:01:14.729> much

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
they'll have snaps so it'll be much

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.390 
they'll have snaps so it'll be much
quicker<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.570> much<00:01:15.900> easier<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.320> fold<00:01:16.650> if<00:01:17.130> you

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
quicker and much easier to fold if you

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.620 
quicker and much easier to fold if you
want<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.759> convenience<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.270> might<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.540> to

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
want the convenience you might have to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.490 
want the convenience you might have to
pay<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> little<00:01:18.900> bit<00:01:19.020> more<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.290> get<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
pay a little bit more to get the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.870 
pay a little bit more to get the
versions<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> snaps<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.490> didn't<00:01:20.729> really

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
versions with the snaps I didn't really

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.840 
versions with the snaps I didn't really
care<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:22.070> didn't<00:01:23.070> feel<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.490> would<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
care I didn't feel that it would be a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.850 
care I didn't feel that it would be a
big<00:01:24.270> difference<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.650> got<00:01:25.770> these

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
big difference but I just got these

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.350 
big difference but I just got these
versions<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:26.700> they<00:01:26.850> were<00:01:26.939> cheap<00:01:27.180> I

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
versions just because they were cheap I

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.730 
versions just because they were cheap I
mean<00:01:27.509> they've<00:01:27.630> worked<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:27.960> as<00:01:28.110> well<00:01:28.259> however

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
mean they've worked just as well however

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.050 
mean they've worked just as well however
if<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.040> want<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.250> snaps<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.670> pay<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> little

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
if you want the snaps just pay a little

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.160 
if you want the snaps just pay a little
bit<00:01:30.150> more<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.570> not<00:01:30.689> gonna<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.049> much

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
bit more it's not gonna be that much

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.230 
bit more it's not gonna be that much
more<00:01:31.229> expensive<00:01:31.530> I'll<00:01:32.040> post<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> pricings<00:01:33.090> up

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
more expensive I'll post the pricings up

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.899 
more expensive I'll post the pricings up
on<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.720> information<00:01:34.680> sidebar<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.549> let<00:01:35.850> me

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
on the information sidebar so let me

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.730 
on the information sidebar so let me
just<00:01:36.090> fold<00:01:36.750> these<00:01:36.869> up<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.439> give<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.650> an

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
just fold these up just to give you an

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.289 
just fold these up just to give you an
idea<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.009> how<00:01:38.159> these<00:01:38.310> works<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.820> have<00:01:39.210> this

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
idea of how these works so you have this

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.380 
idea of how these works so you have this
flat<00:01:39.570> sheet<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:40.530> pretty<00:01:41.189> thin<00:01:41.430> I'd<00:01:42.150> say

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
flat sheet it's pretty thin I'd say

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.999 
flat sheet it's pretty thin I'd say
that's<00:01:42.600> about<00:01:42.810> as<00:01:43.079> thick<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.680> don't<00:01:43.950> know

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
that's about as thick as I don't know

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.800 
that's about as thick as I don't know
anyway<00:01:44.310> we're<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.549> 10<00:01:44.939> sheets<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.329> regular

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
anyway we're like 10 sheets of regular

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.620 
anyway we're like 10 sheets of regular
a4<00:01:46.500> size<00:01:46.710> paper<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.549> when<00:01:48.180> they're<00:01:48.299> not<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.450> use

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
a4 size paper so when they're not in use

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.770 
a4 size paper so when they're not in use
you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.020> pack<00:01:49.170> them<00:01:49.350> into<00:01:49.530> say<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.780> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
you can just pack them into say the the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.109 
you can just pack them into say the the
pouch<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:53.009> hydration<00:01:53.310> pouch<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.880> your

flat area as a cutting board works great

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.259 
flat area as a cutting board works great
for<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.769> that's<00:02:32.430> another<00:02:32.670> use<00:02:32.880> together

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
for that so that's another use together

for that so that's another use together
for<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.940> plate<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:37.019> cup<00:02:37.260> is

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
for that so that is the plate the cup is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.809 
for that so that is the plate the cup is
a<00:02:37.470> little<00:02:37.709> bit<00:02:37.799> more<00:02:37.890> complicated<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.610> lot<00:02:38.700> of

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
a little bit more complicated a lot of

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.130 
a little bit more complicated a lot of
people<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.150> complained<00:02:39.540> about<00:02:39.660> folding<00:02:40.049> the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
people have complained about folding the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.650 
people have complained about folding the
cup<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.319> because<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.799> has<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.950> lot<00:02:41.130> more<00:02:41.160> folds

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
cup just because it has a lot more folds

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.390 
cup just because it has a lot more folds
but<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.900> don't<00:02:43.170> think<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.380> should<00:02:43.680> be<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:44.069> vanish

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
but I don't think it should be to vanish

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.120 
but I don't think it should be to vanish
take<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.150> area<00:02:45.450> fold<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:46.319> up<00:02:46.500> here<00:02:46.799> all

take this area fold this up here all

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.460 
take this area fold this up here all
this<00:02:48.530> insert<00:02:49.530> just<00:02:50.519> flap<00:02:51.150> into<00:02:51.930> here<00:02:52.260> so

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
this insert just flap into here so

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.970 
this insert just flap into here so
that's<00:02:53.370> one<00:02:53.580> side<00:02:54.230> here<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.380> fold<00:02:55.620> this<00:02:55.799> over

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
that's one side here you fold this over

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.569 
that's one side here you fold this over
here<00:02:56.340> here<00:02:57.299> surf<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.140> flap<00:02:58.410> underneath

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.100 

there<00:03:02.579> push<00:03:03.090> this<00:03:03.239> into<00:03:03.480> turn<00:03:03.750> into<00:03:03.989> the

there push this into turn into the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.220 
there push this into turn into the
handle<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:05.040> there<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.280> go<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.640> got<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.790> cup

pretty nice pretty easy and as a nice

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.789 
pretty nice pretty easy and as a nice
touch<00:03:08.730> they<00:03:09.180> put<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.840> capacity<00:03:10.470> of<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.650> cup

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
touch they put the capacity of the cup

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.190 
touch they put the capacity of the cup
here<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.220> got<00:03:11.340> ounces<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.060> cups<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:12.690> this

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
here you got ounces and cups so this

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.470 
here you got ounces and cups so this
holds<00:03:13.410> 12<00:03:14.130> fluid<00:03:14.310> ounces<00:03:14.519> or<00:03:15.000> one<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.299> half

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
holds 12 fluid ounces or one and a half

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.759 
holds 12 fluid ounces or one and a half
cups<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.049> on<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.230> other<00:03:16.319> side<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.680> got

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
cups and on the other side you got

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.849 
cups and on the other side you got
metric<00:03:17.100> so<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:17.790> says<00:03:18.000> 400<00:03:18.600> mils<00:03:18.750> that's<00:03:19.590> great

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
metric so it says 400 mils that's great

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.280 
metric so it says 400 mils that's great
so<00:03:20.280> with<00:03:21.209> something<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.600> packs<00:03:21.810> completely

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
so with something that packs completely

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.759 
so with something that packs completely
flat

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
flat

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.370 
flat
it<00:03:23.030> weighs<00:03:24.030> next<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.389> nothing<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:25.109> it's
