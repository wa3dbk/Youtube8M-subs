was<00:02:55.930> seen<00:02:56.230> at<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.680> length<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.370> was<00:02:57.489> really<00:02:57.760> a

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
was seen at the length it was really a

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.410 
was seen at the length it was really a
chance<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:58.900> do<00:02:59.109> the<00:02:59.200> Jew<00:02:59.379> comes<00:02:59.680> and<00:03:00.389> due<00:03:01.389> to

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
chance to do the Jew comes and due to

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.170 
chance to do the Jew comes and due to
the<00:03:01.689> fact<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:02.079> our<00:03:02.349> rosters<00:03:03.180> rapidly

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
the fact that our rosters rapidly

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.819 
the fact that our rosters rapidly
growing<00:03:04.389> there's<00:03:04.689> like<00:03:04.810> four<00:03:05.109> commentators

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
growing there's like four commentators

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.589 
growing there's like four commentators
which<00:03:06.489> means<00:03:06.700> I<00:03:06.790> was<00:03:06.879> only<00:03:06.939> going<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.239> get<00:03:07.359> one

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
which means I was only going to get one

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.069 
which means I was only going to get one
a<00:03:08.459> comet<00:03:09.459> tree<00:03:09.579> up<00:03:09.700> every<00:03:10.030> month<00:03:10.329> so<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:10.810> think

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
a comet tree up every month so I think

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.110 
a comet tree up every month so I think
it'd<00:03:11.200> be<00:03:11.349> so<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.650> thought<00:03:11.950> there's<00:03:12.760> really<00:03:12.909> no

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
it'd be so I thought there's really no

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.110 
it'd be so I thought there's really no
point<00:03:13.329> in<00:03:13.480> me<00:03:13.629> in<00:03:14.129> having<00:03:15.129> to<00:03:15.220> do<00:03:15.340> that<00:03:15.400> but<00:03:16.060> I

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
point in me in having to do that but I

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.689 
point in me in having to do that but I
see<00:03:16.389> I<00:03:16.419> found<00:03:16.629> the<00:03:16.870> after<00:03:17.319> lift<00:03:17.590> up<00:03:17.889> both<00:03:18.489> have

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:18.699 
see I found the after lift up both have

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.520 
see I found the after lift up both have
the<00:03:18.849> chance<00:03:19.090> do<00:03:19.359> these<00:03:19.480> sort<00:03:20.139> of<00:03:20.169> things<00:03:20.230> are

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
the chance do these sort of things are

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.220
