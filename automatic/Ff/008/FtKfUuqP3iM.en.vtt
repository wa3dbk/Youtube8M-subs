00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:10.170
 this is mine and welcome yes 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.389
 here and now two children 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.000
 surprise eggs that are special 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.640
 The girls can be recognized by the color 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.470
 top tip the girls are all like that 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.220
 Say with this girl color now 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.710
 in quotation marks and 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.080
 for comparison, a normal agreement 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.059
 capital has its just not the star 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.260
 That's the packaging 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.329
 then i really no star no 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.390
 normal everywhere more about the comparison 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.920
 to show again in any case so 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.620
 Look at the girls of a beautiful girl 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:50.969
 us first a a4 scrap in there 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.160
 here could actually be figures 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.360
 let's start with the scrap suspected 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.070
 to open and the whole here 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.280
 we tear with the iphone body 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.019
 so beautiful delicious chocolate looks on 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.760
 a skilful grip we see the yellow 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.020
 from the egg and here comes the renewed 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.500
 shakes it does not sound right now 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:19.020
 more could be a figure so bad 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:27.750
 and yes it is not much clock it is 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:32.159
 ariel the leaflets these figures 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.740
 There are already jasmine and bell 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.390
 I have and now I have too 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.119
 Ariel I think I already have 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.670
 double 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.740
 well 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.820
 first of all we need it there 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.640
 ariel 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.830
 She is a great singer and loves 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.439
 her independence sometimes affects her 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.649
 a bit prickly and stubborn though 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:56.530
 she is also very brave yes that's ariel 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.570
 and that always makes me happy when I have one 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.810
 I found small text to read aloud 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.320
 that should be with every figure and the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.509
 number is of course also 139 and 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.800
 ariel is in three parts we have one 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:15.400
 Ariel and her fins will be 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:23.019
 because you have to put together here too 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:25.600
 be careful you have to enter 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:33.720
 Apply a little force and then come 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:36.100
 ariel out here on this stone 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.290
 but again, it looks as if 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:43.980
 you can muster a little bit of strength here 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:48.120
 I do not have to understand it that way yet 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.120
 I want to break something here 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:58.120
 so pure crushed should also be like that 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.830
 hard to recognize how exactly or 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.900
 from other side near from other side 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.150
 It can not be it or not 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.680
 Throwing a page has been quite possible 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.129
 easy 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.140
 Maria here it looks like that's her 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.540
 on her stone the figure almost 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.579
 broken because I just do not 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.250
 looked at the note so she sees 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.540
 out 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.810
 and yes with her beautiful red 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.209
 who knows the movie or rather 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.340
 the disney strip ariel the first part 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.720
 is still the best and i believe 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.180
 There was also a second one when we did that 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.780
 just not sure in any case the 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.489
 first part was really good 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.980
 even there is a new and a 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.470
 old synchro so if you are an old and 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.819
 a new synchronization version and 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.040
 even there I have to say the old one 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:51.549
 Sync version I found just 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:58.840
 he's better off that, that's it 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:04:01.299
 Ariel on that was my little no stop 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.700
 people's something I have to say 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.829
 you still a few leagues where I the 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.549
 had a suspicion on a figure how is it 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:15.250
 yes , that sounds like a figure too 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:17.019
 it would be time to pack properly position spring 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.639
 Also do not throw away kuechenblick.de 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.260
 to keep 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:24.099
 Here we also look a skilful grip 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.120
 but the ice stubbornly there 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.120
 we have the money over again 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.370
 That sounds like a puzzle but it is 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.860
 no puzzle it's one of those yes it is 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.629
 one of these rotor of the 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:47.979
 For the sake of completeness, that shows now 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:49.150
 one more time 51 of these toys ft 0 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.090
 73 a 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:57.250
 the whole thing works very simple and 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:05:01.360
 pull on this gyro and let it 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:12.009
 then on the table or somewhere else 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:15.219
 that's not a bit more dancing 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:17.080
 more on says that was the highlight ariel 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.310
 right in the first and I will be myself 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.840
 of course, the super 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.610
 to enjoy delicious chocolate 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.800
 that was it from me i hope you had 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.479
 Write fun the comments are in it 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.479
 See you next time 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.620
 the
