 because I'm proud to have such 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.280
 relationship with the Brest public and I 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.370
 thank him very much for that 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.430
 you from your Brest period especially from the 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.440
 good memory no during the three years 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.970
 was here in 3 min we felt very 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.420
 well here we know more we did 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.420
 a lot of friends 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:40.399
 especially makes the time really pass 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.399
 it is the most important 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.229
 I found everything so I know you have 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.039
 did you finally make a 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.840
 try arles avignon 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.850
 how did it go it was not a 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.380
 try it was just because the coach 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.409
 called me and I signed the plane 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.810
 so I 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.609
 I said that I could go down 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:14.209
 underneath to see the facilities in 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:15.620
 the city ​​and all that we know you 're 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.640
 Well Brittany region 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.480
 what did you think of the region 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.010
 around in the video 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.810
 during the duration of the t jump it is very 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.050
 hot so it's sure the climate 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.050
 trades 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.750
 but the city is very beautiful so I say 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.160
 just in downtown avignon and 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.900
 I guess it is a beautiful area 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.410
 so do you have contacts with 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.200
 other clubs 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.530
 yes there are not yet of course 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.570
 but these are also contacts as long as 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.740
 art is assigned 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.100
 does the fact that you speak five 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.560
 languages 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:57.330
 it can help to find a good club 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.140
 sure i'm not fooled invented i change 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.140
 to change 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.660
 even if I had to go to a country 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.030
 whose language I do not speak yet I 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.960
 would not be against I think the base 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:23.240
 okay is what you have in a 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.240
 corner of the head the world 2014 with 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:36.360
 the already delicate team so I was in 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.980
 national team when I was at the beginning 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.200
 if after that because I will be titular 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.580
 to install the markets is good 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.950
 so here was all the assets 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.950
 to be there since 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.720

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.180
 compatriot thomas smith heat yes that 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.190

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.190
 city tour and Buczek trawls 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:10.350
 facilities side football is what you 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.220

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.430
 Brest especially thanks for these three 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.940

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.320
 I will never forget them and that's for sure 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.160
 as I say that a relationship between me 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.160

 professional at the highest level 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:35.670
 whoever deserves it and maybe also 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.100
 a day to settle down just link 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.330
 but in a regular basis which is this 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.190
 that you think that the Brest Stadium can 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:49.330
 make a good season 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:51.070
