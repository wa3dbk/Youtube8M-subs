 [Music] 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.280
 hi to all and is it 007 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.030
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:20.130
 little tutorial video so it's for in 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.260
 does so for this style of problem so 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.880
 windows errors so explorer 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.550
 windows and stop working by 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.640
 example it can be there instead you 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.390
 can be other than what you want 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.239
 so you have an application not a 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.010
 application it does not work what 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.260
 I eat a little cold so a 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.200
 application that and that it does work 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.600
 no bath or follow this tutorial is 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.070
 logically it should work so 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.750
 so so to start this tutorial well 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.850
 just to make it work 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.180
 you will have to go to the menu 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.210
 start 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.149
 after you have to go here so on 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.710
 the picture here after you will do 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.670
 manage to our account 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.189
 yes here is me here I did a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.600
 tale to avoid so I'm not going to 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.580
 desert killed because I'm afraid that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.619
 all my data about you so the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.810
 logical you have the fan account fans 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.009
 or there so he will ask you to 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.810
 activated so there you'll activate it or 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.689
 then you can have a new one created 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.740
 so here here is administrators 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.570
 it's much better 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.090
 there you put the ofppt lepleux the thing 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.540
 after you make an account so 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:44.520
 so here I want to delete it so 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.670

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.240
 in the hard drive like here I did 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.960
 well, that was to put on the 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.060
 modes your so with this game there or so 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.600
 you can go directly into your 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.269
 programs 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.690

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:22.870
 weed so here for that one hop weeds 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.860
 here is here I have my application you 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.470

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.500
 simulator of it works and it got me 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.170
 slightly late slightly sat agree 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.650
 I still go back some fps 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.090
 I will not say 50 fps but I would say 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.079
 although it will go up a good 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.299
 dozens of fps as m so that's so
