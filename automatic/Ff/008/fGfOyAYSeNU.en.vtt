00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.760
 is fast in the sprint but there was 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.860
 still good level there was 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.140

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.390
 florian vachon there was a lot of 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.740
 guys she avoids after me that was 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.380
 15 days I did not know where 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.360
 I was there I was not great 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.850
 confident I launched from afar because 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.989
 I was in fifth position and then 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.160
 I had the strength to hold me 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.530
 I was here for that one 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.090
 stage victory I was a little frustrated 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.690
 of my time and was a little less 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.550
 although last year 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.840
 it's a state producers then at 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.910
 overall classification if possible but good 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.100
 is the priority now we will take 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.209
 from day to day we will see where it takes us 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.070
 kavala I had won for the first 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.090
 participation 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.160
 loops of the mayenne jalagania will lift 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.660
 ritual social times of every year 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.500
 I came back with ambitions but this 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.739
 is not easy to win every year 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.330
 this rich year with this ground in 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.830
 good condition I was coming here for for 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.390
 that and the guys trust me since 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.470
 the beginning of the year 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.810
 if it's not to disappoint so good 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.480
 moment and but does not spread badly so 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.800
 here I would say thank you again what to 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.540
 every time they sacrifice they make 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.300

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.730
 my well protected they rolled that in 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.440
 highlights 40 terminals of arrival 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.049
 Or here it is until 5 band arrived my 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.000

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.570
 sprint it's not kidding every time but 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.500
