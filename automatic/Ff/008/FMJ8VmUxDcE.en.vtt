alignment<00:00:16.170> check<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.800> out

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
alignment check it out

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.679 
alignment check it out
whoa<00:00:17.520> three<00:00:17.910> tires<00:00:18.590> so<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.340> first<00:00:20.609> one<00:00:20.939> what

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
whoa three tires so the first one what

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.019 
whoa three tires so the first one what
do<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.869> notice<00:00:22.050> about<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.500> first<00:00:22.740> time<00:00:23.029> that

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
do you notice about the first time that

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.359 
do you notice about the first time that
it's<00:00:24.539> worn<00:00:24.869> on<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.109> edges<00:00:25.650> but<00:00:25.890> not<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
it's worn on the edges but not in the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.660 
it's worn on the edges but not in the
middle<00:00:26.490> okay<00:00:27.359> that's<00:00:27.570> very<00:00:27.660> good<00:00:28.369> this<00:00:29.369> is

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
middle okay that's very good this is

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.389 
middle okay that's very good this is
usually<00:00:29.880> caused<00:00:30.390> by<00:00:30.800> under<00:00:31.800> inflation

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
usually caused by under inflation

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.040 
usually caused by under inflation
meaning<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.120> customer<00:00:33.570> didn't<00:00:33.780> have<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
meaning the customer didn't have the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.780 
meaning the customer didn't have the
proper<00:00:34.320> air<00:00:34.590> pressure<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.040> their<00:00:35.160> tire<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:35.760> it

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
proper air pressure in their tire so it

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.060 
proper air pressure in their tire so it
was<00:00:35.969> low<00:00:36.239> okay<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.290> with<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.530> being<00:00:37.559> low<00:00:37.920> it

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
was low okay and with it being low it

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.250 
was low okay and with it being low it
puts<00:00:38.309> stress<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> outer<00:00:39.030> edges<00:00:39.300> yeah<00:00:39.840> and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
puts stress on the outer edges yeah and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.709 
puts stress on the outer edges yeah and
it<00:00:40.410> wears<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.800> tire<00:00:41.040> out<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.420> caused

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it wears the tire out so is that caused

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.869 
it wears the tire out so is that caused
by<00:00:43.020> alignment<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.070> not<00:00:44.309> caused<00:00:44.610> by<00:00:44.640> an

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
by alignment it is not caused by an

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.400 
by alignment it is not caused by an
alignment<00:00:45.180> even<00:00:45.719> though<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.960> might<00:00:46.079> have<00:00:46.379> a

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
alignment even though it might have a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.869 
alignment even though it might have a
little<00:00:46.620> bit<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.860> extra<00:00:47.039> wear<00:00:47.280> added<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.730> it

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
little bit of extra wear added to it

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.610 
little bit of extra wear added to it
okay<00:00:48.239> but<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.510> will<00:00:48.629> affect<00:00:48.809> your<00:00:49.230> alignment
