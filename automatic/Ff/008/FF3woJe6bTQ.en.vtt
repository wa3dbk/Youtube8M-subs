00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 and good very good from before good where 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.509
 we are going to start then or better 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.910
 said let's go finishing these of 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.040
 ruins but yes forwarding some steps 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.429
 and what I did was cut the zucchini very 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.330
 fine in thin baskets I cook it in a 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.160
 skillet and shangri-la the terrine mold 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.050
 with the seventh of his clients he 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.760
 understand that part after cooking 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.470
 vegetables in the pan let's say you do not have 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.500
 No secret just skip the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.750
 carrots and asparagus foundations 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.420
 that we also lack in the pan 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.870
 no secret nothing more than that for another 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.910
 side I have eggs and white cheese in this 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.790
 we are going to beat it so that they leave 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.350
 thus integrating absolutely the air 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.570
 cheese they use will be left 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.510
 excellent is also so they can 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.820
 do it if you want low calorie for 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.360
 that way you can consume all the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.590
 family when game are in 63 14 44 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.989
 total not to stay short 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.000
 preferable to change in something needed 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.510
 We're really going to put a little salt 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.060
 there it is and we integrate again beating 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.220
 let's also put some milk 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.040
 so that way that a little more 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.020
 Liquid the mixture and distribute well 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.990
 among all the vegetables that we are going to go 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.090
 placing in the mold determines output 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.950
 we have then the base that is going to bind 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.060
 all the ingredients that we are going to 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.590
 place in the end 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.140
 that's it, you cooked them 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.820
 ingredients that is exactly lizard 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.939
 cook them in the arts in the arteries 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.159
 the pans like that is in a pretty game 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.409
 strong thing that they get golden quickly that 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.600
 are very tasty but also that 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.729
 are slightly placed as 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.860
 so that we can better enjoy the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.920
 vegetables always keep their best 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.200
 nutrients and much better all the flavor 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.509
 try too I'll always decide that 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.539
 do not cook it is too clear it is 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.789
 just that madeleine durito clear 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.770
 it's fundamental no we're not 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.020
 accustomed these are black olives 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.909
 of dollars lacks and cut them a little 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.099
 let's add also here I wanted you 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.409
 comment that we are not used to 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.360
 eat vegetables that are strained 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.299
 we could say al dente like pasta 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.400
 that are barely crispy but without 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.000
 However, if we get used to eating like this 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.250
 we go 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.070
 appreciate them much more because they are much 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.020
 tastier to that crunchy texture you 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.960
 It really gives a very 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.580
 particular to vegetables so it's 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.010
 very good try to do it and now 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.660
 well let's accommodate these clubs 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.420
 I am eduard with my hands here lizard 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.400
 free I washed my hands previously 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.260
 we were money from what we do for 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.180
 meals we have to use the most for 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.980
 Of course, yes, always 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.500
 well sanitized lizard that's 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.300
 fundamental but you have to use the 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.910
 hands are one of the best but the 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.920
 best and most important tool that 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.480
 we can have the cooks them 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.700
 we arrange well then the asparagus 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.370
 have enough asparagus do not have 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.560
 fear the other day they asked me if the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.630
 asparagus cooking them to the pan not 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.209
 they were very bitter, because it gave me 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.050
 Laughter was seen making the asparagus in 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.050
 the pan 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.450
 to see if they are going to make you bitter 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.610
 before and be tested by the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.350
 he tried and they loved it so you know 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.239
 encourage yourself to do it in the pan because 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.450
 they are truly much tastier 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.489
 now we put some red peppers 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.489
 or we 're going to be good and we press 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.019
 a little we move the sterling down 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.519
 we hit her a little bit so she 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.640
 go arranging the vegetables had 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.280
 brava and now exactly the cream goes 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.400
 that we prepared so that way 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.920
 will analyze these ingredients and what is 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.540
 really very interesting is the 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.310
 amount that we prepare to give with the cde 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.349
 that we have a barbarian eye andrÃ© together 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.720
 you told me up there just hydro use 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.239
 just that and now we double the 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.700
 ends of the surimi that is left out 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.110
 mold inward so that it 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.849
 well accommodated 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.349
 there are always meters we leave the 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.000
 little tips inside 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.980
 there it is because if they are not going to 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.900
 burn the throat you see at the moment of 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.940
 take it value are not going to go down and do not 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.209
 is the little dot inside is going to burn in 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.160
 so much we move well we accommodate all and 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.440
 now we take it directly to the 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.019
 students about 40 minutes 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.459
 so that it is very solid and tasty 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.560
 if they do it in a mold suitable for 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.260
 Microwave can also be done in the 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.150
 micro so it's a good idea for the 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.769
 who want to use the micro very well 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.019
 go that to the oven or to the oven 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.410
 Paisito in us to the break and 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.410
 we come back
