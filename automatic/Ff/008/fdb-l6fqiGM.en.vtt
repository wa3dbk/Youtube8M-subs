 why trucker radio exhaustive 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.220
 the answer to this question is given by our next 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.530
 the plot of the DVR is fixed as 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.349
 within a few minutes the chauffeur four and 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.049
 did my best to save his and 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.949

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.390
 no longer on the dvr installed in 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.279
 the cab of the truck that drives along 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.650
 federal highway at some point 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.869
 trucks refuse to brake only 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.000
 avoid accident warn 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.000
 other participants in the movement on the radio 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.370
 but these negotiations are available mostly 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.440
 for drivers of the other four owner 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.719
 cars miraculously gone from a collision 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.429
 when the truck drove into the oncoming chauffeur 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.140
 on the radio fall asleep tips 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:50.729
 some recommend brakes with 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.949
 other gearboxes 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:55.680
 offer to pull over but from 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.899
 such maneuvers , to the eyeballs wagon may 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.609
 turn over apparently the driver spun 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.920
 in my head all the options I realized that the way out 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:08.970
 one offend the other cars and wait for when 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:11.009
 the speed will gradually decrease through 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.409
 few minutes uncontrollable race 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.030
 on the way there is a real threat to both 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.709
 lanes for no two wagons 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.140
 and again the radio comes to the rescue 

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:21.890
 prevent car crashes fails in 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.890
 last seconds 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.020
 and jump 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.510
 words of gratitude for lightning 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.220
 the reaction of other drivers can be seen that 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.110
 the roadsides are trucks skipping 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.910
 unmanaged truck moreover 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.890
 truckers have time to warn and 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.990
 other cars on the track finally 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.180
 small lift multi-ton car 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.180
 reduces speed and stops 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.400
 great luck that the stop occurred 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.250
 before entering a large city 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.830
 the appearance of an unmanaged truck there could 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.900
 lead to tragic consequences or
