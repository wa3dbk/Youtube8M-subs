competition<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.460> video<00:01:32.850> because<00:01:33.450> I

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
competition on this video because I

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.840 
competition on this video because I
think<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.200> would<00:01:34.350> be<00:01:34.500> easier<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.159> guys<00:01:35.250> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
think it would be easier for you guys to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.109 
think it would be easier for you guys to
see<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.689> rather<00:01:37.560> than<00:01:37.710> watching<00:01:38.490> two<00:01:38.670> videos

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
see it rather than watching two videos

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.330 
see it rather than watching two videos
to<00:01:39.420> see<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:40.110> might<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.350> easier<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.890> put<00:01:41.100> it

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
to see it it might be easier to put it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.520 
to see it it might be easier to put it
on<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.119> here<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.170> hope<00:01:43.380> you
