00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.630
 ah 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:22.330
 the stairs would be a challenge for people 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:27.599
 that there are times when they do not have help and so 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.599
 things was a bit difficult because 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.850
 there are many descents 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.730
 there are no people to help you 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.620
 it does not come down without falling 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.739
 on the road there were small holes 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.710
 people passed almost in front of you 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.680
 I would not let you through 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:52.590
 the ramps are smooth and the tires are 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.590
 they shed a lot of work rights 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.430
 I think the road is here 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.129
 have to wait for several cars 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.119
 pass and there are some from the step that 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:08.070
 I have all they do they have us docked 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.070
 for people in wheelchairs 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.890
 Sorry I could not go outside 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.130
 good yes but 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.550
 I do not know what I would feel sorry for and apart 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.440
 had very divided up and down that the 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.540
 people will throw me in there like they are not 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.000
 aware and gives them the same as you do 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.090
 to one side and you can fall you are not going to 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.090
 help 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.159
 although I would never like to be in a 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.740
 wheelchair and that people who are 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.659
 in a wheelchair they are very strong 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.659
 on itself because if I 'm doing 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.940
 is rooted in that they first test and 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.940
 mistake and then do your things because or 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.320
 you just have the idea that it's going to 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.320
 work but have not tried it 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:04.130
 good with your ramps 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.649
 but as they would do when crossing the street 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.140
 there are good signs there are cruises that do not 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.399
 they see them or something is something 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.920
 something very big to what I would face 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.780
 because I could not walk anymore I could not 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.430
 I would have to join the difficult chair 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.090
 tired because you are in a chair 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.910
 wheels is complicated is heavy I say 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.879
 yes because they are afraid of what 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.739
 think the other people of them 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:34.540
 they are afraid of what they can mock 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.540
 for your disability or something 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.830
 Y 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.600
 Well, in fact, if you keep thinking about 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.760
 the conscience because then more than anything 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.980
 for my profession because if I focus on that 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.660
 and it's what I do sometimes when I see 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.150
 people who flat out if they need help 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.510
 I offer myself but I think that 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.909
 most people do not 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.970
 when there is traffic if not you can not 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.980
 look and walk around here in fact nothing 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.689
 more than 100 distance and more than anything 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.390
 offer our to our help when 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.640
 more is necessary not by the sidewalk not 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.700
 because in fact sometimes people are 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.690
 thinks they get in the way or something like that and in 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.629
 time to help them 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.879
 they just snatch us away and seek the 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.989
 exit to go faster rather than 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.989
 stop helping them 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.350
 well 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.020
 the majority of the wind 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.050
 ah 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.590
 if you climb the route if they help you climb 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.590
 how do you 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.340
 he does not want me
