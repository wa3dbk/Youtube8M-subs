00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello everyone with you again max and today 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.690
 I'll show you a pirated version of the game and nso 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.499
 jeans and she recently stepped in and 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.749
 let's get down to installing it and 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:18.650
 so we need we need 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:22.599
 the two parts of the game itself, that is, it is broken 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:29.019
 into two parts well, not two parts namely 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:31.249
 games and its files we need to crack and 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.100
 the torrent file itself which will 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:37.450
 be these two parts as you see they 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.920
 weighs a lot and 1 update 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.710
 which we will put on top of the game and 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.710
 so first we start the torrent 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.250
 and as you see I already have this 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.250
 torrent so I will not upload it 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.450
 and so after you have downloaded this 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:04.210
 torrent you will have two parts first and 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.500
 the second part only there will be under the bath 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.380
 under that 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:14.410
 but I did in Russian that is 1 part 2 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.410
 ok now let's proceed to unarchiving 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:21.180
 these parts are exactly installers who 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.180
 are in these archives 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.990
 transfer to the game folder the future game 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.340
 and expect 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.320
 then we have this one pops up 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.030
 not even a cure need the next volume and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.030
 we choose the second part 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.439
 knives 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.439
 ok 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:55.610
 all the files have been successfully transferred let's 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.610
 check if everything is in place 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.170

 This is a successful installation. 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.460

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.799
 and we transfer everything to 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.799
 or from the archive to the game folder 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:02.890
 we transfer everything with complete replacement about which 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.890

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:11.420
 replace one file and now we have something 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:16.010
 there is nothing left for us except 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:19.310
 the fact that you run the game through frets so 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:23.000
 I will check the performance of the game exactly 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.040
 running it and so i went into the game we 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.810
 we are in the main menu and that to us 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.570

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.270

 press the usual button that is needed 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.560
 to open the console as in any 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:46.520
 other games and we have a console 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:53.330
 and so now we are in this console 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:55.250

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.650

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.720
