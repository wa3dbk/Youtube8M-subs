00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
pull the Z up to 1.6 47 and that should

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.420 
pull the Z up to 1.6 47 and that should
be<00:04:16.950> good<00:04:17.100> uh<00:04:17.340> right<00:04:18.239> now<00:04:19.130> you're<00:04:20.130> gonna<00:04:20.220> want

so next you want to go to video effects

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.320 
so next you want to go to video effects
and<00:04:31.380> you<00:04:31.590> want<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:31.800> go<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:32.330> Gaussian<00:04:33.330> blur<00:04:34.039> gosh

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
and you want to go to Gaussian blur gosh

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.270 
and you want to go to Gaussian blur gosh
audion<00:04:36.330> blur<00:04:36.570> put<00:04:37.289> whatever<00:04:37.530> i<00:04:37.710> call<00:04:37.949> it<00:04:38.039> and

audion blur put whatever i call it and

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.959 
audion blur put whatever i call it and
your<00:04:39.240> do<00:04:39.419> extreme<00:04:39.810> blur<00:04:40.050> and<00:04:40.350> for<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.160> first

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:42.969 
your do extreme blur and for the first

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:46.340 
your do extreme blur and for the first
for<00:04:43.539> the<00:04:43.629> first<00:04:43.989> of

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350

for the first of
we<00:04:46.890> first<00:04:47.190> keyframe<00:04:48.180> you're<00:04:48.600> gonna<00:04:48.750> want<00:04:48.870> to

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
we first keyframe you're gonna want to

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.690 
we first keyframe you're gonna want to
put<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.110> 200

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700

bro oh you want to have another default

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:07.499 
bro oh you want to have another default
just<00:05:06.370> make<00:05:06.490> a<00:05:06.520> new<00:05:06.699> keyframe<00:05:06.909> make<00:05:07.300> sure<00:05:07.419> it

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509 
just make a new keyframe make sure it

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:09.779 
just make a new keyframe make sure it
says<00:05:07.599> zero<00:05:07.659> and<00:05:08.199> at<00:05:08.349> the<00:05:08.500> end<00:05:08.680> make<00:05:09.610> your

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
says zero and at the end make your
