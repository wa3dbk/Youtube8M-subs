00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
obviously that's my part there is a

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.750 
obviously that's my part there is a
space<00:02:33.530> right<00:02:33.800> here<00:02:34.040> as<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:34.190> can<00:02:34.220> see<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.460> put<00:02:34.670> my

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
space right here as you can see I put my

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.840 
space right here as you can see I put my
finger<00:02:35.090> there<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:36.020> I<00:02:36.560> created<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:37.640> space

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
finger there and I created that space

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.450 
finger there and I created that space
just<00:02:38.330> by<00:02:38.450> taking<00:02:38.750> my<00:02:39.050> shears<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.800> kind<00:02:40.370> of

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
just by taking my shears and kind of

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.160 
just by taking my shears and kind of
going<00:02:40.760> down<00:02:40.940> because<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.300> know<00:02:41.330> that<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.930> arm

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
going down because you know that the arm

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.120 
going down because you know that the arm
netting<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:43.070> you<00:02:43.820> do<00:02:44.690> your<00:02:44.810> crochet<00:02:45.050> unit<00:02:45.950> on

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
netting that you do your crochet unit on

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.760 
netting that you do your crochet unit on
is<00:02:46.400> very<00:02:46.640> thin<00:02:47.090> which<00:02:47.750> is<00:02:47.900> great<00:02:48.230> because<00:02:48.530> it

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
is very thin which is great because it

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.680 
is very thin which is great because it
allows<00:02:48.800> your<00:02:49.220> unit<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:50.090> allows<00:02:50.330> your<00:02:50.450> scalp

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
allows your unit to it allows your scalp

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.240 
allows your unit to it allows your scalp
to<00:02:50.750> be<00:02:50.840> able<00:02:50.990> to<00:02:51.080> breathe<00:02:51.320> great<00:02:51.920> ventilation

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
to be able to breathe great ventilation

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.120 
to be able to breathe great ventilation
so<00:02:52.760> I<00:02:52.820> just<00:02:53.120> did<00:02:53.720> like<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.900> little<00:02:54.140> slit<00:02:54.590> in<00:02:54.830> a

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
so I just did like a little slit in a

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.490 
so I just did like a little slit in a
little<00:02:55.610> like<00:02:55.760> spring<00:02:56.330> open<00:02:56.720> burger

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
little like spring open burger

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.230 
little like spring open burger
but<00:02:57.680> don't<00:02:58.040> worry<00:02:58.250> cuz<00:02:58.640> that's<00:02:58.790> what<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:59.030> want

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
but don't worry cuz that's what you want

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.160 
but don't worry cuz that's what you want
and<00:02:59.470> then<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.530> placed<00:03:01.010> this<00:03:01.280> on<00:03:01.600> my<00:03:02.600> head<00:03:02.930> where

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
and then I placed this on my head where

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.280 
and then I placed this on my head where
I<00:03:03.200> wanted<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.650> behind<00:03:04.430> my<00:03:04.760> hairline<00:03:05.210> ok<00:03:05.660> this

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
I wanted it behind my hairline ok this

is my hair

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.340
