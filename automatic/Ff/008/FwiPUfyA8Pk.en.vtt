 every use is routine at 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.600
 extensive use of the the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.540
 This year, for example, body was this year 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.200
 snow chaos the further in the broken 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.110
 locked in 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.250
 it was it was however the hotspot did 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.310
 then turned out that the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.200
 Hotspot in the snow chaos of East Tyrol was 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.130
 and by that I have all 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.260
 TV stations in Austria and 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.790
 print media online media

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.810
 then after the game it goes directly 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.940
 next use his work 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.070
 leads to the inhabitants in all parts of the 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.460
 that's personally the district 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.790
 Diversity informant alison report 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.900
 the mentality of the persons 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.700
 performers at the performances 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.630
 It's just the differences of 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.030
 so totally and thought events something 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.800
 what so happen one of these events 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.350
 is the dome cup of the volunteers 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.390
 Feuerwehr a 21 groups from East Tyrol 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.760
 South Tyrol and Carinthia mocked each other 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.560
 in it a so-called suction line so 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.560
 to pair together as quickly as possible 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.040
 Berlin 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.040
 to water 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.620
 After all the bikes and footballers 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.560
 Firefighters are scanned 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.879
 for philipp in the deserved evening of celebration 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.099
 at least until the next alarm 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.879
 and this usually does not last long 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.129
 to wait 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:03.030
 which is the biggest challenge 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:06.370
 easy to get up in the night 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.900
 when the alarm comes and then 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.299
 rich to by no matter how far it 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.910
 Of course, that's why you think about it 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:16.590
 you should always get up twice 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.590
 around the night or not
