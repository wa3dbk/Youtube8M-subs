00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.160
 but in my opinion they are the same meet two 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.920
 very budget smartphone from samsung to 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:20.600
 samsung not only releases galaxy s4 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:24.769
 not only galaxy note 2 me galaxy star and 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.769
 galaxy pocket neo 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:34.469
 who of them who is this start 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:41.520
 here it is on both souls dvuhsimochnye very 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:45.289
 very similar appearance that is not 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.059
 you know and you really can't tell 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:52.350
 traditional unpacking today will not be 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:57.120
 they came to me rather modest 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:06.150
 bundling so we'll just put in there 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:08.689
 Sim card and turn on did not ask 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.689
 turn on 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.130
 to tell 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:21.270
 stand star costs from three to 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.189
 three and a half thousand rubles a package on 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.970
 cut half to four and a half 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.729
 can find a sell parade and are very close 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:36.829
 according to your characteristics you fights 3 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.829
 inch screens 240 320 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.140
 if someone is funny then you can no longer 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:53.090
 watch this video I am quite you 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:53.090
 understood the battery 1200 beatings 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:04.479
 I think the battery is perfect 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:09.789
 equally iron iron slightly different 1 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:12.060
 processor day and hertz dear eight hundred 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.650
 fifty megahertz 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.890
 more detailed specifications 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.690
 something on earth for this i 'll figure it out 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.819
 the process of writing an operational review 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.170
 memory and there and there floor it 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.040
 4GB flash memory card support 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.239
 of memory 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:46.680
 you can see the location of all everyone 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:46.680
 waste items very much like a hospital 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.440
 No, unfortunately , SIM cards have ended 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:58.159
 so every city I put only 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.159
 water 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:16.090
 for some reason I thought that here are sim cards 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:19.150
 usually the world is clearly not here except ask 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:24.810
 pardon a little technological and 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.810
 rivers went for other sim cards 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.290
 here I brought small sim cards let's 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.290
 continue 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.660
 per minute to another 2 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.380
 are pretty tight 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:57.910
 return to the place of the battery will be 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:00.960
 It is enabled when at least I did not say on 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.540
 my what is the difference from the apparatus 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:08.830
 Anime processor frequency differences are very 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:13.270
 even a simple one of them has three 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.970
 g-dragon is not difficult for me to guess 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:20.430
 price 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.430
 3g is a bit more expensive 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:42.910
 he was a prophet equipped with cameras 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:47.590
 modest to other pixel-free 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:50.140
 type of the focus of how flashes weigh 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:54.220
 they are also about the same about 100 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:57.000
 gram each size 1 window and particular 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:02.250
 you are always interested in thickness 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.250
 better back about 12 millimeters 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.389
 but 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.800
 he 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.110
 but 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:32.290
 but 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:38.670
 while I skip creating accounts and 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.670
 come in lips I'll be home 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.700
 but 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.540
 but 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.989
 about 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:36.199
 Well, finally, he threatened the parade 

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:41.409
 interrupted on their text screen typical 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:41.409
 just more no less 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:57.380
 I start to study slowly through 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:58.910
 some time the pattern will appear on us 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:03.500
 site . 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:08.480
 how let's see the version of android 4 1 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:12.040
 2 that what is here for now and thank you all 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.040
 for attention bye
