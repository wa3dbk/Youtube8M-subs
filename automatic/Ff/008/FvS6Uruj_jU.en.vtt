00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.889 
in profit to talk about silver okay
first<00:01:44.850> silver<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.420> interesting<00:01:45.630> because

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
first silver it's interesting because

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.899 
first silver it's interesting because
the<00:01:46.079> charts<00:01:46.320> are<00:01:46.439> very<00:01:46.470> similar<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
the charts are very similar so on the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.460 
the charts are very similar so on the
daily<00:01:48.210> perspective<00:01:48.780> you're<00:01:48.960> looking<00:01:49.259> at<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
daily perspective you're looking at the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.380 
daily perspective you're looking at the
same<00:01:49.680> thing<00:01:49.920> if<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.460> wanted<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.850> correlate

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
same thing if you wanted to correlate

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.940 
same thing if you wanted to correlate
that<00:01:51.630> then<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.229> would<00:01:52.350> want<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.770> go<00:01:52.920> with

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
that then you would want to go with

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.950 
that then you would want to go with
something<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.970> bull<00:01:54.180> call<00:01:54.360> spread<00:01:54.390> again

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
something like a bull call spread again

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.830 
something like a bull call spread again
the<00:01:55.320> but<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.530> would<00:01:55.619> be<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> 35<00:01:56.250> 36<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.450> you'd<00:01:57.630> buy

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
the but it would be a 35 36 so you'd buy

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.780 
the but it would be a 35 36 so you'd buy
the<00:01:57.899> 35<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.590> you'd<00:01:58.680> sell<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> 36<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.549> then<00:01:59.700> we

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the 35 so you'd sell the 36 and then we

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.039 
the 35 so you'd sell the 36 and then we
wouldn't<00:02:00.000> want<00:02:00.119> silver<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.630> able<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.899> move

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
wouldn't want silver to be able to move

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.749 
wouldn't want silver to be able to move
that<00:02:01.200> much<00:02:01.380> by<00:02:01.590> April<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.070> next<00:02:02.250> year<00:02:02.430> so

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.149 
that much by April of next year so

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
they're not really expensive nice return

but for me watching it over the last
number<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.340> years<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.880> think<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.510> the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
number of years I think that the the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.530 
number of years I think that the the
fail<00:02:25.020> in<00:02:25.290> 2008<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.610> me<00:02:26.820> seemed<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.210> little<00:02:27.420> bit

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
fail in 2008 to me seemed a little bit

I<00:02:28.320> think<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.130> recovery<00:02:29.370> was<00:02:30.120> way<00:02:30.690> too<00:02:30.750> fast

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
I think the recovery was way too fast

I think the recovery was way too fast
I<00:02:31.740> don't<00:02:32.430> trust<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.970> levels<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.660> think<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.200> a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
I don't trust the levels I think that a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.420 
I don't trust the levels I think that a

in the next bit of time and then the

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
reaction there at first it was blamed on

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.130 
reaction there at first it was blamed on
Europe<00:02:44.820> right<00:02:45.180> oh<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:45.750> has<00:02:45.870> got<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.110> be

what's going on here well Europe's been

what's going on here well Europe's been
going<00:02:47.400> on<00:02:47.459> for<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.670> long<00:02:47.790> time<00:02:47.850> so<00:02:48.330> we're<00:02:48.480> going

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
going on for a long time so we're going

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.810 
going on for a long time so we're going
on<00:02:48.959> for<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> long<00:02:49.290> time<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.950> don't<00:02:50.400> think<00:02:50.520> that

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
on for a long time I don't think that

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.310 
on for a long time I don't think that
that's<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.090> deal<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.480> then<00:02:51.630> we're<00:02:51.959> still<00:02:52.140> not

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
that's the deal and then we're still not

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.660 
that's the deal and then we're still not
seeing<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.590> lot<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.770> progression<00:02:53.280> in<00:02:53.430> the

you don't have to pull everything out
but<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.510> think<00:03:27.660> for<00:03:27.930> new<00:03:28.080> investors<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.739> stocks

but I think for new investors and stocks

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.410 
but I think for new investors and stocks
just<00:03:29.190> be<00:03:29.400> wary<00:03:29.580> of<00:03:29.670> what<00:03:29.850> you're<00:03:30.000> getting<00:03:30.180> into

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
just be wary of what you're getting into

it<00:04:32.639> already<00:04:32.760> has<00:04:32.910> it's<00:04:33.840> it's<00:04:34.290> interesting<00:04:34.440> to

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
it already has it's it's interesting to

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.840 
it already has it's it's interesting to
watch<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.040> you<00:04:35.130> brought<00:04:35.280> up<00:04:35.400> California

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
watch and you brought up California

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.390 
watch and you brought up California
outright<00:04:36.210> we<00:04:37.169> just<00:04:37.380> actually<00:04:37.560> got<00:04:37.980> notified

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
outright we just actually got notified

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.879 
outright we just actually got notified
this<00:04:38.730> this<00:04:39.090> week<00:04:39.300> I<00:04:39.480> believe<00:04:39.540> that<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:40.470> Malibu

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
this this week I believe that the Malibu

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.440 
this this week I believe that the Malibu
court<00:04:41.250> systems<00:04:41.730> are<00:04:41.940> going<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.150> be<00:04:42.240> shutting

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
court systems are going to be shutting

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.690 
court systems are going to be shutting
down<00:04:42.690> in<00:04:42.930> Malibu<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:43.889> Beverly<00:04:44.280> Hills<00:04:44.490> and

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
down in Malibu and and Beverly Hills and

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.530 
down in Malibu and and Beverly Hills and
a<00:04:44.730> couple<00:04:44.880> of<00:04:45.000> other<00:04:45.090> places<00:04:45.210> obviously

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
a couple of other places obviously

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.110 
a couple of other places obviously
they're<00:04:45.870> not<00:04:45.960> large<00:04:46.440> in<00:04:46.800> population<00:04:47.430> but<00:04:47.940> it's

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
they're not large in population but it's

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.360 
they're not large in population but it's
again<00:04:48.510> par<00:04:49.050> for<00:04:49.230> the<00:04:49.260> course<00:04:49.440> you<00:04:49.590> you<00:04:50.010> end<00:04:50.190> up

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
again par for the course you you end up

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.250 
again par for the course you you end up
with<00:04:50.880> massive<00:04:51.150> government<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.080> lot<00:04:52.230> of

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
with massive government and a lot of

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.350 
with massive government and a lot of
expenditures<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:53.130> a<00:04:53.250> lot<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.460> it<00:04:53.639> unnecessary

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
expenditures and a lot of it unnecessary

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.909 
expenditures and a lot of it unnecessary
it's<00:04:54.690> not<00:04:54.900> very<00:04:55.110> efficient<00:04:55.530> in<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.680> way<00:04:55.800> it's

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
it's not very efficient in the way it's

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.850 
it's not very efficient in the way it's
run<00:04:56.130> and<00:04:56.370> any<00:04:57.330> of<00:04:57.450> you<00:04:57.510> talking<00:04:57.900> also<00:04:58.140> you're

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
run and any of you talking also you're

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.140 
run and any of you talking also you're
looking<00:04:59.070> at<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.190> economy<00:04:59.280> headlines<00:05:00.000> this

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
looking at the economy headlines this

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.300 
looking at the economy headlines this
week<00:05:00.210> right<00:05:00.630> hostess<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:01.530> your<00:05:01.890> Twinkie<00:05:02.220> is

week right hostess and your Twinkie is

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.670 
week right hostess and your Twinkie is
dying<00:05:02.580> now<00:05:02.850> because<00:05:03.330> of<00:05:03.480> Union<00:05:03.900> issues<00:05:04.410> right

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
dying now because of Union issues right

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.890 
dying now because of Union issues right
and<00:05:04.860> all<00:05:04.980> of<00:05:05.070> this<00:05:05.220> kind<00:05:05.400> of<00:05:05.520> stems<00:05:05.780> it's<00:05:06.780> all

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
and all of this kind of stems it's all

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.420 
and all of this kind of stems it's all
together<00:05:07.110> it<00:05:07.530> feeds<00:05:07.770> each<00:05:07.950> other<00:05:08.160> and

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
together it feeds each other and

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.040 
together it feeds each other and
ultimately<00:05:09.270> you<00:05:09.390> don't<00:05:09.480> see<00:05:09.660> a<00:05:09.690> lot<00:05:09.840> of<00:05:09.900> profit

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
ultimately you don't see a lot of profit

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.610 
ultimately you don't see a lot of profit
coming<00:05:10.380> out<00:05:10.500> of<00:05:10.620> it<00:05:10.710> and<00:05:10.890> so<00:05:11.100> looking<00:05:11.820> at

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
coming out of it and so looking at

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.750 
coming out of it and so looking at
roadblocks<00:05:13.620> and<00:05:13.860> barriers<00:05:13.919> for<00:05:14.490> people<00:05:14.520> to

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
roadblocks and barriers for people to

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.100 
roadblocks and barriers for people to
start<00:05:15.000> new<00:05:15.120> businesses<00:05:15.150> I<00:05:15.750> think<00:05:15.900> there's<00:05:16.050> a

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
start new businesses I think there's a

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.290 
start new businesses I think there's a
lot<00:05:16.350> that<00:05:16.560> fades<00:05:16.740> into<00:05:16.950> that<00:05:17.220> you<00:05:18.030> know<00:05:18.060> I<00:05:18.150> I

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
lot that fades into that you know I I

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.969 
lot that fades into that you know I I
agree<00:05:19.020> with<00:05:19.260> you<00:05:19.350> I<00:05:19.380> grew<00:05:19.560> up<00:05:19.620> in<00:05:19.770> a<00:05:19.830> military

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
agree with you I grew up in a military

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.360 
agree with you I grew up in a military
family<00:05:20.220> I<00:05:20.490> think<00:05:20.760> so<00:05:21.690> we<00:05:21.810> were<00:05:22.260> taught<00:05:22.500> to<00:05:22.770> to

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
family I think so we were taught to to

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.100 
family I think so we were taught to to
be<00:05:23.610> independent<00:05:24.120> and<00:05:24.180> to<00:05:24.240> be<00:05:24.389> self<00:05:24.600> thinkers

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
be independent and to be self thinkers

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.620 
be independent and to be self thinkers
and<00:05:25.350> and<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.680> you<00:05:25.919> know<00:05:26.030> just<00:05:27.030> and<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.389> beyond

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
and and to you know just and and beyond

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.240 
and and to you know just and and beyond
that<00:05:27.750> there's<00:05:28.050> there's<00:05:28.350> a<00:05:28.410> there's<00:05:28.950> a<00:05:29.010> piece

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
that there's there's a there's a piece

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.430 
that there's there's a there's a piece
of<00:05:29.400> team<00:05:29.700> there<00:05:30.169> when<00:05:31.169> you're<00:05:31.290> in<00:05:31.350> the

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
of team there when you're in the

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.990 
of team there when you're in the
military<00:05:31.830> you<00:05:32.040> don't<00:05:32.460> go<00:05:32.550> out<00:05:32.669> there<00:05:32.790> as<00:05:32.970> a

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
military you don't go out there as a

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.150 
military you don't go out there as a
one-man<00:05:33.330> show<00:05:33.930> but<00:05:34.470> there's<00:05:34.620> still<00:05:34.800> a<00:05:34.860> lot<00:05:35.130> of

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
one-man show but there's still a lot of

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.740 
one-man show but there's still a lot of
drive<00:05:35.490> and<00:05:35.610> initiative<00:05:36.060> on<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.210> individual

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
drive and initiative on the individual

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.630 
drive and initiative on the individual
you<00:05:37.020> know<00:05:37.050> you<00:05:37.229> take<00:05:37.410> ownership<00:05:37.680> and<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:38.490> you

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
you know you take ownership and and you

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.520 
you know you take ownership and and you
and<00:05:38.820> you<00:05:38.970> lead<00:05:39.240> and<00:05:39.570> I<00:05:39.840> think<00:05:40.020> those<00:05:40.289> are

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
and you lead and I think those are

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.080 
and you lead and I think those are
really<00:05:40.740> really<00:05:40.919> important<00:05:41.580> pieces<00:05:41.910> that

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
really really important pieces that

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.880 
really really important pieces that
we're<00:05:42.210> missing<00:05:42.360> right<00:05:42.660> now<00:05:42.720> to<00:05:43.320> me<00:05:43.500> leadership

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
we're missing right now to me leadership

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.550 
we're missing right now to me leadership
outright<00:05:44.490> means<00:05:44.820> action<00:05:45.360> and<00:05:45.600> when<00:05:46.440> you're

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
outright means action and when you're

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.380 
outright means action and when you're
talking<00:05:46.919> about<00:05:47.010> action<00:05:47.580> you<00:05:47.850> have<00:05:48.030> to<00:05:48.180> own

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
talking about action you have to own

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.719 
talking about action you have to own
your<00:05:48.900> decisions<00:05:49.380> as<00:05:49.620> well<00:05:49.890> you<00:05:50.400> know<00:05:50.520> so<00:05:50.669> you

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
your decisions as well you know so you

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.700 
your decisions as well you know so you
lead<00:05:50.940> by<00:05:51.060> action<00:05:51.390> not<00:05:51.510> by<00:05:51.660> speaking<00:05:51.720> and<00:05:52.289> then

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
lead by action not by speaking and then

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.070 
lead by action not by speaking and then
you<00:05:53.250> have<00:05:53.460> to<00:05:53.669> actually<00:05:53.820> buck<00:05:54.360> up<00:05:54.539> you<00:05:54.780> have<00:05:54.930> to

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
you have to actually buck up you have to

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.050 
you have to actually buck up you have to
own<00:05:55.200> your<00:05:55.470> decisions<00:05:55.950> right<00:05:56.130> or<00:05:56.310> wrong<00:05:56.550> either

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
own your decisions right or wrong either

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.490 
own your decisions right or wrong either
way<00:05:57.240> you<00:05:57.419> need<00:05:57.750> to<00:05:57.810> be<00:05:57.930> able<00:05:57.990> to<00:05:58.110> own<00:05:58.229> them<00:05:58.380> and

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
way you need to be able to own them and

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.690 
way you need to be able to own them and
I<00:05:58.530> think<00:05:58.710> that's<00:05:58.860> a<00:05:58.950> massive<00:05:59.220> piece<00:05:59.550> that's

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
I think that's a massive piece that's

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.270 
I think that's a massive piece that's
missing<00:05:59.760> on<00:06:00.390> higher<00:06:01.289> levels<00:06:01.710> and<00:06:01.950> it<00:06:02.070> trickles

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280
