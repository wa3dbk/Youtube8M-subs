theworkoutcorner.com and today we're
going<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.670> do<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> basic<00:00:09.030> overview<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.690> fat<00:00:10.380> loss

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:10.680 
going to do a basic overview of fat loss

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.549 
going to do a basic overview of fat loss
in<00:00:11.130> regards<00:00:11.760> to<00:00:12.000> getting<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.720> 6-pack<00:00:13.290> and

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
in regards to getting you a 6-pack and

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.770 
in regards to getting you a 6-pack and
more<00:00:14.160> muscle<00:00:14.519> definition<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:15.389> kind<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.690> a

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
more muscle definition so kind of a

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.990 
more muscle definition so kind of a
basic<00:00:16.170> formula<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:16.860> fat<00:00:17.340> loss<00:00:17.550> occurs

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
basic formula is that fat loss occurs

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.140 
basic formula is that fat loss occurs
when<00:00:18.450> you<00:00:18.570> consume<00:00:19.110> fewer<00:00:20.099> calories<00:00:20.220> than

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
when you consume fewer calories than

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.050 
when you consume fewer calories than
your<00:00:21.599> body<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:22.079> burning<00:00:22.700> all<00:00:23.700> right<00:00:23.790> so<00:00:23.939> that's

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
your body is burning all right so that's

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.089 
your body is burning all right so that's
obviously<00:00:24.329> a<00:00:25.020> kind<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.619> simplified

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
obviously a kind of simplified

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.089 
obviously a kind of simplified
definition<00:00:26.480> one<00:00:27.480> caveat<00:00:28.200> being<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.590> you

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
definition one caveat being that you

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.569 
definition one caveat being that you
know<00:00:29.189> just<00:00:29.430> dropping<00:00:29.820> your<00:00:29.849> calories<00:00:30.419> by<00:00:30.660> 50%

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
know just dropping your calories by 50%

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.100 
know just dropping your calories by 50%
it's<00:00:32.579> not<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.270> mean<00:00:33.480> you're<00:00:33.960> gonna

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
it's not going to mean you're gonna

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.160 
it's not going to mean you're gonna
start<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.770> know<00:00:34.860> hitting<00:00:35.340> rapid<00:00:35.820> fat<00:00:36.030> loss<00:00:36.170> if

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
start you know hitting rapid fat loss if

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.439 
start you know hitting rapid fat loss if
you<00:00:37.260> cut<00:00:37.500> your<00:00:37.620> calories<00:00:37.769> too<00:00:38.280> much<00:00:38.550> your<00:00:39.210> body

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
you cut your calories too much your body

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.479 
you cut your calories too much your body
is<00:00:39.600> gonna<00:00:39.719> kind<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.079> go<00:00:40.199> into<00:00:40.440> starvation<00:00:40.920> mode

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
is gonna kind of go into starvation mode

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.790 
is gonna kind of go into starvation mode
where<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.090> lowers<00:00:42.539> your<00:00:42.570> overall<00:00:43.350> metabolism

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
where it lowers your overall metabolism

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.150 
where it lowers your overall metabolism
and<00:00:44.929> it's<00:00:45.929> gonna<00:00:46.079> prevent<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.559> from<00:00:46.649> burning

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
and it's gonna prevent you from burning

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.299 
and it's gonna prevent you from burning
fat<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.000> want<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.750> slow<00:00:49.199> safe<00:00:49.769> reduction

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
fat so you want to slow safe reduction

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.079 
fat so you want to slow safe reduction
in<00:00:50.429> calories<00:00:50.940> nothing<00:00:51.749> drastic<00:00:52.789> so<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> good

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
in calories nothing drastic so a good

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.149 
in calories nothing drastic so a good
analogy<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.719> think<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.170> when<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.499> comes<00:00:55.589> to<00:00:55.920> fat

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
analogy to think of when it comes to fat

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.939 
analogy to think of when it comes to fat
loss<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.839> boiling<00:00:57.839> a<00:00:58.050> pot<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.350> water<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
loss is boiling a pot of water on a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.520 
loss is boiling a pot of water on a
stove<00:00:59.159> and<00:01:00.409> think<00:01:01.409> of<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.280> water<00:01:02.730> as<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:04.260> fat

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
stove and think of the water as the fat

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.680 
stove and think of the water as the fat
and<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.370> know<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.670> want<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> evaporate<00:01:06.659> that

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
and you know we want to evaporate that

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.490 
and you know we want to evaporate that
and<00:01:07.140> burn<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.590> off<00:01:08.509> now<00:01:09.509> you<00:01:09.570> can't<00:01:09.930> look<00:01:10.229> at

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
and burn that off now you can't look at

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.770 
and burn that off now you can't look at
a<00:01:10.799> pot<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> stove<00:01:11.549> with<00:01:12.030> water<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.509> it<00:01:12.600> and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
a pot on the stove with water in it and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.770 
a pot on the stove with water in it and
say<00:01:12.930> okay<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.560> want<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.549> water<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.630> this

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
say okay I want the water in just this

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.359 
say okay I want the water in just this
corner<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> pot<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.950> get<00:01:17.100> evaporated

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
corner of the pot to get evaporated

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.670 
corner of the pot to get evaporated
right<00:01:18.270> that's<00:01:18.750> not<00:01:18.899> how<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.140> works<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
right that's not how it works it's the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.010 
right that's not how it works it's the
whole<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.909> whole<00:01:21.119> pot<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.390> gonna<00:01:21.630> boil<00:01:21.899> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
whole the whole pot is gonna boil the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.639 
whole the whole pot is gonna boil the
water<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.740> water<00:01:22.890> levels<00:01:23.310> gonna<00:01:23.460> lower

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
water and the water levels gonna lower

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.980 
water and the water levels gonna lower
evenly<00:01:25.649> for<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.579> most<00:01:26.759> part<00:01:27.030> as<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.780> heat

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
evenly for the most part as the heat

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.230 
evenly for the most part as the heat
rises<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.770> that's<00:01:28.920> very<00:01:29.219> similar<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
rises up and that's very similar to the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.209 
rises up and that's very similar to the
way<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.719> you<00:01:30.990> burn<00:01:31.200> fat<00:01:31.469> off<00:01:31.710> your<00:01:31.740> body

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
way that you burn fat off your body

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.149 
way that you burn fat off your body
the<00:01:32.790> burner<00:01:33.390> underneath<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.170> stove<00:01:34.500> are

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the burner underneath the stove are

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.700 
the burner underneath the stove are
underneath<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.030> pot<00:01:36.240> rather<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.259> going

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
underneath the pot rather that is going

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.100 
underneath the pot rather that is going
to<00:01:37.799> be<00:01:37.920> equivalent<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.520> your<00:01:39.119> cardio<00:01:39.509> so

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
to be equivalent to your cardio so

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.480 
to be equivalent to your cardio so
that's<00:01:40.350> what's<00:01:40.710> heating<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.310> that's

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that's what's heating up and that's

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.330 
that's what's heating up and that's
what's<00:01:41.729> evaporating<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> water<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.890> fat

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
what's evaporating the water and for fat

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.929 
what's evaporating the water and for fat
loss

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
loss

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.029 
loss
that's<00:01:45.509> what's<00:01:45.840> turning<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.320> your<00:01:46.469> body<00:01:46.649> and

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
that's what's turning on your body and

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.340 
that's what's turning on your body and
getting<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.670> metabolism<00:01:48.539> up<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.020> helping

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
getting the metabolism up and helping

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.620 
getting the metabolism up and helping
you<00:01:49.560> burn<00:01:50.039> some<00:01:50.340> fat<00:01:50.520> weightlifting<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.299> also

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
you burn some fat weightlifting is also

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.050 
you burn some fat weightlifting is also
important<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:53.009> burning<00:01:53.369> fat<00:01:53.399> because<00:01:54.030> that

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
important for burning fat because that

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.230 
important for burning fat because that
is<00:01:54.539> equivalent<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.619> conductivity<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
is equivalent to the conductivity of the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.270 
is equivalent to the conductivity of the
pot<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.509> you're<00:01:57.869> using<00:01:58.079> right<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.100> if<00:01:59.189> you

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
pot that you're using right so if you

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.399 
pot that you're using right so if you

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
have a copper or brass pot that's gonna

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.620 
have a copper or brass pot that's gonna
transfer<00:02:01.950> heat<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.520> know<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> lot<00:02:02.969> quicker<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
transfer heat you know a lot quicker and

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.230 
transfer heat you know a lot quicker and
heat<00:02:04.500> up<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.740> water<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.070> lot<00:02:05.280> faster<00:02:05.820> than<00:02:06.090> if

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
heat up the water a lot faster than if

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.330 
heat up the water a lot faster than if
you<00:02:06.390> had<00:02:06.659> like<00:02:06.929> a<00:02:07.140> pot<00:02:07.409> made<00:02:07.590> out<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.859> wood<00:02:08.070> I

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
you had like a pot made out of wood I

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.440 
you had like a pot made out of wood I
mean<00:02:08.729> eventually<00:02:08.820> that<00:02:09.210> would<00:02:09.330> probably

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
mean eventually that would probably

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.780 
mean eventually that would probably
catch<00:02:09.690> fire<00:02:09.929> but<00:02:10.370> initially<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.400> know<00:02:11.730> you

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
catch fire but initially you know you

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.490 
catch fire but initially you know you
put<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.330> stove<00:02:12.630> it's<00:02:13.080> not<00:02:13.290> really

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
put that on the stove it's not really

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.810 
put that on the stove it's not really
going<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.680> heat<00:02:13.890> up<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.130> water<00:02:14.310> because<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
going to heat up the water because the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.400 
going to heat up the water because the
wood<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:15.540> not<00:02:15.690> going<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.900> transfer<00:02:16.320> the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
wood is just not going to transfer the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.110 
wood is just not going to transfer the
heat<00:02:16.790> so

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
heat so

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.869 
heat so
it's<00:02:18.450> important<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.379> realize<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.670> both
