only the background instead of being
that<00:01:38.600> kind<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:38.840> folksy<00:01:39.290> sound<00:01:39.560> it's<00:01:39.710> almost

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
from the new explosions in the sky or

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.160 
from the new explosions in the sky or
caspian<00:01:52.520> record<00:01:52.880> i'd<00:01:53.060> be<00:01:53.479> I<00:01:53.630> believe<00:01:53.990> you

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
caspian record i'd be I believe you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.200 
caspian record i'd be I believe you
right<00:01:54.470> absolute<00:01:55.369> because<00:01:55.700> that's<00:01:55.909> just<00:01:56.030> where

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
right absolute because that's just where

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.060 
right absolute because that's just where
the<00:01:56.330> guitars<00:01:56.689> in<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.990> percussion<00:01:57.500> or<00:01:57.619> rap<00:01:57.799> but

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
the guitars in the percussion or rap but

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.770 
the guitars in the percussion or rap but
also<00:01:58.250> what<00:01:58.610> I<00:01:58.640> think<00:01:58.909> is<00:01:59.030> cool<00:01:59.270> about<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.689> way

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
also what I think is cool about the way

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.840 
also what I think is cool about the way
they<00:01:59.960> produce<00:02:00.170> this<00:02:00.590> not<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:01.010> just<00:02:01.610> dive<00:02:01.820> right

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
they produce this not to just dive right

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.899 
they produce this not to just dive right
in<00:02:02.150> to<00:02:02.180> protect<00:02:02.659> me<00:02:03.170> here<00:02:03.470> but<00:02:03.680> but<00:02:04.549> one<00:02:04.759> thing

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
in to protect me here but but one thing

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.219 
in to protect me here but but one thing
you'll<00:02:05.060> notice<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:05.509> when<00:02:05.659> you<00:02:05.780> listen<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.110> this

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
you'll notice is when you listen to this

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.749 
you'll notice is when you listen to this
if<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.500> focus<00:02:06.860> on<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.009> instrumentals<00:02:07.640> the

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
if you focus on the instrumentals the

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.580 
if you focus on the instrumentals the
guitar<00:02:08.090> bass<00:02:08.360> drums<00:02:08.390> whatever<00:02:09.110> other<00:02:09.289> kind<00:02:09.560> of

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
guitar bass drums whatever other kind of

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.619 
guitar bass drums whatever other kind of
sound<00:02:09.860> scapes<00:02:10.189> are<00:02:10.340> happening<00:02:10.849> they<00:02:11.269> tend<00:02:11.569> to

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
sound scapes are happening they tend to

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.390 
sound scapes are happening they tend to
be<00:02:11.780> very<00:02:11.810> low<00:02:12.349> to<00:02:12.409> mid-range<00:02:12.739> they're<00:02:13.250> not

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
be very low to mid-range they're not

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.030 
be very low to mid-range they're not
very<00:02:13.640> bright<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:15.049> I<00:02:15.470> think<00:02:15.769> that<00:02:15.859> they<00:02:15.980> do

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
very bright and I think that they do

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.830 
very bright and I think that they do
that<00:02:16.310> on<00:02:16.459> purpose<00:02:16.489> to<00:02:17.060> leave<00:02:17.239> room<00:02:17.540> for<00:02:17.569> the

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
that on purpose to leave room for the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.319 
that on purpose to leave room for the
vocals<00:02:18.290> because<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.739> vocals<00:02:19.129> occupy<00:02:19.730> most<00:02:20.090> of

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
vocals because the vocals occupy most of

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:20.580 
vocals because the vocals occupy most of
the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.350 
the
I<00:02:20.620> end<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:21.129> the<00:02:21.250> eq's<00:02:21.640> network<00:02:22.060> so<00:02:22.239> they<00:02:22.330> just

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
I end of the eq's network so they just

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.150 
I end of the eq's network so they just
shine<00:02:22.810> overall<00:02:23.349> absolutely<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.099> that's

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
shine overall absolutely and that's

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.619 
shine overall absolutely and that's
where<00:02:24.400> that's<00:02:24.580> what<00:02:24.790> makes<00:02:24.970> these<00:02:25.120> tracks<00:02:25.450> so

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
where that's what makes these tracks so

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.540

at<00:03:16.390> you<00:03:16.569> by<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.019> end<00:03:17.230> of<00:03:17.319> it<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.530> mean<00:03:17.650> it's<00:03:18.010> just

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
at you by the end of it I mean it's just

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.280 
at you by the end of it I mean it's just
it's<00:03:18.510> moving<00:03:19.510> when<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.780> when<00:03:20.019> you<00:03:20.049> hear

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
it's moving when you when you hear

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.970 
it's moving when you when you hear
dynamic<00:03:20.829> shifts<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:22.000> powerful<00:03:22.599> in<00:03:23.379> here<00:03:23.860> it

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
dynamic shifts that powerful in here it

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.309 
dynamic shifts that powerful in here it
so<00:03:24.160> often<00:03:24.370> yeah<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:25.630> know<00:03:25.780> I<00:03:25.810> think<00:03:26.200> even

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
so often yeah and you know I think even

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.599 
so often yeah and you know I think even
the<00:03:26.530> lyrics<00:03:26.889> work<00:03:27.100> with<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.430> because

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
the lyrics work with that because

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.819 
the lyrics work with that because
they're<00:03:27.880> somewhat<00:03:28.209> evocative<00:03:28.959> they<00:03:29.410> make<00:03:29.650> you

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
they're somewhat evocative they make you

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.069 
they're somewhat evocative they make you
think<00:03:30.220> but<00:03:30.459> they're<00:03:31.120> they're<00:03:31.510> not<00:03:31.720> they're

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
think but they're they're not they're

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.870 
think but they're they're not they're
not<00:03:32.109> too<00:03:32.470> much<00:03:32.739> you<00:03:32.799> know<00:03:33.190> they're<00:03:33.459> not<00:03:33.489> too

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
not too much you know they're not too

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.270 
not too much you know they're not too
forward<00:03:34.299> they're<00:03:34.810> not<00:03:34.959> too<00:03:35.170> obvious<00:03:35.829> there's

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
forward they're not too obvious there's

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.099 
forward they're not too obvious there's
room<00:03:36.519> for<00:03:36.549> interpretation<00:03:37.030> there's<00:03:37.810> room<00:03:38.079> to

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
room for interpretation there's room to

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.750 
room for interpretation there's room to
just<00:03:38.769> listen<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.160> them<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.430> kind<00:03:39.519> of<00:03:39.609> figure

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
just listen to them and kind of figure

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.800 
just listen to them and kind of figure
out<00:03:39.970> what<00:03:40.090> they<00:03:40.209> mean<00:03:40.239> but<00:03:40.510> more<00:03:40.690> than

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
out what they mean but more than

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.390 
out what they mean but more than
anything<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:41.380> think<00:03:41.560> they<00:03:41.799> match<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.160> mood<00:03:42.310> of

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
anything I think they match the mood of

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.099 
anything I think they match the mood of
the<00:03:42.459> music<00:03:42.639> absolutely<00:03:43.269> I<00:03:43.329> like<00:03:43.510> all<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.870> time

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
the music absolutely I like all the time

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.039 
the music absolutely I like all the time
and<00:03:44.410> so<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:44.920> really<00:03:45.819> I<00:03:45.849> liked<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.510> sound<00:03:46.780> of

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
and so I really I liked the sound of

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.140 
and so I really I liked the sound of
this<00:03:47.200> album<00:03:47.470> right<00:03:48.220> away<00:03:48.489> as<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:48.819> mentioned

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150

from<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.419> get-go<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.959> just<00:03:50.139> has<00:03:50.319> this<00:03:50.560> appeal

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
from the get-go it just has this appeal

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.800 
from the get-go it just has this appeal
but<00:03:51.549> what<00:03:51.849> really<00:03:52.030> made<00:03:52.299> me<00:03:52.329> fall<00:03:52.630> in<00:03:52.660> love

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190
