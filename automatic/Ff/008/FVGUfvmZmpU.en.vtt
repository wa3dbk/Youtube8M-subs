00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
just like anything else in life if you

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.670 
just like anything else in life if you
don't<00:00:32.940> put<00:00:33.239> into<00:00:33.420> practice<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.530> won't

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
don't put into practice you just won't

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.590 
don't put into practice you just won't
get<00:00:34.920> good<00:00:35.910> at<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
get good at it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.860 
get good at it
so<00:00:37.260> if<00:00:37.980> we're<00:00:38.280> dancing<00:00:38.760> there's<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.420> rule<00:00:39.719> of

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
so if we're dancing there's a rule of

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.410 
so if we're dancing there's a rule of
thumb<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.140> for<00:00:40.649> every<00:00:40.980> one<00:00:41.309> hour<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.820> lesson

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
thumb that for every one hour of lesson

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.090 
thumb that for every one hour of lesson
you<00:00:42.870> should<00:00:42.899> put<00:00:43.200> an<00:00:43.290> equal<00:00:43.649> amount<00:00:43.950> of

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
you should put an equal amount of

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.850 
you should put an equal amount of
practice<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.820> an<00:00:45.149> hour<00:00:45.629> lesson<00:00:46.170> should<00:00:46.530> equal

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
practice so an hour lesson should equal

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.700 
practice so an hour lesson should equal
an<00:00:47.070> hour<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:48.059> practicing<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.500> way

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
an hour of practicing and that way

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.529 
an hour of practicing and that way
you'll<00:00:49.950> get<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.309> quickest<00:00:50.700> progress<00:00:51.270> and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
you'll get the quickest progress and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.060 
you'll get the quickest progress and
you're<00:00:51.809> also<00:00:51.930> going<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.199> get<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.530> best<00:00:52.770> value

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
attention to the technique you want to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.770 
attention to the technique you want to
make<00:02:51.580> sure<00:02:51.610> that<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.120> are<00:02:52.269> leading<00:02:52.450> and

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
make sure that you are leading and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.650 
make sure that you are leading and
following<00:02:53.320> because<00:02:53.799> if<00:02:54.220> both<00:02:55.060> partners<00:02:55.450> are

not leading and following with very
simple<00:02:57.610> moves<00:02:57.970> guess<00:02:58.269> what<00:02:58.510> where<00:02:59.170> they're

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
simple moves guess what where they're

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.080 
simple moves guess what where they're
not<00:02:59.380> going<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.590> be<00:02:59.739> doing<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.160> with<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.700> more

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090
