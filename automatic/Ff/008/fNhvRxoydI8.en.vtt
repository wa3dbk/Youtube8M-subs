really had no idea what to expect you
know<00:01:54.180> France<00:01:54.570> isn't<00:01:54.750> really<00:01:55.080> you<00:01:55.200> don't<00:01:55.380> want

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
know France isn't really you don't want

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.530

to talk hockey countries in the world

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.570 
to talk hockey countries in the world
but<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.470> think<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.800> fans<00:01:59.010> here<00:01:59.130> pretty<00:01:59.370> good

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
but I think the fans here pretty good

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.650 
but I think the fans here pretty good
there's<00:01:59.820> not<00:01:59.940> that<00:01:59.970> many<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.420> them<00:02:00.540> but

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
there's not that many of them but

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.660 
there's not that many of them but
they're<00:02:00.810> loud<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.320> traveled<00:02:01.740> Oh<00:02:02.160> a<00:02:02.280> games

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
they're loud that traveled Oh a games

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.960 
they're loud that traveled Oh a games
and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
and

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.210 
and
I<00:02:04.060> think<00:02:04.900> they<00:02:04.990> do<00:02:05.050> all<00:02:05.260> right<00:02:05.470> for<00:02:05.500> their<00:02:05.770> the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
I think they do all right for their the

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.100 
I think they do all right for their the
size<00:02:06.460> wow<00:02:06.880> we're<00:02:07.390> really<00:02:07.480> struggling<00:02:07.900> right

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
size wow we're really struggling right

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.410 
size wow we're really struggling right
now<00:02:08.290> I<00:02:09.190> think<00:02:09.580> we<00:02:09.729> can<00:02:09.910> string<00:02:10.119> together<00:02:10.210> a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
now I think we can string together a

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.320 
now I think we can string together a
couple<00:02:10.540> wins<00:02:10.840> here<00:02:11.050> can<00:02:12.010> maybe<00:02:12.180> make<00:02:13.180> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
couple wins here can maybe make the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.140 
couple wins here can maybe make the
playoffs<00:02:13.720> live<00:02:14.530> alone<00:02:14.830> Trevor<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.490> V<00:02:15.670> Lee<00:02:15.880> to
