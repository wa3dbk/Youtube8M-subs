00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
actually just have to hit him for it to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.910 
actually just have to hit him for it to
update<00:00:32.719> so<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.809> can<00:00:33.930> see<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.200> health<00:00:34.410> 29

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
update so you can see as health 29

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.700 
update so you can see as health 29
because<00:00:35.190> obviously<00:00:35.340> done<00:00:35.760> one<00:00:35.969> damage<00:00:36.710> then

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
because obviously done one damage then

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.470 
because obviously done one damage then
you<00:00:37.829> can<00:00:37.950> also<00:00:38.070> decrease<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.120> do<00:00:39.239> M

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
you can also decrease it you do M

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.319 
you can also decrease it you do M
decrease<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.620> then<00:00:40.770> play<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> name<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.180> then

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
decrease and then play a name and then

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.299 
decrease and then play a name and then
how<00:00:42.450> much<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.899> I'll<00:00:42.989> do<00:00:43.140> 12<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.710> time<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.219> I'll

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
how much so I'll do 12 this time so I'll

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.479 
how much so I'll do 12 this time so I'll
have<00:00:44.430> less<00:00:44.640> health<00:00:44.879> than<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.210> default<00:00:46.460> so<00:00:47.460> you

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
have less health than a default so you

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.990 
have less health than a default so you
can<00:00:47.640> see<00:00:47.760> itself<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.210> 18<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.780> time<00:00:49.910> so<00:00:50.910> you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
can see itself is 18 this time so you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.939 
can see itself is 18 this time so you
can<00:00:51.149> see<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.449> displayed<00:00:51.809> there<00:00:52.050> 18<00:00:52.559> health

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.290 

and<00:00:55.949> then<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> next<00:00:56.460> command<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.059> set<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
and then the next command is to set the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.290 
and then the next command is to set the
health<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.840> M<00:00:58.020> set<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.460> player<00:00:59.699> name<00:01:00.000> and

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.840 
update seamlessly 34 obviously done one
damage<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.659> M<00:01:18.869> reset<00:01:19.850> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.940 
damage so then you can do M reset and
then<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.119> player<00:01:21.360> name<00:01:21.630> oh<00:01:21.900> wait<00:01:22.560> you're<00:01:22.799> not

going<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> put<00:01:23.250> space<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.450> M<00:01:24.720> reset<00:01:25.170> one

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
going to put space so so M reset one

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.109 
going to put space so so M reset one
word<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.920> then<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.100> players<00:01:26.400> name<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.939> it'll

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
word and then the players name and it'll

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.530 
word and then the players name and it'll

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
reset their health to the default amount

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.940 
reset their health to the default amount
so<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.659> should<00:01:30.930> reset<00:01:31.290> his<00:01:31.380> health<00:01:31.560> back<00:01:31.770> to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
so this should reset his health back to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.880 
so this should reset his health back to
20<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.850> hit<00:01:33.030> him<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.240> should<00:01:33.420> update<00:01:33.890> ya

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
20 so if I hit him it should update ya

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.420 
20 so if I hit him it should update ya
his<00:01:35.159> health<00:01:35.369> 20<00:01:36.619> so<00:01:37.619> then<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> next<00:01:38.130> command

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
his health 20 so then the next command

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.660 
his health 20 so then the next command
is<00:01:38.579> actually<00:01:38.939> M<00:01:39.150> view<00:01:39.799> player<00:01:40.799> name<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.400> then

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
is actually M view player name and then

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.889 
is actually M view player name and then
it<00:01:41.700> will<00:01:41.909> show<00:01:41.939> me<00:01:42.210> his<00:01:42.390> health

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
it will show me his health

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.960 
it will show me his health
it's<00:01:43.649> obviously<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.369> good<00:01:44.579> because<00:01:44.850> you
