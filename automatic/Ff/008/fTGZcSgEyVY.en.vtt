00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.589
 it does not do quite well and it does 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.670
 and it's a lot of fun and fun 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.080
 of course if things are going well 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.059
 it just just makes a lot 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.910
 It's all pretty easy 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.850
 the hand and that's why I'm happy 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.359
 even first then only then 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.189
 Munich 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.699
 I've since then I'm just as easy 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.710
 and parallel slalom is what we are 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.720
 actually always requires very convenient 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.130
 has and so I got what I to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.199
 people or very good show 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.510
 can and of course I also good 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.090
 will cut off and you are 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.399
 free of complaints and healthy and fit he 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.200
 So we fit again today 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.940
 quite a load on the back and 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.239
 get my knee and now you go 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.399
 a bit tough today but tomorrow 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.710
 will be good again what are they 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.020
 Seasonal goals is still the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.550
 world championship in Schladming then where 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.969
 it's the high points now 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.579
 now at the beginning of the year and of course 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.730
 Once the new year munich it 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.979
 A spectacular for us depends on it 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.979
 January is actually like that 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.790
 salomon has the whole highlight 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.159
 bring days 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.140
 adelboden kitzbÃ¼hel that will be natural 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.610
 again something special and 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.150
 then clear the world championship in 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.080
 schladming 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.700
 I think that this world championship 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.400
 which is one of the most beautiful possible 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.299
 probably each has been given by 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.610
 the mood 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.180
 the Austrians as clear are whole 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.659
 crazy and and I'm looking forward to it 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.009
 a few very much to this year has one 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.409
 world championship have the austrians 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.659
 the pressure I have with a parcel 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.689
 getting stuck during the planning process 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.490
 also quite demanding so the 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.350
 ball goes pretty fast to the point 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.850
 but we know 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.710
 the best skiers in the world 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.350
 and we should be on the toughest 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.180
 and most demanding can hang with it 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.259
 one has even madonna again 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.119
 That was really a mental thing 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.380
 repaired and as well as very well 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.649
 works as that's why I am 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.649
 positive
