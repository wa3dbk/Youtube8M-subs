here<00:00:02.610> are<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.760> pieces<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.240> frame<00:00:03.419> each

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
here are the pieces to the frame each

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.289 
here are the pieces to the frame each
piece<00:00:04.380> is<00:00:04.440> identical<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:05.250> it<00:00:05.790> has<00:00:05.910> alongside

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
piece is identical and it has alongside

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.960 
piece is identical and it has alongside
and<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.930> short<00:00:07.170> side<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:08.130> standard<00:00:08.460> setting<00:00:08.820> is

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
and a short side the standard setting is

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.629 
and a short side the standard setting is
long<00:00:09.360> side<00:00:09.570> too<00:00:09.750> long<00:00:09.929> side<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.440> if<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.460> need

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
long side too long side and if you need

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.039 
long side too long side and if you need
to<00:00:11.820> raise<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.120> up<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.330> get<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.480> more<00:00:12.630> circular

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
to raise it up to get a more circular

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.770 
to raise it up to get a more circular
ball<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.799> would<00:00:13.950> use<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.820> long<00:00:15.030> side<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.660> one

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
ball you would use the long side to one

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.060 
ball you would use the long side to one
of<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.929> shorter<00:00:16.260> sides<00:00:16.500> you'll<00:00:16.680> just<00:00:16.800> have<00:00:16.949> to

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
of the shorter sides you'll just have to

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.290 
of the shorter sides you'll just have to
play<00:00:17.250> with<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.670> figure<00:00:17.910> out<00:00:18.000> which<00:00:18.119> one

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
play with that to figure out which one

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.300 
play with that to figure out which one
gives<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.840> best<00:00:18.960> ball<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.560> me<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
gives you the best ball for me the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.040 
gives you the best ball for me the
standard-setting<00:00:20.789> alongside<00:00:21.150> too<00:00:21.660> long<00:00:21.840> side

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
standard-setting alongside too long side

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.650 
standard-setting alongside too long side
works<00:00:22.650> just<00:00:22.890> fine<00:00:23.130> if<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.210> need<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.420> raise

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
works just fine if you do need to raise

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.750 
works just fine if you do need to raise
it<00:00:24.779> up<00:00:24.869> these<00:00:25.289> supports<00:00:25.710> may<00:00:25.890> be<00:00:25.949> helpful<00:00:26.250> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
it up these supports may be helpful to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.689 
it up these supports may be helpful to
keep<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.180> frame<00:00:27.390> from<00:00:27.599> Boeing<00:00:27.960> or<00:00:28.550> give<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.640> a

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
keep the frame from Boeing or give it a

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.849 
keep the frame from Boeing or give it a
little<00:00:29.849> more<00:00:30.119> strength<00:00:30.510> behind<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.230> will

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
little more strength behind it I will

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:50.290 
little more strength behind it I will
show<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.070> how<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.250> put<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.550> together

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.730 

and<00:00:51.300> that's<00:00:51.990> it<00:00:52.140> that's<00:00:52.260> how<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.500> put<00:00:52.710> it

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
and that's it that's how you put it

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.160 
and that's it that's how you put it
together<00:00:52.860> alongside<00:00:53.790> to<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> long<00:00:54.420> side<00:00:54.690> it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
together alongside to the long side it

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.350 
together alongside to the long side it
should<00:00:55.320> all<00:00:55.470> be<00:00:55.500> flush<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.130> the<00:00:56.220> counter<00:00:56.550> at

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
should all be flush on the counter at

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.350 
should all be flush on the counter at
this<00:00:57.630> height<00:00:58.110> and<00:00:58.730> it<00:00:59.730> doesn't<00:01:00.060> really<00:01:00.120> matter

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
this height and it doesn't really matter

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.260 
this height and it doesn't really matter
which<00:01:00.750> not<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.590> choose<00:01:02.120> basically<00:01:03.120> it's

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
which not you choose basically it's

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.700 
which not you choose basically it's
however<00:01:03.540> much<00:01:03.690> cake<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.410> work<00:01:04.559> with

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
however much cake you have to work with

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.100 
however much cake you have to work with
you<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:05.010> make<00:01:05.130> it<00:01:05.309> very<00:01:06.120> big<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.870> have<00:01:06.960> a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
you can make it very big if you have a

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.130 
you can make it very big if you have a
lot<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.350> cake<00:01:07.590> or<00:01:07.770> if<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:08.160> have<00:01:08.510> a<00:01:09.510> half<00:01:09.990> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
lot of cake or if you just have a half a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.300 
lot of cake or if you just have a half a
cake<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.470> want<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.680> use<00:01:10.800> you<00:01:10.950> can<00:01:11.100> just

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
cake you want to use you can just

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.800 
cake you want to use you can just
measure<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.090> down<00:01:12.330> accordingly<00:01:14.750> now<00:01:15.750> if

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
measure this down accordingly now if

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.910 
measure this down accordingly now if
we're<00:01:15.930> going<00:01:16.050> to<00:01:16.140> raise<00:01:16.260> it<00:01:16.410> up<00:01:16.500> we're<00:01:16.800> going

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
we're going to raise it up we're going

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.710 
we're going to raise it up we're going
to<00:01:17.010> use<00:01:17.160> the<00:01:17.310> longer<00:01:17.610> side<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> shorter

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
to use the longer side to the shorter

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.780 
to use the longer side to the shorter
side<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.620> first<00:01:19.860> step<00:01:20.100> up<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.460> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> be

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
side the first step up is going to be

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.640 
side the first step up is going to be
the<00:01:20.940> longer<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> two<00:01:21.510> and<00:01:21.869> then<00:01:22.440> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the longer of the two and then the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.900 
the longer of the two and then the
highest<00:01:22.979> setting<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.400> going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.760> this

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
highest setting is going to be this

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.590 
highest setting is going to be this
little<00:01:24.090> tiny<00:01:24.390> one<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:26.580> connect<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.030> will

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
little tiny one so to connect it will

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.140 
little tiny one so to connect it will
connect<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.470> longer<00:01:28.770> side<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.910> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
connect the longer side here to the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.800 
connect the longer side here to the
longer<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.840> shorter<00:01:31.260> sides<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.600> same

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
longer of the shorter sides and the same

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.760 
longer of the shorter sides and the same
on<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.050> other<00:01:34.110> side

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:50.440 

and<00:01:40.250> then<00:01:40.490> here

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.719 

all<00:01:51.049> right<00:01:51.170> now<00:01:51.350> we<00:01:51.409> have<00:01:51.680> it<00:01:51.890> raised<00:01:52.219> up<00:01:52.490> just

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
all right now we have it raised up just

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.490 
all right now we have it raised up just
a<00:01:52.850> little<00:01:52.969> bit<00:01:53.170> so<00:01:54.170> if<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.740> notice<00:01:56.140> these<00:01:57.140> two

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
a little bit so if you notice these two

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.169 
a little bit so if you notice these two
ends<00:01:57.680> here<00:01:58.009> are<00:01:58.159> not<00:01:58.399> touching<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.850> counter

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
ends here are not touching the counter

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.840 
ends here are not touching the counter
only<00:01:59.869> these<00:02:00.020> two<00:02:00.079> are<00:02:00.469> so<00:02:01.159> in<00:02:01.189> order<00:02:01.399> for<00:02:01.520> me<00:02:01.820> to

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
only these two are so in order for me to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.969 
only these two are so in order for me to
roll<00:02:02.149> over<00:02:02.210> this<00:02:02.689> without<00:02:02.929> it<00:02:03.259> without<00:02:03.679> it

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
roll over this without it without it

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.429 
roll over this without it without it
moving<00:02:04.100> around<00:02:04.460> I'll<00:02:04.810> put<00:02:05.810> these<00:02:06.200> little

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
moving around I'll put these little

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.350 
moving around I'll put these little
supports<00:02:06.950> underneath<00:02:07.220> since<00:02:07.819> we<00:02:07.970> use<00:02:08.149> this

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
supports underneath since we use this

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.389 
supports underneath since we use this
longer<00:02:08.750> side<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.709> raise<00:02:09.860> it<00:02:10.009> up<00:02:10.069> we're<00:02:10.280> going

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
longer side to raise it up we're going

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.850 
longer side to raise it up we're going
to<00:02:10.459> connect<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.269> longer<00:02:11.660> in<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.930> middle<00:02:12.200> to

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
to connect the longer in the middle to
