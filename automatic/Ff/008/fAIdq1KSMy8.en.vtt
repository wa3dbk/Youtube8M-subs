 It sure is a beautiful melody that goes 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.990
 give us a very easy ground 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.610

 Website gives color to i 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.110

 public and you can download 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.640
 free on the website so let's see the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.630
 tablature note each measure will have 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.670
 three times 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.050
 noting that in the first bar we 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.270
 we did not play the first time already 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.340
 we start in the second half and the last 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.440
 compass we touch the first time and 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.390
 we let the air all compass or three 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.429
 times then back to the start we 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.050
 let's use the alternate palette to 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.409
 over all the music starting to 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.460
 down the bar and we're going to 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.200
 alternately throughout the music 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.509
 watching here for the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.330
 keep the palette alternated until 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.120
 get the beat 18 notes that the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.700
 18 to 19 until an asterisk is marked there 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.650
 it's two inches down because 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.170
 because there will be a jump to fourth 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.540
 rope then this jump will get more 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.519
 easy your father is down all the 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.769
 annotations that I make in the openings in 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.900
 direction of vane the number 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.540
 fingers to be employed at last in the 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.820
 Attempt to help give you a guide 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.709
 to do the exercises nothing prevents you from 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.390
 if you disagree with some facts that 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.340
 are being suggested you make your 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.720
 way you can suddenly find a 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.820
 way that fits best with your 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.109
 smooth style you make of shape 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.850
 that you think is best 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.709
 I did not put many indications to 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.660
 respect to the number of fingers to be 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.880
 used in lowering the aperture because 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.890
 in general the number of fingers will be 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.100
 equal to the number of houses for example 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.290
 I'm going to press three in the house with the finger three 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.299
 so this will be our standard for 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.459
 this song and the exceptions so I 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:07.940
 I put it that they are the ones of irritations 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:12.500
 in bars 45 on bars 11 and 12 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:15.410
 13 in bars 16 and 17 and in the bar 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.840
 19 I'm going to play the ground very slowly to 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.380
 People pick up note by note and you 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.910
 video for video 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.310
 Are you following right to 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.310
 pad and type just let's see 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.660
 ae 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.220
 so this was our solo 3 jesus 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.410
 joy of men 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.180
 see the video again see how many times 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.610
 it is necessary for you to learn 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.860
 Do not force yourself by observing the 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.660
 suggestions for collecting and typing 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.820
 tablature is on the blog click here 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.430
 blog or in the description is just to give a 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.020
 look and as always you already know right 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.420
 staff leave your comment if you 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.130
 like that in positive is not like 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.480
 No problem too, but I say why 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.770
 What are we trying to improve? 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.660
 Video posts are fine 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.590
