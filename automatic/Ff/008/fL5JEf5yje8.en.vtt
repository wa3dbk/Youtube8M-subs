00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.290
 Like them with a tablet or 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.179
 smartphone which does not have the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.490
 corresponding connections 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.119
 anyway, come on the tv and 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.580
 is there to view and control 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.140
 especially with old trays and 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.470
 Mobile phones are missing the connections 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.380
 hdmi and here it goes about usb them 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.590
 So only need to usb cable 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.930
 in the tablet smartphone sony which im 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.140
 trade for about six euros 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.600
 Of course, the cable should also be the one 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.910
 corresponding length have for example 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.250
 when you are sitting in the bathtub and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.860
 TV is a few meters away 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.500
 You can get wonderful out of the bath 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.809
 out of the bath with the tablet 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.760
 smartphone over the cable in the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.960
 go tv and get everything in there 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.020
 great view 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.899
 The cable is plugged into smartphone 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.239
 tablet to the usb output then in 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.820
 TV to the USB plug easy 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.450
 purely where the usb stick inserted 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.119
 becomes 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.240
 a usb stick is not required 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.400
 if you do not have usb input on tv 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.320
 but only one not ni input 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.890
 then you have to get a cable 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.229
 at the end with me costs about 15 euro 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.900
 and of course, at all 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.850
 smartphones and tablets no hdmi 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.189
 you can have a connection 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.000
 Switch digital camera in between 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.340
 Watch the video from the smartphone tablet 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.540
 to then turned on camera from there 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.570
 continue to the television 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.509
 as I said, which is crucial 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.490
 outputs you have on your cellphone tablet 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.920
 and what inputs on her 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.259
 TV are with old ones 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.720
 tube TV is synonymous with klink 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.490
 cable but you get that today as yes 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.820
 between clutch certainly not more 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.960
 In addition, the image quality is poor 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.479
 choose on the video 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.820

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.700

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.160
 I sit and watch TV 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.289

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.860

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.340
 surf and everything nice in big and 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.290
 to be able to see loud in the stereo sound 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.720
 especially if you are in the apartment 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.010

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.950

 not over the appropriate connections 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.100

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.110
 Come and see and control there 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.600

 especially with old trays and 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.490
 Mobile phones are missing the connections 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.400
 hdmi and here it goes about usb them 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.580
 So only need to usb cable 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.920
 in the tablet smartphone sony which im 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.840
 to get trade for about six euros 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.160
 are 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.620
 of course, the cable should also 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.989
 corresponding length have for example 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.270
 when you are sitting in the bathtub and the 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.880
 TV is a few meters away 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.520
 You can get wonderful out of the bath 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.800
 out of the bath with the tablet 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.750
 smartphone over the cable in the 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.950
 go tv and get everything in there 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.010
 great view 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.890
 The cable is plugged into the smartphone 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.200
 tablet to the usb output then in 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.810
 TV to the USB plug easy 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.470
 purely where the usb stick inserted 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.110
 becomes 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.230
 a usb stick is not required 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.390
 if you do not have usb input on tv 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.880
 but only one not ni input 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.060
 then you have to get an indication on 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.250
 the end with me costs about 15 euros 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.890
 and of course if you are old 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.840
 smartphones and tablets no hdmi 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.180
 you can have a connection 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.019
 Switch digital camera in between 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.330
 Watch the video from the smartphone tablet 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.700
 to switched on camera from there on 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.640
 continue to the television as I said 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.340
 the decisive factor is what kind of outputs do you have 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.640
 have your mobile tablet and which 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.680
 Entrances on your TV are included 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.660
 old tube-TV 's that too 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.060
 with clinic cable but you get that 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.799
 today yes as between clutch even 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.310
 no more besides, the picture quality 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.650
 bad you see on the video there 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.200
 I have shown all variants and it 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.840
 makes fun in the bathtub to sit 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.479
 and on the tv I have too 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.060
 one in the bathroom over the internet 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.099
 mobile phone or tablet to surf and 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.340
 everything is great in big and loud in the 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:39.289
 to be able to see stereotypically 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.720
 especially if you are in the apartment 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.910
 have and the mobile tablet over plan 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.599
 is activated because it is nothing 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.599
 costs
