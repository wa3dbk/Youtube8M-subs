00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and it'll show you how to do moonlit sky

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.230 
and it'll show you how to do moonlit sky
with<00:01:13.860> some<00:01:14.010> clouds<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.610> check<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.210> out

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
with some clouds so check that one out

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.969 
with some clouds so check that one out
and<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:16.710> video<00:01:17.280> kind<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.670> skipped<00:01:17.939> here<00:01:18.950> when<00:01:19.950> I

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
and a video kind of skipped here when I

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.060 
and a video kind of skipped here when I
was<00:01:20.130> recording<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.960> but<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.380> added<00:01:22.920> in

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
was recording it but I just added in

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.640 
was recording it but I just added in
basic<00:01:23.990> foreground<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.259> some<00:01:25.439> background

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
basic foreground and some background

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.710 
basic foreground and some background
trees<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.280> also<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:27.000> another<00:01:27.270> video<00:01:27.509> that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
trees I also have another video that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.569 
trees I also have another video that
shows<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.080> how<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.350> do<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.310> check<00:01:29.520> that

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
shows you how to do that so check that

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.880 
shows you how to do that so check that
out<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.060> well<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:31.290> believe<00:01:31.560> that's<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
out as well and I believe that's the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.370 
out as well and I believe that's the
spiral<00:01:32.460> tree<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.570> shows<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.869> how<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.960> do<00:01:34.140> some

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
spiral tree it shows you how to do some

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.679 
spiral tree it shows you how to do some
background<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.130> some<00:01:35.460> foreground<00:01:35.970> very

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
background and some foreground very

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.359 
background and some foreground very
simple<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:38.900> here<00:01:39.900> I'm<00:01:40.049> painting<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.890> light

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
simple and here I'm painting in a light

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.149 
simple and here I'm painting in a light
outline<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.509> tree<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.140> was<00:01:43.530> afraid<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.890> do

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
outline of a tree I was afraid to do

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.219 
outline of a tree I was afraid to do
dark<00:01:44.430> at<00:01:44.610> first<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.540> tree<00:01:45.780> has<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:45.990> be

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
dark at first because the tree has to be

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.090 
dark at first because the tree has to be
a<00:01:46.259> dark<00:01:46.649> brown<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.200> was<00:01:49.350> kind<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.619> winging<00:01:49.860> it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
a dark brown so I was kind of winging it

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.270 
a dark brown so I was kind of winging it
here<00:01:50.990> but<00:01:51.990> eventually<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.590> got<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.890> outline

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
here but eventually I got the outline

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.870 
here but eventually I got the outline
how<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.520> wanted<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.710> so<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.100> eventually<00:01:56.369> start

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
how I wanted it so I eventually start

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.240 
how I wanted it so I eventually start
painting<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.450> darker<00:01:58.140> color<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.890> which

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
painting in the darker color on it which

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.010 
painting in the darker color on it which
you<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.490> see<00:01:59.790> here<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> painted<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.180> dark

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
you can see here so I painted a dark

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.319 
you can see here so I painted a dark
purple<00:02:04.590> brown<00:02:04.890> color<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.670> now<00:02:05.909> I'm<00:02:06.030> throwing

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
purple brown color and now I'm throwing

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.369 
purple brown color and now I'm throwing
on<00:02:06.509> some<00:02:06.750> gnarly<00:02:07.110> moss<00:02:07.849> hanging<00:02:08.849> down<00:02:09.379> just

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
on some gnarly moss hanging down just

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.680 
on some gnarly moss hanging down just
gives<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.860> kind<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.459> creepy<00:02:11.910> effect<00:02:12.330> even

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
gives it a kind of a creepy effect even

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.640 
gives it a kind of a creepy effect even
though<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:13.080> kind<00:02:13.290> of

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
though it's kind of

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.000

the tree there you can see it's really
pronounced<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:11.790> left<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.209> darker<00:03:12.659> color

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
of the foreground

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.229 
of the foreground
I<00:03:14.099> added<00:03:14.310> some<00:03:14.430> dark<00:03:14.819> green<00:03:15.530> on<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:17.250> back<00:03:17.940> side

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
I added some dark green on the back side

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.750 
I added some dark green on the back side
of<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.510> tree<00:03:18.780> there<00:03:19.019> on<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.500> grass<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:20.549> show<00:03:20.730> a

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
of the tree there on the grass to show a

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.259 
of the tree there on the grass to show a
shadow<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:22.130> then<00:03:23.130> around<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.549> moon<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:24.090> gave

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
shadow and then around the moon I gave

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.150 
shadow and then around the moon I gave
some<00:03:24.540> kind<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.810> glowing<00:03:25.260> clouds<00:03:25.620> which

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
some kind of glowing clouds which

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.069 
some kind of glowing clouds which
honestly<00:03:26.849> we're<00:03:27.000> kind<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.359> a<00:03:27.419> mistake<00:03:27.840> I

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
honestly we're kind of a mistake I

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.920 
honestly we're kind of a mistake I
should<00:03:28.470> have<00:03:28.650> just<00:03:28.980> blurred<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.760> moon<00:03:30.000> like

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
should have just blurred the moon like

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.409 
should have just blurred the moon like
in<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.169> night<00:03:31.349> sky<00:03:31.620> video<00:03:31.980> if<00:03:32.879> you<00:03:33.000> check<00:03:33.239> that

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
in the night sky video if you check that

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.509 
in the night sky video if you check that
one<00:03:33.569> out<00:03:33.599> if<00:03:34.349> you<00:03:34.500> kind<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.739> just<00:03:34.950> blur<00:03:35.280> the

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
one out if you kind of just blur the

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.220 
one out if you kind of just blur the
moon<00:03:35.730> it'll<00:03:36.030> give<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.480> glowing<00:03:36.840> effect

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
moon it'll give it a glowing effect

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.440 
moon it'll give it a glowing effect
without<00:03:37.590> getting<00:03:38.099> see<00:03:38.790> there<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.030> can<00:03:39.150> see<00:03:39.329> it

without getting see there you can see it

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.220 
without getting see there you can see it
