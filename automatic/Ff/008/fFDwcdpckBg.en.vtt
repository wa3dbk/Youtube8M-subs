trying<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.340> free<00:00:47.460> all<00:00:47.579> had<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> get<00:00:48.149> outworked

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
trying to free all had to get outworked

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.020 
trying to free all had to get outworked
and<00:00:48.750> why<00:00:48.930> do<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.170> get<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:49.530> i<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:50.579> was<00:00:50.879> just

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
and why do you get up i think was just

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.819 
and why do you get up i think was just
the<00:00:51.149> lack<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.690> communication<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.559> had

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
the lack of communication that we had

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.369 
the lack of communication that we had
not<00:00:53.610> coming<00:00:53.910> out<00:00:54.000> as<00:00:54.120> much<00:00:54.270> fire<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:55.230> we
