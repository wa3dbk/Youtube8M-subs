00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.540
 the point of voting 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.540
 this point is whether it has been 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.089
 let's assume you already have a fabric 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:10.879
 It is from 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.359
 one of the parts of the work 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.739
