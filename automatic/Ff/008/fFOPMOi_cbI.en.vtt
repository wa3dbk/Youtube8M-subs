 forester's house we can enter and we can not 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.370

 Must be lords can be no it is impossible here a lot 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.620
 people, but in principle you can see 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.440
 what is going on here 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:24.110

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.280
 master class at the factory I saw a bottle 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.130
 hot faces of those present at it and 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.260
 say what it's nice when you 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.180
 giving out autographs in fact this 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.730
 very cool when you understand that 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.740
 how would you still young but you already 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.260
 there were some viewers who 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.590
 who like your creativity then what 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.060
 you do and they come to the meeting 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.370
 listen to what you tell 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.580
 even at the end here leave some 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.260
 autograph or not they are usually in principle 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.500
 but you actually have some 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.080
 last year there was a huge leap 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.540
 subscribers tell about their recruitment methods 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.860
 In general, I initially went out 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.110
 out show 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.600
 test there is only one video category 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.030
 this is exactly the sketch show we chose the theme and 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.400
 on this subject filmed different sketches in 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.080
 I finally realized that there is such a thing as 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.630
 Colloboration with other videobloger 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.010
 the more there signed a contract with 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.959
 business company is good i mean we 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.770
 We work together and I have appeared 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.140
 some exits 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.580
 other video bloggers, I realized what it is 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.470
 In principle, you can somehow useful 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.280
 You can use it first with the guys 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.900
 meet and secondly shoot something 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.790
 joint well and so dressed project 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.000
 star challenge where different known 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.460
 personalities send us assignments of different 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.800
 formats and in the end we execute them 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.290
 most like and happy 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.030
 subscribers to other video bloggers what 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.230
 fuzzy individual projects well and their 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.390
 the fact that some here are videobloger 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.400
 lit up our project seems to me 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.650
 many girls who if signed 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.240
 very interested and the main issue 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:11.190
 You know the girl is actually a lot 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.510
 attention from a female female but I 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.010
 rarely met girls 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.620
 that is, if I had any 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.790
 relationship this very rare was well 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.460
 somewhere 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.160
 well , about three four girls I had 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.459
 and we with him not very long and meets 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.049
 we are not the characters 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.230
 I now begin to slowly understand 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:36.049
 why are creative people actors 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.700
 dancers and singers start dating 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.799
 people who have some kind of mutual 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.409
 separate issue here is understanding 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.780
 Here there is in this area so there is no I until 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.819
 freedom yet so she just gotta lie down 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.219
 the future is your chosen one to have some 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.379
 attitude to your current kind 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:55.379
 activities would actually like 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.180
 I would like to yes but at the same time as if not 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.879
 I wanted it to be very little 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.519
 the mask is such a lady hostess that is when 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.439
 I come the more I live alone I usually 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.169
 come home 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:09.659
 nothing to eat at home I'm tired 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.400
 Dad's too lazy to cook something 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.079
 falls there quickly or in short 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.180
 to knock myself off when i want 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:18.180
 come home to be homely 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.190
