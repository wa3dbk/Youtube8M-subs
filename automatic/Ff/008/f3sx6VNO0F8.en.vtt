if<00:00:07.510> you<00:00:07.630> ever<00:00:07.690> taken<00:00:08.050> chemistry<00:00:08.230> you<00:00:08.740> probably

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
if you ever taken chemistry you probably

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.070 
if you ever taken chemistry you probably
saw<00:00:09.250> that<00:00:09.550> periodic<00:00:10.240> table<00:00:10.720> all<00:00:10.900> those

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
saw that periodic table all those

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.250 
saw that periodic table all those
different<00:00:11.470> boxes<00:00:12.460> with<00:00:12.610> those<00:00:12.760> elements<00:00:13.260> well

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
different boxes with those elements well

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.600 
different boxes with those elements well
those<00:00:14.500> are<00:00:14.680> things<00:00:14.920> that<00:00:15.099> make<00:00:15.309> up<00:00:15.460> this

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
those are things that make up this

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.630 
those are things that make up this
planet<00:00:15.940> and<00:00:16.299> the<00:00:16.359> way<00:00:16.510> it<00:00:16.630> works<00:00:16.869> is<00:00:17.109> those

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
planet and the way it works is those

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.909 
planet and the way it works is those
metallic<00:00:18.640> minerals<00:00:19.240> and<00:00:19.480> rocks<00:00:19.810> are<00:00:20.589> supposed

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
metallic minerals and rocks are supposed

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.649 
metallic minerals and rocks are supposed
to<00:00:20.980> be<00:00:21.159> in<00:00:21.279> the<00:00:21.489> soil<00:00:21.820> and<00:00:22.119> the<00:00:22.210> plant<00:00:22.539> is

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:22.659 
to be in the soil and the plant is

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:24.179 
to be in the soil and the plant is
supposed<00:00:22.869> to<00:00:22.960> break<00:00:23.140> it<00:00:23.289> down<00:00:23.380> and<00:00:23.619> pull<00:00:23.949> it

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
supposed to break it down and pull it

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.579 
supposed to break it down and pull it
into<00:00:24.489> the<00:00:24.640> plant<00:00:24.909> and<00:00:25.060> convert<00:00:25.900> it<00:00:26.079> into<00:00:26.380> a

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:26.589 
into the plant and convert it into a

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.739 
into the plant and convert it into a
plant<00:00:27.009> base<00:00:27.279> mineral<00:00:28.239> that<00:00:28.269> we're<00:00:28.480> supposed

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:28.749 
plant base mineral that we're supposed

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.809 
plant base mineral that we're supposed
to<00:00:28.839> eat<00:00:29.109> because<00:00:29.470> it's<00:00:29.800> easier<00:00:30.099> to<00:00:30.220> digest<00:00:30.339> a

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:30.819 
to eat because it's easier to digest a

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:33.709 
to eat because it's easier to digest a
plant-based<00:00:31.179> mineral<00:00:31.539> but<00:00:32.290> unfortunately

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
plant-based mineral but unfortunately

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.790 
plant-based mineral but unfortunately
manufacturing<00:00:34.719> company<00:00:35.109> especially<00:00:35.320> likes

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
manufacturing company especially likes

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.110 
manufacturing company especially likes
cereals<00:00:36.309> and<00:00:36.579> vitamin<00:00:37.000> companies<00:00:37.989> and<00:00:38.410> even

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
companies that make baby food are now

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.770 
companies that make baby food are now
using<00:00:42.570> not<00:00:43.570> just<00:00:43.600> synthetic<00:00:44.410> vitamins<00:00:44.949> but

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
using not just synthetic vitamins but

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.349 
using not just synthetic vitamins but
metallic<00:00:46.780> minerals<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:47.800> even<00:00:48.760> rocks<00:00:49.030> like

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
metallic minerals and even rocks like

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:51.810 
metallic minerals and even rocks like
calcium<00:00:49.600> carbonate<00:00:50.379> and<00:00:50.649> the<00:00:51.519> metallic

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
calcium carbonate and the metallic

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.220 
calcium carbonate and the metallic
mineral<00:00:52.329> for<00:00:52.449> iron<00:00:52.660> would<00:00:52.780> be<00:00:52.870> ferrous

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
mineral for iron would be ferrous

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.060 
mineral for iron would be ferrous
sulfate<00:00:53.710> so<00:00:54.670> it's<00:00:55.030> my<00:00:55.390> belief<00:00:55.660> in<00:00:56.350> my<00:00:56.530> opinion

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
sulfate so it's my belief in my opinion

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.950 
sulfate so it's my belief in my opinion
that<00:00:57.100> there's<00:00:57.879> a<00:00:57.999> huge<00:00:58.300> difference<00:00:58.539> between

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
that there's a huge difference between

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.689 
that there's a huge difference between
plant<00:00:59.620> base<00:00:59.859> and<00:01:00.539> these<00:01:01.739> rocks<00:01:02.739> and<00:01:03.100> metals

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
plant base and these rocks and metals

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.000 
plant base and these rocks and metals
for<00:01:04.120> our<00:01:04.239> health<00:01:04.570> I<00:01:04.900> believe<00:01:05.650> that<00:01:05.830> they're

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
for our health I believe that they're

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.520 
for our health I believe that they're
definitely<00:01:06.340> not<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.850> best<00:01:07.060> so<00:01:07.390> let<00:01:08.260> me<00:01:08.380> show

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
definitely not the best so let me show

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.320 
definitely not the best so let me show
you<00:01:08.620> what<00:01:08.740> I'm<00:01:08.860> talking<00:01:08.920> about<00:01:09.280> check<00:01:10.180> this

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
you what I'm talking about check this

you what I'm talking about check this
out<00:01:10.570> I<00:01:10.930> have<00:01:11.230> some<00:01:11.830> ordinary<00:01:12.190> cereal<00:01:12.940> from<00:01:13.120> the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
out I have some ordinary cereal from the

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.790 
out I have some ordinary cereal from the
grocery<00:01:13.450> store<00:01:13.570> and<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:14.080> have<00:01:14.230> a<00:01:14.260> very<00:01:14.470> strong

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
grocery store and I have a very strong

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.160 
grocery store and I have a very strong
magnet<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.550> I'm<00:01:16.090> just<00:01:16.210> gonna<00:01:16.330> crush<00:01:16.930> up<00:01:17.140> some

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
magnet and I'm just gonna crush up some

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.640 
magnet and I'm just gonna crush up some
of<00:01:17.410> the<00:01:17.500> cereal<00:01:17.980> just<00:01:18.220> to<00:01:18.850> show<00:01:19.180> you<00:01:19.650> what

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
of the cereal just to show you what

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.900 
of the cereal just to show you what
happens<00:01:21.360> -<00:01:22.620> look<00:01:23.620> at<00:01:23.710> this<00:01:23.800> look<00:01:24.190> at<00:01:24.280> this<00:01:24.430> look

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.720 

at<00:01:27.910> that<00:01:28.090> it's<00:01:28.900> magnetic<00:01:29.530> it<00:01:29.650> has<00:01:29.830> metal<00:01:30.520> in

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
at that it's magnetic it has metal in

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.140 
at that it's magnetic it has metal in
there<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.740> that's<00:01:32.740> why<00:01:33.040> I<00:01:33.070> cling<00:01:33.670> so<00:01:34.000> the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
there and that's why I cling so the

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.230 
there and that's why I cling so the
metal<00:01:34.540> that's<00:01:35.340> attracted<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.520> this<00:01:36.670> magnet<00:01:37.150> is

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
metal that's attracted to this magnet is

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.030 
metal that's attracted to this magnet is
iron<00:01:37.600> so<00:01:38.530> they<00:01:38.740> use<00:01:38.920> metallic<00:01:39.580> iron<00:01:40.450> in<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.830> lot

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
iron so they use metallic iron in a lot

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.800 
iron so they use metallic iron in a lot
of<00:01:42.070> these<00:01:42.190> cereals<00:01:42.760> that<00:01:42.970> are<00:01:43.090> promoted<00:01:43.480> to<00:01:43.690> be

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
of these cereals that are promoted to be

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.400 
of these cereals that are promoted to be
health<00:01:44.140> foods<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.790> that's<00:01:45.870> why<00:01:46.870> they<00:01:47.080> cling

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
health foods and that's why they cling

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.520 
health foods and that's why they cling
to<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.770> magnet<00:01:48.280> yeah<00:01:49.270> it's<00:01:49.450> amazing<00:01:49.690> so<00:01:50.230> I

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
to the magnet yeah it's amazing so I

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.740 
to the magnet yeah it's amazing so I
just<00:01:51.490> wanted<00:01:51.700> to<00:01:51.820> do<00:01:51.910> a<00:01:51.940> little<00:01:52.060> demo<00:01:52.510> there

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
just wanted to do a little demo there

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.400 
just wanted to do a little demo there
and<00:01:53.370> show<00:01:54.370> you<00:01:54.400> that<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.960> is<00:01:56.140> what<00:01:56.290> we're

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
and show you that this is what we're

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.170 
and show you that this is what we're
feeding<00:01:56.590> our<00:01:56.830> kids<00:01:57.750> amazing<00:01:59.550> and<00:02:00.550> there<00:02:00.730> we<00:02:00.820> go

feeding our kids amazing and there we go

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.210 
feeding our kids amazing and there we go
reduced<00:02:01.600> iron<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.730> synthetic<00:02:03.730> vitamins
