00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
here as you can see we got it tightened

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070 
here as you can see we got it tightened
almost<00:01:14.490> all<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.909> way<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.390> think<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
almost all the way up I think it

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.690 
almost all the way up I think it
actually<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.799> all<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.070> threads<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:17.549> up

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
actually it is it all the threads are up

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.420 
actually it is it all the threads are up
lots<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.540> spring<00:01:18.840> tension<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> head<00:01:19.619> makes

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
lots of spring tension on the head makes

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.630 
lots of spring tension on the head makes
it<00:01:20.610> light<00:01:21.680> very<00:01:22.680> light<00:01:22.920> for<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.159> pickup<00:01:23.340> wheel

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
it light very light for the pickup wheel

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.140 
it light very light for the pickup wheel
so<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.689> will<00:01:24.780> float<00:01:24.990> across<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.409> ground<00:01:26.150> here

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
so it will float across the ground here

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.270 
so it will float across the ground here

chain this chain in the front I

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.830 
chain this chain in the front I
recommend<00:05:24.580> changing<00:05:24.790> every<00:05:25.210> four<00:05:25.480> to<00:05:25.660> five

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
recommend changing every four to five

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.420 
recommend changing every four to five
years<00:05:26.230> depending<00:05:26.350> on<00:05:26.830> how<00:05:26.980> much<00:05:27.100> hay<00:05:27.250> you're

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
years depending on how much hay you're

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.430 
years depending on how much hay you're
bailing<00:05:27.580> because<00:05:28.360> this<00:05:28.810> chain<00:05:29.110> drives

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
bailing because this chain drives

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.760 
bailing because this chain drives
everything<00:05:29.770> except<00:05:30.550> for<00:05:30.670> the<00:05:30.760> pickup<00:05:31.030> hat<00:05:31.770> so

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
everything except for the pickup hat so

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.230 
everything except for the pickup hat so
let's<00:05:32.950> taking<00:05:33.190> a<00:05:33.280> lot<00:05:33.430> of<00:05:33.550> stress<00:05:33.820> is<00:05:33.970> taking

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
let's taking a lot of stress is taking
