00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.890 
figures of like super saiyan 3 vegito
that<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.720> can<00:02:21.870> only<00:02:22.020> find<00:02:22.380> in<00:02:22.620> Japan<00:02:23.569> and<00:02:24.569> you

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
that you can only find in Japan and you

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.750 
that you can only find in Japan and you
know<00:02:24.990> Japan<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:25.590> much<00:02:25.740> more<00:02:25.770> exclusive

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
know Japan is so much more exclusive

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.670 
know Japan is so much more exclusive
than<00:02:26.790> what<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:27.300> have<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.959> rest<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.470> world

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
than what we have the rest of the world

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.910 
than what we have the rest of the world
you<00:02:28.890> know<00:02:29.040> because<00:02:29.940> naturally<00:02:30.900> Japan<00:02:31.709> is

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
you know because naturally Japan is

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.190 
you know because naturally Japan is
where<00:02:32.400> dragon<00:02:32.850> ball<00:02:32.970> z<00:02:33.120> was<00:02:33.270> born<00:02:33.630> in<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.930> sense

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
where dragon ball z was born in a sense

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.640 
where dragon ball z was born in a sense
so<00:02:35.160> it's<00:02:35.819> kind<00:02:36.569> of<00:02:36.600> logical<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.319> it<00:02:37.470> would

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
so it's kind of logical that it would

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.380 
so it's kind of logical that it would
have<00:02:37.800> more<00:02:38.040> exclusive<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.790> guess<00:02:38.940> we<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:39.180> say

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
have more exclusive I guess we can say

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.290 
have more exclusive I guess we can say
but<00:02:40.319> anyways<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.739> mean<00:02:41.010> that's<00:02:41.850> not<00:02:42.030> fair

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
but anyways I mean that's not fair

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.210 
but anyways I mean that's not fair
towards<00:02:42.780> us<00:02:43.050> but<00:02:43.290> anyways<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:45.709> then<00:02:46.709> mean
