 Hi, how are you all good? 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.300
 we are not here with an explanatory video 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.809
 as regards repair of errors of the 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:17.460
 ego legends you will see something about 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:19.380
 days the new patch appeared with yasuo 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.829
 and good, too, things that had been done 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.039
 some champions I started to install it 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:28.390
 update and for I do not know why without 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.750
 no reason 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.720
 I could not get it to install itself 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.980
 it separated the launcher it did not work 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.030
 and well I tried to go a little to the 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.970
 people 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.540
 berrÃ­os in the forums and others that 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.010
 they could help me but there was no way 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.170
 with which I'm going to show you some 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.020
 techniques that can help you if the 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.880
 launcher works well for us 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.280
 update completely if it is missing some 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.410
 folders and they make some mistakes me 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.720
 I have managed to fix it and I can 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.489
 I'm going to show you what I did in 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.729
 first place you see us here to these 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.799
 wheels 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.080
 you have to deactivate the settings 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.570
 spirit pit agreement the duties 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.900
 activated then you have to deactivate us 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.360
 and you will have to give it here to the solution 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.970
 of problems you give in repair here you 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.380
 He says attention can take a long time 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:31.540
 they are actually between 15 or 30 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:34.170
 minutes depending on your computer 's 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.369
 the wifi connection you have and so on 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.800
 later some will be saved 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.520
 records with all the analysis that there 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.630
 of cheerios you can have a computer 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:50.390
 to help you 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:52.250
 finally once you repair this 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.500
 in theory it is to solve problems 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.840
 the launcher will simply be activated 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.880
 again and you will not have any problem 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.070

 check files damaged files 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.980

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.340
 merino you have and communicates it to 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.340
 server 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.650
 later I will upload another video with a 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.860
 problem solver that the 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.430
 river employees have proposed as soon as 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.010
 to delete some folders and others to 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.260
 to see if it can help you like this 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.180
