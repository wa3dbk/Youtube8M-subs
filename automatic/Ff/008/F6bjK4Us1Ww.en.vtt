00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
them eat on the ground and you can take

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.890 
them eat on the ground and you can take
them<00:01:03.090> for<00:01:03.390> grazing<00:01:03.750> walks<00:01:05.060> the<00:01:06.060> most<00:01:06.420> body

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
them for grazing walks the most body

them for grazing walks the most body
parts<00:01:07.619> move<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.580> greatest<00:01:09.330> range<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.810> motion

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
parts move the greatest range of motion

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.219 
parts move the greatest range of motion
at<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.070> walk<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:12.030> because<00:01:12.270> they're<00:01:12.540> their

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
at the walk so because they're their

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.370 
at the walk so because they're their
jaws<00:01:13.619> their<00:01:14.400> dental<00:01:14.760> structure<00:01:15.210> also<00:01:15.479> evolved

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
jaws their dental structure also evolved

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.560 
jaws their dental structure also evolved

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
for eating on the ground and we've not

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.850 
for eating on the ground and we've not
only<00:01:18.600> changed<00:01:19.110> their<00:01:19.259> diet

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
only changed their diet

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.630 
only changed their diet
we've<00:01:20.159> changed<00:01:20.369> everything<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:22.640> now

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
we've changed everything and now

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.270 
we've changed everything and now
dentistry<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.689> discovering<00:01:25.380> problems<00:01:25.979> that

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
dentistry is discovering problems that

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.760 
dentistry is discovering problems that
I'm<00:01:26.970> sure<00:01:27.420> didn't<00:01:27.720> exist<00:01:28.049> before<00:01:28.200> because

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
I'm sure didn't exist before because

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.950 
I'm sure didn't exist before because
horses<00:01:29.280> wouldn't<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.210> maintained<00:01:30.840> their

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
horses wouldn't have maintained their

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.620 
horses wouldn't have maintained their
teeth<00:01:31.200> or<00:01:31.439> they<00:01:31.710> would<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:31.920> evolved<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
teeth or they would have evolved a

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.780 
teeth or they would have evolved a
different<00:01:33.630> situation<00:01:34.040> so<00:01:35.040> their<00:01:35.280> teeth<00:01:35.549> and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
different situation so their teeth and

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.020 
different situation so their teeth and
their<00:01:36.210> respiratory<00:01:36.600> tract<00:01:37.850> ignition<00:01:38.850> léa

their respiratory tract ignition léa

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.219 
their respiratory tract ignition léa
fected<00:01:39.689> by<00:01:40.380> feeding<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.670> ground<00:01:42.229> because

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
fected by feeding on the ground because

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.280 
fected by feeding on the ground because
when<00:01:43.350> they<00:01:43.439> pull<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.979> hay<00:01:44.189> out<00:01:44.220> all<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.869> dust

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
when they pull that hay out all the dust

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.530 
when they pull that hay out all the dust
and<00:01:46.649> allergens<00:01:46.770> go<00:01:47.399> right<00:01:47.640> up<00:01:47.790> their<00:01:47.970> nose<00:01:48.180> and

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and allergens go right up their nose and

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.960 
and allergens go right up their nose and
they<00:01:49.049> can't<00:01:49.350> blow<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.950> out<00:01:50.130> either<00:01:50.670> because

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
they can't blow it out either because

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.149 
they can't blow it out either because
their<00:01:51.299> heads<00:01:51.540> up<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.990> their<00:01:52.409> neck<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.799> craned

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
their heads up and their neck is craned

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.789 
their heads up and their neck is craned
because<00:01:53.759> they<00:01:53.880> always<00:01:54.240> choose<00:01:54.570> one<00:01:55.020> side<00:01:55.380> of

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
because they always choose one side of

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.590 
because they always choose one side of
the<00:01:55.920> hay<00:01:56.070> rack<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.579> lot<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.090> times<00:01:57.240> because<00:01:57.390> it's

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
the hay rack a lot of times because it's

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.060 
the hay rack a lot of times because it's
in<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.960> corner<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.350> they<00:01:58.439> have<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.040> so

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
in the corner and they have to and so

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.730
