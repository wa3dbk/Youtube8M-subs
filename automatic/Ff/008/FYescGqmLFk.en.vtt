wrong<00:00:26.130> i<00:00:26.840> find<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.050> legatus<00:00:28.439> it's<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:29.010> little

wrong i find the legatus it's a little
bit<00:00:29.400> too<00:00:29.640> complex<00:00:30.150> for<00:00:30.359> people<00:00:30.840> under<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.199> age

move<00:01:42.299> up<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.600> little<00:01:42.720> bit<00:01:42.930> closer<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.619> can

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
move up a little bit closer so you can

two pieces in the back of another oops
you<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.909> get<00:01:54.920> open-pit<00:01:58.250> your<00:01:59.250> third<00:01:59.700> piece<00:02:00.270> of

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
you can get open-pit your third piece of

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.010 
you can get open-pit your third piece of
cargo<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.710> front<00:02:02.090> was<00:02:03.090> raring<00:02:03.540> for<00:02:03.570> maybe

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
cargo in the front was raring for maybe

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.670 
cargo in the front was raring for maybe
a<00:02:04.140> few<00:02:04.469> parcels<00:02:05.189> or<00:02:05.430> something<00:02:06.000> um<00:02:06.469> I<00:02:07.469> guess

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
a few parcels or something um I guess

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.040 
a few parcels or something um I guess
that<00:02:07.920> was<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.160> reason<00:02:08.640> for<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.149> extra<00:02:09.660> room<00:02:09.869> in

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
that was a reason for the extra room in

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.760 
that was a reason for the extra room in
the<00:02:10.170> front<00:02:10.410> was<00:02:10.709> for<00:02:11.009> these<00:02:11.190> parcels

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
the front was for these parcels

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.120 
the front was for these parcels
as<00:02:13.850> this<00:02:14.850> does<00:02:15.270> come<00:02:15.720> as<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.050> part<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.710> a<00:02:16.860> bigger

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
as this does come as a part of a bigger

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.960 
as this does come as a part of a bigger
set<00:02:17.990> now<00:02:18.990> looking<00:02:19.440> at<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.980> truck<00:02:22.820> shut<00:02:23.820> the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
set now looking at the truck shut the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.490 
set now looking at the truck shut the
side<00:02:24.270> down<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:25.500> can<00:02:26.430> turn<00:02:29.510> whoops<00:02:30.510> very

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
side down so I can turn whoops very

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.740 
side down so I can turn whoops very
fiddly<00:02:31.920> little<00:02:32.130> bits<00:02:32.700> that's<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.240> reason<00:02:33.570> why

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
fiddly little bits that's the reason why

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.720 
fiddly little bits that's the reason why
I<00:02:36.050> reckon<00:02:37.050> these<00:02:37.230> like<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.680> thing<00:02:38.430> should<00:02:38.670> be

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
I reckon these like a thing should be

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.530 
I reckon these like a thing should be
really<00:02:39.180> models<00:02:39.660> not<00:02:39.990> toys<00:02:40.440> for<00:02:40.860> kids<00:02:41.100> as<00:02:41.540> you

has done is these new mudguards they've
brought<00:03:12.690> out<00:03:12.990> a<00:03:13.340> lot<00:03:14.340> more<00:03:14.520> realistic<00:03:14.970> as<00:03:15.630> you

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
brought out a lot more realistic as you

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.250 
brought out a lot more realistic as you
can<00:03:16.050> see<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.530> foot<00:03:16.800> stairs<00:03:17.480> into<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.930> design

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
can see that foot stairs into the design

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
slight differences in topic because I've

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.020 
slight differences in topic because I've
lost<00:04:15.540> some<00:04:15.959> pieces<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.310> replaced<00:04:17.820> some

lost some pieces and I replaced some

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.790 
lost some pieces and I replaced some
assume<00:04:18.540> are<00:04:18.720> looking<00:04:19.370> pieces<00:04:20.370> of<00:04:20.760> Lego<00:04:20.940> and

assume are looking pieces of Lego and

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.409 
assume are looking pieces of Lego and
the<00:04:22.800> stick<00:04:23.130> is<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.310> little<00:04:23.669> bit<00:04:23.789> odd<00:04:23.970> because<00:04:24.270> I

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
the stick is a little bit odd because I

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.940 
the stick is a little bit odd because I
broke<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:24.840> within

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
broke it within

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.210 
broke it within
a<00:04:26.010> couple<00:04:27.000> hours<00:04:27.180> of<00:04:27.570> building<00:04:28.050> it<00:04:28.200> so<00:04:28.920> I

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
a couple hours of building it so I

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.150 
a couple hours of building it so I
didn't<00:04:29.700> do<00:04:29.850> these<00:04:30.090> right<00:04:30.570> so<00:04:30.930> fix<00:04:31.560> them<00:04:31.860> up<00:04:31.890> in

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
didn't do these right so fix them up in

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.330 
didn't do these right so fix them up in
the<00:04:32.280> coming<00:04:32.640> weeks<00:04:33.080> but<00:04:34.080> as<00:04:34.620> you<00:04:34.980> can<00:04:35.070> see<00:04:35.310> that

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
the coming weeks but as you can see that

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.320 
the coming weeks but as you can see that
put<00:04:35.760> in<00:04:35.910> fuel<00:04:36.270> tanks<00:04:37.100> I<00:04:38.100> guess<00:04:38.820> that's<00:04:38.970> air

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
put in fuel tanks I guess that's air

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.750 
put in fuel tanks I guess that's air
filter<00:04:40.050> for<00:04:40.500> turn<00:04:40.770> around<00:04:41.640> it<00:04:42.090> is<00:04:43.130> trailer<00:04:44.130> you

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
filter for turn around it is trailer you

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.540 
filter for turn around it is trailer you
can<00:04:44.790> see<00:04:45.240> there's<00:04:45.960> a<00:04:46.170> snow<00:04:46.530> hole<00:04:48.020> more<00:04:49.550> tank

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
can see there's a snow hole more tank

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.200 
can see there's a snow hole more tank
stuff<00:04:51.050> wheels<00:04:52.050> as<00:04:52.590> you<00:04:53.340> can<00:04:53.490> see<00:04:53.730> on<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:54.000> back

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
stuff wheels as you can see on the back

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.190 
stuff wheels as you can see on the back
the<00:04:54.540> guy<00:04:54.740> hitch<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:56.570> probably<00:04:57.570> can't<00:04:57.840> see<00:04:57.990> it

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
the guy hitch and probably can't see it

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.430 
the guy hitch and probably can't see it
back<00:04:58.530> clearly<00:04:59.160> if<00:04:59.370> I<00:04:59.810> it's<00:05:00.810> probably<00:05:01.230> because

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
back clearly if I it's probably because

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.910 
back clearly if I it's probably because
of<00:05:01.710> my<00:05:02.160> hands<00:05:02.670> in<00:05:02.790> the<00:05:02.940> way<00:05:03.090> of<00:05:03.330> the<00:05:03.480> white<00:05:03.920> you

of my hands in the way of the white you

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.200 
of my hands in the way of the white you
can<00:05:05.100> see<00:05:05.370> there's<00:05:05.670> some<00:05:05.930> back<00:05:06.930> lights<00:05:08.210> they've

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
can see there's some back lights they've

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.780 
can see there's some back lights they've
kept<00:05:09.600> with<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:09.930> new<00:05:10.290> standard<00:05:11.040> wheel<00:05:11.310> design

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
kept with the new standard wheel design

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.260 
kept with the new standard wheel design
what<00:05:12.120> I'm<00:05:12.360> happy<00:05:13.080> where<00:05:13.320> as<00:05:13.680> you<00:05:14.670> see<00:05:14.970> the

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
what I'm happy where as you see the

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.010 
what I'm happy where as you see the
truck<00:05:15.510> driver<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:18.770> ten<00:05:19.770> round<00:05:20.040> to<00:05:20.250> the<00:05:20.280> front

front of the truck again as you can see
the<00:05:25.080> chassis<00:05:25.530> design<00:05:25.740> is<00:05:26.310> actually<00:05:26.520> quite

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
the chassis design is actually quite

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
the chassis design is actually quite
realistic<00:05:30.230> using<00:05:31.230> old<00:05:31.500> um<00:05:32.510> the<00:05:33.510> power<00:05:34.970> clips

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
realistic using old um the power clips

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.560 
realistic using old um the power clips
um<00:05:38.390> instead<00:05:39.390> of<00:05:39.420> using<00:05:39.870> the<00:05:40.260> standard<00:05:40.590> wheel

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570

um instead of using the standard wheel
clips<00:05:42.570> for<00:05:43.200> the<00:05:43.320> wheels<00:05:44.750> this<00:05:45.750> design<00:05:46.200> I'll

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
clips for the wheels this design I'll

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.560 
clips for the wheels this design I'll
probably<00:05:46.830> give<00:05:47.190> a<00:05:47.220> good<00:05:48.410> good<00:05:49.940> 10<00:05:50.940> out<00:05:51.150> of<00:05:51.180> 10

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570
