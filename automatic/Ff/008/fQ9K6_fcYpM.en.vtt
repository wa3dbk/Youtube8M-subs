home<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.350> as<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.489> can<00:02:08.550> see<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.849> kind<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.270> like

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
home is as you can see is kind of like

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.140 
home is as you can see is kind of like
I'm<00:02:10.200> sure<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:10.679> sharp<00:02:11.009> edges<00:02:11.220> here<00:02:11.580> was

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
I'm sure like sharp edges here was

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.670 
I'm sure like sharp edges here was
curved<00:02:12.629> up<00:02:12.750> at<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.989> top

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
curved up at the top

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.099 
curved up at the top
I<00:02:13.769> would<00:02:14.010> like<00:02:14.159> to<00:02:14.219> see<00:02:14.459> them<00:02:14.640> do<00:02:14.760> curve<00:02:15.030> on<00:02:15.299> all

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:16.109 
I would like to see them do curve on all

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:17.569 
I would like to see them do curve on all
the<00:02:16.260> sides<00:02:16.379> I<00:02:16.680> said<00:02:16.859> just<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.189> top<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.489> the

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
the sides I said just the top and the

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.789 
the sides I said just the top and the
bottom<00:02:17.840> because<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> little

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
bottom because it is a little

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.830 
bottom because it is a little
uncomfortable<00:02:20.189> to<00:02:20.519> hold<00:02:20.640> both<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.299> case<00:02:21.510> that

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
uncomfortable to hold both the case that

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.190 
uncomfortable to hold both the case that
they<00:02:21.989> send<00:02:22.349> out<00:02:22.439> with<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:23.459> life<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.420> XO<00:02:24.719> it's

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
they send out with the life you XO it's

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.199 
they send out with the life you XO it's
actually<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.530> lot<00:02:25.650> more<00:02:25.709> comfortable<00:02:26.099> I<00:02:26.579> also

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
actually a lot more comfortable I also

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.610 
actually a lot more comfortable I also
would<00:02:27.450> like<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.689> have<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.989> power<00:02:28.140> button<00:02:28.349> on

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
would like to have the power button on

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.000 
would like to have the power button on
the<00:02:28.680> side<00:02:29.040> instead<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.640> at<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.879> top<00:02:30.060> um<00:02:30.889> but<00:02:31.889> as

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
the side instead of at the top um but as

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.349 
the side instead of at the top um but as
far<00:02:32.129> your<00:02:32.280> software<00:02:32.639> goes<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:33.030> pretty<00:02:33.299> much

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
far your software goes it's pretty much

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:34.580 
far your software goes it's pretty much
the<00:02:33.450> same<00:02:33.659> as<00:02:33.840> what<00:02:33.930> we've<00:02:34.079> seen<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.379> the<00:02:34.439> life

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
the same as what we've seen on the life

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.220 
the same as what we've seen on the life
here<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.159> that<00:02:35.340> life<00:02:35.459> peer<00:02:35.670> mini<00:02:36.049> no<00:02:37.049> app

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
here in that life peer mini no app

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.580 
here in that life peer mini no app
drawer<00:02:38.510> plenty<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.629> pre-installed<00:02:40.019> apps<00:02:40.349> but

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
drawer plenty of pre-installed apps but

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.069 
drawer plenty of pre-installed apps but
it's<00:02:40.709> not<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.950> ton<00:02:41.459> like<00:02:42.269> some<00:02:42.480> other<00:02:42.599> companies

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
it's not a ton like some other companies

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.629 
it's not a ton like some other companies
do<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.650> got<00:02:43.769> about<00:02:43.829> three<00:02:44.069> pages<00:02:44.219> here

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
do so you got about three pages here

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.720 
do so you got about three pages here
that's<00:02:44.909> what<00:02:45.090> about<00:02:45.329> 36<00:02:46.230> apps<00:02:46.439> not<00:02:47.370> too<00:02:47.549> bad

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
that's what about 36 apps not too bad

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.369 
that's what about 36 apps not too bad
then<00:02:48.269> includes<00:02:48.569> all<00:02:48.689> the<00:02:48.720> Google<00:02:49.079> stuff<00:02:49.230> as

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
then includes all the Google stuff as

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.569 
then includes all the Google stuff as
well<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:52.530> there's<00:02:52.769> a<00:02:52.829> couple<00:02:52.950> other<00:02:53.159> apps<00:02:53.430> in

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
well so there's a couple other apps in

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.429 
well so there's a couple other apps in
here<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.730> wanted<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.180> take<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.540> look<00:02:54.720> at<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.290> this

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
here I wanted to take a look at so this

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.229 
here I wanted to take a look at so this
one's<00:02:55.650> phone<00:02:55.829> accelerate<00:02:56.340> allows<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.120> to

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
one's phone accelerate allows you to

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.569 
one's phone accelerate allows you to
clear<00:02:57.419> your<00:02:57.450> RAM<00:02:57.780> clear<00:02:58.079> cache<00:02:58.469> and<00:02:58.769> optimize

clear your RAM clear cache and optimize
the<00:02:59.790> boot<00:02:59.969> so<00:03:00.900> if<00:03:01.079> you<00:03:01.200> have<00:03:01.319> any<00:03:01.469> apps<00:03:01.650> that

it'll<00:03:04.260> take<00:03:04.620> care<00:03:04.799> of<00:03:04.889> that<00:03:05.010> for<00:03:05.219> you<00:03:05.840> there's

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
it'll take care of that for you there's

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.420 
it'll take care of that for you there's
also<00:03:07.019> traffic<00:03:07.469> assistant<00:03:07.950> which<00:03:08.129> I<00:03:08.219> can't

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
also traffic assistant which I can't

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.649 
also traffic assistant which I can't
really<00:03:08.579> ensuring<00:03:08.969> that<00:03:09.120> because<00:03:09.389> it's<00:03:09.540> an

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
really ensuring that because it's an

card in here but it'll basically is

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.520 
card in here but it'll basically is
basically<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.730> data<00:03:14.939> usage<00:03:15.359> of<00:03:15.389> settings<00:03:15.959> on

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
we have power manager there we go so

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.460 
we have power manager there we go so
it's<00:03:30.000> showing<00:03:30.269> me<00:03:30.389> I've<00:03:30.479> got<00:03:30.659> about<00:03:30.900> 18<00:03:31.349> hours

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470
