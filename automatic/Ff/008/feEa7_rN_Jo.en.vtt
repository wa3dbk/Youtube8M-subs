cost you like 30 $40 and we know players
are<00:00:27.990> having<00:00:28.080> such<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> good<00:00:28.529> time<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.769> our<00:00:29.010> game

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
are having such a good time in our game

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.650 
are having such a good time in our game
right<00:00:29.369> now<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.789> they<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.029> want<00:00:30.240> more<00:00:30.599> and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
right now and they just want more and

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.630 
right now and they just want more and
more<00:00:30.869> stuff<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.380> do<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.250> didn't<00:00:32.430> want<00:00:32.520> to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
more stuff to do and we didn't want to

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.580 
more stuff to do and we didn't want to
make<00:00:32.730> people<00:00:33.000> wait<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.360> long<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:34.170> know<00:00:34.290> for

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
make people wait that long you know for

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.950 
make people wait that long you know for
a<00:00:34.620> big<00:00:35.100> expansion<00:00:35.489> pack<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.270> decided<00:00:36.630> what

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
a big expansion pack so we decided what

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.470 
a big expansion pack so we decided what
we<00:00:36.989> would<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:37.350> was<00:00:37.559> kind<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.480> smaller

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
we would do was kind of do a smaller

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.470 
we would do was kind of do a smaller
scope<00:00:39.899> expansions<00:00:40.739> what<00:00:40.920> we<00:00:41.010> call

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
scope expansions what we call

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.000 
scope expansions what we call
downloadable<00:00:42.480> packs<00:00:42.629> right<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.260> then<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.800> get

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
downloadable packs right and then we get

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.950 
downloadable packs right and then we get
them<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.430> more<00:00:44.640> frequently<00:00:45.210> rather<00:00:45.690> than

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
them to you more frequently rather than

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.990 
them to you more frequently rather than
waiting<00:00:46.170> 12<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.070> 16<00:00:47.370> months<00:00:47.430> you're<00:00:47.730> gonna<00:00:47.820> get

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
waiting 12 to 16 months you're gonna get

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.670 
waiting 12 to 16 months you're gonna get
these<00:00:48.149> more<00:00:48.450> often<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.050> they're<00:00:49.379> gonna<00:00:49.500> get

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
these more often and they're gonna get

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.310 
these more often and they're gonna get
new<00:00:50.129> stuff<00:00:50.820> into<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> game<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.140> fight

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
new stuff into the game so with fight

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.840 
new stuff into the game so with fight

like that which you can see kind of

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.670 
like that which you can see kind of
going<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.240> maybe<00:01:06.689> through<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> microphone<00:01:07.500> in

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
going on maybe through the microphone in

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.920 
going on maybe through the microphone in
the<00:01:07.740> background<00:01:08.189> here<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.659> make<00:01:09.780> all

and there's all different kinds of

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.249 
and there's all different kinds of
constructs<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.330> create<00:01:21.689> light

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
you can change together to it is really

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.709 
you can change together to it is really
deep<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.430> really<00:02:05.610> compelling<00:02:06.090> we're<00:02:06.360> excited

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
deep and really compelling we're excited

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.800 
deep and really compelling we're excited
about<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.140> mechanic<00:02:07.590> that

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
about the mechanic that

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.660 
about the mechanic that
adding<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.319> game<00:02:08.500> because<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:09.039> gives<00:02:09.429> us<00:02:09.550> a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
adding to the game because it gives us a

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.670 
adding to the game because it gives us a
lot<00:02:09.789> of<00:02:09.940> opportunities<00:02:10.569> to<00:02:10.599> expand<00:02:11.530> existing

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
lot of opportunities to expand existing

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.860 
lot of opportunities to expand existing
powers<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:12.580> even<00:02:12.640> add<00:02:12.880> new<00:02:12.910> ones<00:02:13.239> like<00:02:13.569> light

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
powers and even add new ones like light

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.160 
powers and even add new ones like light
to<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.170> game<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:15.370> that<00:02:15.489> just<00:02:15.930> playability<00:02:16.930> is

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
to the game so that just playability is

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.130 
to the game so that just playability is
off<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.590> charts<00:02:17.920> on<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.280> yeah<00:02:19.239> it's<00:02:19.930> really

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
off the charts on this yeah it's really

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.110 
off the charts on this yeah it's really
it's<00:02:20.440> really<00:02:20.530> deep<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.400> know<00:02:21.520> obviously<00:02:21.940> we

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
it's really deep you know obviously we

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.250 
it's really deep you know obviously we
couldn't<00:02:23.910> pay<00:02:24.910> off<00:02:25.090> on<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:25.540> on<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.870> ring<00:02:26.080> in

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
couldn't pay off on the on the ring in

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.660 
couldn't pay off on the on the ring in
the<00:02:26.349> sense<00:02:26.590> if<00:02:26.800> we<00:02:26.890> can<00:02:27.010> hook<00:02:27.160> something<00:02:27.220> into

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
the sense if we can hook something into

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.160 
the sense if we can hook something into
your<00:02:27.790> brain<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.209> you<00:02:28.269> can<00:02:28.390> make<00:02:28.599> anything<00:02:28.930> you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
your brain and you can make anything you

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.620 
your brain and you can make anything you
want<00:02:29.349> to<00:02:29.739> like<00:02:30.040> green<00:02:30.280> lantern<00:02:30.670> can<00:02:30.880> so<00:02:31.450> we

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
want to like green lantern can so we

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.420 
want to like green lantern can so we
looked<00:02:31.870> at<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.170> different<00:02:32.590> way<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:33.160> try<00:02:33.400> and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
looked at a different way to try and

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.180 
looked at a different way to try and
spark<00:02:34.120> people's<00:02:34.450> imaginations<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.500> creating

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
spark people's imaginations of creating

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.890 
spark people's imaginations of creating
constructs<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.060> we<00:02:37.180> came<00:02:37.360> up<00:02:37.480> with<00:02:37.569> this<00:02:37.690> idea

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
constructs and we came up with this idea

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.809 
constructs and we came up with this idea
of<00:02:38.260> chaining<00:02:38.620> them<00:02:38.890> together<00:02:39.069> so<00:02:39.670> you're

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
of chaining them together so you're

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.699 
of chaining them together so you're
making<00:02:40.030> your<00:02:40.360> own<00:02:40.390> combos<00:02:41.170> as<00:02:41.380> you're<00:02:41.530> going

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
making your own combos as you're going

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.979 
making your own combos as you're going
through<00:02:44.010> whatever<00:02:45.010> it's<00:02:45.340> comic-con<00:02:45.870> what<00:02:46.870> can

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
through whatever it's comic-con what can

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.500 
through whatever it's comic-con what can
you<00:02:47.080> tell<00:02:47.200> us<00:02:47.319> about<00:02:47.440> when<00:02:47.769> it<00:02:47.890> comes<00:02:47.920> out<00:02:48.510> its

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
you tell us about when it comes out its

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.150 
you tell us about when it comes out its
gonna<00:02:49.660> come<00:02:49.870> out<00:02:49.989> this<00:02:50.170> summer<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:50.709> really

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160
