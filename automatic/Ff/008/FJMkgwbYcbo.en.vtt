this<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.699> one<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.269> particular<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.750> a

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
this the one I have in particular is a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.140 
this the one I have in particular is a
stainless<00:00:25.199> steel<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.670> believe<00:00:26.910> they<00:00:27.000> made

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
stainless steel and I believe they made

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.210 
stainless steel and I believe they made
a<00:00:27.180> titanium<00:00:27.539> version<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.410> think<00:00:28.560> they<00:00:28.800> also<00:00:28.949> um

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
a titanium version I think they also um

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.089 
a titanium version I think they also um
had<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> rare<00:00:29.730> all-black<00:00:30.269> version<00:00:30.769> but<00:00:31.769> I

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
had like a rare all-black version but I

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.920 
had like a rare all-black version but I
thought<00:00:32.489> it'd<00:00:32.610> be<00:00:32.640> kind<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.850> nice<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.360> step

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
thought it'd be kind of nice to step

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.450 
thought it'd be kind of nice to step
back<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.380> sparticles<00:00:34.770> history<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.309> take<00:00:35.430> a

knife<00:01:37.680> apart<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.280> now<00:01:38.340> probably

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
knife apart and now probably

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.819 
knife apart and now probably
superimposed<00:01:39.150> some<00:01:39.420> photos<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.049> here

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
superimposed some photos of that here

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.830 
superimposed some photos of that here
but<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.520> actually<00:01:41.820> serves<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.299> lock<00:01:42.540> stop

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
but it's actually serves as a lock stop

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.069 
but it's actually serves as a lock stop
to<00:01:43.439> prevent<00:01:43.740> over<00:01:44.100> extension<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:45.420> when<00:01:46.020> you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
to prevent over extension so when you

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.749 
to prevent over extension so when you
get<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.320> here<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.740> lock<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.130> stops<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.670> will

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
get to here the lock just stops it will

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.539 
get to here the lock just stops it will
not<00:01:47.909> extend<00:01:48.240> past<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.689> part<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.369> lock<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.520> very

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
not extend past this part a lock is very

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.190 
not extend past this part a lock is very
smooth<00:01:51.030> now<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.990> blade

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
smooth now you can see the the blade

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.870 
smooth now you can see the the blade
just<00:01:52.380> drops<00:01:52.680> down<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.189> didn't<00:01:53.460> take<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.670> apart

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
just drops down I didn't take it apart

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.600 
just drops down I didn't take it apart
and<00:01:53.970> reel<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.740> let<00:01:55.740> these<00:01:55.950> your<00:01:56.280> might<00:01:56.430> have<00:01:56.579> a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
and reel it let these your might have a

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.679 
and reel it let these your might have a
little<00:01:56.790> bit<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.090> problem<00:01:57.299> because<00:01:57.479> I

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
little bit of a problem because I

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.990 
little bit of a problem because I
noticed<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.579> harder<00:01:59.909> to

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
noticed that it's just it's harder to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.609 
noticed that it's just it's harder to
get<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> blade<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.600> drop<00:02:00.899> because<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.469> some

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
get the blade to drop because for some

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.230 
get the blade to drop because for some
reason<00:02:01.649> while<00:02:02.070> you're<00:02:02.250> putting<00:02:02.460> your<00:02:02.700> index

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
reason while you're putting your index

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.840 
reason while you're putting your index
finger<00:02:03.509> here<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.590> pressure<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.700> put

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
finger here the pressure that you put

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.730 
finger here the pressure that you put
against<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.270> pivot<00:02:06.600> actually<00:02:07.020> prevents<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
against the pivot actually prevents the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.420 
against the pivot actually prevents the
blade<00:02:08.069> from<00:02:08.190> dropping<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.929> very<00:02:10.430> yeah

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
blade from dropping so it's very yeah

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.790 
blade from dropping so it's very yeah
see<00:02:11.640> it's<00:02:11.849> very<00:02:11.910> interesting<00:02:12.300> but

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
see it's very interesting but

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.710 
see it's very interesting but
my<00:02:13.860> keys<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.460> this<00:02:14.670> really<00:02:15.000> easy<00:02:15.150> just<00:02:15.510> drops

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
my keys is this really easy just drops

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.230 
my keys is this really easy just drops
right<00:02:15.900> down<00:02:15.960> very<00:02:16.380> smooth<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.610> there's<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.850> hole

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
right down very smooth so there's a hole

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.670 
right down very smooth so there's a hole
for<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.480> lanyard<00:02:18.870> here<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.470> looks<00:02:19.620> like

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
for the lanyard here and it looks like

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.980 
for the lanyard here and it looks like
it's<00:02:19.860> largely<00:02:20.100> for<00:02:20.370> 550<00:02:20.790> paracord<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:21.960> a

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
it's largely for 550 paracord it is a

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.690 
it's largely for 550 paracord it is a
barrel<00:02:22.350> spacer<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.040> there's<00:02:23.310> also<00:02:23.460> two

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
barrel spacer and there's also two

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.790 
barrel spacer and there's also two
standoffs<00:02:24.180> on<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.390> back<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:25.500> wrestling

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
standoffs on the back the wrestling

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.080 
standoffs on the back the wrestling
handle<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.160> pretty<00:02:26.400> much<00:02:26.520> in<00:02:26.700> an<00:02:26.820> open

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
handle is pretty much in an open

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.910 
handle is pretty much in an open
construction<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:28.290> very<00:02:28.500> easy<00:02:28.800> for

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
construction so it's very easy for

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.450 
construction so it's very easy for
cleaning<00:02:29.400> as<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.610> see<00:02:29.820> here<00:02:31.130> one<00:02:32.130> of<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.280> more

cleaning as you see here one of the more

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.580 
cleaning as you see here one of the more
unique<00:02:32.760> features<00:02:32.790> are<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.360> ATR<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:34.110> says

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
unique features are the ATR it says

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.620 
unique features are the ATR it says

cobra hood installed my back in the
blade<00:02:36.810> spine<00:02:37.110> here<00:02:37.700> says<00:02:38.700> several<00:02:39.080> distinct

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
blade spine here says several distinct

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.260 
blade spine here says several distinct
advantages<00:02:40.560> number<00:02:40.890> one<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.640> tell<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:41.940> sticks

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
advantages number one you tell it sticks

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.060 
advantages number one you tell it sticks
out<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.450> little<00:02:42.540> bit<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.110> provides<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.770> lot<00:02:44.040> of

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
out a little bit to provides a lot of

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.770 
out a little bit to provides a lot of
traction<00:02:44.430> for<00:02:44.910> when<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.150> need<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.360> go<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.510> play

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
traction for when you need to go to play

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.590 
traction for when you need to go to play
the<00:02:45.900> knife<00:02:46.220> number<00:02:47.220> two<00:02:47.580> since<00:02:48.150> it's<00:02:48.360> on<00:02:48.420> the

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
the knife number two since it's on the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.300 
the knife number two since it's on the
thumb<00:02:48.780> ramp<00:02:49.020> here<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.470> notice<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.830> provides<00:02:50.220> a

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
thumb ramp here you notice it provides a

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.850 
thumb ramp here you notice it provides a
larger<00:02:50.730> area<00:02:51.090> for<00:02:51.360> your<00:02:52.140> thumb<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.440> rest<00:02:52.650> on

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
larger area for your thumb the rest on

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.640 
larger area for your thumb the rest on
so<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:53.700> ramp<00:02:54.000> is<00:02:54.240> also<00:02:54.660> jumped<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.560> it

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
so this ramp is also jumped so it

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.170 
so this ramp is also jumped so it
provides<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:56.070> lot<00:02:56.220> of<00:02:56.280> traction<00:02:56.670> as<00:02:56.970> well

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
provides a lot of traction as well

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.420 
provides a lot of traction as well
holding<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.200> ATR<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.710> extremely<00:02:59.220> comfortable

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
holding the ATR is extremely comfortable

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.880 
holding the ATR is extremely comfortable
in<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.910> hand<00:03:00.060> despite<00:03:00.720> being<00:03:01.110> an<00:03:01.590> all-metal

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
in the hand despite being an all-metal

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.730 
in the hand despite being an all-metal
design<00:03:02.870> okay<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.050> let's<00:03:04.260> take<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.410> look<00:03:04.590> at<00:03:04.650> the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
design okay so let's take a look at the

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.770 
design okay so let's take a look at the
blade<00:03:05.010> here<00:03:05.250> on<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.970> ricasso<00:03:06.270> you<00:03:06.540> notice

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
blade here on the ricasso you notice

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.870 
blade here on the ricasso you notice
it's<00:03:06.930> got<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.260> Spyderco<00:03:07.710> branding<00:03:08.160> stamped

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
knife is very simple because of the
