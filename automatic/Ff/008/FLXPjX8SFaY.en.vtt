00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.769
 Today we are in the Pitztal in 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.290
 tyrol 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.660
 because there is a lot of snow here and in the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.630
 snow there is this car at home 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.900
 the audi quattro the ur-quattro the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.840
 father of all four-wheel sports cars 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.180
 rally cars and four-wheel limousine 1980 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.250
 This car came on the market and back then 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.060
 the least of which is what one 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.640
 sensation 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.890
 the quattro is happy by him 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.840
 got the audi slogan projection through 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.300
 technology a whole new meaning then 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.190
 hannu mikkola michelle mother and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.620
 of course walter röhrl also have 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.559
 the quattro on the race track the opponents 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.140
 it dried up to the point of lust and mood 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.750
 the ur-quattro the audi of this 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.480
 biedermann image has freed and the way 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.620
 paved the way to sporty 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.539
 premium manufacturers the best ideas 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.370
 come a miserable if not 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.949
 with it and then so will the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.860
 Idea for quattro somewhere in finland 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.869
 a february day in the year 77 born that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.060
 audi team is there at Arctic 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.490
 temperatures to test drives on the way 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.530
 and on snow and ice they stay 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.439
 front-wheel drive stuck again and again 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.570
 only one drives everyone up and away and 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.500
 that is a vw iltis this little one 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.780
 suv 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.479
 then the audi man says jörg 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.630
 bensinger give me an old one with more 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.939
 performance and I forgot everyone and this one 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.820
 wish is then something like that 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.890
 first breath of quattro ferdinand piëch 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.770
 at that time was in the board of audi 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.200
 in charge of the technology and it comes 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.479
 he heard this story from the all-wheel 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.939
 is enthusiastic gives green light and im 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.490
 january 78 will be on the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.600
 Europe's steepest mountain road on the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.390
 turracher height 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.079
 a first prototype tested of course 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.600
 on snow 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.540
 you can imagine the result 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.090
 last doubts will be in april 78 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.329
 in hockenheim eliminated a quattro 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.990
 prototype enters a Porsche 928 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.119
 on 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.890
 he drives the same times in the dry 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.500
 and then we wet the runway 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.810
 the quattro lets the porsche miles 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.350
 beautiful views up here 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.450
 in the mountain 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.830
 say we come to the views of 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.690
 audi quattro 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.210
 the car is certainly the most beautiful 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.670
 car of all times and the myth of 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.920
 cato has not only with the 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.440
 design to do the car is very long 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.630
 he became very angular and very edgy 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.240
 looks like you have him completely with you 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.390
 The ruler was drawn at that time 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.270
 To save money while audi are strong 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.380
 in the design of the quattro audi 80 coupe 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.730
 orientate 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.990
 Nevertheless, the car has a lot 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.460
 Imposing a very aggressive 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.070
 get occurred 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.680
 i like that very very good hartmut 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.780
 In 1980, Warkus was the design boss 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.930
 audi and he wanted to show it 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.370
 that the crater grew together with the earth 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.740
 is not a stream 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.040
 he can blow this car around 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.320
 no chichi highway at Krato should 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.210
 not the elegance but the technology in the 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.640
 foreground stand so you also 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.340
 the fenders are so conspicuously modeled around 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.910
 something is happening down here 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.630
 namely all-wheel driving fun and permanently 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.630
 traction tour 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.730
 one recognizes him already from a distance 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.650
 five-cylinder turbo of the audi quattro 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.320
 this month to his very own 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.150
 Sound that is partly due to the 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.610
 irregular spacing are the 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.370
 five cylinders to another at the deep 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.070
 rumbling of the exhaust and the fans call 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.740
 then this sound only quattro fonie 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.870
 the engine front left still in front of the 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.180
 front axle built that it is not quite 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.700
 so much for the weight distribution he 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.490
 has a bosch injection system and a 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.090
 turbocharger from kkk and that's what he brings 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.900
 It was a word at 200 ps 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.450
 among men 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:12.310
 For comparison, a porsche from the 80s 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.350
 years a 911 sc had only 188 ps and 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.590
 then he accelerates with this 200 ps 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.440
 in 7.2 seconds from 0 to 100 and the 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.930
 tachonadel remains only at 222 stand 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.910
 wehrmann is traveling in ur quattro 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.560
 then you always have the feeling that one 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.840
 touched by walter röhrl and rallye 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.210
 monte-carlo drives here and the car 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.230
 drives itself as it looks like 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.820
 Little Monster 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.500
 if you for example on the brake 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.080
 then you really have the feeling 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.910
 that you have to go hard in the iron 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.920
 and when you insert you can feel the 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.900
 driving forces at the front axle 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.780
 cern and then at the curve exit 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.690
 then gas returns then pulls the car 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.970
 straight ahead and the traction 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.580
 is incredible there you can feel that 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.040
 Quato just here in the snow in his 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.410
 element is so the quattro is a 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.110
 very honest car that very much 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.430
 fun does so completely without esp and 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.920
 electronic frills 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.440
 when the car comes on the market in 1980 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.600
 because it is an absolute high performance 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.050
 car the quattro costs as much as one 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.210
 Porsche 911 and all the people themselves 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.610
 want to buy this car because they just 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.710
 are fascinated by this technology and 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.920
 the driving dynamics we are here 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.630
 effortlessly the toboggan run hochzeiger im 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.090
 Pitztal started up 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.040
 These people get a shock though 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.800
 the first time in the car 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.350
 get in there because that has it in here 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.910
 nothing to do with ferrari or porsche 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.300
 that it is cheaper 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.730
 plastic from the audi 80 this is the 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.800
 second series looks a little better 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.840
 At that time, people were especially proud of 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.820
 ingolstadt on this digital 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.550
 Combination instrument that is natural 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.770
 mice cinema par excellence but that makes 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.140
 also the charm of ur-quattro from that 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.900
 he is not so perfect inside and out 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.280
 you just wanted to audi all the money 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.990
 in technology and not in 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.840
 to put up some luxury 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.790
 Incidentally, the quattro would almost have one 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.400
 walter got a completely different name 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.930
 teresa is the product manager at that time 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.730
 left a story in an article 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.340
 over a jeep with a new quadra 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.140
 trac gear quadra trac like reeser 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.170
 and then it develops slowly 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.680
 quattro but from wolfsburg comes the 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.130
 announcement 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.770
 to call this car bike grasses 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:29.920
 only hisses the nose and at the next 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.200
 meeting of the strategy committee he drew 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:35.020
 a vial of perfume out of the bag 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.030
 that is also called karat and theresa asks 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.550
 the gentlemen from wolfsburg if you in the 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.250
 car with which one wants to conquer the world 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:45.270
 to call it like a cheap one 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.270
 housewives suitcase 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.840
 the quattro is really the lord of the 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.940
 rings we are now over 2000 meters 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.130
 height arrived on the dance 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:04.400
 no problem with the four-wheel drive 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:07.160
 and so you had to audi 1980 too 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.440
 Do not think long about what to do around 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.080
 to show how graewe lotion he likes 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.780
 This new system is one to think about 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.490
 Just had to quattro against the 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.740
 rest of the car world against everything 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.900
 let conventional compete and that 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.820
 You could not get anywhere then and now 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.070
 better than on the rally stage the 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.810
 just on snow and gravel could there 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:30.010
 the audi quattro show the competition 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.010
 where the hammer hangs
