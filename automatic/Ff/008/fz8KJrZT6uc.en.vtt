because<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.200> surely<00:00:49.680> will<00:00:49.829> fall<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.399> then

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
because it surely will fall and then

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.369 
because it surely will fall and then
your<00:00:50.700> crystals<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.329> isolate<00:00:51.809> will<00:00:51.989> go<00:00:52.110> all

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
your crystals you isolate will go all

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.610 
your crystals you isolate will go all
over<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.949> bench<00:00:53.809> alternatively<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:55.260> smaller

funnel<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.969> want<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.239> choose<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
funnel for this you want to choose the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.250 
funnel for this you want to choose the
small<00:01:01.710> pieces<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.280> filter<00:01:02.730> paper<00:01:02.809> that<00:01:03.809> fits

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
small pieces of filter paper that fits

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.260 
small pieces of filter paper that fits
snugly<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.309> top<00:01:07.040> over<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.340> porcelain<00:01:08.970> holes

snugly on top over the porcelain holes

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.230 
snugly on top over the porcelain holes
so<00:01:10.200> there's<00:01:10.439> three<00:01:10.770> types<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.310> filter<00:01:11.729> papers

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
so there's three types of filter papers

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.289 
so there's three types of filter papers
found<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:13.200> our<00:01:13.380> laboratory<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.670> small<00:01:15.000> one

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299

for the Hurst funnel the next size
larger<00:01:19.320> for<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.979> Buechner<00:01:20.430> funnel<00:01:21.170> it's<00:01:22.170> like

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
larger for the Buechner funnel it's like

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.460 
larger for the Buechner funnel it's like
this<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.270> filter<00:01:24.689> papers<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.350> are

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
this and then the filter papers that are

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.160 
this and then the filter papers that are
larger<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.400> we<00:01:26.549> use<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:27.390> gravity

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
larger that we use for gravity

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.499 
larger that we use for gravity
filtration<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:29.790> want<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.210> try<00:01:30.450> to

turn on the vacuum chicken here and then

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.010 
turn on the vacuum chicken here and then
you<00:01:50.219> want<00:01:50.459> to<00:01:50.520> moisten<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.450> filter<00:01:51.840> paper

there<00:03:03.580> am<00:03:03.760> nice<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.330> dry<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.890> can't<00:03:06.250> be<00:03:06.460> moved

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
there am nice and dry and can't be moved

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:15.180 
there am nice and dry and can't be moved
around<00:03:08.880> with<00:03:09.880> your<00:03:10.150> metal<00:03:10.390> spatula<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:14.560> good<00:03:14.800> 5

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
around with your metal spatula so good 5

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.630 
around with your metal spatula so good 5
or<00:03:15.220> 10<00:03:15.820> minutes<00:03:16.030> on<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.990> filter<00:03:17.410> paper<00:03:17.640> will

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
or 10 minutes on the filter paper will

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.060 
or 10 minutes on the filter paper will
give<00:03:18.820> you<00:03:19.000> nice<00:03:19.350> dry<00:03:20.350> crystals<00:03:21.660> with<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:22.690> good

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
give you nice dry crystals with a good

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.220 
give you nice dry crystals with a good
melting<00:03:24.070> point<00:03:24.400> if<00:03:24.670> they're<00:03:24.910> pure

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.640 

all<00:03:29.800> right<00:03:30.060> after<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.239> crystals<00:03:31.750> are<00:03:31.870> dry<00:03:32.110> you

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
all right after the crystals are dry you

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.030 
all right after the crystals are dry you
want<00:03:32.830> to<00:03:33.040> release<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.790> pressure<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:35.799> do

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
want to release the pressure and to do

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.610 
want to release the pressure and to do
this<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.730> slowly<00:03:39.450> pull<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.720> vacuum<00:03:41.260> tube

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
this you slowly pull the vacuum tube

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.369 
this you slowly pull the vacuum tube
again<00:03:42.069> notice<00:03:42.519> we're<00:03:42.790> using<00:03:43.299> thick<00:03:43.959> wall

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
again notice we're using thick wall

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.780 
again notice we're using thick wall
tubing<00:03:45.010> here<00:03:45.310> not<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.849> thin<00:03:46.150> walled<00:03:46.420> tubing

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
tubing here not the thin walled tubing

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:56.000 
tubing here not the thin walled tubing
then<00:03:48.790> release<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.629> pressure

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.830 

and<00:03:56.459> turn<00:03:56.790> off<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.360> back

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.830 

then<00:04:03.440> you<00:04:03.769> can<00:04:04.010> carefully<00:04:04.670> transfer<00:04:05.540> the

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
then you can carefully transfer the

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.880 
then you can carefully transfer the
crystals<00:04:06.410> to<00:04:06.769> a<00:04:07.160> watch<00:04:07.550> glass<00:04:07.940> or<00:04:09.010> into<00:04:10.010> a<00:04:10.480> file

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
crystals to a watch glass or into a file

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:19.030 
crystals to a watch glass or into a file
for<00:04:14.019> massing<00:04:15.019> or<00:04:15.519> determining<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:16.760> yield
