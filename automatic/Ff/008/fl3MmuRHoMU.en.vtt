00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.099 
out and I got to say they're actually
pretty<00:00:13.349> good<00:00:14.599> compared<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> studios

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
pretty good compared to the studios

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.560 
pretty good compared to the studios
which<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.500> had<00:00:16.650> before<00:00:16.859> these<00:00:17.310> I'd<00:00:17.880> say<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.270> like

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
which I had before these I'd say I like

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.400 
which I had before these I'd say I like
these<00:00:18.810> more<00:00:19.080> but<00:00:20.270> it<00:00:21.270> depends<00:00:21.539> really<00:00:21.840> you

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
these more but it depends really you

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.189 
these more but it depends really you
like<00:00:22.590> really<00:00:23.010> heavy<00:00:23.160> bass<00:00:23.460> I'm<00:00:24.420> sorry<00:00:24.689> you're

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
like really heavy bass I'm sorry you're

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.990 
like really heavy bass I'm sorry you're
like<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> really<00:00:25.590> heavy<00:00:25.800> base<00:00:26.039> then<00:00:26.400> studios

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
like a really heavy base then studios

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.089 
like a really heavy base then studios
are<00:00:27.090> probably<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.359> little<00:00:27.449> better<00:00:27.750> these<00:00:28.710> but

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
are probably a little better these but

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.580 
are probably a little better these but
if<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.580> like<00:00:29.730> balanced<00:00:30.300> these<00:00:31.170> are<00:00:31.349> probably

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
if you like balanced these are probably

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.240 
if you like balanced these are probably
a<00:00:31.800> lot<00:00:32.009> better<00:00:33.620> concerts<00:00:34.620> pretty<00:00:35.010> much<00:00:35.130> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960

far like these better the noise
cancelling<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.729> little<00:01:33.180> bit<00:01:33.299> better<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.509> these

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
cancelling a little bit better on these

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.560 
cancelling a little bit better on these
and<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.979> your<00:01:35.100> money<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.520> would<00:01:35.790> say<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.360> these

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and for your money I would say get these

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.469 
and for your money I would say get these
these<00:01:37.500> are<00:01:37.820> definitely<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.210> little<00:01:39.990> bit<00:01:40.229> better

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
these are definitely a little bit better

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.190 
these are definitely a little bit better
especially<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.570> you're<00:01:42.659> going<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.869> spend

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
especially if you're going to spend

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.840 
especially if you're going to spend
three<00:01:43.530> hundred<00:01:43.770> dollars<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.399> want<00:01:44.579> something

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
three hundred dollars you want something

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.469 
three hundred dollars you want something
that's<00:01:44.939> going<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.240> be<00:01:46.520> worth<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.149> think

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
that's going to be worth it and I think

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.980 
that's going to be worth it and I think
these<00:01:48.600> are<00:01:49.640> let's<00:01:50.640> go<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> case<00:01:51.090> case<00:01:53.990> it's

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
these are let's go to the case case it's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.160 
these are let's go to the case case it's
hard<00:01:55.200> pretty<00:01:55.799> hard<00:01:55.950> same<00:01:56.719> little<00:01:57.719> bit<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.990> lot

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
hard pretty hard same little bit a lot

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.789 
hard pretty hard same little bit a lot
bigger<00:01:58.439> than<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> studio<00:01:59.759> case<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:01.649> not

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
bigger than the studio case but it's not

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.350 
bigger than the studio case but it's not
it's<00:02:01.950> alright<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.880> case<00:02:03.090> better

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
it's alright I like this case better

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.899 
it's alright I like this case better
because<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:04.680> studio<00:02:05.070> case<00:02:05.310> right<00:02:05.880> there

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
because the studio case right there

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.040 
because the studio case right there
where<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:07.129> zipper<00:02:08.129> thing<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.479> it<00:02:09.479> collapse

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
where the zipper thing is it collapse

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.110 
where the zipper thing is it collapse
into<00:02:10.289> itself<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:11.039> I'd<00:02:11.340> feel<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:11.819> I'd<00:02:11.970> be

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
into itself and I'd feel like I'd be

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.430 
into itself and I'd feel like I'd be
crushing<00:02:12.510> my<00:02:12.840> head

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
crushing my head

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.080 
crushing my head
on<00:02:13.920> these<00:02:14.220> ones<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:14.700> doesn't<00:02:14.970> correct

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
on these ones it doesn't correct

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.570 
on these ones it doesn't correct
collapse<00:02:15.600> into<00:02:15.810> itself<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.320> when<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.800> zip

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
collapse into itself it when it you zip

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.110 
collapse into itself it when it you zip
it<00:02:17.670> up<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.940> doesn't<00:02:18.030> close<00:02:18.450> back<00:02:18.960> into<00:02:19.230> itself

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
it up it doesn't close back into itself

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.760 
it up it doesn't close back into itself
so<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.750> also<00:02:22.050> like<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.290> material

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
so I like that I also like the material

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.590 
so I like that I also like the material
and<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.400> pocket<00:02:23.790> it's<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.090> little<00:02:24.300> better<00:02:24.390> than

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
and the pocket it's a little better than

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.500 
and the pocket it's a little better than
this<00:02:24.690> one<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.850> put<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.970> plus<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:29.330> did<00:02:30.330> like

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
this one so put the plus I did like

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.820 
this one so put the plus I did like
about<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.780> studio's<00:02:31.230> ever<00:02:31.410> been<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:31.710> they

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
about the studio's ever been this they

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.400 
about the studio's ever been this they
had<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> mute<00:02:32.220> button<00:02:32.250> on<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.700> side<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:34.170> does

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
had a mute button on the side this does

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.060 
had a mute button on the side this does
not<00:02:34.440> have<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:35.090> no<00:02:36.090> mute<00:02:36.270> button<00:02:36.540> but<00:02:37.070> that's

not have that no mute button but that's
not<00:02:38.220> too<00:02:38.460> bad<00:02:38.490> i<00:02:38.700> mean<00:02:39.110> it's<00:02:40.110> not<00:02:40.200> very<00:02:40.350> hard

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
not too bad i mean it's not very hard

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.690 
not too bad i mean it's not very hard
just<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.860> put<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:41.310> pause<00:02:43.700> earcups

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
just to put it on pause earcups

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.510 
just to put it on pause earcups
basically<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.300> same<00:02:47.450> basically<00:02:48.450> same<00:02:49.520> these

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
basically the same basically same these

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.630 
basically the same basically same these
are<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.670> little<00:02:50.790> bigger<00:02:51.530> but<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:53.400> not<00:02:53.490> that

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
are a little bigger but it's not that

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.660 
are a little bigger but it's not that
bad<00:02:53.760> they<00:02:54.360> do<00:02:54.420> go<00:02:54.690> over<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.990> ear<00:02:55.640> perfectly<00:02:56.640> I

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
bad they do go over the ear perfectly I

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.370 
bad they do go over the ear perfectly I
mean<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.180> didn't<00:02:57.660> have<00:02:57.780> any<00:02:57.930> problem<00:02:58.230> with<00:02:58.290> that

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
mean I didn't have any problem with that

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.440 
mean I didn't have any problem with that
being<00:02:58.770> on<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.040> air<00:02:59.130> no<00:03:00.200> trouble<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:02.450> they

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
being on the air no trouble and they

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.850 
being on the air no trouble and they
fold<00:03:03.660> up<00:03:03.750> nicely<00:03:04.020> like<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:07.410> box<00:03:07.680> it

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
fold up nicely like that the box it

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.840 
fold up nicely like that the box it
comes<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.220> it's<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.700> lot<00:03:08.790> smaller<00:03:09.470> but<00:03:10.760> it's<00:03:11.760> a

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
comes in it's a lot smaller but it's a

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.150 
comes in it's a lot smaller but it's a
little<00:03:12.030> harder<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.300> open<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.930> kind<00:03:13.710> of<00:03:13.770> got<00:03:14.040> me

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
little harder to open I kind of got me

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.560 
little harder to open I kind of got me
mad<00:03:14.310> on<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.460> I<00:03:14.640> could<00:03:14.880> barely<00:03:15.090> open<00:03:15.210> this

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
mad on that I could barely open this

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.460 
mad on that I could barely open this
thing<00:03:15.780> but<00:03:17.630> it's<00:03:18.630> not<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.959> bad<00:03:19.080> once<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:19.320> get

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
thing but it's not that bad once you get

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.130 
thing but it's not that bad once you get
it<00:03:19.620> out<00:03:19.709> sounds<00:03:20.100> nice<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.580> guess<00:03:20.610> but<00:03:20.790> oh<00:03:21.239> well

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
it out sounds nice I guess but oh well

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.229 
it out sounds nice I guess but oh well
yeah<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.280> that's<00:03:23.640> my<00:03:23.820> review<00:03:24.090> on<00:03:24.330> this<00:03:24.540> the

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
yeah so that's my review on this the

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.930 
yeah so that's my review on this the
basically<00:03:27.410> summary<00:03:28.410> is<00:03:28.590> V<00:03:29.400> sound<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.790> little

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
basically summary is V sound a little

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.370 
basically summary is V sound a little
bit<00:03:30.120> better<00:03:30.270> than<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.510> drays<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.970> they<00:03:33.170> are<00:03:34.170> a

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
bit better than the drays and they are a

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.020 
bit better than the drays and they are a
little<00:03:34.560> bit<00:03:34.739> more<00:03:34.860> balanced<00:03:35.340> knots<00:03:35.790> bass

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
little bit more balanced knots bass

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.530 
little bit more balanced knots bass
heavy<00:03:36.239> but<00:03:37.489> overall<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:38.820> like<00:03:39.360> these<00:03:39.480> better

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
heavy but overall I like these better

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.040 
heavy but overall I like these better
than<00:03:39.989> my<00:03:40.320> Studios<00:03:40.770> ahead
