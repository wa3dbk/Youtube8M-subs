00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
worth it this is the Manhattan which is

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.110 
worth it this is the Manhattan which is
appropriate<00:00:31.410> since<00:00:31.710> Wolfgang's<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.790> coming

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
appropriate since Wolfgang's is coming

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.110 
appropriate since Wolfgang's is coming
from<00:00:33.540> New<00:00:33.690> York<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.290> Miami<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.100> we're<00:00:36.030> gonna

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
from New York to Miami so we're gonna

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.860 
from New York to Miami so we're gonna
try<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.450> Manhattan

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
try the Manhattan

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.100 
try the Manhattan
that<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> strong<00:00:40.530> but<00:00:40.950> amazing<00:00:41.670> drink<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.270> I

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
that is a strong but amazing drink and I

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.170 
that is a strong but amazing drink and I
think<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.860> Manhattan<00:00:44.250> works<00:00:44.460> very<00:00:44.879> well<00:00:45.000> here

think the Manhattan works very well here

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.590 
think the Manhattan works very well here
in<00:00:45.449> Miami<00:00:49.040> so<00:00:50.040> we<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.550> tomato<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.300> onion

excited and I was told to maybe try some

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.649

of<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.720> Wolfgang<00:01:01.079> sauce<00:01:01.769> so<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.460> might<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:03.510> go

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
of the Wolfgang sauce so I might just go

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
and take the waiter suggestion why not

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.859 
and take the waiter suggestion why not
right<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.950> sauce<00:01:08.159> really<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.790> accents<00:01:09.690> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
right the sauce really like accents the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.870 
right the sauce really like accents the
tomato<00:01:10.440> and<00:01:10.649> the<00:01:10.740> onion<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.250> wouldn't<00:01:11.789> normally

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
tomato and the onion I wouldn't normally

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.669
