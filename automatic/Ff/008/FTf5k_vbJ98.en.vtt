00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.660

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.570
 ruined filled the news that 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.700
 unknown publisher smart 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.340
 he's going to be publishing dylan long on 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.770
 Russian actually they did their job 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.900
 releasing the first number but then later 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.359
 a month and a half maybe more after 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.609
 first they published the second number like me 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.830
 spoke then I liked everything but on 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:37.770
 my surprise the second number was still 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:39.420
 better please love and favor think how 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.879
 and in the previous review of the authors and 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.920
 I will not say anything new although there is no plot 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.670
 the same nickname and draftsman changed 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.440
 Angela Stana replaced Gustav 3g drawing 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.600
 visibly changed became more 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.969
 detailed dark first number 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.360
 dawn of the living dead was called 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.579
 they have nothing to do with mysticism 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.140
 the name is his jack the ripper yes exactly 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.390
 the same man the ripper 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.610
 serial killer from london which 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.689
 acted at the end of the 800s which 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.000
 I killed and opened people linda I know 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.700
 said a little earlier what to spend or not 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.310
 nothing mystical so here i was 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.590
 wrong so to this day it is not known 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.630
 how many people did he kill and the real one 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.270
 the maniacâ€™s identity also remains a mystery 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.340
 oh well all the fun about it 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.150
 smart guy placed on the back side 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.329
 covers 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.950
 so read it yourself about the plot first 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.840
 the page shows us some 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.360
 seance on which group 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.640
 people trying to evoke the spirit of who would you 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.070
 thought 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:46.290
 the cause of the ripper just guys for 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.180
 the table succeeds but by 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.850
 home house summoner nica 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.790
 medium she did not understand what 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.110
 happened in an unusual condition 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.149
 after that very session she 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.719
 returns home everything seems good 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.460
 but she hears footsteps behind her at home 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.909
 runs runs headlong 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.030
 but gets into a dead end where its naturally 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.429
 kill 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.799
 morning newspapers are full of news 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.599
 Jack the Ripper return so here 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.730
 our already good friend dyan dog 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.489
 together with his friend groucho 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.739
 learns about this event and how it was already 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.620
 earlier to him is sweet beautiful 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.439
 a lady named jane who talks about 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.629
 that her stepmother killed it through 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.939
 some time memory introduces us even to 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.189
 Another important character and the spectrum was very 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.959
 but let's not talk for a long time about him 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.480
 only that they can be said 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.040
 companions made before jane 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.579
 actively flirts with dog 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.780
 and that turn has reciprocated 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.450
 some time after dating 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.269
 guys are having a crazy ride 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.889
 on motsike to her place of work there she 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.280
 tell the case well, all the details 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:54.900
 that session and the facts about the people that were there 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.379
 later in a rather weird environment 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.480
 mind manages to break a couple of couch into it 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.419
 same time one more precisely one participant 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.379
 session actively cheating on her husband well 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:07.319
 that is, bom bom 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:10.349
 everything seems to be good to wear alone at home 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:14.250
 suddenly hears footsteps nearby and this 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:17.069
 far from her husband that in this room you 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.150
 we are waiting for interesting and often unexpected 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:24.659
 events and the ending is generally super 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:30.150
 murders and riddles and humor and sekas all 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:32.939
 it's about demand aha well, like everything is exactly 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.849
 pair of parts first smart number o van 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:38.280
 released in 3000 copies and the same 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.400
 slightly thought cut back to 1000 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.049
 also changed the cover material more precisely 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.329

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.359
