to<00:01:07.840> be<00:01:07.929> bringing<00:01:08.049> GTA<00:01:08.619> 5<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:09.189> PC<00:01:09.639> but<00:01:10.149> the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
to be bringing GTA 5 to the PC but the

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.550 
to be bringing GTA 5 to the PC but the
game<00:01:10.420> requires<00:01:10.569> a<00:01:10.840> little<00:01:11.200> bit<00:01:11.350> more

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
game requires a little bit more

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.679 
game requires a little bit more
development<00:01:12.219> time<00:01:12.429> in<00:01:12.639> order<00:01:12.999> to<00:01:13.179> ensure<00:01:13.509> that

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
development time in order to ensure that

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.480 
development time in order to ensure that
it's<00:01:13.840> amazing<00:01:14.259> and<00:01:14.380> as<00:01:14.499> polished<00:01:14.889> as<00:01:14.889> possible

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
it's amazing and as polished as possible

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.399 
it's amazing and as polished as possible
so<00:01:16.299> it<00:01:16.420> does<00:01:16.539> make<00:01:16.569> sense<00:01:16.899> that<00:01:17.139> they<00:01:17.200> want<00:01:17.350> to

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
so it does make sense that they want to

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:18.870 
so it does make sense that they want to
take<00:01:17.560> that<00:01:17.649> little<00:01:17.920> bit<00:01:18.039> extra<00:01:18.159> time<00:01:18.639> to<00:01:18.850> make

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
take that little bit extra time to make

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.989 
take that little bit extra time to make
sure<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.240> pc<00:01:19.600> version<00:01:19.630> is<00:01:20.229> extra<00:01:20.829> good<00:01:21.009> but<00:01:21.939> it

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:21.999 
sure the pc version is extra good but it

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:23.669 
sure the pc version is extra good but it
also<00:01:22.119> makes<00:01:22.389> sense<00:01:22.630> on<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.840> marketing<00:01:23.319> side<00:01:23.560> of

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
also makes sense on a marketing side of

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:24.629 
also makes sense on a marketing side of
you<00:01:23.829> you<00:01:23.979> know<00:01:24.069> people<00:01:24.310> are<00:01:24.369> going<00:01:24.459> to<00:01:24.549> be

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:24.639 
you you know people are going to be

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:27.120 
you you know people are going to be
upgrading<00:01:25.179> to<00:01:25.209> playstation<00:01:25.780> 4<00:01:26.049> and<00:01:26.200> xbox<00:01:26.560> one

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
upgrading to playstation 4 and xbox one

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.410 
upgrading to playstation 4 and xbox one
and<00:01:27.310> then<00:01:27.670> they'll<00:01:27.819> probably<00:01:27.969> be<00:01:28.149> inclined

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
and then they'll probably be inclined

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.480 
and then they'll probably be inclined
again<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:29.079> upgrade<00:01:29.439> on<00:01:29.590> pc<00:01:29.979> when<00:01:30.189> that<00:01:30.279> comes

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
again to upgrade on pc when that comes

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.340 
again to upgrade on pc when that comes
out<00:01:30.639> later<00:01:30.850> whereas<00:01:31.539> if<00:01:31.569> they're<00:01:32.049> really<00:01:32.139> sit

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
out later whereas if they're really sit

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.779 
out later whereas if they're really sit
at<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.499> same<00:01:32.649> time<00:01:32.920> people<00:01:33.279> might<00:01:33.459> just<00:01:33.700> go

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
at the same time people might just go
