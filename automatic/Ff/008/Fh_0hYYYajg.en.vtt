00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.439
 hello people in the video is about it 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:08.450
 which foods you never get 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.650
 increases 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.109
 You know that's meanwhile 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.929
 It should be clear that one 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:23.519
 now only if you can take one 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:27.659
 calorie surplus therefore has to be 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.150
 the food they eat at all 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:33.150
 Do not let that get you that far 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.050
 into a calorie surplus 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.940
 which foods are that specific 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.840
 let's start with the calorie poorest 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.610
 things 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.000
 That's definitely vegetable vegetables 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.460
 of all the foods known to me 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.710
 are the least calories 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.310
 that is vegetables you could say 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.730
 kilos of vegetables could kilo in 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.790
 Shovel yourself every day and you 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.759
 Do not take it because it is very 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.679
 unlikely to be with vegetables 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:12.439
 ever in a calorie surplus 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:20.509
 So come you knew quiet five kilo 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:23.340
 salad tomatoes cucumbers broccoli cauliflower 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.069
 carrots so that it can you five kilo 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.270
 Eat and you still will not be in 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:31.350
 calories are over you 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.689
 Of course, you can also get one of them 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.060
 I have a very large amount of food 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.189
 You say five kilo 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.159
 Of course, the sat but you take 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.600
 nevertheless not second thing of the 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.109
 it is very unlikely that one 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.499
 increases 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:56.159
 this is fruit like apple wanderin 

00:01:48.499 --> 00:02:00.630
 pear raspberries strawberries and so on 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:04.290
 Generally, such grapes 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.260
 things because they are also extreme 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.479
 extremely low calorie density have that 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.370
 means you have a lot 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.230
 also has relatively few calories 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.750
 For example, we can do a whole one 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.570
 eat whole watermelon then you will 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.240
 be really busy because they are very much 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.700
 However, water just contains very little 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.700
 Calories and fruits are one of those 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.160
 You can do that with vegetable kilos 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.980
 eat and it will be very unlikely 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.980
 be that you can take from it if 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.260
 Not her ten kilos of it 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.250
 I ate but I think so much 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.090
 nobody needs 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:46.980
 one is already with 23 kilo vegetables and 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:53.490
 You can already get enough fruit during the day 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:58.910
 will come then things like so 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:03.060
 vegan vegan stuff like potatoes rice 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:06.270
 something in the direction because that's always 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.900
 again the thing of less 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.880
 Calorie dense potatoes are a whole 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.040
 good example karl he does it now 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.739
 The potato diet he is not going to 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.050
 take it will decrease even though he 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.040
 three kilos of potatoes a day 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.870
 he will most likely take 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.540
 can reduce body fat percentage 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.580
 with three kilos of potatoes first mega 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.209
 I could not do that much 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.720
 during the day 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:36.330
 he makes it first fresach I would 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.130
 but does not provide as can you also 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.080
 you can only see potatoes eating like that 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.400
 much as you want 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.840
 it will be very unlikely that 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.299
 your calorie surplus 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.880
 as well as fat free 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:56.640
 meat and fish for example 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.380
 salmon fillet chicken breast fillet something like that 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.299
 if then, for example, the meat and 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.010
 fish species with the least 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.560
 fat percentage and that's where most falls 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.150
 has calories and that data is not 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.380
 have also found these foods 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.470
 automatically very little calories 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.240
 you will not get any of that 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.519
 not the calories on circuit 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.329
 most likely you will get that 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.910
 does not come and that's why you can get away with it 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.510
 also eat a lot and you will not 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.330
 to take 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.760
 So that was just a few examples 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.350
 for very poor low calorie foods 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.600
 you can eat them then you need 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.100
 Also, do not count calories you can 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.070
 eat and eat and eat and you become 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.680
 most likely not to take 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:47.330
 but it is that that is really 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:55.470
 very unlikely that human 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:58.410
 yes 45 to take 67 kilos of food 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.000
 before he gets fed up he can 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.970
 stomach also has a limited volume 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.450
 so if you take back those things 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.550
 then you will not take 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.810
 i could put my hand into the fire for that 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:15.300
 that more and more comes from 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.870
 ready meals microwaves eat almost 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.250
 food and such continue to say a lot 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.390
 fat is in it and means a lot of value 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.340
 fi calories 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.440
 In addition, the supervisors are calories 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.060
 dense like sweets 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.850
 they have a lot of sugar in one 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.919
 low volume and therefore they have 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.630
 also a lot of calories 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.820
 You should avoid that and that 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.040
 you should have named such an initial 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.930
 prefers applying line to take 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.250
 also does not need to count calories 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.250
 that was thank you
