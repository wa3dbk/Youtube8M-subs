 that in what I do the lighting or if what 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.460
 I do skype because it's the problem 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.000
 to play is that I can not play and talk 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.280
 that's a problem ok then there is 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.550
 as it will distract me greatly from my 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.220

 There are guys who are checking out, not the truth 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.600
 is that everyone is not very sure but 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.950

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.810
 It did not go so well for me to say 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.470
 I played like 20 games and this was the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.910
 only good round because it can have 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.280
 a lot of time I did not play the day 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.320
