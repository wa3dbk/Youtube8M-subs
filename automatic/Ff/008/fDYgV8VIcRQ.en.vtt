00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.620
 another minecraft tutorial and in 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.899
 I will hate this one for myself 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.040
 Imagine this is what gives you everything 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.599
 can do with them and what for 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.940
 characteristics you have that explain me 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.559
 you guys in this video hurry in 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.150
 minecraft actually around and you free 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.210
 you can find them here, for example 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.840
 normal plains in the savanna in the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.140
 high mountains in swamp in all sorts 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.369
 Fields in the taiga and also now and then 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.560
 time in the jungle 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.300
 Now we come to Martin relevant facts 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.640
 and there are a total of eight types 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.160
 of bunnies and although the first six are 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.710
 once every brown rabbit at the albino 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.930
 Haase then the fun then the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.540
 black white bunny then the sand colored one 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.250
 Hare and the brown spotted Haase these 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.960
 Six species run everywhere in the outdoors 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.789
 Wildlife above and can be found too 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.680
 quite often there are also 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.270
 special types and that if I am now 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.949
 try this hare with one 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.870
 to name tag 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.780
 then he ends the color and becomes this 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.949
 hare black white bunnies and therefore 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.180
 a special form 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.219
 There is also a killer 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.530
 rabbits and for that we need 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.549
 either very lucky and indeed happy 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.340
 those with a likelihood of 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.020
 one to 1000 or we use this 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.450
 command block and that we build the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.460
 hate together then talks a command 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.610
 block then we have to specify here 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.170
 rabbit 99 if we hate another one 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.740
 want to have, we must at the rap hip 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.150
 simply specify five or four and the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.250
 we have to specify 90 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.229
 Then click on that here 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.780
 like a normal haase but there 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.549
 a new day and that is the killer 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.900
 rabbits and if we are too close to the home 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.920
 we see that we are attacking him 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.540
 and he does a really good job if 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.189
 I can get him killed 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.759
 of course, a reward here too 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.740
 example a raw rabbit and a 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.299
 rabbit falls that one sees here too 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.549
 and now and then you can get one too 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.320
 rabbit photo drops what you can with the 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.850
 Three things can show now 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.049
 with the high rabbit 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.579
 Maybe you can do that in the oven 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.530
 burn and that will us in one 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.829
 fried meat can here it 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.840
 we just roast it in the oven like that and 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.610
 we see that was fried now and 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.439
 we can do that with the rabbit fur too 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.239
 very cool thing and if 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.020
 we four of them in the crafting 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.360
 do table 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.240
 so we can make a song here 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.650
 forces 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.960
 and with the bunny foot you can be cool 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.730
 brewing potions such as the potion 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.740
 the power to jump and that's what we need 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.020
 here quite normal water bottles and the 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.980
 we have to become one with each other 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.260
 make strange potion 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.610
 so now a strange drank and 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.440
 We have to go further 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.849
 Consuming and indeed we are lying 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.250
 here again three strange drinks pure 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.690
 and then comes the hare finds and 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.920
 there we have to wait a bit and 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.760
 then we drank one 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.870
 jump power out 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.489
 but now to multiply the hare and 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.680
 Although you can on the one hand with 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.090
 Dandelion and multiply with carrots 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.470
 the difference between the two 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.060
 things as if I have a carrot now 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.230
 holding in hand I see that me 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.840
 watch and jump on 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.269
 if I like the dandelion somehow 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.260
 he suspects he wants to be interested now 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.599
 but not anyway I can with 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.909
 right click the two make horny and 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.200
 then they show two or a little one 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.640
 ache 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.290
 the same thing works with 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.420
 carrots and golden carrots here 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.609
 I'll click the two and the two 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.159
 are in love now and enter 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.540
 little bunny baby and finally 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.920
 Really you were yours 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.560
 bring carrot fields to safety 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.720
 should because if a hare comes here 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.280
 market namely carrots and we are the same 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.470
 he will see these carrots 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.909
 eat and essential wait until this 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.950
 cute haase a warranty period 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.459
 thank you for spectators until the 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.459
 next time
