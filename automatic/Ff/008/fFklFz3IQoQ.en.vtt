you're expecting the other process is
out<00:04:20.210> there<00:04:20.450> that<00:04:20.630> are<00:04:20.660> dried<00:04:21.020> our

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 
out there that are dried our

out there that are dried our
freeze-dried<00:04:22.460> we<00:04:22.700> suggest<00:04:23.180> you<00:04:23.330> avoid<00:04:23.419> that

freeze-dried we suggest you avoid that
just<00:04:24.140> because<00:04:24.470> it<00:04:24.650> costs<00:04:25.070> twice

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
just because it costs twice

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.620 
just because it costs twice
as<00:04:25.470> much<00:04:25.710> takes<00:04:26.430> three<00:04:26.730> times<00:04:26.880> as<00:04:27.090> much<00:04:27.300> space

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
as much takes three times as much space

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.590 
as much takes three times as much space
in<00:04:27.960> storage<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.650> also<00:04:29.490> it<00:04:29.970> has<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.270> lot<00:04:30.570> of
