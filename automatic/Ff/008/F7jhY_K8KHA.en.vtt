hi scarless Marci advisor a program in
radio<00:00:03.720> transmitters<00:00:03.899> it's<00:00:04.740> just<00:00:04.950> way<00:00:05.279> too

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
radio transmitters it's just way too

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.460 
radio transmitters it's just way too
hard<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:05.910> think<00:00:06.089> it's<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.270> lot<00:00:06.450> harder<00:00:06.690> than<00:00:07.049> it

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
hard I think it's a lot harder than it

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.160 
hard I think it's a lot harder than it
needs<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.770> be<00:00:08.090> the<00:00:09.090> nice<00:00:09.420> mirror<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:09.900> use

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
needs to be the nice mirror that I use

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.789 
needs to be the nice mirror that I use
is<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.440> J<00:00:10.790> rx9<00:00:11.790> 303<00:00:12.540> which<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.870> got<00:00:13.049> like<00:00:13.230> four<00:00:13.740> or

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
is a J rx9 303 which I got like four or

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.540 
is a J rx9 303 which I got like four or
five<00:00:13.950> years<00:00:14.250> ago<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:15.269> when<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.450> first<00:00:15.780> got<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.199> I

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
five years ago and when I first got it I

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.130 
five years ago and when I first got it I
sat<00:00:17.550> down<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.060> created<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.480> entire<00:00:18.779> model

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
sat down and I created the entire model

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.160 
sat down and I created the entire model
it<00:00:19.439> was<00:00:19.560> over<00:00:20.010> 200<00:00:20.520> pages<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.630> remember

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
it was over 200 pages and I remember

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.259 
it was over 200 pages and I remember
that<00:00:22.289> was<00:00:22.439> also<00:00:22.800> like<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.189> lighter<00:00:23.550> supplement

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
that was also like a lighter supplement

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.200 
that was also like a lighter supplement
with<00:00:24.420> another<00:00:24.930> 50<00:00:25.320> pages<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.670> pretty

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
with another 50 pages and this is pretty

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.910 
with another 50 pages and this is pretty
technical<00:00:27.480> pretty<00:00:28.320> dense<00:00:29.269> model<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.769> so<00:00:31.769> then

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
technical pretty dense model and so then

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.639 
technical pretty dense model and so then
after<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.579> finished<00:00:32.850> doing<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:34.020> went<00:00:34.290> okay

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
after I finished doing that I went okay

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.799 
after I finished doing that I went okay
lemme<00:00:34.829> program<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.399> liner<00:00:35.670> just<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.480> see<00:00:36.660> how

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
lemme program it liner just to see how

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:37.400 
lemme program it liner just to see how
it<00:00:36.960> goes

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
it goes

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.069 
it goes
and<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.790> only<00:00:39.149> complication<00:00:39.600> with<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
and the only complication with the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.770 
and the only complication with the
glider<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> really<00:00:41.100> simple<00:00:41.820> one<00:00:41.969> he<00:00:42.480> said<00:00:42.690> he

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
glider is a really simple one he said he

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.459 
glider is a really simple one he said he
has<00:00:42.930> spoilers

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
has spoilers

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.299 
has spoilers
we<00:00:43.649> had<00:00:43.860> one<00:00:44.550> spoiler<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.770> bottom<00:00:47.100> line

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
we had one spoiler and the bottom line

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.090 
we had one spoiler and the bottom line
was<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.450> could<00:00:48.809> not<00:00:49.170> figure<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.649> how

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
was is that I could not figure out how

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.240 
was is that I could not figure out how
to<00:00:50.160> program<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.180> spoiler<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.920> again<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> have

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
to program the spoiler and again I have

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.040 
to program the spoiler and again I have
read<00:00:53.489> all<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> documentation<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.840> being

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
read all the documentation I was being

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.439 
read all the documentation I was being
very<00:00:55.289> careful<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.610> never<00:00:56.850> figured<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.300> out

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
very careful and I never figured it out

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.349 
very careful and I never figured it out
to<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.809> day<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.379> still<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.940> spoiler

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
to this day I still have a this spoiler

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.810 
to this day I still have a this spoiler
program<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.050> model<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:02.340> I've<00:01:02.670> been

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
program for that model and I've been

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.700 
program for that model and I've been
flying<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.329> long<00:01:03.510> time<00:01:03.780> your<00:01:04.110> models<00:01:04.589> and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
flying for a long time your models and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.620 
flying for a long time your models and
full-size<00:01:05.010> I've<00:01:05.820> got<00:01:06.030> an<00:01:06.150> Ivy<00:01:06.450> League

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
full-size I've got an Ivy League

full-size I've got an Ivy League
computer<00:01:07.140> science<00:01:07.470> degree<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:08.010> mean<00:01:08.400> if<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.640> can

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
computer science degree I mean if I can

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.830 
computer science degree I mean if I can
figure<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.180> out

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
figure this out

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.130 
figure this out
who<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.439> if<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.299> remember<00:01:12.299> asking<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.780> friend

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
that has the same transmitter that

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.570 
that has the same transmitter that

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
hi-pro Tommy spoiler-free glider and I

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.820 
hi-pro Tommy spoiler-free glider and I
said<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.479> tell<00:01:18.689> me<00:01:18.840> what<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.140> did<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.530> he

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
me he had just tried a bunch of

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.890 
me he had just tried a bunch of
different<00:01:26.670> settings<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.600> he<00:01:27.689> got

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
different settings so that he got

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.850 
different settings so that he got
something<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.409> worked

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
something that worked

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.090 
something that worked
we<00:01:29.189> shall<00:01:29.369> October<00:01:29.880> said<00:01:30.090> that's<00:01:30.329> crazy<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
we shall October said that's crazy and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.289 
we shall October said that's crazy and
before<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.189> think<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.490> I'm<00:01:32.670> bashing<00:01:32.939> they

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
before you think that I'm bashing they

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.929 
before you think that I'm bashing they
are<00:01:33.479> I've<00:01:34.259> also<00:01:34.500> used<00:01:35.130> Futaba

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
are I've also used Futaba

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.609 
are I've also used Futaba
a<00:01:36.030> lot<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.329> futaba-san<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:37.049> better<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.560> just

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
a lot in futaba-san it better it's just

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.520 
a lot in futaba-san it better it's just
different<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.360> remember<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.079> friend<00:01:40.290> that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
different and I remember a friend that

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.999 
different and I remember a friend that
had<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> nine<00:01:41.130> channel<00:01:41.579> multiplex<00:01:42.180> radio<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:43.009> I

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
had a nine channel multiplex radio and I

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.069 
had a nine channel multiplex radio and I
said<00:01:44.250> okay<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.700> see<00:01:44.970> how<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.509> programming

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
said okay can I see how the programming

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:46.880 
said okay can I see how the programming
works<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.500> that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
works on that

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.789 
works on that
and<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:48.390> minute<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.840> wanted<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.259> programming

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and the minute I wanted to programming

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.679 
and the minute I wanted to programming
mode<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> transmitter<00:01:50.790> he<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.540> went

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
mode on the transmitter he just went

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.330 
mode on the transmitter he just went
into<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.960> panic<00:01:52.170> oh<00:01:52.560> my<00:01:52.710> god<00:01:52.860> don't<00:01:53.040> change

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
into a panic oh my god don't change

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.960 
into a panic oh my god don't change
anything

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
anything

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.460 
anything
because<00:01:54.299> I'll<00:01:54.509> never<00:01:54.750> know<00:01:54.990> what<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.320> was<00:01:55.439> that

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
because I'll never know what it was that

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.770 
because I'll never know what it was that
you<00:01:55.740> changed<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.700> I'm<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.060> okay<00:01:57.390> that's<00:01:57.570> not

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
you changed and I'm like okay that's not

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.789 
you changed and I'm like okay that's not
a<00:01:57.810> good<00:01:58.049> time<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:59.899> and<00:02:00.899> I'm<00:02:01.049> not<00:02:01.079> talking<00:02:01.649> about

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
a good time so and I'm not talking about

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.850 
a good time so and I'm not talking about
the<00:02:02.490> thousand<00:02:03.210> dollar<00:02:03.860> professional

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
the thousand dollar professional

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.530 
the thousand dollar professional
transmitters<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.700> don't<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.000> don't<00:02:06.119> have<00:02:06.390> much

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
transmitters I don't I don't have much

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.900 
transmitters I don't I don't have much
experience<00:02:06.570> with<00:02:07.259> those<00:02:07.409> maybe<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.520> baby

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
experience with those maybe the baby

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.940 
experience with those maybe the baby
programming<00:02:09.450> one<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.690> those<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.020> easier<00:02:10.500> I'm

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
programming one of those is easier I'm

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.809 
programming one of those is easier I'm
talking<00:02:11.430> about<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.819> more<00:02:12.060> mainstream

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
talking about the more mainstream

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.759 
talking about the more mainstream
like<00:02:13.359> the<00:02:13.480> 9303<00:02:14.049> which<00:02:14.469> are<00:02:14.620> very<00:02:14.799> popular<00:02:15.120> so

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
like the 9303 which are very popular so

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.259 
like the 9303 which are very popular so
and<00:02:17.769> of<00:02:17.889> course<00:02:18.099> you<00:02:18.280> know<00:02:18.400> I'm<00:02:18.670> talking<00:02:18.879> about

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
and of course you know I'm talking about

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.420 
and of course you know I'm talking about
also<00:02:19.629> radios<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.260> are<00:02:20.469> aimed<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:21.010> more<00:02:21.219> and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
also radios that are aimed and more and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.420 
also radios that are aimed and more and
less<00:02:21.609> experienced<00:02:22.209> fliers<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:23.349> I<00:02:23.650> don't<00:02:24.310> like

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
less experienced fliers so I don't like

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.069 
less experienced fliers so I don't like
bringing<00:02:24.700> your<00:02:24.849> plan<00:02:25.389> O's<00:02:25.569> with<00:02:25.599> I'm<00:02:25.900> also

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
bringing your plan O's with I'm also

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.140 
bringing your plan O's with I'm also
offering<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.859> solution<00:02:27.189> so<00:02:27.579> I<00:02:27.730> have<00:02:27.969> two

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
offering a solution so I have two

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.490 
offering a solution so I have two
potential<00:02:28.569> solutions<00:02:29.230> for<00:02:29.409> the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
potential solutions for the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.410 
potential solutions for the
manufacturers<00:02:30.219> one<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:30.909> them<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.209> to

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
display to do that and just do it as a

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.750 
display to do that and just do it as a
question<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.469> answer<00:02:41.829> type<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.219> format<00:02:42.579> you

you want to have exponential do you
wanna<00:02:56.379> do<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:56.769> want<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.069> have<00:02:57.250> dual<00:02:57.549> rate<00:02:57.790> what

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
wanna do you want to have dual rate what

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.330 
wanna do you want to have dual rate what
type<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:58.930> model<00:02:59.230> is<00:02:59.319> it<00:02:59.560> is<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.799> training

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
type of model is it is it training

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.409 
type of model is it is it training
irresolute<00:03:00.879> 3d<00:03:01.349> you<00:03:02.349> want<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.680> have<00:03:02.829> mixing

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
irresolute 3d you want to have mixing

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.720 
irresolute 3d you want to have mixing
from<00:03:04.419> the<00:03:04.569> elevator<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.139> the<00:03:05.169> tunnel<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:06.159> I

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
from the elevator to the tunnel and I

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.459 
from the elevator to the tunnel and I
mean<00:03:07.599> those<00:03:07.719> are<00:03:07.870> very<00:03:08.079> straightforward

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:08.469 
mean those are very straightforward

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.520 
mean those are very straightforward
questions<00:03:09.189> and<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:10.209> desoto<00:03:10.569> that<00:03:10.930> would<00:03:11.139> be<00:03:11.290> a

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
questions and the desoto that would be a

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.159 
questions and the desoto that would be a
good<00:03:12.219> but<00:03:12.519> basic<00:03:13.030> set<00:03:13.269> up<00:03:13.449> the<00:03:13.719> curse<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.079> know

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:14.169 
good but basic set up the curse you know

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:15.899 
good but basic set up the curse you know
you<00:03:14.319> need<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:14.739> be<00:03:14.829> conservative<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.760> learn

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
you need to be conservative you learn

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.409 
you need to be conservative you learn
all<00:03:16.090> these<00:03:16.359> specifics<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:17.049> the<00:03:17.169> model<00:03:17.500> but

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
all these specifics of the model but

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:22.050 
all these specifics of the model but
it's<00:03:19.419> a<00:03:19.599> hell<00:03:19.870> of<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:20.109> lot<00:03:20.290> easier<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:21.489> modify

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
it's a hell of a lot easier to modify

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.729 
it's a hell of a lot easier to modify
the<00:03:22.120> configuration<00:03:22.479> after<00:03:23.259> you<00:03:23.590> have

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
the configuration after you have

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.800 
the configuration after you have
something<00:03:24.129> in<00:03:24.280> there<00:03:24.489> than<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:25.239> is<00:03:25.389> to<00:03:25.569> create

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
something in there than it is to create

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.059 
something in there than it is to create
it<00:03:26.049> in<00:03:26.199> the<00:03:26.259> first<00:03:26.560> place

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
it in the first place

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.159 
it in the first place
so<00:03:27.519> so<00:03:27.879> this<00:03:28.030> would<00:03:28.209> be<00:03:28.299> a<00:03:28.329> good<00:03:28.509> way<00:03:28.689> to<00:03:28.750> get

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
so so this would be a good way to get

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.399 
so so this would be a good way to get
you<00:03:29.379> started<00:03:29.409> and<00:03:30.009> then<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.540> can<00:03:31.720> tweak<00:03:31.989> it<00:03:32.049> as

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
you started and then you can tweak it as

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.469 
you started and then you can tweak it as
you<00:03:32.560> fly<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:32.859> model<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.609> as<00:03:33.879> you<00:03:34.030> need<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.239> and

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:34.479 
you fly the model and as you need to and

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:36.509 
you fly the model and as you need to and
that<00:03:34.900> that<00:03:35.199> would<00:03:35.319> be<00:03:35.379> fine<00:03:35.709> the<00:03:36.489> only

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
that that would be fine the only

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.219 
that that would be fine the only
suggestion<00:03:37.090> that<00:03:37.419> I<00:03:37.449> have<00:03:37.509> for<00:03:38.139> the

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:38.229 
suggestion that I have for the

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:41.569 
suggestion that I have for the
manufacturers<00:03:38.979> is<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.430> have<00:03:40.299> a<00:03:40.329> USB<00:03:40.750> port<00:03:40.930> and

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
manufacturers is to have a USB port and

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.699 
manufacturers is to have a USB port and
document<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.729> format<00:03:43.180> of<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.419> data<00:03:43.709> because

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
document the format of the data because

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.830 
document the format of the data because
then<00:03:45.099> that<00:03:45.310> will<00:03:45.459> open<00:03:45.609> up<00:03:45.879> the<00:03:45.939> door<00:03:46.269> to<00:03:46.599> have

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
then that will open up the door to have

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.039 
then that will open up the door to have
third<00:03:47.169> parties<00:03:47.590> write<00:03:48.459> software<00:03:49.120> or<00:03:49.659> for<00:03:49.989> the

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
third parties write software or for the

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.349 
third parties write software or for the
open-source<00:03:50.500> software<00:03:50.759> so<00:03:51.759> that<00:03:51.790> you<00:03:51.970> can<00:03:52.239> use

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
open-source software so that you can use

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.780 
open-source software so that you can use
a<00:03:52.389> PC<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.620> do<00:03:53.769> all<00:03:53.919> the<00:03:54.040> programming<00:03:54.250> for<00:03:54.639> your

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
a PC to do all the programming for your

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.179 
a PC to do all the programming for your
transmitter<00:03:55.409> but<00:03:56.409> any<00:03:56.590> others<00:03:56.859> pretty<00:03:56.979> much

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:57.189 
transmitter but any others pretty much

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.740 
transmitter but any others pretty much
impossible<00:03:57.489> because<00:03:58.030> you<00:03:58.150> can't<00:03:58.389> get<00:03:58.509> at<00:03:58.629> the

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
impossible because you can't get at the

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.259 
impossible because you can't get at the
data<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:59.259> in<00:03:59.829> the<00:04:00.129> few<00:04:00.400> cases<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:00.909> you<00:04:01.030> can

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
data and in the few cases that you can

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.270 
data and in the few cases that you can
is<00:04:01.719> probably<00:04:02.259> 30<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:02.769> you<00:04:02.859> don't<00:04:03.040> know<00:04:03.099> what

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
is probably 30 and you don't know what

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.869 
is probably 30 and you don't know what
the<00:04:03.370> format<00:04:03.699> is

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
the format is

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.439 
the format is
so<00:04:04.329> if<00:04:04.750> they<00:04:04.930> open<00:04:05.229> up<00:04:05.319> the<00:04:05.469> data<00:04:05.680> format<00:04:06.449> it's

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
so if they open up the data format it's

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.300 
so if they open up the data format it's
gonna<00:04:07.629> make<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:08.019> easy<00:04:08.169> for<00:04:08.469> somebody<00:04:08.979> else<00:04:09.159> to

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
gonna make it easy for somebody else to

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.219 
gonna make it easy for somebody else to
come<00:04:09.340> in<00:04:09.609> and<00:04:09.759> help<00:04:09.939> them<00:04:10.060> so<00:04:10.599> anyway<00:04:10.959> that's

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:11.229 
come in and help them so anyway that's

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:14.939 
come in and help them so anyway that's
my<00:04:11.349> rant<00:04:11.650> for<00:04:11.829> today<00:04:11.889> till<00:04:12.519> next<00:04:12.699> time
