and<00:00:06.629> then<00:00:07.200> I<00:00:07.379> can<00:00:07.589> zoom<00:00:07.740> back<00:00:07.980> again<00:00:08.340> ok<00:00:10.250> so

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
and then I can zoom back again ok so

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.480 
and then I can zoom back again ok so
that<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.460> using<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.360> sensor<00:00:13.349> that's<00:00:16.490> the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
that is using the sensor that's the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.070 
that is using the sensor that's the
point<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.330> did<00:00:18.770> ok<00:00:20.539> then<00:00:21.539> if<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.840> show<00:00:22.020> you

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
point that we did ok then if I show you

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.960 
point that we did ok then if I show you
that<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.529> stills<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.220> show<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.580> micro

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
that the stills I can show you the micro

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.380 
that the stills I can show you the micro
so<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.240> i<00:00:24.390> go<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.570> camera<00:00:24.990> mode<00:00:25.760> here<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.970> choose

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
so if i go to camera mode here I choose

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.929 
so if i go to camera mode here I choose
full<00:00:28.320> resolution<00:00:28.650> now<00:00:29.189> just<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.699> show<00:00:29.730> you

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
full resolution now just to show you

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.849 
full resolution now just to show you
what<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.390> can<00:00:30.420> do<00:00:30.689> with<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.470> takes<00:00:31.679> it

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
what you can do with that that takes it

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.790 
what you can do with that that takes it
41-megapixel<00:00:32.809> listen<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.079> takes<00:00:34.110> thirty

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
41-megapixel listen it takes thirty

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.330 
41-megapixel listen it takes thirty
eight<00:00:35.010> megapixel<00:00:35.730> use<00:00:36.090> mebbekew<00:00:36.890> CC<00:00:37.890> 38

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
eight megapixel use mebbekew CC 38

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.790 
eight megapixel use mebbekew CC 38
megapixel<00:00:38.940> I've<00:00:39.149> chosen<00:00:39.629> macro<00:00:40.230> mode<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
megapixel I've chosen macro mode and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.889 
megapixel I've chosen macro mode and
then<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.670> go<00:00:41.820> here<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.149> touch<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.690> focus

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
then I can go here and touch to focus

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.639 
then I can go here and touch to focus
there<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.739> then<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.460> take<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.760> image<00:00:45.649> like

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
there and then I take the image like

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.569 
there and then I take the image like
that<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.660> then<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.899> go<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.260> gallery<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.399> now<00:00:50.550> i

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
that and then I go to gallery and now i

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.430 
that and then I go to gallery and now i
can<00:00:51.000> then<00:00:51.180> decide<00:00:51.570> what<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.809> do<00:00:51.960> with<00:00:52.289> this

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
can then decide what I do with this

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.700 
can then decide what I do with this
image<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.280> i<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.610> zoom<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.420> well<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.410> then<00:00:55.590> i

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
image so i can zoom in well and then i

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.740 
image so i can zoom in well and then i
can<00:00:55.890> zoom<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.219> some<00:00:56.399> more<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.239> didn't<00:00:57.629> see

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
can zoom in some more you didn't see

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.020 
can zoom in some more you didn't see
those<00:00:57.899> details<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.590> yeah<00:00:58.859> yeah<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.520> see

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
those details in yeah yeah you can see

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.399 
those details in yeah yeah you can see
that<00:01:00.210> there<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.370> that<00:01:02.370> that's<00:01:02.609> really

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
that there and that that's really

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.929 
that there and that that's really
because<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.739> big<00:01:05.010> Center<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:05.790> you

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
because of this big Center and then you

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.750 
because of this big Center and then you
can<00:01:06.090> share<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.680> in<00:01:07.680> facebook<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.400> with<00:01:08.580> one

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
can share it in facebook just with one

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.149 
can share it in facebook just with one
click<00:01:08.939> once<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.630> size<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.170> pretty<00:01:10.439> much<00:01:10.740> you

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
click once the size so pretty much you

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.160 
click once the size so pretty much you
took<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.540> take<00:01:12.720> full<00:01:12.960> resolution

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
took so if you take full resolution

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.550 
took so if you take full resolution
images<00:01:13.860> they<00:01:14.040> are<00:01:14.220> pretty<00:01:15.000> big<00:01:15.330> they're<00:01:15.570> about

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
images they are pretty big they're about

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.820 
images they are pretty big they're about
12<00:01:16.950> mega<00:01:17.250> size<00:01:17.490> twelve<00:01:18.479> megabyte<00:01:18.689> if<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.650> use

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
12 mega size twelve megabyte if you use

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.950 
12 mega size twelve megabyte if you use
the<00:01:19.860> PureView<00:01:20.490> mode<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.360> when<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.659> use<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the PureView mode so when you use the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.840 
the PureView mode so when you use the
full<00:01:22.140> center<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.650> create<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:23.100> smaller<00:01:23.460> image

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
full center to create a smaller image

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.410 
full center to create a smaller image
then

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
then

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.160 
then
image<00:01:26.049> size<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:27.549> best<00:01:28.090> about<00:01:28.810> three<00:01:29.110> hundred

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
image size is best about three hundred

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.219 
image size is best about three hundred
kilobytes<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:30.220> maybe<00:01:30.580> half<00:01:30.850> a<00:01:30.880> megabyte<00:01:31.299> so

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
kilobytes to maybe half a megabyte so

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.399 
kilobytes to maybe half a megabyte so
they<00:01:32.409> are<00:01:32.619> really<00:01:32.799> easy<00:01:33.070> to<00:01:33.340> use<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:34.479> share<00:01:34.720> and

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
they are really easy to use to share and

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.410 
they are really easy to use to share and
I<00:01:35.560> can<00:01:35.740> show<00:01:35.890> you<00:01:35.950> some<00:01:36.189> example<00:01:36.790> images<00:01:36.939> here

I can show you some example images here

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.460 
I can show you some example images here
from<00:01:37.689> the<00:01:37.840> gallery<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:42.700> can<00:01:42.880> get<00:01:43.470> images

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
from the gallery so you can get images

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.929 
from the gallery so you can get images
like<00:01:44.740> like<00:01:45.220> this<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.630> this<00:01:46.840> has<00:01:47.170> Carl<00:01:47.440> Zeiss

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
like like this so this has Carl Zeiss

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.170 
like like this so this has Carl Zeiss
lenses<00:01:48.939> and<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:50.229> very<00:01:50.860> wide<00:01:51.070> angle<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:51.820> you<00:01:51.939> get

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
lenses and a very wide angle and you get

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.420 
lenses and a very wide angle and you get
also<00:01:52.509> this<00:01:52.659> kind<00:01:52.689> of<00:01:53.229> background<00:01:53.530> blurring<00:01:54.100> if

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
also this kind of background blurring if

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.490 
also this kind of background blurring if
you<00:01:54.549> want<00:01:54.759> so<00:01:54.970> you<00:01:55.270> can<00:01:55.420> get<00:01:55.509> really<00:01:55.750> artistic

you want so you can get really artistic
images<00:01:57.009> this<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:58.119> bokeh<00:01:58.539> effect<00:01:59.050> here<00:01:59.580> but

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
images this the bokeh effect here but

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.190 
images this the bokeh effect here but
