want to go not where they're moving to
at<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.010> same<00:00:53.219> time<00:00:53.550> okay

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
at the same time okay

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.119 
at the same time okay
from<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.140> point<00:00:55.469> as<00:00:55.590> well<00:00:55.739> we're<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.070> to

from that point as well we're going to

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.580 
from that point as well we're going to
ask<00:00:56.370> them<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.640> force<00:00:57.000> their<00:00:57.660> weight<00:00:57.899> forward

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.590 
ask them to force their weight forward
on<00:00:58.770> their<00:00:58.980> skate<00:00:59.280> not<00:00:59.760> back<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.300> heel

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
on their skate not back in the heel

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.270 
on their skate not back in the heel
because<00:01:00.840> if<00:01:01.050> we're<00:01:01.199> using<00:01:01.350> their<00:01:01.620> heels<00:01:01.890> we're

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
because if we're using their heels we're

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.740 
because if we're using their heels we're
going<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> tendency<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.149> digging<00:01:03.600> in

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
going to have a tendency of digging in

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.710 
going to have a tendency of digging in
at<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.350> top<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.210> circle<00:01:06.210> which<00:01:06.570> will

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
at the top of the circle which will

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.300 
at the top of the circle which will
actually<00:01:06.900> end<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.320> stopping<00:01:07.710> them<00:01:08.010> throughout

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
actually end up stopping them throughout

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.820 
actually end up stopping them throughout
the<00:01:08.460> process<00:01:08.670> last<00:01:09.630> thing<00:01:09.990> they<00:01:10.619> need<00:01:10.799> to

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the process last thing they need to

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.340 
the process last thing they need to
focus<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.610> controlling<00:01:12.299> their<00:01:12.540> free<00:01:12.840> leg<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
focus on controlling their free leg and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.469 
focus on controlling their free leg and
not<00:01:13.770> letting<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.220> leg<00:01:14.460> swing<00:01:14.939> behind<00:01:15.299> them

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
not letting that leg swing behind them

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.760 
not letting that leg swing behind them
which<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.930> cause<00:01:16.140> their<00:01:16.380> hips<00:01:16.619> to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
which is going to cause their hips to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.830 
which is going to cause their hips to
turn<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.280> get<00:01:17.729> them<00:01:17.909> off<00:01:18.090> their<00:01:18.330> inside<00:01:18.659> edge

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
turn and get them off their inside edge

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.899 
turn and get them off their inside edge
ok<00:01:19.500> gang<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.189> let's<00:01:20.369> try

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
ok gang so let's try

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.210 
ok gang so let's try
nice<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.540> slow<00:01:21.810> focusing<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> inside

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
nice and slow focusing on the inside

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.910 
nice and slow focusing on the inside
edge<00:01:23.840> 360<00:01:24.840> degrees<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.380> you're<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
edge 360 degrees and you're going to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.550 
edge 360 degrees and you're going to
watch<00:01:26.250> them<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.610> maintain<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.780> position<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
watch them to maintain that position the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.520 
watch them to maintain that position the
entire<00:01:28.680> time<00:01:29.130> heads<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.850> let's<00:01:30.210> go<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.479> work

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.950 

good<00:01:37.100> maintain<00:01:37.670> that<00:01:37.910> bend<00:01:38.390> force<00:01:38.690> your

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
good maintain that bend force your

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.690 
good maintain that bend force your
weight<00:01:39.200> forward<00:01:42.100> looking<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.220> where<00:01:43.370> you<00:01:43.490> want

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
weight forward looking to where you want

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.660 
weight forward looking to where you want
to<00:01:43.760> go

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
to go

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:54.520 
to go
excellent<00:01:46.670> job<00:01:46.850> gang<00:01:52.090> okay<00:01:53.120> and<00:01:53.390> stop<00:01:53.900> now<00:01:54.200> the

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
progression is going to be here for in

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.300 
progression is going to be here for in
the<00:01:56.420> teaching<00:01:56.930> for<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.530> coaches<00:01:57.980> and<00:01:58.100> in<00:01:58.220> a

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
teaching purpose this is going to be we

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.440 
teaching purpose this is going to be we
have<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.620> learn<00:02:00.950> how<00:02:01.670> we<00:02:01.730> can<00:02:02.120> move<00:02:02.270> around

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
have to learn how we can move around

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.720 
have to learn how we can move around
whether<00:02:02.900> our<00:02:03.110> edges<00:02:03.470> on<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.620> hard<00:02:04.100> inside<00:02:04.520> edge

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
whether our edges on a hard inside edge

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.450 
whether our edges on a hard inside edge
or<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:05.000> soft<00:02:05.450> inside<00:02:05.960> edge<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:06.710> this<00:02:07.100> time<00:02:07.310> I'm

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
or a soft inside edge so this time I'm

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.430 
or a soft inside edge so this time I'm
going<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.670> ask<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.000> players<00:02:08.270> to<00:02:08.479> go<00:02:08.630> left<00:02:09.200> and

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
going to ask the players to go left and
