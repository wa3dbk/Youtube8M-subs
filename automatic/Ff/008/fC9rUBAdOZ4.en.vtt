here<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:08.980> cut<00:02:09.340> some<00:02:09.910> traits<00:02:10.240> into<00:02:10.540> this<00:02:11.080> boar

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
here I cut some traits into this boar

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.850 
here I cut some traits into this boar
and<00:02:12.180> then<00:02:13.180> later<00:02:13.450> I'll<00:02:14.230> put<00:02:14.710> this<00:02:16.440> plate<00:02:17.440> right

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
will be a finish so I must make more

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.470 
will be a finish so I must make more
