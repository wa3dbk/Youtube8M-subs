00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
Mojo hockey stick and this can be one of

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.150 
Mojo hockey stick and this can be one of
the<00:00:10.929> new<00:00:11.050> additions<00:00:11.410> to<00:00:11.500> the<00:00:11.679> warrior<00:00:11.950> line

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 
the new additions to the warrior line

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.549 
the new additions to the warrior line
and<00:00:12.400> they're<00:00:12.820> using<00:00:13.209> a<00:00:13.660> new<00:00:14.080> kind<00:00:14.530> of

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
and they're using a new kind of

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:15.720 
and they're using a new kind of
construction<00:00:15.099> of<00:00:15.190> the<00:00:15.249> stick<00:00:15.490> but<00:00:15.639> they're

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
construction of the stick but they're

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.910 
construction of the stick but they're
calling<00:00:15.969> the<00:00:16.059> AXI<00:00:16.539> system<00:00:16.930> basically<00:00:17.800> what

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
calling the AXI system basically what

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.710 
calling the AXI system basically what
this<00:00:18.039> does<00:00:18.250> is<00:00:18.430> it<00:00:18.550> has<00:00:18.760> a<00:00:18.820> differentiated

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
this does is it has a differentiated

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.960 
this does is it has a differentiated
sidewalls<00:00:20.260> for<00:00:20.620> right<00:00:21.190> and<00:00:21.400> left-handed

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
sidewalls for right and left-handed

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.600 
sidewalls for right and left-handed
sticks<00:00:22.270> what<00:00:23.140> that's<00:00:23.290> going<00:00:23.410> to<00:00:23.500> do<00:00:23.710> is<00:00:23.890> they

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
sticks what that's going to do is they

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.370 
sticks what that's going to do is they
basically<00:00:24.760> add<00:00:25.330> it<00:00:25.540> a<00:00:25.600> little<00:00:25.780> bit<00:00:25.930> stiffer<00:00:26.200> on

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
basically add it a little bit stiffer on

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.080 
basically add it a little bit stiffer on
one<00:00:26.620> side<00:00:26.860> than<00:00:27.160> the<00:00:27.250> other<00:00:27.280> so<00:00:27.880> when<00:00:28.000> you're

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
one side than the other so when you're

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.160 
one side than the other so when you're
going<00:00:28.240> and<00:00:28.420> taking<00:00:28.630> your<00:00:28.690> shots<00:00:28.930> you're<00:00:29.050> going

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
going and taking your shots you're going

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.860 
going and taking your shots you're going
to<00:00:29.230> get<00:00:29.350> more<00:00:29.500> pop<00:00:29.770> off<00:00:30.100> your<00:00:30.480> regular<00:00:31.480> side<00:00:31.720> if

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:31.870 
to get more pop off your regular side if

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.180 
to get more pop off your regular side if
you're<00:00:32.020> taking<00:00:32.349> like<00:00:32.469> a<00:00:32.500> wrist<00:00:32.770> shot<00:00:32.890> slap

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
you're taking like a wrist shot slap

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.799 
you're taking like a wrist shot slap
shot<00:00:33.460> and<00:00:33.700> then<00:00:34.000> on<00:00:34.090> the<00:00:34.180> back<00:00:34.329> hands<00:00:34.570> gonna<00:00:34.750> be

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
shot and then on the back hands gonna be

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.930 
shot and then on the back hands gonna be
a<00:00:34.840> little<00:00:34.989> bit<00:00:35.140> softer<00:00:35.649> so<00:00:36.460> basically<00:00:36.760> how

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
a little bit softer so basically how

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.489 
a little bit softer so basically how
they<00:00:37.089> did<00:00:37.239> that<00:00:37.359> is<00:00:37.539> like<00:00:37.660> I<00:00:37.780> said<00:00:37.839> they<00:00:38.079> added

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:38.499 
they did that is like I said they added

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:40.439 
they did that is like I said they added
materials<00:00:38.980> on<00:00:39.160> each<00:00:39.370> side<00:00:39.670> to<00:00:39.850> make<00:00:39.879> it<00:00:40.030> more

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
materials on each side to make it more

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.360 
materials on each side to make it more
specific<00:00:41.140> to<00:00:41.710> right-handed<00:00:42.249> or<00:00:42.339> left-handed

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
specific to right-handed or left-handed

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.149 
specific to right-handed or left-handed
player<00:00:42.879> also<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.870> sticks<00:00:44.109> gonna<00:00:44.350> have<00:00:44.589> what

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
player also the sticks gonna have what

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.160 
player also the sticks gonna have what
they're<00:00:45.309> calling<00:00:45.579> the<00:00:45.879> slick<00:00:46.480> grip<00:00:46.899> material

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
they're calling the slick grip material

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.590 
they're calling the slick grip material
so<00:00:48.010> basically<00:00:48.309> has<00:00:48.489> like<00:00:48.699> that<00:00:48.909> similar<00:00:49.329> grip

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
so basically has like that similar grip

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.020 
so basically has like that similar grip
coating<00:00:49.989> but<00:00:50.350> it's<00:00:50.499> as<00:00:50.620> if<00:00:50.769> they<00:00:50.920> applied<00:00:51.550> the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
coating but it's as if they applied the

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.700 
coating but it's as if they applied the
nipple<00:00:52.359> grip<00:00:52.539> on<00:00:52.719> just<00:00:52.960> two<00:00:53.199> sides<00:00:53.469> of<00:00:53.620> the

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
nipple grip on just two sides of the

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.110 
nipple grip on just two sides of the
stick<00:00:53.920> so<00:00:54.309> you're<00:00:54.460> actually<00:00:54.550> gonna<00:00:54.760> have<00:00:54.969> it

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
stick so you're actually gonna have it

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.880 
stick so you're actually gonna have it
on<00:00:55.269> your<00:00:55.390> back<00:00:55.629> hand<00:00:55.929> of<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.140> blade<00:00:56.350> I<00:00:56.559> mean

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
on your back hand of the blade I mean

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.840 
on your back hand of the blade I mean
you're<00:00:56.979> also<00:00:57.100> gonna<00:00:57.280> have<00:00:57.399> it<00:00:57.489> on<00:00:57.550> the<00:00:57.670> bottom

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
you're also gonna have it on the bottom

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.700 
you're also gonna have it on the bottom
so<00:00:58.510> when<00:00:58.629> you're<00:00:58.749> playing<00:00:58.989> since<00:00:59.530> there's<00:00:59.679> a

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
so when you're playing since there's a

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.709 
so when you're playing since there's a
left-handed<00:01:00.129> stick<00:01:00.429> you'd<00:01:00.819> have<00:01:01.030> your<00:01:01.359> palm

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
left-handed stick you'd have your palm

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.360 
left-handed stick you'd have your palm
facing<00:01:02.139> then<00:01:02.530> grip<00:01:02.710> material<00:01:03.100> to<00:01:03.190> give<00:01:03.309> you

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
facing then grip material to give you

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.770 
facing then grip material to give you
just<00:01:03.519> a<00:01:03.579> little<00:01:03.609> bit<00:01:03.940> more<00:01:04.150> control<00:01:04.600> out<00:01:04.750> of

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
just a little bit more control out of

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.630 
just a little bit more control out of
the<00:01:04.930> stick<00:01:05.170> as<00:01:05.740> we<00:01:05.920> go<00:01:06.040> ahead<00:01:06.250> and<00:01:06.340> move<00:01:06.430> down

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
the stick as we go ahead and move down

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.980 
the stick as we go ahead and move down
this<00:01:06.880> is<00:01:06.970> going<00:01:07.090> to<00:01:07.150> be<00:01:07.210> using<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.780> carbon

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
this is going to be using the carbon

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.200 
this is going to be using the carbon
deluxe<00:01:08.409> material<00:01:08.860> so<00:01:08.950> a<00:01:09.009> nice<00:01:09.130> solid<00:01:09.610> level<00:01:09.850> of

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
deluxe material so a nice solid level of

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.749 
deluxe material so a nice solid level of
carbon<00:01:10.630> on<00:01:10.750> this<00:01:10.869> stick<00:01:11.110> and<00:01:11.320> as<00:01:12.219> we<00:01:12.399> move<00:01:12.579> down

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
carbon on this stick and as we move down

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.580 
carbon on this stick and as we move down
into<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.149> blade<00:01:13.509> you<00:01:14.049> can<00:01:14.200> really<00:01:14.409> see<00:01:14.560> that

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
into the blade you can really see that

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.160 
into the blade you can really see that
they're<00:01:14.860> using<00:01:14.890> that<00:01:15.250> different<00:01:15.990> weaves<00:01:16.990> on

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
they're using that different weaves on

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.899 
they're using that different weaves on
the<00:01:17.229> material<00:01:17.590> so<00:01:18.159> you<00:01:18.250> have<00:01:18.430> a<00:01:18.460> little<00:01:18.729> bit<00:01:18.850> of

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
the material so you have a little bit of

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.609 
the material so you have a little bit of
a<00:01:18.969> different<00:01:19.360> checkered<00:01:20.110> material<00:01:20.469> that<00:01:20.560> you

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
a different checkered material that you

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.260 
a different checkered material that you
saw<00:01:20.770> on<00:01:21.100> some<00:01:21.310> of<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.460> previous<00:01:21.789> ones<00:01:22.000> and

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
saw on some of the previous ones and

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.719 
saw on some of the previous ones and
this<00:01:22.630> is<00:01:22.780> also<00:01:22.899> a<00:01:23.020> soft<00:01:23.350> core<00:01:23.619> blade<00:01:23.920> so<00:01:24.640> it's

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
this is also a soft core blade so it's

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.249 
this is also a soft core blade so it's
going<00:01:24.820> to<00:01:24.880> have<00:01:25.060> some<00:01:25.360> vibration<00:01:25.899> dampening

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
going to have some vibration dampening

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:27.870 
going to have some vibration dampening
properties<00:01:26.320> to<00:01:26.890> it<00:01:27.009> have<00:01:27.159> a<00:01:27.189> nice<00:01:27.310> puck<00:01:27.610> feel

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
properties to it have a nice puck feel

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.029 
properties to it have a nice puck feel
and<00:01:28.149> then<00:01:28.630> going<00:01:28.869> ahead<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.320> seeing<00:01:29.710> the

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
and then going ahead and seeing the

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.170 
and then going ahead and seeing the
backside<00:01:30.490> you<00:01:30.520> can<00:01:30.640> see<00:01:30.850> that<00:01:31.000> has<00:01:31.149> a

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
backside you can see that has a

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.510 
backside you can see that has a
different<00:01:31.659> weave<00:01:32.170> it<00:01:32.530> actually<00:01:33.009> follows<00:01:33.340> up

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
different weave it actually follows up

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.490 
different weave it actually follows up
into<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.030> shaft<00:01:34.299> and<00:01:34.659> this<00:01:35.049> is<00:01:35.200> going<00:01:35.289> to<00:01:35.380> be

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
into the shaft and this is going to be

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.410 
into the shaft and this is going to be
what<00:01:35.649> they're<00:01:35.740> calling<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:36.700> X<00:01:36.880> weave<00:01:37.210> design

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
what they're calling the X weave design

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.050 
what they're calling the X weave design
this<00:01:38.229> is<00:01:38.409> going<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.619> go<00:01:38.890> right<00:01:39.130> into<00:01:39.399> mesh<00:01:39.820> well

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
this is going to go right into mesh well

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.260 
this is going to go right into mesh well
with<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.420> AXI<00:01:40.899> design<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:42.369> basically<00:01:42.909> what

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
with the AXI design and basically what

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.310 
with the AXI design and basically what
that's<00:01:43.390> going<00:01:43.570> to<00:01:43.659> do<00:01:43.750> is<00:01:43.869> like<00:01:43.990> I<00:01:44.079> said<00:01:44.109> it's

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
that's going to do is like I said it's

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.929 
that's going to do is like I said it's
going<00:01:44.409> to<00:01:44.469> add<00:01:44.619> stiffness<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.490> blade<00:01:45.789> so

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
going to add stiffness to the blade so

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.310 
going to add stiffness to the blade so
it's<00:01:46.060> not<00:01:46.149> gonna<00:01:46.329> want<00:01:46.509> to<00:01:46.539> open<00:01:46.600> up<00:01:46.960> as<00:01:47.109> much

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
it's not gonna want to open up as much

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.630 
it's not gonna want to open up as much
and<00:01:47.530> then<00:01:47.829> it's<00:01:47.979> also<00:01:48.100> going<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.460> have<00:01:48.609> a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
and then it's also going to have a

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.819 
and then it's also going to have a
little<00:01:49.030> bit<00:01:49.119> more<00:01:49.270> of<00:01:49.329> a<00:01:49.390> snappy<00:01:49.840> feel<00:01:50.079> going

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
little bit more of a snappy feel going

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.160 
little bit more of a snappy feel going
on<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.250> overall<00:01:51.460> feel<00:01:51.820> this<00:01:52.030> stick<00:01:52.329> it<00:01:53.020> has

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
on to the overall feel this stick it has

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.810 
on to the overall feel this stick it has
a<00:01:53.200> nice<00:01:53.439> overall<00:01:54.039> feel<00:01:54.340> it's<00:01:54.520> not<00:01:54.609> gonna<00:01:54.729> be

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
a nice overall feel it's not gonna be

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.099 
a nice overall feel it's not gonna be
the<00:01:54.880> lightest<00:01:55.179> stick<00:01:55.359> on<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.570> market<00:01:55.929> but

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
the lightest stick on the market but

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:57.359 
the lightest stick on the market but
it's<00:01:56.229> certainly<00:01:56.560> not<00:01:56.770> going<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.039> be<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.159> really

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
it's certainly not going to be a really

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.679 
it's certainly not going to be a really
heavy<00:01:57.609> stick<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:57.939> little<00:01:58.149> bit<00:01:58.329> lighter<00:01:58.570> than

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
heavy stick a little bit lighter than

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.870 
heavy stick a little bit lighter than
what<00:01:58.869> you<00:01:59.020> saw<00:01:59.229> on<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.740> Vandal<00:02:00.189> and<00:02:00.340> a<00:02:00.640> little

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
what you saw on the Vandal and a little

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.060 
what you saw on the Vandal and a little
bit<00:02:00.969> more<00:02:01.090> balanced<00:02:01.479> fuel<00:02:01.749> as<00:02:01.840> well<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.920> it's

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
bit more balanced fuel as well so it's

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.739 
bit more balanced fuel as well so it's
been<00:02:03.189> just<00:02:03.219> a<00:02:03.460> quick<00:02:03.700> look<00:02:03.969> at<00:02:04.179> the<00:02:04.450> warrior

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
been just a quick look at the warrior

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.899 
been just a quick look at the warrior
