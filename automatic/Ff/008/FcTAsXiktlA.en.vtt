weather simulation here so not only do
you<00:01:28.469> have<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> deciduous<00:01:29.579> trees<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.090> lose

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
you have the deciduous trees that lose

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.370 
you have the deciduous trees that lose
their<00:01:30.270> leaves<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.229> these

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
their leaves but you have these

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590 
their leaves but you have these
evergreens<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:32.130> well<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.479> be

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
evergreens as well so it's going to be

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.270 
evergreens as well so it's going to be
very<00:01:33.630> realistic<00:01:34.530> when<00:01:34.679> you<00:01:34.770> actually<00:01:34.920> play

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
very realistic when you actually play

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.940 
very realistic when you actually play
through<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.609> game<00:01:36.229> now<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.259> want<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.710> introduce
