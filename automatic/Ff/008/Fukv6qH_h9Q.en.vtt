so<00:02:28.700> what<00:02:28.940> is<00:02:28.970> this<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:29.510> what<00:02:29.600> does<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:29.750> do<00:02:30.050> um

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
so what is this and what does it do um

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.170 
so what is this and what does it do um
it's<00:02:30.710> pretty<00:02:31.040> standard<00:02:31.370> protective<00:02:32.000> gear<00:02:32.150> for

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
longboarding it's a leather glove so you

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.730
