00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
SSD running at tip top speed and it

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.150 
SSD running at tip top speed and it
really<00:00:36.690> will<00:00:36.930> keep<00:00:37.260> your<00:00:37.380> SSD<00:00:37.590> running<00:00:37.950> for<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
year or two longer than it that it

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.959 
year or two longer than it that it
normally<00:00:40.350> would<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.890> been<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.820> is

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
normally would have been and this is

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.779 
normally would have been and this is
very<00:00:42.270> important<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.500> any<00:00:44.190> system<00:00:44.489> mac

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
very important to do on any system mac

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.110 
very important to do on any system mac
or<00:00:45.000> pc<00:00:45.030> SSD<00:00:45.930> needs<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.680> trim<00:00:46.980> enabled<00:00:47.489> so

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
or pc SSD needs to have trim enabled so

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.180 
or pc SSD needs to have trim enabled so
today<00:00:48.510> we'll<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:48.899> doing<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.230> windows<00:00:49.649> 8<00:00:49.890> and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
today we'll be doing it on windows 8 and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
custom thing that I did to my computer

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.119 
custom thing that I did to my computer
when<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.780> obviously<00:01:01.350> does<00:01:01.500> not<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.890> that
