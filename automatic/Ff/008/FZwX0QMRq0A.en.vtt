00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
looseness and I'm gonna have to take it

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:10.969 
looseness and I'm gonna have to take it
up<00:02:10.050> quite<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> bit<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.530> get<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.709> down<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.890> the

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
it down so that you can actually kind of

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.900 
it down so that you can actually kind of
flip<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.680> on<00:03:39.770> and<00:03:39.800> off<00:03:41.230> that's<00:03:42.230> around<00:03:42.680> one

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.550 

kinda<00:03:47.510> like<00:03:47.600> your<00:03:47.690> Benny<00:03:47.930> behind<00:03:48.260> another

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
kinda like your Benny behind another

zone

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:41.040 

Oh

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:49.959 

now<00:04:42.050> another<00:04:42.380> thing<00:04:42.500> is<00:04:42.680> called<00:04:43.039> is<00:04:43.190> it

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:49.969 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:52.479 

to<00:04:50.539> get<00:04:50.689> a<00:04:50.719> harmonica<00:04:51.289> to<00:04:52.009> the<00:04:52.099> harmonicas

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:52.489 
to get a harmonica to the harmonicas

00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:54.180 
to get a harmonica to the harmonicas
here

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
here

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.410 
here
because<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.400> string<00:04:55.700> is<00:04:55.730> actually<00:04:55.910> fretted

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
because the string is actually fretted

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.960 
because the string is actually fretted
at<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:56.600> first<00:04:56.810> fret<00:04:57.010> okay<00:04:58.010> so<00:04:58.550> anyway<00:04:58.820> that's

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
at the first fret okay so anyway that's

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.970 
at the first fret okay so anyway that's
another<00:04:59.330> cool<00:04:59.600> one<00:04:59.780> I'm<00:05:00.380> gonna<00:05:00.530> show<00:05:00.710> you<00:05:00.800> some

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
another cool one I'm gonna show you some

another cool one I'm gonna show you some
more<00:05:01.130> I'm<00:05:01.310> going<00:05:01.460> to<00:05:01.520> do<00:05:01.610> some<00:05:01.760> different<00:05:02.030> ones

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
more I'm going to do some different ones

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.960 
more I'm going to do some different ones
and<00:05:02.890> just<00:05:03.890> kind<00:05:04.220> of<00:05:04.250> give<00:05:04.400> you<00:05:04.460> some<00:05:04.550> ideas

and just kind of give you some ideas

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.950 
and just kind of give you some ideas
basically<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:07.490> idea<00:05:07.820> is<00:05:07.910> to<00:05:08.210> not<00:05:08.660> have<00:05:08.690> an

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
basically the idea is to not have an

basically the idea is to not have an
idea

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
idea

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.960

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
the idea is just to kind of throw it on

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.610 
the idea is just to kind of throw it on
