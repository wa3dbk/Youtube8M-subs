00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.220

 malaysia thailand singapore and ends up playing on jakarta to present 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.820
 a little earlier the liking of indonesia the project this one that took place 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.210
 in us we were 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.700
 to 40 days in indonesia 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.420
 as second coach that jorge ameal 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.280
 Respect selecting players in four cities we were in Jakarta 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.280

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.930
 We made a final selection in Jakarta or 25 players emerged 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.650
 are these guys who are training here in Uruguay 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.260
 and there were 25 more players in Indonesia who are going to play a tournament in 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.320
 april stelling training do to whom 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.510
 the facilities of the olive trees are housed calculated stored all the 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.040
 comforts and it's amazing how easily we have no lack 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.360
 absolutely nothing we are very motivated we know it is a difficult task 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.659
 that it is not easy to reverse a football that is practically not achieved anything 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.160
 important 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.370
 but here is a process you have to take it easy and they will do 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.270
 four years of work and there you will see the final results not but we are very 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.650
 optimistic in achieving very good results 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.600
 in indonesia he found great fanaticism for football 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.250
 they have a beautiful stadium scene and even cry 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.530
 serve this letter for 120 thousand people 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.819
 To regain a great fan they love football than in the professional league 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.970
 I think that one of the bases of having brought this project that Uruguay was 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.220
 the minutes 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.850
 the rich history the impressive history that Uruguay has in terms of 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.679
 titles achieved 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:16.599
 it was difficult for them to understand how a country with three million inhabitants p 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.389
 got the titles 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:25.180
 it is very difficult to think about them when they have 220 million 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:28.459
 inhabitants as a country but good to repeat with 3 million managed the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.069
 World titles South American titles make 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.459
 many conflicts at the youth level 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.959
 I am struck by the number of players that are exported annually 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.920
 here is places had a comparative table that last year was 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.920
 they exported almost the same players as Argentina 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.730
 the abuse the law 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.209
 Pablo 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.579
 rangel project heart truth take care of everyone 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.269
 as I was saying today we are very optimistic
