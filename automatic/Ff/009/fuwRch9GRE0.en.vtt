cem<00:02:13.239> so<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:14.070> make<00:02:15.070> a<00:02:15.100> couple<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.670> changes<00:02:16.000> here

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
cem so I make a couple of changes here

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.630 
cem so I make a couple of changes here
based<00:02:16.450> on<00:02:16.720> suggestions<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.800> people<00:02:18.130> made<00:02:18.340> in

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
based on suggestions that people made in

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.210 
based on suggestions that people made in
the<00:02:18.790> comments<00:02:19.269> so<00:02:19.630> drop<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.170> new<00:02:20.410> CD<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.860> moon

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
the comments so drop the new CD a moon

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.880 
the comments so drop the new CD a moon
and<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:25.200> think<00:02:26.200> probably<00:02:28.410> Keynes<00:02:29.410> gonna<00:02:29.739> have

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
and I think probably Keynes gonna have

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.819 
and I think probably Keynes gonna have
to<00:02:30.040> go<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:33.510> mean<00:02:34.510> I'm<00:02:34.810> not<00:02:34.989> really<00:02:35.049> feeling<00:02:35.620> that

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
to go I mean I'm not really feeling that

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.920 
to go I mean I'm not really feeling that
we're<00:02:36.130> work<00:02:36.340> with<00:02:36.760> pace<00:02:37.000> abusing<00:02:37.480> enough<00:02:37.750> at

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
we're work with pace abusing enough at

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.360 
we're work with pace abusing enough at
the<00:02:38.019> moment<00:02:38.049> with<00:02:38.380> this<00:02:38.500> squad<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.250> is

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
the moment with this squad so this is

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.150 
the moment with this squad so this is
where<00:02:39.519> Leandro<00:02:40.260> little<00:02:41.260> Robin<00:02:41.560> nicely<00:02:41.980> and

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
where Leandro little Robin nicely and

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.210 
where Leandro little Robin nicely and
then<00:02:42.459> Nevers<00:02:43.180> can<00:02:43.510> go<00:02:43.690> in<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.680> cam<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.610> this

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
then Nevers can go in and cam and this

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.780 
then Nevers can go in and cam and this
yeah<00:02:48.220> so<00:02:48.790> it's<00:02:49.390> i<00:02:49.690> mean<00:02:49.750> that's<00:02:50.640> 233<00:02:51.640> they're

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
yeah so it's i mean that's 233 they're

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.850 
yeah so it's i mean that's 233 they're
fairly<00:02:52.239> good<00:02:52.690> upgrades<00:02:53.170> on<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.560> players<00:02:53.799> that

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
fairly good upgrades on the players that

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.490 
fairly good upgrades on the players that
were<00:02:54.010> there<00:02:54.130> before<00:02:54.160> that's<00:02:54.760> not<00:02:54.910> easy<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:56.350> i

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
were there before that's not easy and i

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.410 
were there before that's not easy and i
think<00:02:56.829> anything<00:02:57.220> he<00:02:57.340> did<00:02:57.519> put<00:02:57.760> perishing<00:02:58.269> in

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
think anything he did put perishing in

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.979 
think anything he did put perishing in
at<00:02:58.980> left<00:02:59.980> mid<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:00.610> I'm<00:03:01.150> right<00:03:01.360> minute<00:03:01.690> left<00:03:01.840> in

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
at left mid so I'm right minute left in

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.990 
at left mid so I'm right minute left in
at<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.200> moment<00:03:02.350> yeah<00:03:03.130> that's<00:03:03.489> definitely<00:03:03.730> a

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
at the moment yeah that's definitely a

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.039 
at the moment yeah that's definitely a
worthy<00:03:04.239> upgrade<00:03:05.070> left<00:03:06.070> smeared<00:03:06.310> host<00:03:07.049> over

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
worthy upgrade left smeared host over

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.190 
worthy upgrade left smeared host over
there<00:03:08.260> so<00:03:08.890> that's<00:03:09.570> pretty<00:03:10.570> much<00:03:10.810> I<00:03:11.170> think

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
there so that's pretty much I think

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.440 
there so that's pretty much I think
that's<00:03:12.010> as<00:03:12.220> good<00:03:12.400> as<00:03:12.549> I<00:03:12.640> could<00:03:12.730> get<00:03:13.030> in<00:03:13.239> terms

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
that's as good as I could get in terms

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.690 
that's as good as I could get in terms
of<00:03:13.540> Kim<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:14.049> think<00:03:14.860> that's<00:03:14.980> not<00:03:15.130> bad<00:03:15.310> right<00:03:15.489> so

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
of Kim I think that's not bad right so

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.460 
of Kim I think that's not bad right so
we're<00:03:15.820> on<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:16.030> our<00:03:16.150> paid<00:03:16.600> packs<00:03:16.930> now<00:03:17.110> Tom<00:03:17.320> as<00:03:17.440> a

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
we're on to our paid packs now Tom as a

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.490 
we're on to our paid packs now Tom as a

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
as a control test yes we're kind of

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.190 
as a control test yes we're kind of
seeing<00:03:21.220> if<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:22.090> paid<00:03:22.299> stuff<00:03:22.600> yields<00:03:23.079> better

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
seeing if the paid stuff yields better

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.699 
seeing if the paid stuff yields better
results<00:03:23.769> than<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.190> yes<00:03:25.109> okay<00:03:26.109> well<00:03:26.500> we<00:03:26.590> did

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
results than the yes okay well we did

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.199 
results than the yes okay well we did
okay<00:03:26.950> them<00:03:27.100> in<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.220> free<00:03:27.370> back<00:03:27.579> so<00:03:27.820> this<00:03:28.060> love

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.530 

overly<00:03:34.260> impressive<00:03:34.620> but<00:03:35.330> certainly<00:03:36.330> not

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
overly impressive but certainly not

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.479 
overly impressive but certainly not
compatible<00:03:37.080> is<00:03:37.319> a<00:03:37.380> keeper<00:03:37.709> so<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.310> means

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
compatible is a keeper so that means

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.160 
compatible is a keeper so that means

upgrading it let's get a next-gen in the
house<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:01.080> we<00:05:01.229> can<00:05:01.260> we<00:05:01.620> can<00:05:01.800> start<00:05:02.340> playing

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
house and we can we can start playing

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.980 
house and we can we can start playing
that<00:05:02.820> and<00:05:02.940> then<00:05:03.030> I<00:05:03.120> can<00:05:03.240> start<00:05:03.330> using<00:05:03.570> it<00:05:03.810> for

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
that and then I can start using it for

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.440 
that and then I can start using it for
some<00:05:04.110> games<00:05:04.350> and<00:05:05.030> this<00:05:06.030> feels<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.360> bit

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
some games and this feels a bit

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.120 
some games and this feels a bit
pointless<00:05:06.690> taking<00:05:07.320> it<00:05:07.440> on<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.860> current

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
pointless taking it on to the current

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.770 
pointless taking it on to the current
gen<00:05:08.340> stuff<00:05:08.610> and<00:05:08.910> playing<00:05:09.240> with<00:05:09.389> that<00:05:09.539> when<00:05:09.750> I

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
gen stuff and playing with that when I

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.629 
gen stuff and playing with that when I
know<00:05:10.289> that<00:05:10.500> I'm<00:05:10.620> going<00:05:10.800> to<00:05:10.860> have<00:05:11.010> an<00:05:11.100> xbox<00:05:11.280> one

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
know that I'm going to have an xbox one

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.930 
know that I'm going to have an xbox one
in<00:05:11.789> a<00:05:11.850> couple<00:05:12.090> of<00:05:12.120> weeks<00:05:12.180> so<00:05:13.789> think<00:05:14.789> that<00:05:14.910> I

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
in a couple of weeks so think that I

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.760 
in a couple of weeks so think that I
learned<00:05:15.180> to<00:05:15.300> change<00:05:15.570> exactly<00:05:16.380> that<00:05:16.620> all

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
learned to change exactly that all

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.350 
learned to change exactly that all
migrated<00:05:17.160> over<00:05:17.280> almost<00:05:17.610> not<00:05:17.940> getting<00:05:18.210> some

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
migrated over almost not getting some

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.820 
migrated over almost not getting some
foods<00:05:18.690> and<00:05:18.960> game<00:05:19.080> footage<00:05:19.380> in<00:05:19.530> here<00:05:19.680> as<00:05:19.800> well

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
foods and game footage in here as well

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.320 
foods and game footage in here as well
so<00:05:21.169> excellent<00:05:22.169> sometimes<00:05:23.100> ahead<00:05:23.400> very<00:05:24.120> much

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
so excellent sometimes ahead very much

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.090 
so excellent sometimes ahead very much
so<00:05:24.389> I<00:05:24.780> think<00:05:25.110> that<00:05:25.200> that<00:05:25.229> concludes<00:05:25.860> it<00:05:25.979> for

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
so I think that that concludes it for

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.010 
so I think that that concludes it for
the<00:05:26.160> free<00:05:26.250> pack<00:05:26.520> project<00:05:27.090> episode<00:05:27.180> 4<00:05:27.690> will<00:05:27.990> be

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
the free pack project episode 4 will be

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.900 
the free pack project episode 4 will be
