 2.9 s 80 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.250
 the time band that the time band 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:20.060
 we are seeing what 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.690
 here is a point 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.730
 good 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:29.070
 at this point if you look closely 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.030
 truth has to 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.880
 it has to be with this 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.940
 there it must be 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.690
 there you can see 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.800
 he needs a little bit where is this 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.530
 time here 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.670
 if we look well 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.670
 here is the other 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.190
 it's all very well because it's a bit 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.820
 complicated but 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.030
 we look good 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.740
 let's look at something exactly that 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.600
 we're 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.409
 the time with this 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.100
 you can not appreciate 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.100
 so 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.630
 and this is 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.650
 active 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.250
 the other point is seeing that there is 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.609
 point at the camera and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.670
 we are seeing that there is the other 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:46.020
 point 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.890
 and we look closely 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.310
 that is the line 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.240
 there is the brand that is 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:01.039
 it's there where I'm pointing a 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.280
 camera there is the point now the other 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.570
 there is more for there 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.570
 there you can appreciate 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.810
 there where is the brillito where it shines 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.810
 there is 10 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.210
 and they are fixed 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.870
 he needs a little more for outside 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.410
 because here is also making me 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.410
 lack 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:34.810
 a little down will accommodate 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.460
 and there you can see you can see clearly 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:43.140
 the time 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.140
 for a powder 2000 2.9 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.410
