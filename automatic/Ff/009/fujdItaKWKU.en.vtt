will appear within apps and while at

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.370 
will appear within apps and while at
your<00:01:46.590> watch<00:01:46.920> face<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.479> see<00:01:48.720> at<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.170> top

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
your watch face so you see at the top

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.090 
your watch face so you see at the top
there<00:01:49.680> there<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.909> airplane<00:01:51.509> mode<00:01:51.780> icon

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
there there is the airplane mode icon

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.889 
there there is the airplane mode icon
just<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.369> that

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
just like that

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.840 
just like that
so<00:01:54.899> there's<00:01:55.380> another<00:01:55.950> icon<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.430> want<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.700> show

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
so there's another icon I want to show

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.950 
so there's another icon I want to show
you

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
you

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.070 
you
and<00:01:58.620> it's<00:01:59.100> probably<00:01:59.520> one<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.240> don't

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
and it's probably one that you don't

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.710 
and it's probably one that you don't
want<00:02:01.260> to<00:02:01.530> see<00:02:01.800> that<00:02:02.040> often<00:02:02.250> that's<00:02:02.910> the

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
want to see that often that's the

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.470 
want to see that often that's the
disconnect<00:02:04.340> icon<00:02:05.340> indicating<00:02:05.940> that<00:02:06.090> there<00:02:06.360> is

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
disconnect icon indicating that there is

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.480 
disconnect icon indicating that there is
a<00:02:06.510> disconnection<00:02:07.290> between<00:02:07.440> your<00:02:08.009> Apple<00:02:08.460> watch

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
a disconnection between your Apple watch

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.940 
a disconnection between your Apple watch
and<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.030> iPhone<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.320> supposed<00:02:10.710> to<00:02:10.830> be

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
and the iPhone that it's supposed to be

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.280 
and the iPhone that it's supposed to be
paired<00:02:11.280> with<00:02:11.450> so<00:02:12.450> what<00:02:12.810> I'm<00:02:12.900> going<00:02:12.990> to<00:02:13.050> do<00:02:13.170> is

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
paired with so what I'm going to do is

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.800 
paired with so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:13.380> going<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.530> place<00:02:13.710> my<00:02:13.740> iPhone<00:02:14.400> into

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
I'm going to place my iPhone into

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.090 
I'm going to place my iPhone into
airplane<00:02:15.810> mode<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.770> will<00:02:16.920> obviously

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
airplane mode and that will obviously

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.010 
airplane mode and that will obviously
shut<00:02:17.850> down<00:02:18.000> all<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.440> all<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.650> radios<00:02:20.040> and

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
shut down all the all that radios and

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.140 
shut down all the all that radios and
eventually<00:02:22.020> it's<00:02:22.650> going<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.890> timeout<00:02:23.160> its

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
eventually it's going to timeout its

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.640 
eventually it's going to timeout its
connection<00:02:24.690> with<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:24.990> Apple<00:02:25.260> watch<00:02:25.290> and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
connection with the Apple watch and

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.350 
connection with the Apple watch and
you're<00:02:25.770> going<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.950> see<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.310> happen<00:02:26.790> right<00:02:27.120> in

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
you're going to see that happen right in

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.510 
you're going to see that happen right in
the<00:02:28.080> status<00:02:28.410> area<00:02:29.690> give<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.900> second<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.740> you

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
the status area give it a second and you

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.090 
the status area give it a second and you
should<00:02:33.060> see<00:02:33.300> there<00:02:33.720> we<00:02:34.110> go<00:02:34.260> there<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.830> the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
should see there we go there is the

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.920 
should see there we go there is the
disconnect<00:02:35.690> indicator<00:02:36.690> just<00:02:37.820> like<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:39.090> so

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
disconnect indicator just like that so

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.750 
disconnect indicator just like that so
obviously<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.500> way<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.010> watch<00:02:41.250> handle

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
obviously the way that the watch handle

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.330 
obviously the way that the watch handle
status<00:02:42.300> indicators<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.290> different<00:02:43.830> than<00:02:43.950> iOS

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
status indicators is different than iOS

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.949 
status indicators is different than iOS
so<00:02:44.520> it's<00:02:44.670> good<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:44.940> become<00:02:45.270> familiar<00:02:45.570> with

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
so it's good to become familiar with

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.230 
so it's good to become familiar with
some<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.980> status<00:02:47.310> indicators<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:47.940> you

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
some of the status indicators that you

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.080 
some of the status indicators that you
may<00:02:48.360> see<00:02:48.420> while<00:02:49.230> using<00:02:49.620> your<00:02:49.740> Apple<00:02:49.920> watch<00:02:50.100> let

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
may see while using your Apple watch let

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.190 
may see while using your Apple watch let
