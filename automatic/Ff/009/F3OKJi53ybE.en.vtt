we've<00:01:02.489> always<00:01:02.670> felt<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:02.940> he's<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> leader<00:01:03.449> not

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
we've always felt like he's a leader not

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.359 
we've always felt like he's a leader not
I<00:01:03.780> think<00:01:04.110> part<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.710> because<00:01:04.890> of

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
I think part of that is because of

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.390 
I think part of that is because of
coming<00:01:06.090> from<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.299> coaching<00:01:07.049> background<00:01:07.590> I

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
coming from that coaching background I

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.490 
coming from that coaching background I
mean<00:01:08.970> he's<00:01:09.119> been<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> leader<00:01:09.540> since<00:01:10.049> he's<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
mean he's been a leader since he's a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.289 
mean he's been a leader since he's a
little<00:01:10.890> kid<00:01:11.070> kind<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.430> natural<00:01:11.850> born<00:01:12.060> leader

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
little kid kind of natural born leader

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.289

and<00:01:12.659> now<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.740> really<00:01:13.920> fits<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.400> role<00:01:14.610> because

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
and now it really fits the role because

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.289 
and now it really fits the role because
he's<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> senior<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.110> he<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:17.610> he<00:01:17.790> does<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.180> the
