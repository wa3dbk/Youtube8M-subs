00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080

people that prefer it some people don't
so<00:05:10.600> really<00:05:10.960> you<00:05:11.169> could<00:05:11.350> do<00:05:11.470> either<00:05:11.620> all<00:05:11.889> with

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
so really you could do either all with

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.360 
so really you could do either all with
your<00:05:12.100> step<00:05:12.840> for<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:14.080> color<00:05:14.289> of<00:05:14.380> my<00:05:14.650> eyelid<00:05:15.160> I'm

your step for the color of my eyelid I'm

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.330 
your step for the color of my eyelid I'm
going<00:05:15.550> in<00:05:15.880> with<00:05:16.060> a<00:05:16.509> shadow<00:05:17.229> from<00:05:17.650> shantou<00:05:18.160> Chi

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
going in with a shadow from shantou Chi

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.610 
going in with a shadow from shantou Chi
which<00:05:18.520> is<00:05:18.699> called<00:05:18.910> sesame<00:05:19.539> and<00:05:19.720> then<00:05:20.289> using

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
which is called sesame and then using

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.529 
which is called sesame and then using
both<00:05:20.800> a<00:05:20.949> flat<00:05:21.220> brush<00:05:21.460> and<00:05:21.729> a<00:05:21.940> blending<00:05:22.509> brush

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
both a flat brush and a blending brush

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.170 
both a flat brush and a blending brush
for<00:05:23.020> this<00:05:23.080> step<00:05:23.440> so<00:05:23.770> just<00:05:24.520> with<00:05:24.729> the<00:05:24.880> side<00:05:25.150> of

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
for this step so just with the side of

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.330 
for this step so just with the side of
the<00:05:25.479> brush<00:05:25.660> I'm<00:05:25.930> spilling<00:05:26.349> that<00:05:26.620> into<00:05:27.220> the

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
the brush I'm spilling that into the

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.189 
the brush I'm spilling that into the
powder<00:05:27.580> and<00:05:27.910> then<00:05:28.120> tapping<00:05:28.419> off<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:28.780> excess

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
powder and then tapping off the excess

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.339 
powder and then tapping off the excess
and<00:05:29.440> then<00:05:29.530> pressing<00:05:30.400> that<00:05:30.669> into<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.240> skin<00:05:31.570> now

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
and then pressing that into the skin now

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.469 
and then pressing that into the skin now
is<00:05:32.590> good<00:05:32.800> to<00:05:32.949> go<00:05:33.070> on<00:05:33.310> with<00:05:33.550> a<00:05:33.580> primer<00:05:34.120> before

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
is good to go on with a primer before

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.350 
is good to go on with a primer before
the<00:05:34.810> steps<00:05:35.139> I<00:05:35.380> find<00:05:35.860> that<00:05:36.250> I<00:05:36.310> could<00:05:36.849> naturally

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360
