 (Cortez) Diaz was pleased, and would like to see you again. 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.740
 (Tommy) Is that a good thing? 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.980
 (Cortez) Of course! Although I am beginning to think that Diaz was responsible for our unfortunate loss ... 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.960
 (Tommy) What makes you say that? 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.220
 (Cortez) One does not wield accusations against a man like Diaz ... I'm just thinking out loud ... 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.880
 (Cortez) It does not matter. I have a proposal that you could benefit from ... 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.100
 (Tommy) I do not have time to do more errands, Cortez. 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.140
 (Cortez) I would have thought that a man with such large debts would be anxious to find opportunities. Please, Tommy, at least listen to me. 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.260
 (Tommy) Go ahead ... 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.600
 (Cortez) I have a buyer for a piece of military equipment that is being transported through the city. Pick it up for me ... 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.400
 (Cortez) and once you have it, I want you to call me immediately, then ... 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.080
 (Commander) Go get some donuts, soldier! 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.160
 (Soldier) Sir, yes, sir! 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.420
 (Commander) I CONVOY, STOP! 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.780
 (Soldier) Civil, get away from the tank! 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.380
 (Military Operator) Activated Delta India Eco security protocol! Self-destruction of the vehicle started!
