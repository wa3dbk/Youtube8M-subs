00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.740
 friends of chalaca puntocom who has not 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.919
 finished the 2012 season for the 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.570
 Peruvian soccer with a game I think 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:14.599
 at the end of a final unfortunately 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.880
 marred by some incidents of 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.039
 violence used by people 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.300
 irresponsible people misfits people 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.060
 that hurts the soccer of the 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.590
 society that starts to scare a 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.740
 village that was quiet as the 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.820
 puneño in a match that had been then 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.610
 difficult to play in which you 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.590
 believes or did weigh the best bank that 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.000
 has the best structure to depend on 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.070
 has and above all a tactical order 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.110
 much more prolix than playing that was 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.150
 disorderly and ximo that in spite of that 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.390
 came to flip the game for that 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.910
 strong impetus that the team has here 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.690
 puneño and this locality that weighs here in 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.840
 the belon towers 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.420
 but well I finish playing you winning 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.680
 however the 3 to 2 was exhibited iván 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.110
 State-level policies and has 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.760
 seen this match where I create utc 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.290
 he got what he had to do goals 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.750
 early to be able to condition the 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.510
 rival if we actually said 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.000
 in the previous in the square when newly 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.000
 got you this is a team that 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.680
 it is not equal to the game that the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.360
 other rivals that alfonso ugarte had 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.180
 then in this way 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.900
 we saw that although the obligation had 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.660
 ugarte out to do their work not 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.160
 in this case to put the premises that 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.440
 I needed to be able to classify 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.060
 you were going to counterattack not and that 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.010
 was what he did precisely not and in addition 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.260
 has helped because playing inside very 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.090
 puzzled at the start 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.160
 and I think throughout the game he did not have 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.960
 this clear actions not if the 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.790
 three goals and finally the match won 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.649
 although it did not reach him to equal the 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.840
 difference or overcome it was only 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.399
 because there was a will on the part of some 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.680
 players for example of moses condori 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.259
 not that he tried to put the computer to 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.420
 shoulder but he missed someone else 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.250
 there is no companion some partner and 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.340
 unfortunately there was not some 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.609
 sparks of red 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.649
 and we could stop telling us what 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:07.570
 He made a letter instead, you left 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.429
 more solvent team knew what he was doing and 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.260
 the kickbacks were really 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.510
 deadly from part of the whole that 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.650
 marginalized followed him to the point in the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.000
 that you had a management 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.160
 smart game with a kilos 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.599
 impeccable in the bow, cutting everything 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.670
 that he had before him the 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:29.110
 true a very well managed match with 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.900
 you in the first time driving the 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.220
 the times with the goal of guevara is for 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.480
 both of those huge facilities that 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.670
 drown and huarte that is a mess 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.079
 because when he was going to attack even 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.870
 when even when you consider three 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.670
 goals you had to carry on one side 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.560
 donuts to the guanaco crossing the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.079
 right to the left choose the one 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.390
 comes who knows how to score that goal of 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.489
 discount the truth that it was a mess 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.989
 terrible tactical the team's 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.400
 chalaca gonzales and that's why 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.230
 it is mainly that we counterattack what 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.940
 end up liquidating clear of all 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.060
 ways this one there is also a 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.709
 conditioner not in the case of the 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.350
 first goal of you took very 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.080
 early and that I believe and it also ends 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.810
 to kill this choke 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.150
 and already with 10 men 1 to 0 below it was already 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.000
 it was another game and unfortunately 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.459
 for people one did not give 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.760
 thankfully for those of utc if you 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.400
 gave and it is the final conclusion of the match 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.590
 in a game that also starts as 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.060
 anecdote with a hail not those that 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.250
 we went up to field level we could 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.650
 check what actually there is 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.629
 hail the climate changed completely 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.469
 then at the time of the game the sun came out 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:40.569
 Y 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.950
 good are conjunctural issues 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.829
 nothing has to do with the development of 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.719
 I finally play ugarte because he could not 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.299
 to weigh the locality as if it had 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:51.849
 made other parties about what 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.400
 It has occurred against the game here 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.750
 also from the side of the tribune I repeat 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.510
 the podium was held so 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.010
 peaceful there were perhaps very exalted people 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.319
 in some moments in the gallery I 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.670
 It's surprising that it was almost from the 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.620
 around the main ones of the 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.019
 Western tribune because otherwise 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.209
 the people were calm and in the end if 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.549
 I've seen people very out of place I 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.500
 I really do not understand, I do not understand why 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.410
 what exists in Peru in some 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.380
 sectors the willingness to go against 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.120
 the police to fight with the police not 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.160
 when here the police tried to put 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.720
 order and good finally finished 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.979
 generating is something that we in throwing 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.990
 the head are the ones that is a bit of 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.180
 violence we are not going to show 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.370
 images of these terrible acts that are 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.919
 have registered here at the stadium because 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.270
 this had been a nice party and so 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.039
 It has to be because I think that you 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.639
 it is repeated he gives back the joy 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:45.180
 Cajamarca after 19 years 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.650
 I wanted to do it just like now 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.629
 all the options of being in second and 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.400
 be able to make a decent campaign of all 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:52.499
 ways out of these facts 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.270
 extra-sports outside the events of 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:55.919
 violence I think what you have to 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.169
 rescue is that two teams arrive very 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.120
 that at one point it was said they are 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.199
 not investing two teams arrive 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.060
 they have an economic livelihood behind and 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.800
 finally the access to first got it 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.749
 etc 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.430
 and alfonso ugarte is going to have to play the 

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:15.090
 second or by right is already 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:19.199
 classified and then he would tell us that that 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.599
 impetus I'm going to that that desire that showed 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.009
 the ugarte team this season what 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:24.870
 keep showing in the second division what 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.580
 feel like to maintain it 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.009
 that has to be reinforced despite I repeat 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.069
 of what tactical disorder bothered here 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.800
 the arbitration has been pretty good I think 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:37.680
 that he did not have to follow a concert in 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:41.330
 some classroom and little relevant otherwise 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.330
 I think the carrillo was impeccable 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.160
 I think a little bit of 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.350
 condescension no or of 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.420
 the time it took for some 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.400
 typical good minutes also of 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.310
 visitor archer always does the same 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.980
 but be out there could have rushed 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.130
 the game because sometimes 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:05.260
 we were on the court and there was a 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.580
 a situation in which I had to hurry 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.500
 we can show a yellow for 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.870
 condition but outside of it not 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.820
 does not influence the result either 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.250
 work is good but managed to manage 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.750
 the party and so a third who could 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.300
 in one of the most difficult stages of 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.710
 Peru has managed to give a huge 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.290
 joy Cajamarca to the people of Cajamarca 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.180
 that last year he could not enjoy his 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.670
 team at home because of conflicts 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.150
 social issues that there were for the terrible 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:34.720
 problem that I box with 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:36.550
 authorities that have incited the people to 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.640
 a violent reaction and oversize 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.860
 before facts derived from topics 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.170
 economic issues that are economic are 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.390
 they returned politicians cajamarca a town 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:49.480
 hit by all that today smiles 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.280
 today you know if it goes and goes first after 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.230
 19 years old with all the merits 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.310
 of the case because I work because this 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:58.030
 group of people 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:00.730
 rafo castle that has led has known 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:03.070
 carry on let you smile with 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.810
 an ascent an expected ascent and that 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.190
 returns to the cream box to a seat 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.140
 where the big teams as well 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.090
 an art that those leftovers from the inside 

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.500
 of the country that also deserves its 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:15.850
 opportunity and if you keep working 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:17.500
 he will surely manage to smile and have to 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.360
 be because the big teams of 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.280
 inside the country expert in a party 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.960
 like the one that was today that full stadium 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.870
 before it was raised in some 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.700
 problems that I think is what the 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.500
 football can rescue from this cup peru 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:33.420
 and especially in this year 2012 that here 

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.420
 ends to take the coat a little
