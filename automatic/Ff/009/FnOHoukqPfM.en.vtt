I<00:01:37.200> can't<00:01:37.409> even<00:01:37.470> remember<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.490> game

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
I can't even remember but the the game

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.370 
I can't even remember but the the game
that<00:01:39.000> lets<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.420> choose<00:01:39.689> kill<00:01:39.960> streaks<00:01:40.200> per

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
that lets you choose kill streaks per

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.530 
that lets you choose kill streaks per
class<00:01:40.619> because<00:01:41.040> you'd<00:01:41.820> put<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> class

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
class because you'd put it on a class

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.480 
class because you'd put it on a class
and<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.930> know<00:01:43.049> if<00:01:43.290> there<00:01:44.100> was<00:01:44.220> no<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.460> on

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
and you know if there was no one on

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.100 
and you know if there was no one on
there<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.880> team<00:01:45.030> shooting<00:01:45.299> things<00:01:45.720> down<00:01:45.930> you

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
there the team shooting things down you

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.539 
there the team shooting things down you
would<00:01:46.229> use<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:46.740> that's<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.130> problem<00:01:47.399> with

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
would use it but that's the problem with

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.670 
would use it but that's the problem with
it<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.060> easy<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.479> shoot<00:01:48.689> down<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.649> a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
it it's so easy to shoot down that a

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.499 
it it's so easy to shoot down that a
long<00:01:49.979> time<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.340> get<00:01:50.670> taken<00:01:50.880> out<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.329> this

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
long time it can get taken out in this

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.240 
long time it can get taken out in this
game<00:01:51.750> mine's<00:01:52.170> even<00:01:52.290> get<00:01:52.530> taken<00:01:52.710> out<00:01:52.890> they<00:01:53.100> may

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
get that thing up in the air to stay

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.670 
get that thing up in the air to stay
there<00:02:05.610> for<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> while<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.869> ridiculously

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
there for a while it is ridiculously

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.949 
there for a while it is ridiculously
powerful<00:02:07.920> it's<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.940> chopper<00:02:09.360> gunner<00:02:09.539> it's

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
powerful it's it's a chopper gunner it's

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.330 
powerful it's it's a chopper gunner it's
equivalent<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.470> chopper<00:02:10.860> gunner<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.099> kills

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
equivalent to chopper gunner it kills

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.450 
equivalent to chopper gunner it kills
quickly<00:02:11.550> if

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
quickly if

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.800 
quickly if
you<00:02:12.490> can<00:02:12.640> get<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.880> aim<00:02:13.000> right<00:02:13.270> sometimes<00:02:13.600> you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
you can get the aim right sometimes you

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.110 
you can get the aim right sometimes you
have<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.020> lead<00:02:14.200> bullets<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.950> it's<00:02:15.790> not<00:02:15.970> too

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
have to lead bullets and it's not too

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.720 
have to lead bullets and it's not too
hard<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.750> use<00:02:16.960> and<00:02:17.350> in<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:18.070> game<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.310> think<00:02:18.640> I

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
hard to use and in this game I think I

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.160 
hard to use and in this game I think I
got<00:02:18.880> something<00:02:19.330> right<00:02:19.390> somewhere<00:02:19.690> around<00:02:19.750> 10

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
got something right somewhere around 10

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.520 
got something right somewhere around 10
maybe<00:02:21.010> 11<00:02:21.160> kills<00:02:21.850> with<00:02:22.180> it<00:02:22.210> and<00:02:22.570> this<00:02:23.320> kill

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
maybe 11 kills with it and this kill

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.050 
maybe 11 kills with it and this kill
streak<00:02:23.740> isn't<00:02:24.070> too<00:02:24.160> high<00:02:24.340> I'm<00:02:24.700> pretty<00:02:24.940> sure

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
streak isn't too high I'm pretty sure

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.550 
streak isn't too high I'm pretty sure
it's<00:02:25.180> like<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.300> 10<00:02:25.600> kill<00:02:25.900> streak<00:02:25.930> or<00:02:26.260> maybe<00:02:26.470> a

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
it's like a 10 kill streak or maybe a

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.260 
it's like a 10 kill streak or maybe a
little<00:02:26.770> lower<00:02:26.980> but<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:27.880> know<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.090> kill

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
little lower but you know the kill

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.210 
little lower but you know the kill
streak<00:02:28.480> isn't<00:02:28.780> too<00:02:28.900> high<00:02:29.050> another<00:02:29.890> thing<00:02:30.100> that

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
streak isn't too high another thing that

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.890

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
a game well truthfully you shouldn't be

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.400 
a game well truthfully you shouldn't be
using<00:02:43.240> it<00:02:43.480> if<00:02:43.600> they're<00:02:43.750> shooting<00:02:43.870> stuff<00:02:44.170> down
