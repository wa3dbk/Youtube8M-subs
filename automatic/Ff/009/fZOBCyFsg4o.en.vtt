links<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.519> gameplay<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.750> if<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:27.960> get

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
links for this gameplay so if we get

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.439 
links for this gameplay so if we get
straight<00:00:28.529> into<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.859> first<00:00:29.310> clip<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:30.060> first

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
straight into the first clip the first

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.060 
straight into the first clip the first
clip<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.810> downhill<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.529> if<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.800> don't<00:00:31.980> know

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
clip is downhill and if you don't know

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.790 
clip is downhill and if you don't know
what<00:00:32.189> downhill<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:33.329> basically<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.989> snowy

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
what downhill is it's basically a snowy

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.630 
what downhill is it's basically a snowy
ski<00:00:35.489> slope<00:00:36.090> map<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:37.469> cable<00:00:38.219> carts<00:00:38.520> and

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
ski slope map with cable carts and

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.340 
ski slope map with cable carts and
everything<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.270> do<00:00:39.329> think<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.050> run

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
everything and I do think if you run

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.950 
everything and I do think if you run
into<00:00:40.379> these<00:00:40.710> cable<00:00:41.100> cuts<00:00:41.309> they<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.180> crush<00:00:42.719> you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
into these cable cuts they can crush you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.889 
into these cable cuts they can crush you
just<00:00:43.950> like<00:00:44.070> care<00:00:44.280> packages<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.969> other<00:00:45.120> moving

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
just like care packages and other moving

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.540 
just like care packages and other moving
things<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> game<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.100> train<00:00:47.370> on

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
things in the game like the train on

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.970 
things in the game like the train on
expressly<00:00:48.140> but<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.260> does<00:00:49.410> look<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.739> very

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
expressly but it does look like a very

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.340 
expressly but it does look like a very
very<00:00:50.219> good<00:00:50.460> map<00:00:50.780> there's<00:00:51.780> not<00:00:51.899> very<00:00:51.930> many

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
very good map there's not very many

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.130 
very good map there's not very many
snowy<00:00:52.710> maps<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.250> black<00:00:53.489> ops<00:00:53.670> 2<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.989> to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
snowy maps on black ops 2 and I have to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.110 
snowy maps on black ops 2 and I have to
admit<00:00:55.260> black<00:00:55.559> ops<00:00:55.739> one<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> snow<00:00:56.850> maps

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
admit black ops one with the snow maps

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.299 
admit black ops one with the snow maps
was<00:00:57.329> very<00:00:57.809> very<00:00:58.050> good<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.590> enjoy<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
was very very good and I do enjoy the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.520 
was very very good and I do enjoy the
snow<00:00:59.370> maps<00:00:59.760> quite<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> lot<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:01.170> here<00:01:01.379> are<00:01:01.410> some

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
snow maps quite a lot so here are some

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.600 
snow maps quite a lot so here are some
quick<00:01:02.300> peacekeeper<00:01:04.070> gameplay<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
quick peacekeeper gameplay on the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.140 
quick peacekeeper gameplay on the
downhill<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.830> it<00:01:07.830> looks<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.220> kind<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.000> like

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
downhill and it looks like kind of like

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.660 
downhill and it looks like kind of like
the<00:01:09.360> vector<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:10.650> guy's<00:01:10.830> got<00:01:11.040> red<00:01:11.250> dot<00:01:11.430> sight

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the vector this guy's got red dot sight

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.080 
the vector this guy's got red dot sight
and<00:01:11.850> grip<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.299> think<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:13.220> it's<00:01:14.220> very<00:01:14.880> low

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
and grip I think and it's very low

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.660 
and grip I think and it's very low
recoil<00:01:15.500> it's<00:01:16.500> very<00:01:16.680> manageable<00:01:17.130> as<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.520> can

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
recoil it's very manageable as you can

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.760 
recoil it's very manageable as you can
see<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.090> he's<00:01:18.689> picking<00:01:19.320> off<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.590> long

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
see here he's picking off that long

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.280 
see here he's picking off that long
range<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.159> quite<00:01:20.520> easily<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:21.290> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
range but quite easily but the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.260 
range but quite easily but the
Peacekeeper<00:01:22.860> does<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.610> very<00:01:23.909> good

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
Peacekeeper does that like a very good

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.899 
Peacekeeper does that like a very good
gun<00:01:24.799> as<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.009> can<00:01:26.130> see<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:26.700> actually

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
gun as you can see here you can actually

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.880 
gun as you can see here you can actually
go<00:01:27.210> into<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.659> kind<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.990> turnaround<00:01:28.380> bit<00:01:28.680> where

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
go into the kind of turnaround bit where

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.940 
go into the kind of turnaround bit where
the<00:01:29.070> cable<00:01:29.880> carts<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.240> turn<00:01:30.509> around<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.020> I

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
the cable carts do turn around and I

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.499 
the cable carts do turn around and I
don't<00:01:32.460> know<00:01:32.579> if<00:01:32.670> he<00:01:32.759> actually<00:01:32.909> gets<00:01:33.180> squished

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
don't know if he actually gets squished

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.749 
don't know if he actually gets squished
by<00:01:33.750> them<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.079> but<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.560> do<00:01:35.130> stop<00:01:35.520> and

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
by them here but I do stop and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.730 
by them here but I do stop and
unfortunately<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.810> can't<00:01:37.079> actually<00:01:37.259> get<00:01:37.560> on

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
unfortunately you can't actually get on

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.920 
unfortunately you can't actually get on
them<00:01:37.950> which<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.610> bit<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.939> shame<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.450> thought

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
them which is a bit of a shame I thought

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.539 
them which is a bit of a shame I thought
I'd<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.229> quite<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> cool<00:01:40.770> element<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> game

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
I'd be quite a cool element of the game

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.730 
I'd be quite a cool element of the game
to<00:01:41.759> actually<00:01:42.119> get<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> cable<00:01:43.350> cars<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
to actually get on the cable cars and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.160 
to actually get on the cable cars and
move<00:01:43.920> around<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.490> next<00:01:45.329> map<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.869> is

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
move around the next map we have is

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.020 
move around the next map we have is
grind<00:01:46.590> if<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.250> don't<00:01:47.399> know<00:01:47.460> what<00:01:47.579> grinders

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
grind if you don't know what grinders

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.630 
grind if you don't know what grinders
it's<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.450> skate<00:01:48.899> park<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.460> definitely

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
it's a skate park and this is definitely

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.310 
it's a skate park and this is definitely
going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.970> be<00:01:51.030> one<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.450> popular<00:01:51.899> maps<00:01:52.110> I

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
going to be one of the popular maps I

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.889 
going to be one of the popular maps I
think<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.159> size<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.909> map<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.149> very<00:01:54.540> close

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
think the size of this map is very close

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.130 
think the size of this map is very close
to<00:01:54.930> stadium<00:01:55.680> from<00:01:56.100> black<00:01:56.369> ops<00:01:56.610> 1<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.149> it's<00:01:57.990> got

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
to stadium from black ops 1 and it's got

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.740 
to stadium from black ops 1 and it's got
very<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.619> curved<00:01:59.340> areas<00:02:00.149> obviously<00:02:00.329> with

pipes<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.680> know<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:04.979> going<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.250> very

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
pipes you know it's going to be very

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.459

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
map we have here is Mirage and if you

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.030 
map we have here is Mirage and if you
don't<00:03:10.269> knock<00:03:10.330> mirages<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.080> basically<00:03:11.620> a<00:03:11.650> kind

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
don't knock mirages is basically a kind

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.690 
don't knock mirages is basically a kind
of<00:03:12.160> desert<00:03:12.880> type<00:03:13.690> map<00:03:14.100> it<00:03:15.100> looks<00:03:15.130> like<00:03:15.489> it's

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
of desert type map it looks like it's

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.880 
of desert type map it looks like it's
set<00:03:15.850> in<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.120> Middle<00:03:16.510> East<00:03:16.810> probably<00:03:17.650> near

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
set in the Middle East probably near

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.039 
set in the Middle East probably near
where<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.280> zombie<00:03:18.700> map<00:03:18.850> die<00:03:19.060> rise<00:03:19.360> is<00:03:19.600> set<00:03:19.840> and

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
where the zombie map die rise is set and

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.650 
where the zombie map die rise is set and
it<00:03:20.920> basically<00:03:21.130> looks<00:03:21.610> like<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.910> Chinese<00:03:22.360> or

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
it basically looks like a Chinese or

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.920 
it basically looks like a Chinese or
Japanese<00:03:22.920> dojo<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:25.269> can<00:03:25.450> see<00:03:25.630> it's<00:03:25.780> got

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
Japanese dojo and you can see it's got

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.840 
Japanese dojo and you can see it's got
these<00:03:26.079> big<00:03:26.350> kind<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.769> statues<00:03:27.250> out<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.549> front

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
these big kind of statues out the front

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.250 
these big kind of statues out the front
I<00:03:28.680> think<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.950> main<00:03:30.360> deal<00:03:31.360> of<00:03:31.570> this<00:03:31.690> map<00:03:31.930> is<00:03:31.959> if

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
I think the main deal of this map is if

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.229 
I think the main deal of this map is if
you<00:03:32.380> get<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.709> dojo<00:03:33.190> secured<00:03:33.670> with<00:03:33.850> your<00:03:34.000> team

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
you get that dojo secured with your team

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.090 
you get that dojo secured with your team
you're<00:03:34.900> basically<00:03:35.110> going<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.590> have<00:03:35.739> control

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
you're basically going to have control

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.520 
you're basically going to have control
of<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.370> whole<00:03:36.549> game<00:03:36.930> maybe<00:03:37.930> headquarters

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
of the whole game maybe headquarters

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
objective of that map will be of that

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.590 
objective of that map will be of that
game<00:03:48.040> mode<00:03:48.250> even<00:03:48.400> will<00:03:48.700> be<00:03:48.880> in<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.209> center<00:03:49.570> of

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
game mode even will be in the center of

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.440 
game mode even will be in the center of
this<00:03:49.840> map<00:03:50.280> but<00:03:51.280> there<00:03:51.430> is<00:03:51.549> like<00:03:51.760> 2<00:03:51.940> levels<00:03:52.329> to

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
this map but there is like 2 levels to

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.390 
this map but there is like 2 levels to
the<00:03:52.570> dojo<00:03:52.750> as<00:03:53.019> you<00:03:53.170> can<00:03:53.350> see<00:03:53.590> there's<00:03:54.250> like<00:03:54.280> a

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
the dojo as you can see there's like a

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.710 
the dojo as you can see there's like a
bottom<00:03:54.700> level<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:55.030> there's<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.239> second<00:03:55.540> level

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
bottom level and there's a second level

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.750 
bottom level and there's a second level
wasted<00:03:56.140> now<00:03:56.320> but<00:03:57.100> it<00:03:57.280> does<00:03:57.459> look<00:03:57.489> like<00:03:57.670> a

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
wasted now but it does look like a

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.220 
wasted now but it does look like a
really<00:03:58.090> really<00:03:58.329> good<00:03:58.510> map<00:03:58.720> again<00:03:58.989> it's<00:03:59.170> going

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
really really good map again it's going

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.900 
really really good map again it's going
to<00:03:59.350> be<00:03:59.440> very<00:03:59.470> close<00:03:59.799> quarters<00:04:00.280> with<00:04:00.459> the

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
to be very close quarters with the

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.300 
to be very close quarters with the
doorways<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:01.450> staircases<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:03.130> whole

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
doorways the staircases and the whole

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.940 
doorways the staircases and the whole
idea<00:04:03.519> of<00:04:03.970> securing<00:04:04.390> this<00:04:04.660> dojo<00:04:05.109> but<00:04:05.709> it<00:04:05.829> does

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
idea of securing this dojo but it does

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.740 
idea of securing this dojo but it does
the<00:04:06.100> like<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.250> really<00:04:06.519> good<00:04:06.700> map<00:04:06.880> and<00:04:07.180> again<00:04:07.540> he

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
the like a really good map and again he

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.920 
the like a really good map and again he
is<00:04:07.930> using<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.350> Peacekeeper<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:10.750> rate<00:04:10.900> of

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
is using the Peacekeeper and the rate of

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.390 
is using the Peacekeeper and the rate of
fire<00:04:11.200> on<00:04:11.320> this<00:04:11.440> gun<00:04:11.620> it's<00:04:11.799> actually<00:04:12.220> quite

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
fire on this gun it's actually quite

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.720 
fire on this gun it's actually quite
high<00:04:12.790> something<00:04:13.660> I'm<00:04:13.780> noticed<00:04:14.230> but<00:04:15.040> again

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
high something I'm noticed but again

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.069 
high something I'm noticed but again
it's<00:04:15.940> going<00:04:16.060> to<00:04:16.120> be<00:04:16.209> in<00:04:16.359> similar<00:04:16.660> terms<00:04:16.840> with

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
it's going to be in similar terms with

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.650 
it's going to be in similar terms with
the<00:04:17.229> vector<00:04:17.979> but<00:04:18.519> slightly<00:04:18.820> lower<00:04:19.030> recoil<00:04:19.329> I

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
the vector but slightly lower recoil I

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.240 
the vector but slightly lower recoil I
think<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:20.140> it<00:04:20.380> definitely<00:04:20.590> does<00:04:20.919> look<00:04:21.099> like<00:04:21.190> a

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
think and it definitely does look like a

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.790 
think and it definitely does look like a
very<00:04:21.489> good<00:04:21.760> gun<00:04:22.000> so<00:04:22.690> I'm<00:04:23.020> very<00:04:23.080> excited<00:04:23.380> for

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
very good gun so I'm very excited for

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.469 
very good gun so I'm very excited for
