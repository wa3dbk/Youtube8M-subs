00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.620
 2 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.629
 the featured textures so will remain the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.180
 thirsts 8 which features silk satin 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.760
 silk muslin pancakes and 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.920
 georgette sheets double sheets 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.059
 face what's called the double satin 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.760
 etc. 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.559
 others this category there actually who 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.339
 suggests a fluid silhouette and 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.339
 willowy 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.579
 the cuts so will continue in a 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.260
 modern sense actually at the level of the 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:10.090
 structure but in langil and so is 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.830
 no layering the sleeves funds 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.360
 will be the angel is so far from sleeves 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.659
 three quarters makes it the least two 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.270
 sleeves cost the four still tend 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:23.700
 liv more either sleeveless or with 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:28.530
 motion there are two trends actually 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.899
 that they will actually stay on stage 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.170
 either the flared cuts that promotes in 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:39.580
 does the girl tell him and some 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.460
 ease in fact at the level of forms and 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.820
 that are compatible with the 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.369
 fluid textures 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.890
 lc grows well together be a cut 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.140
 in fact they are returning to the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.960
 the 70's and the 80's this is the 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.289
 cut in fact of the right attire but 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.590
 melted on the sides except that when we go 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.090
 create the slots we will have to work 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.599
 the bench the ball beavers at the level of 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.940
 slots either we'll put a finish of 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:11.860
 the craftsman is an embroidery either 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.980
 plainly the texture and will be printed 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.230
 or else 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.590
 a texture that contrasts with that of 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.590
 above 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:30.069
 2014-2015 also will see at the level of 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:32.739
 finishes a pretty special combination by 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.920
 report to my work for example I 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.440
 mix 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.120
 more actual in fact between what is 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.530
 old at the level of finishing by 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.610
 example the work of the mail likes we 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.560
 saw on the caftan from top to bottom me 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.400
 I do not position it in a way 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.890
 different already so the positioning 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.900
 which is more modern more sought after or 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.230
 well the schemes between different types 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.800
 embroidery finishing with dumoulin 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.830
 from the mail m 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.320
 benchmarks the mandates that comes back very 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.060
 trend too but we do not touch 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.430
 the traditional way as we 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.350
 saw before 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.810
 so I'll say everything is in the mix 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.340
 of in the way actually to mix 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:22.090
 to combine the finishes so that they 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.150
 are actually more modern at rendering 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.150
 final 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.150
 you
