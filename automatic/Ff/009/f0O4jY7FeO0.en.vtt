00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.800
 subscribed to the channel tsf for one year 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.300
 Gaming is the knowledge that I am 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.340

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.649

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.140
 I'll explain you what that is 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.000
 at all, this is top 5 place and how 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.579

 what will i do with my head through or 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.350

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.100

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.130
 of duty battlefield a category 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.679

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:18.600
 i also know with much luck 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.600
 I do not really know anything about that 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.180
 really newest that's the top-5 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.090
 place or top ten place or topp place 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.189
 of leon and the month and then there is 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.130
 yet this top five fails where anyone 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.430
 really shit 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.229
 is dreamed or he really bad 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.570
 Everybody has his five minutes 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.530
 the day he sits in the game and himself 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.979
 think what am I doing here for one 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.030
 crap 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:49.500
 These five minutes will be in one 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.329
 used video and yes I have me so 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.860
 I imagine blinded or I have you 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.590
 really this one all the time 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:00.689
 e-mail adress displayed on this e 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.880
 mail address you can address me yes 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.670
 So post in the typical link of 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.579
 youtube where you uploaded a clip 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.380
 have something really horny makes 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:13.380
 either as a top five 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.430
 place edition become top five fails 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.959
 we can always come back 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.079
 if there are enough submissions 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.340
 then I like doing that but I want 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.060
 First of me on this top five 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.420
 place so there 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.750
 good concentration means that if you are 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.190
 what you want to send then you can yours 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.690
 league of legends from no 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.959
 idea from the new player or otherwise 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.540
 What 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.770
 upload it to youtube if it succeeds 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.520
 or not listed it is me 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.400
 not really matter 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.450
 send me the link and I download 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.330
 with the video and become in my 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.769
 use pot place video 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.360
 that's the theory now we come to 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.480
 practice the practice just looks like this 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.850
 that I depend on you 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.920
 no top five place of tales of 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.959
 Gaming is supposed to be a top 5 place 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.610
 edition of the community will be the 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.069
 means I am dependent on you 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.500
 and I really ask you for that 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.950
 no idea we all or have 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.590
 at least 70 on the pc with the man 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.360
 to receive the here maybe 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.980
 take care that we maybe more 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.910
 run his recording program by the way 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.739
 let and yes that is so clips you come 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.209
 can also submit several clips is 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.680
 not limited can also several 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.780
 People in different episodes several times 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.010
 occur in it that is if you eg 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.590
 a mister iks sends in episode 1 in 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.540
 clip in and also in episode 2 that 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.650
 is all feasible people i'm just up 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.250
 instruct you 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.989
 that is please please please please please 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.489
 do that that would be really correct 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.569
 awesome thing we all bock on such a thing 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.459
 top 5 place went 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.950
 but I need you for that 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.430
 we need you the whole community 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.769
 depends on each individual 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.510
 So again short and crisp explained 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.910
 you take a clip on new 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.019
 player or solo ingame depending on how 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.630
 think it is right 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.989
 upload this clip on youtube 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.519
 send me the link of this clip it 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.200
 really should just be the clips it 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.389
 should not be the 30-minute somehow 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.579
 be game and then I have to 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.620
 download whole game and then I have to 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.910
 cut it out so that is warm 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.289
 loves if no idea of ​​the clip can 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.519
 even from me that take longer 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.310
 that you really just clip on 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.880
 upload youtube then he sends me the 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.410
 clip so the address of the clips so 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.909
 this youtube link by e mail to her 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.599

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:37.120
 and then send me one 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:40.360
 E-mail with that with this one 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.010
 link in the contents with the inscription pot 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.159
 place that will be enough 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.630
 that's enough and then I am 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.370
 curious if we call this into life 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.599
 can and then I will keep you on the 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.030
 ongoing if that worked 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:54.990
 if not after the first month 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.099
 I will continue to work on it 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.450
 to know that I'm doing that 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:01.120

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.370
