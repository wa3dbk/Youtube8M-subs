00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.190
 Hi dear, it seems to me always that 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.870
 a bit contradictory if we 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.390
 straight dishes for sausages 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.250
 meatballs or similar 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.810
 but he is named after him 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.359
 So be it it is 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.220
 So I get down and prepare 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.900
 Today, vegan sausages taste like that 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.789
 really great and pays the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.929
 components are also credible 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.670
 comprehensibly 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.670
 we need a big onion 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.550
 salt pepper some sugar dried 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.680
 Thyme Semmelbrösel the shells abrasion 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.050
 a bio lemon champignons 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.030
 chickpeas and curry fit 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.940
 depending on how sharp you would like 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.660
 yellow green or red alternatively also harry 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.710
 looked fit 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.809
 we start with the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.520
 preparatory work halves the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.920
 onion then cut them long ago 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.109
 several times but not completely through 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.879
 then bring them and 90 degrees and can 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.680
 They now easily in small cubes 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.720
 cut and so just with the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.610
 Then on the other side we go 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.020
 chickpeas in a sieve with them 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.970
 can drain only the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.560
 cut small mushrooms and these 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.210
 I brushed with one hand before 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.400
 only briefly brushed off 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.470
 in a pan, we brighten about 1 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.630
 tablespoon of oil gives the cut 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.820
 onion and stew it for 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.500
 but stir for about three minutes 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.479
 go through again and then give the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.759
 sliced ​​mushrooms with it too 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.860
 Do it again and again and everything 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.710
 braise for another five minutes or so 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.189
 We then take it from the stove and reach 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.689
 now from the lemon the peel off in 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.729
 a bowl or something similar 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.079
 suitable vessel give me the onion 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.270
 mushroom mixture then the 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.549
 drained chickpeas about one 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.770
 half teaspoon of the church fit the 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.310
 Peel the lemon as well 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.500
 dried thyme and sugar and 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.260
 then season with salt and with 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.930
 betray 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.540
 now edit everything with the blender 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.280
 and roughly enough if so that one 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.430
 or other particles still remains 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.369
 this is not a problem 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:14.090
 only the breadcrumbs give to 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.130
 Stir in this and if done 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.430
 is again with salt and pepper 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.610
 taste and thoroughly through again 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.740
 stir 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.030
 the resulting dough on a 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.790
 give work space 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.280
 I take only half of my hands 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.530
 Everything works best in a longish one 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.840
 form and then with a knife 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.350
 in five to six about the same size 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.790
 pieces divide the individual parts 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.770
 we form now between the hands 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.140
 I knew something similar 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.330
 on the work surface until the final 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.890
 sausages is reached by and drive so 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.709
 we gradually with all the dough pieces 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.990
 at the end of ten to twelve of these 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.660
 have prepared sausages now 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.630
 Put some oil and paint the sausages 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.980
 therefore a 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:06.720
 then we turn them and brush the 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.720
 the other side also with oil 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.430
 we would have a baking tray easily and 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.989
 put the sausages on it alternatively 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.970
 The sausages can be just as good in 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.209
 something fat in the pan or still 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.130
 better on aluminum foil or in grill bowl 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.840
 to be cooked on the grill 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.780
 I now put the baking sheet in the oven 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.060
 set the convection grill to about 180 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.610
 degree and grille this until nicely 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.739
 look crispy when you have a look 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.630
 and not even ten 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.070
 minutes just will not stay close by 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.230
 that they are getting too dark 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.030
 and that's it 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.820
 This vegan treat will be eaten 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.650
 is healthy tastes great and the 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.610
 preparation is we could see 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.709
 not complicated 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.680
 I wish you a lot of fun with it and 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.580
 then quite good appetite 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.709
 but rather something else 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.810
 maybe want to prepare vegan 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.850
 a chickpea vegetable salad or 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.950
 Also prepare the vegetables from the baking sheet 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.080
 then just have a look 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.090
 videos in and if not yet 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.340
 Of course I am very happy 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.860
 about yours but I still have to say 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.860
 until next time bye in
