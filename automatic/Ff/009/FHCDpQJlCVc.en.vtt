you're<00:02:28.680> tasked<00:02:28.920> with<00:02:29.840> replacing<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.930> stars

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
you're tasked with replacing the stars

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.960 
you're tasked with replacing the stars
in<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.440> sky<00:02:31.560> because<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.460> King<00:02:32.670> has

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
in the sky because the King has

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.250 
in the sky because the King has
destroyed<00:02:33.450> them<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:33.780> time<00:02:33.990> it<00:02:34.140> isn't

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
destroyed them this time it isn't

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.570 
destroyed them this time it isn't
actually<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.680> king<00:02:34.980> he<00:02:35.250> was<00:02:35.370> playing

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
actually the king he was playing

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.490 
actually the king he was playing
football<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.480> think<00:02:36.810> he<00:02:36.900> was<00:02:37.020> knocked<00:02:37.260> out

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
football and I think he was knocked out

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.350 
football and I think he was knocked out
because<00:02:37.890> football<00:02:38.250> as<00:02:38.340> well<00:02:38.370> I'm<00:02:39.030> not<00:02:39.150> great

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
because football as well I'm not great

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.850 
because football as well I'm not great
with<00:02:39.390> sports<00:02:39.810> but<00:02:40.140> he<00:02:40.350> was<00:02:40.380> playing<00:02:40.650> football

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
with sports but he was playing football

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.050 
with sports but he was playing football
and<00:02:42.800> he<00:02:43.800> was<00:02:43.920> knocked<00:02:44.130> down<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.610> he's<00:02:44.760> an<00:02:44.880> earth

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
and he was knocked down so he's an earth

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.880 
and he was knocked down so he's an earth
is<00:02:45.360> in<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.510> coma<00:02:45.720> or<00:02:46.110> something<00:02:46.140> like<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.590> and

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
is in a coma or something like that and

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.560 
is in a coma or something like that and
you<00:02:47.010> need<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.660> wake<00:02:48.660> him<00:02:48.930> up<00:02:49.070> but<00:02:50.150> in<00:02:51.150> his<00:02:51.330> said

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
you need to wake him up but in his said

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.210 
you need to wake him up but in his said
you've<00:02:51.720> got<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:52.050> robot<00:02:52.530> King<00:02:52.800> which<00:02:53.010> was

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
you've got the robot King which was

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.340 
you've got the robot King which was
developed<00:02:53.400> by<00:02:53.790> yourself<00:02:54.180> at<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.690> few<00:02:54.960> others<00:02:55.200> i

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
developed by yourself at a few others i

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.630 
developed by yourself at a few others i
think<00:02:55.560> 22<00:02:57.320> yet<00:02:58.320> replace<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.770> king<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.370> then

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
think 22 yet replace the king and then

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.190 
think 22 yet replace the king and then
he<00:02:59.880> is<00:03:00.000> on<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.180> rampage<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.720> destroys<00:03:01.050> all<00:03:01.080> the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
he is on a rampage and destroys all the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.700 
he is on a rampage and destroys all the
stars<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.130> have<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:03.140> try<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.200> get<00:03:04.410> the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
stars so you have to a try and get the

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.010 
stars so you have to a try and get the
king<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.010> all<00:03:05.100> cosmos<00:03:05.310> memory<00:03:06.090> back<00:03:06.270> by<00:03:06.690> going

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
king of all cosmos memory back by going

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.750 
king of all cosmos memory back by going
through<00:03:07.080> older<00:03:07.650> levels<00:03:07.950> from<00:03:08.100> old<00:03:08.280> katamari

games and sort of joining his memory

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.830 
games and sort of joining his memory
these<00:03:11.790> levels<00:03:12.000> appear<00:03:12.360> in<00:03:12.480> sort<00:03:12.690> of<00:03:12.720> a

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
these levels appear in sort of a

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.280 
these levels appear in sort of a
grayscale<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.680> as<00:03:13.770> you<00:03:13.890> collect<00:03:14.900> yeah<00:03:15.900> as<00:03:16.110> you
