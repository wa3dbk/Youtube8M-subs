00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.100 
Next I don't know
fat<00:02:29.730> funk<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.150> don't<00:02:30.329> know<00:02:30.390> if<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.569> guys<00:02:30.750> have

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
fat funk I don't know if you guys have

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.869 
fat funk I don't know if you guys have
these<00:02:31.379> over<00:02:31.709> over<00:02:32.159> where<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.579> are<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.760> think

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
these over over where you are I think

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.670 
these over over where you are I think
you<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.480> think<00:02:34.019> it<00:02:34.110> said<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.530> were<00:02:34.590> in

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
you I think it said that you were in

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.180 
you I think it said that you were in
Malaysia<00:02:35.069> but<00:02:36.290> this<00:02:37.290> was<00:02:37.440> made<00:02:37.590> by<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.799> company

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
Malaysia but this was made by a company

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.850 
Malaysia but this was made by a company
called<00:02:38.569> Messiah<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:40.049> they<00:02:40.290> crashed<00:02:40.620> and

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
called Messiah and they crashed and

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.809 
called Messiah and they crashed and
burned<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.250> think<00:02:41.430> they<00:02:41.549> tried<00:02:41.790> to

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
burned I think they tried to

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.050 
burned I think they tried to
reinvigorate<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.290> 8-bit<00:02:43.860> craze<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.849> think

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
reinvigorate the 8-bit craze and I think

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.789 
reinvigorate the 8-bit craze and I think
they<00:02:45.329> were<00:02:45.390> planning<00:02:45.690> on<00:02:45.930> doing<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.200> 16-bit

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
they were planning on doing a 16-bit

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.430 
they were planning on doing a 16-bit
version<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.519> obviously<00:02:48.510> this<00:02:48.930> clones

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440

can't<00:03:42.660> believe<00:03:42.870> they<00:03:42.959> did<00:03:43.139> this<00:03:43.169> but<00:03:43.680> this<00:03:44.310> is

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
can't believe they did this but this is

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.470 
can't believe they did this but this is
a<00:03:44.639> game<00:03:45.109> that<00:03:46.109> was<00:03:46.260> released<00:03:46.410> here<00:03:47.480> called

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
a game that was released here called

a game that was released here called
target<00:03:49.260> renegade<00:03:49.970> and<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.780> don't<00:03:52.440> know<00:03:52.500> if<00:03:52.590> all

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680

the<00:03:52.829> levels<00:03:53.160> are<00:03:53.310> there<00:03:53.579> but<00:03:54.449> I<00:03:54.949> mean<00:03:55.949> it<00:03:56.040> looks

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
the levels are there but I mean it looks

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.379 
the levels are there but I mean it looks

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
like double dragon but I guess they do

here's double dragon 2 which actually is

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.939 
here's double dragon 2 which actually is
Double<00:04:08.609> Dragon<00:04:08.790> 2<00:04:09.329> oops<00:04:10.319> it's<00:04:10.560> double<00:04:10.739> dragon

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
Double Dragon 2 oops it's double dragon

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.339 
Double Dragon 2 oops it's double dragon
for<00:04:11.069> Emmet<00:04:11.280> bitch<00:04:11.639> which<00:04:12.090> is<00:04:12.359> Double<00:04:12.780> Dragon<00:04:12.900> 2

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
for Emmet bitch which is Double Dragon 2

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.050 
for Emmet bitch which is Double Dragon 2
it<00:04:14.359> it's<00:04:15.359> a<00:04:15.569> sample<00:04:16.049> version<00:04:16.530> down<00:04:16.979> here<00:04:17.459> so

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
it it's a sample version down here so

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.360 
it it's a sample version down here so
I'm<00:04:18.570> thinking<00:04:19.199> it<00:04:19.530> doesn't<00:04:19.919> have<00:04:20.039> all<00:04:20.190> the

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
I'm thinking it doesn't have all the

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.420 
I'm thinking it doesn't have all the
levels<00:04:20.789> but<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.900> it's<00:04:22.349> got<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.860> Japanese

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
levels but and it's got the Japanese

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.490 
levels but and it's got the Japanese
text<00:04:23.969> and

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.530 

it's<00:04:26.770> Double<00:04:27.130> Dragon<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:28.890> reset<00:04:29.890> again<00:04:30.540> this

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
it's Double Dragon to reset again this

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.820 
it's Double Dragon to reset again this
is<00:04:32.100> obviously<00:04:33.100> Double<00:04:33.430> Dragon<00:04:33.520> three<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.830> it

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
is obviously Double Dragon three and it

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:44.550 
is obviously Double Dragon three and it
is<00:04:35.860> Double<00:04:36.550> Dragon<00:04:36.700> three<00:04:37.770> it's

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.490 

and<00:04:45.560> I'm<00:04:46.220> hoping<00:04:46.970> it's<00:04:47.150> like<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.750> entire<00:04:48.170> game

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
and I'm hoping it's like the entire game

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.270 
and I'm hoping it's like the entire game
but<00:04:48.740> I'm<00:04:48.830> not<00:04:48.980> sure<00:04:50.620> it<00:04:51.620> has<00:04:51.770> all<00:04:51.920> the<00:04:52.100> Japanese

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
but I'm not sure it has all the Japanese

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.600 
but I'm not sure it has all the Japanese
