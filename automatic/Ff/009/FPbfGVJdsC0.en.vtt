00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
up front I have a feeling drew Schaefer

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.130

at<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.730> good<00:01:29.880> practice<00:01:30.270> sometimes<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:30.780> hard

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
at a good practice sometimes it's hard

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.780 
at a good practice sometimes it's hard
to<00:01:31.200> tell<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.800> offensive<00:01:32.100> lineman<00:01:32.610> you

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
to tell with the offensive lineman you

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.190 
to tell with the offensive lineman you
know<00:01:32.880> you're<00:01:33.120> trying<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.360> watch<00:01:33.480> anything<00:01:33.840> but

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
know you're trying to watch anything but

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.160 
know you're trying to watch anything but
I<00:01:34.520> felt<00:01:35.520> like<00:01:35.640> we<00:01:35.790> targeted<00:01:36.330> well<00:01:36.510> up<00:01:36.690> front<00:01:36.930> so

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
I felt like we targeted well up front so

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.930 
I felt like we targeted well up front so
that<00:01:37.200> musta<00:01:37.740> mean<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.010> communicated<00:01:38.670> well<00:01:38.820> and

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
that musta mean we communicated well and

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.660 
that musta mean we communicated well and
then<00:01:39.060> all<00:01:39.150> starts<00:01:39.480> with<00:01:39.570> him<00:01:39.720> Sheamus<00:01:40.080> down

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
then all starts with him Sheamus down

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.800 
then all starts with him Sheamus down

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
last season well I thought their

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.820

justin lin you know doesn't fumble any
snaps<00:01:54.270> i<00:01:54.510> thought<00:01:54.660> our<00:01:54.780> command<00:01:55.140> was<00:01:55.320> good<00:01:55.500> and
