those<00:03:35.819> waves<00:03:36.090> don't<00:03:36.359> really<00:03:36.659> suit<00:03:36.900> me<00:03:36.930> that

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
those waves don't really suit me that

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
result that I've never got through that

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.149 
result that I've never got through that
many<00:03:42.090> heeds<00:03:42.359> never<00:03:42.750> never<00:03:43.530> done<00:03:43.709> good<00:03:43.950> there

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
so I was like all right this is actually

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.679 
so I was like all right this is actually

gonna be fun those Peaks everywhere and
a<00:03:49.079> little<00:03:49.319> wedge<00:03:49.469> came<00:03:49.799> that<00:03:50.099> I<00:03:50.310> was<00:03:51.090> deepest

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
a little wedge came that I was deepest

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.050 
a little wedge came that I was deepest
for<00:03:51.719> it<00:03:51.810> i<00:03:51.870> could<00:03:51.930> have<00:03:52.109> got<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.500> i<00:03:52.560> was<00:03:52.680> like<00:03:52.769> a

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
for it i could have got and i was like a

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.179 
for it i could have got and i was like a
it's<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.120> small<00:03:54.420> one<00:03:54.599> I<00:03:54.870> let<00:03:55.260> Kelly<00:03:55.500> get<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:55.920> I

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
it's a small one I let Kelly get it I

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.339 
it's a small one I let Kelly get it I
should<00:03:56.609> have<00:03:56.730> got<00:03:56.849> it<00:03:57.030> he<00:03:57.780> saw<00:03:57.959> something<00:03:58.319> that

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
should have got it he saw something that

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.490 
should have got it he saw something that
I<00:03:58.469> didn't<00:03:58.859> in<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.489> wave<00:03:59.700> and<00:04:00.109> that<00:04:01.109> was<00:04:01.260> just

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
I didn't in that wave and that was just

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.890 
I didn't in that wave and that was just
that<00:04:02.069> was<00:04:02.129> it<00:04:02.489> I<00:04:02.730> think<00:04:03.359> what<00:04:03.510> happened<00:04:03.750> was<00:04:03.780> I

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
that was it I think what happened was I

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.899 
that was it I think what happened was I
got<00:04:03.930> that<00:04:04.200> 85<00:04:04.469> to<00:04:04.680> start<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.159> he<00:04:05.430> knew<00:04:05.639> he<00:04:05.819> had

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
got that 85 to start and he knew he had

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.670 
got that 85 to start and he knew he had
to<00:04:05.970> get<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.150> big<00:04:06.359> score<00:04:06.629> to<00:04:07.109> get<00:04:07.260> in<00:04:07.409> the<00:04:07.500> heat

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
to get a big score to get in the heat

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.309 
to get a big score to get in the heat
and<00:04:08.209> so<00:04:09.209> he<00:04:09.359> was<00:04:09.480> just<00:04:09.599> gonna<00:04:09.689> be<00:04:09.870> patient<00:04:10.049> and

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
and so he was just gonna be patient and

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.440 
and so he was just gonna be patient and
wait<00:04:10.379> for<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.680> good<00:04:11.159> big<00:04:11.340> one<00:04:11.519> he<00:04:12.090> couldn't<00:04:12.329> have

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
wait for a good big one he couldn't have

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.300 
wait for a good big one he couldn't have
gone<00:04:12.540> any<00:04:12.870> slower<00:04:13.230> that<00:04:13.500> final<00:04:13.889> I<00:04:14.540> was<00:04:15.540> just

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
gone any slower that final I was just

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.740 
gone any slower that final I was just
looking<00:04:17.310> around<00:04:17.430> everything<00:04:18.000> was<00:04:18.239> so<00:04:18.449> surreal

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
looking around everything was so surreal

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.060 
looking around everything was so surreal
just<00:04:19.489> look<00:04:20.489> at<00:04:20.579> all<00:04:20.759> these<00:04:20.910> people<00:04:21.180> watching

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
just look at all these people watching

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.450 
just look at all these people watching
and<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.160> can't<00:04:23.400> catch<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.729> wave<00:04:24.830> those<00:04:25.830> guys<00:04:26.160> on

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
and I can't catch a wave those guys on

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.980
