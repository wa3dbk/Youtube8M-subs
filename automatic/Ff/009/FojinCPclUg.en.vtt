00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
can get under the map so hopefully they

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.309

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
that'll help you stay a little bit more

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
little bit more useful you know because

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.119 
little bit more useful you know because
it<00:03:54.359> is<00:03:54.480> three<00:03:54.930> points<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.769> should<00:03:55.980> be<00:03:56.099> a

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
it is three points so it should be a

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.009 
it is three points so it should be a
little<00:03:56.280> bit<00:03:56.459> more<00:03:56.669> useful<00:03:56.819> so<00:03:57.239> moving<00:03:57.720> along

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
little bit more useful so moving along

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.930 
little bit more useful so moving along
now<00:03:58.260> they<00:03:58.440> also<00:03:58.590> fix<00:03:58.919> an<00:03:59.099> issue<00:03:59.250> we're

what<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:11.459> means<00:04:11.729> but<00:04:12.120> it's<00:04:12.299> fixed<00:04:12.629> so<00:04:12.780> that's

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
what that means but it's fixed so that's

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.680

signed into the Wii U you will be

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.740 
signed into the Wii U you will be
prompted<00:05:36.740> to<00:05:36.950> download<00:05:37.430> it<00:05:37.550> when<00:05:37.760> you<00:05:38.210> open<00:05:38.720> it

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
prompted to download it when you open it

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.010 
prompted to download it when you open it
up<00:05:38.870> ghost's<00:05:39.560> so<00:05:39.979> you<00:05:40.039> will<00:05:40.520> see<00:05:40.880> that<00:05:41.030> and<00:05:41.270> I'm

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
up ghost's so you will see that and I'm

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.170 
up ghost's so you will see that and I'm
not<00:05:42.050> 100%<00:05:42.650> sure<00:05:42.950> on<00:05:43.100> what's<00:05:43.610> going<00:05:43.910> on<00:05:43.970> with

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
not 100% sure on what's going on with

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.510 
not 100% sure on what's going on with
the<00:05:44.570> free<00:05:44.960> fall<00:05:45.169> map<00:05:45.410> I<00:05:45.620> think<00:05:45.860> you<00:05:46.250> will

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
the free fall map I think you will

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.540 
the free fall map I think you will
probably<00:05:46.550> have<00:05:47.150> to<00:05:47.390> download<00:05:47.600> it<00:05:47.810> because<00:05:48.550> it

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
probably have to download it because it

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.219 
probably have to download it because it
I<00:05:49.789> don't<00:05:49.970> think<00:05:50.150> it'll<00:05:50.389> separate<00:05:50.840> the<00:05:50.990> players

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
I don't think it'll separate the players

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:52.690 
I don't think it'll separate the players
who<00:05:51.530> don't<00:05:51.800> have<00:05:51.950> the<00:05:52.100> map<00:05:52.280> versus<00:05:52.669> the

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
who don't have the map versus the

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.490 
who don't have the map versus the
players<00:05:53.000> who<00:05:53.180> do<00:05:53.360> so<00:05:53.930> I'm<00:05:54.020> pretty<00:05:54.110> sure<00:05:54.229> you

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
players who do so I'm pretty sure you

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.040 
players who do so I'm pretty sure you
may<00:05:55.280> be<00:05:55.340> prompted<00:05:55.850> to<00:05:56.060> download<00:05:56.300> that<00:05:56.660> as<00:05:56.840> well

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
may be prompted to download that as well

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.659 
may be prompted to download that as well
but<00:05:57.260> I<00:05:57.289> could<00:05:57.530> be<00:05:57.680> I<00:05:57.889> could<00:05:58.130> be<00:05:58.160> wrong

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
but I could be I could be wrong

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.430 
but I could be I could be wrong
it<00:05:58.880> may<00:05:59.030> be<00:05:59.090> optional<00:05:59.389> like<00:05:59.900> I<00:05:59.990> said<00:06:00.169> I'll<00:06:00.289> have

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
it may be optional like I said I'll have

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.279 
it may be optional like I said I'll have
a<00:06:00.470> video<00:06:00.650> coming<00:06:01.039> up<00:06:01.250> about<00:06:01.370> that<00:06:02.020> I'm<00:06:03.020> really

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
a video coming up about that I'm really

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:04.930 
a video coming up about that I'm really
excited<00:06:03.440> about<00:06:03.740> that<00:06:04.070> it's<00:06:04.250> gonna<00:06:04.370> be<00:06:04.550> awesome

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
excited about that it's gonna be awesome

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.830 
excited about that it's gonna be awesome
and<00:06:05.770> this<00:06:06.770> gameplay<00:06:07.039> here<00:06:07.400> by<00:06:07.550> the<00:06:07.610> way<00:06:07.840> you

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
and this gameplay here by the way you

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.180 
and this gameplay here by the way you
can<00:06:08.990> see<00:06:09.110> my<00:06:09.200> teammates<00:06:09.560> didn't<00:06:09.860> really<00:06:10.070> help

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
can see my teammates didn't really help

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.150 
can see my teammates didn't really help
me<00:06:10.340> out<00:06:10.460> here<00:06:10.610> I<00:06:10.669> think<00:06:10.910> I<00:06:10.970> went<00:06:11.150> like<00:06:11.360> 35<00:06:12.110> or<00:06:12.500> 33

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
me out here I think I went like 35 or 33

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.469 
me out here I think I went like 35 or 33
and<00:06:13.280> 5<00:06:13.460> or<00:06:13.669> something<00:06:13.789> like<00:06:14.060> that<00:06:14.120> and<00:06:14.360> we

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
and 5 or something like that and we

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.540 
and 5 or something like that and we
still<00:06:14.750> lost<00:06:14.960> so<00:06:15.380> you<00:06:15.979> know<00:06:16.070> you'll<00:06:16.220> get<00:06:16.340> into

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
still lost so you know you'll get into

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.010
