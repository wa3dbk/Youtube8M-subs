like a mix of a mash-up of a lot of

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.560 
like a mix of a mash-up of a lot of
people<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.670> I've<00:01:35.759> met<00:01:35.790> throughout<00:01:36.210> my<00:01:36.390> life

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
people that I've met throughout my life

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.480 
people that I've met throughout my life
and<00:01:36.780> put<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.170> together<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.920> think<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
and put it together and I think the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.270 
and put it together and I think the
reason<00:01:38.820> why<00:01:38.939> it's<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.630> took<00:01:40.290> off<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.920> much<00:01:41.130> is

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
reason why it's it took off so much is

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.069 
reason why it's it took off so much is
because<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.880> relatable<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.570> people<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
because it is so relatable to people and

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.350 
because it is so relatable to people and
it<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.770> people<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.340> met<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.090> nail
