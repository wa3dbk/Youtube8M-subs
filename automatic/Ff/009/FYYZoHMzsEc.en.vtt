that<00:03:17.689> I<00:03:17.989> was<00:03:18.260> doing<00:03:18.560> there<00:03:18.709> was<00:03:18.739> a<00:03:18.829> regular

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
that I was doing there was a regular

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.399 
that I was doing there was a regular
that<00:03:19.579> was<00:03:19.730> leading<00:03:20.269> me<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.599> issues<00:03:20.959> of<00:03:20.989> steps

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
that was leading me to issues of steps

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.280 
that was leading me to issues of steps
four<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.829> five<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:22.579> he<00:03:22.760> gave<00:03:22.969> me<00:03:23.030> some

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
four and five and so he gave me some

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.420 
four and five and so he gave me some
simple<00:03:24.290> drills<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.680> tips<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:25.099> things<00:03:25.219> and

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
simple drills and tips and things and

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.740 
simple drills and tips and things and
I'm<00:03:25.519> obviously<00:03:25.790> gonna<00:03:26.090> have<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.359> put<00:03:26.510> a<00:03:26.540> lot<00:03:26.659> of

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
I'm obviously gonna have to put a lot of

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.170 
I'm obviously gonna have to put a lot of
practice<00:03:27.109> into<00:03:27.500> in<00:03:28.069> order<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.579> fix<00:03:28.969> some

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
practice into in order to fix some

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.879 
practice into in order to fix some
compensations<00:03:29.930> that<00:03:30.019> I<00:03:30.109> have<00:03:30.319> doing<00:03:30.590> this<00:03:30.620> way

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:30.889 
compensations that I have doing this way

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.920 
compensations that I have doing this way
he<00:03:31.519> was<00:03:31.700> struggling<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:32.299> trying<00:03:32.599> to<00:03:32.750> match<00:03:32.900> up

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
he was struggling and trying to match up

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.229 
he was struggling and trying to match up
key<00:03:33.319> for<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.950> sweet<00:03:34.159> spot<00:03:34.370> path<00:03:34.579> with<00:03:34.939> key

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
key for the sweet spot path with key

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.330 
key for the sweet spot path with key
five<00:03:35.450> just<00:03:36.290> clubface<00:03:36.590> control<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.189> make

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
five just clubface control and make

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.410 
five just clubface control and make
those<00:03:37.489> work<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:38.030> we<00:03:38.329> saw<00:03:38.599> with<00:03:38.840> him<00:03:39.079> he<00:03:40.040> just

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
those work and we saw with him he just

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.140 
those work and we saw with him he just
needed<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:42.159> declutter<00:03:43.159> some<00:03:43.579> things<00:03:43.819> on<00:03:44.030> his

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
needed to declutter some things on his

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.119 
needed to declutter some things on his
backswing<00:03:44.720> in<00:03:45.349> order<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.650> make<00:03:45.799> it<00:03:45.919> a<00:03:45.980> lot

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
backswing in order to make it a lot

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.699 
backswing in order to make it a lot
easier<00:03:46.370> to<00:03:46.730> get<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.359> club<00:03:47.569> back<00:03:47.780> down<00:03:48.109> without

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
easier to get the club back down without

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.009 
easier to get the club back down without
so<00:03:49.400> many<00:03:49.519> compensations<00:03:50.359> and<00:03:50.540> when<00:03:50.900> we

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
so many compensations and when we

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.929 
so many compensations and when we
changed<00:03:51.379> that<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:52.010> he<00:03:52.189> had<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.370> start<00:03:52.579> working

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:52.939 
changed that and he had to start working

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.550 
changed that and he had to start working
on<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:53.180> through<00:03:53.359> some<00:03:53.569> kind<00:03:53.870> of<00:03:53.959> half<00:03:54.169> swings

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
on it through some kind of half swings

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.170 
on it through some kind of half swings
and<00:03:54.709> then<00:03:54.799> three<00:03:54.980> quarter<00:03:55.280> swings<00:03:55.519> and<00:03:56.060> we

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
and then three quarter swings and we

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.550 
and then three quarter swings and we
changed<00:03:56.540> it<00:03:56.689> we<00:03:56.810> started<00:03:57.049> to<00:03:57.139> notice<00:03:57.290> right

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
changed it we started to notice right

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.369 
changed it we started to notice right
away<00:03:57.620> how<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:59.030> club<00:03:59.239> was<00:03:59.419> was<00:03:59.810> right<00:03:59.989> on<00:04:00.200> the

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
away how the club was was right on the

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:01.569 
away how the club was was right on the
plane<00:04:00.650> right<00:04:00.980> where<00:04:01.129> it<00:04:01.189> should<00:04:01.430> have<00:04:01.459> been

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
plane right where it should have been

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.159 
plane right where it should have been
and<00:04:01.969> then<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:02.209> was<00:04:02.299> able<00:04:02.450> to<00:04:02.540> come<00:04:02.750> right<00:04:02.989> back

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
and then it was able to come right back

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.319 
and then it was able to come right back
down<00:04:03.469> the<00:04:03.530> plane<00:04:03.889> very<00:04:04.129> nicely<00:04:04.340> I'm<00:04:04.879> excited

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
down the plane very nicely I'm excited

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.209 
down the plane very nicely I'm excited
to<00:04:05.450> get<00:04:05.629> the<00:04:05.750> DVD<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.260> show<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.560> my<00:04:06.769> girlfriend

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:07.219 
to get the DVD and show to my girlfriend

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:08.890 
to get the DVD and show to my girlfriend
and<00:04:07.340> friends<00:04:07.639> so<00:04:07.790> hopefully<00:04:08.120> they<00:04:08.299> can<00:04:08.480> learn

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
and friends so hopefully they can learn

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.140 
and friends so hopefully they can learn
a<00:04:08.989> little<00:04:09.200> bit<00:04:09.290> too<00:04:09.500> I<00:04:09.650> feel<00:04:10.010> right<00:04:10.579> now<00:04:10.790> I

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
a little bit too I feel right now I

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.479 
a little bit too I feel right now I
could<00:04:11.359> go<00:04:11.540> out<00:04:11.719> and<00:04:11.750> play<00:04:12.200> better<00:04:12.769> making

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
could go out and play better making

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.270 
could go out and play better making
better<00:04:13.849> ball<00:04:14.239> contact<00:04:14.840> it's<00:04:15.470> something<00:04:15.979> so

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
better ball contact it's something so

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.689 
better ball contact it's something so
simple<00:04:16.539> but<00:04:17.539> once<00:04:17.810> you<00:04:18.320> have<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.919> instruction

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
simple but once you have the instruction

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.969 
simple but once you have the instruction
and<00:04:19.970> it<00:04:20.180> gets<00:04:20.419> in<00:04:20.570> your<00:04:20.599> head<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.320> then<00:04:21.859> you

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
and it gets in your head and then you

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.010 
and it gets in your head and then you
practice<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.789> feel<00:04:23.030> of<00:04:23.060> it<00:04:23.389> you<00:04:23.659> certainly

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
practice the feel of it you certainly

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.100 
practice the feel of it you certainly
can<00:04:24.349> walk<00:04:24.560> out<00:04:24.770> on<00:04:24.979> the<00:04:25.070> golf<00:04:25.280> course<00:04:25.520> and

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
can walk out on the golf course and

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.500 
can walk out on the golf course and
transfer<00:04:27.110> that<00:04:27.440> knowledge<00:04:28.000> into<00:04:29.000> those<00:04:29.150> your

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
transfer that knowledge into those your

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.899 
transfer that knowledge into those your
swing<00:04:29.780> on<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.080> golf<00:04:30.260> course<00:04:30.789> most<00:04:31.789> of<00:04:31.849> the

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:31.909 
swing on the golf course most of the

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:33.100 
swing on the golf course most of the
instruction<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.360> I've<00:04:32.539> has<00:04:32.720> pretty

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
instruction that I've has pretty

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.620 
instruction that I've has pretty
intricate<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:33.770> difficult<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.490> then<00:04:35.449> just

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
intricate and difficult and then just

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.469 
intricate and difficult and then just
understanding<00:04:36.199> that<00:04:36.260> that<00:04:37.039> all<00:04:37.370> good<00:04:38.060> golfers

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
understanding that that all good golfers

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.570 
understanding that that all good golfers
do<00:04:38.780> essentially<00:04:39.349> the<00:04:39.530> same<00:04:39.710> five<00:04:39.919> things<00:04:40.280> it's

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
do essentially the same five things it's

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.850 
do essentially the same five things it's
just<00:04:40.789> really<00:04:41.000> simple<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.599> kind<00:04:41.750> of<00:04:41.900> focus<00:04:42.680> on

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
just really simple to kind of focus on

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.589 
just really simple to kind of focus on
on<00:04:43.159> getting<00:04:43.460> those<00:04:43.520> five<00:04:43.759> things<00:04:44.000> right<00:04:44.270> so

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
on getting those five things right so

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.779 
on getting those five things right so
it's<00:04:45.020> just<00:04:45.139> a<00:04:45.500> lot<00:04:45.800> of<00:04:45.860> simply<00:04:46.220> it's<00:04:46.580> very

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
it's just a lot of simply it's very

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.089 
it's just a lot of simply it's very
important<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.360> us<00:04:47.449> to<00:04:47.599> not<00:04:47.780> only<00:04:47.960> explain<00:04:48.349> just

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
important to us to not only explain just

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.550 
important to us to not only explain just
what<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.669> five<00:04:49.880> simple<00:04:50.180> keys<00:04:50.389> are<00:04:50.630> but<00:04:51.409> we

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
what the five simple keys are but we

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.070 
what the five simple keys are but we
give<00:04:52.009> a<00:04:52.039> roadmap<00:04:52.490> for<00:04:52.789> how<00:04:52.820> to<00:04:53.060> achieve<00:04:53.570> and

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
give a roadmap for how to achieve and

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.649 
give a roadmap for how to achieve and
attain<00:04:54.280> each<00:04:55.280> of<00:04:55.520> these<00:04:55.610> motions<00:04:55.940> each<00:04:56.509> of

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
attain each of these motions each of
