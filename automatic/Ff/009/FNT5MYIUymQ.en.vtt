00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.960
 i 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.180
 this time we will explain how 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.299
 be able to remotely control the iphone 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.880
 ipad or ipod touch on the computer a 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.150
 via usb in this case windows 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.000
 we need to have done jailbreak and three 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.730
 programs the first one installs from 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.119
 cydia so we have to enter 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.829
 within cydia we look for a program that 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.789
 it's called vinci 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.820
 and I won and install it once I'm 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:39.820
 installed 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.740
 we have to download two programs that 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.630
 is called 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:53.570
 oh zumbox and ultra vnc bieber that you 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.870
 I will leave the links in the forum and also 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.340
 the climb to the forum section 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.560
 downloads if they ever fail 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.980
 official links once we have 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.810
 We installed the program we go vinci 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.890
 to the menu 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.170
 we go into adjustments 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.500
 in this section in the block of the 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.260
 left we enter in vinci and we write 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.229
 a four-digit password for 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.600
 example we have to have enable the 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.350
 program you can check or uncheck if 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.180
 you want a cursor once this is done 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.180
 we open iphone box 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.799
 we wait for him to load 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.270
 and on the left we select usb tunnel 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.400
 we wait for him to load 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.330
 this section 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.600
 that we need vnc and we minimize them 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.130
 we are not going to use it for the moment 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.830
 in the background because the same 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.490
 program that we are going to use so that 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.450
 you see what you need it would be ultra vnc 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.280
 view see here it loads automatically and 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.280
 if we do not write it we write 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.140
 this number 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.480
 and press connect when connecting as 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.860
 we have password asks us the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.160
 password we write it and press the 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.240
 home 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.240
 and we have it
