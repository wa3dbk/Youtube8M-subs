00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello friends once more with you in 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:10.130
 this opportunity 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.130
 and I welcome you 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.730
 from my channel as it is 2013 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.150
 today we are going to reset 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:24.970
 and we are going to learn today with this 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:28.660
 modelson samson 3300 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.030
 and for that first 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.490
 we are going to 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:39.470
 learn the retro cellular 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:42.710
 and we're going to learn how to reset 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.910
 important reset inside cellular because 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.930
 sometimes we have many applications 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:51.400
 open and that makes it so slow and 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.570
 also be 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.250
 it wears a lot of energy and therefore 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.490
 that is the reason why sometimes 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.630
 have a lot of good consumption we have already 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.460
 on cellular today we are going to reset what 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:12.870
 we learn first and then we enter 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.870
 menu and within the menu we will search 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.250
 Applications 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.939
 no application we are not going to enter we are going to 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.939
 get in 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.030
 to restore 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.350
 to reestablish 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.040
 and within that we press reset and 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.430
 we have values and adjustments 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.580
 and we are going to want 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:46.870
 reset the values ​​or reset the 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.900
 the adjustments if we tighten adjustments we're going to 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:53.140
 eliminate all information and 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:57.550
 configuration that we have had before and 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:02.020
 if we do not do it then we're going to 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:05.430
 only reset what you want 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.100
 say then if we press here values 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.760
 let's reset the screen profiles 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.780
 phone but if we do everything in general 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.690
 Well, let's go 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.920
 to reset everything and everything will be erased 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.950
 that we have had previously 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.600
 configured very well then we are going to 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.110
 remove if we do it then everything 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.740
 and we want to prescribe the whole machine to 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.450
 let it become as we see how we have 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:39.379
 purchased or as has come from 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.560
 from the factory and for that we're going to put 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:45.849
 a key because it asks for a key says 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:50.590
 what key asks us in some cell phones 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:54.209
 has every key 1234 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:03:00.250
 and let's see if it is said not then 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:02.580
 some have 1 2 3 4 5 and we also 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.580
 He says 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:10.690
 does not say no then what key will be 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:13.989
 let's press 0 0 4 zeros and let's 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.319
 see what it tells us to reset there 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.959
 we are restoring the cell phone 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:24.700
 its normal state or how it has come from 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:28.239
 factory establishment complete the 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.030
 phone is going to restart then 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:35.349
 We waited a few seconds for 1 minute 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.990
 and we will wait for it to restart in the 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.090
 phone 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:43.350
 there we see that it is restarting be 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.510
 again it has already been reset 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.409
 totally the team 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.950
 there we see then as I tell you friends 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:56.079
 it's important to reset because we're going to 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.750
 return it to normal with more 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:03.519
 whistling as we bought it there and 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:07.989
 It is normal as we have already bought it 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:10.810
 it's more more soft folders nothing more and 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:14.650

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.289
 suitcases is sensitive and we can already 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.820
