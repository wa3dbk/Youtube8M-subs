I<00:00:38.520> found<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.090> portal<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.719> think<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.469> leads

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
I found the portal I think it leads

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.619 
I found the portal I think it leads
there<00:00:40.950> where<00:00:41.040> everyone<00:00:41.399> else<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:43.789> it's<00:00:44.789> not

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
there where everyone else is it's not

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.700 
there where everyone else is it's not
that<00:00:45.690> simple

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that simple

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.680 
that simple
what<00:00:47.070> do<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.340> mean<00:00:47.489> eat<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.300> long<00:00:48.450> ways<00:00:48.660> down

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
what do you mean eat the long ways down

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.049 
what do you mean eat the long ways down
if<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.739> miss<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.100> portal<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.579> won't<00:00:50.760> be<00:00:50.940> able

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
if you miss the portal you won't be able

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.959 
if you miss the portal you won't be able
to<00:00:51.239> get<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.480> back<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:51.629> um<00:00:52.350> what<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.730> don't

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
to get it back up um what you don't

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.939 
to get it back up um what you don't
think<00:00:54.030> II<00:00:54.239> did<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.809> shot<00:00:55.320> one<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.500> my<00:00:55.590> pillows

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
think II did I shot one of my pillows

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.770 
think II did I shot one of my pillows
down<00:00:56.250> there<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.670> kept<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:56.940> falling<00:00:57.360> and

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
down there and it kept on falling and

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.119 
down there and it kept on falling and
falling<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.829> falling<00:00:59.370> all<00:01:00.000> right<00:01:00.300> we<00:01:00.449> get<00:01:00.690> it

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
falling and falling all right we get it

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.270 
falling and falling all right we get it
so<00:01:02.129> if<00:01:02.340> we<00:01:02.520> go<00:01:02.789> we<00:01:03.690> may<00:01:04.110> not<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.350> able<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.979> return

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
so if we go we may not be able to return

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.030 
so if we go we may not be able to return
maybe<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.659> depends<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.290> how<00:01:07.439> fast<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.830> use

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
maybe it depends on how fast you use

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.340 
maybe it depends on how fast you use
your<00:01:08.220> up<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.760> out<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> portal<00:01:09.750> if<00:01:10.049> you

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
your up be out of the portal if you

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.330 
your up be out of the portal if you
don't<00:01:10.619> use<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.890> fast<00:01:11.369> enough

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
don't use it fast enough

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.830 
don't use it fast enough
that's<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.670> spirit<00:01:15.000> let's<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.720> goal<00:01:19.369> no<00:01:20.369> I

there's no guarantee that this is the

there's no guarantee that this is the
same<00:02:01.920> abort<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:03.000> could<00:02:03.179> lead<00:02:03.330> us<00:02:03.360> somewhere

the key to pandemonium right is that

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.820 
the key to pandemonium right is that
exactly<00:02:38.180> it's<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.720> place<00:02:39.020> where<00:02:39.050> rejected

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
exactly it's a place where rejected

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.620 
exactly it's a place where rejected
characters<00:02:40.310> wait<00:02:40.550> for<00:02:40.760> their<00:02:40.880> chance<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.360> come

characters wait for their chance to come

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.550 
characters wait for their chance to come
to<00:02:41.780> smash<00:02:42.280> huh<00:02:43.340> what<00:02:44.080> every<00:02:45.080> character<00:02:45.530> that

to smash huh what every character that
you<00:02:45.770> know<00:02:45.980> now<00:02:46.220> was<00:02:46.730> once<00:02:47.000> an<00:02:47.150> inhabitant<00:02:47.690> of

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
you know now was once an inhabitant of

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.560 
you know now was once an inhabitant of
pandemonium<00:02:48.370> when<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.400> system<00:02:49.880> crashes<00:02:50.180> in<00:02:50.480> a

pandemonium when a system crashes in a

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.240 
pandemonium when a system crashes in a
new<00:02:50.690> smash<00:02:51.020> is<00:02:51.260> made<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.860> gates<00:02:52.070> of

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
new smash is made the gates of

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.520 
new smash is made the gates of
pandemonium<00:02:52.610> open<00:02:53.300> up<00:02:53.420> for<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.690> short<00:02:53.930> time<00:02:54.140> and

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
pandemonium open up for a short time and

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.560 
pandemonium open up for a short time and
a<00:02:54.710> select<00:02:55.070> few<00:02:55.160> characters<00:02:55.790> are<00:02:55.970> let<00:02:56.180> into<00:02:56.480> the

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
a select few characters are let into the

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.440 
a select few characters are let into the
world<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.960> smash

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.330 

so<00:03:02.170> everyone<00:03:02.560> was<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.709> part<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.130> at<00:03:03.220> one

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
so everyone was a part of it at one

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.600 
so everyone was a part of it at one
point<00:03:03.550> yes<00:03:04.270> wait<00:03:05.260> if<00:03:05.770> we<00:03:06.040> were<00:03:06.130> all<00:03:06.250> there<00:03:06.459> at

course<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:07.110> gate<00:04:07.380> at<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.650> right<00:04:07.890> time<00:04:08.310> you

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
course the gate at the right time you

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.540 
course the gate at the right time you
can<00:04:08.880> gain<00:04:09.300> limitless<00:04:09.660> powers<00:04:10.440> so<00:04:11.100> why<00:04:11.280> do<00:04:11.340> they

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
can gain limitless powers so why do they

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.370 
can gain limitless powers so why do they
steal<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:11.970> star<00:04:12.270> if<00:04:12.480> they<00:04:12.660> just<00:04:12.840> need<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.140> key

steal the star if they just need the key

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.130 
steal the star if they just need the key
because<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.910> key<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:15.450> gate<00:04:15.630> are<00:04:15.840> in<00:04:15.960> two

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
because the key and the gate are in two

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.050 
because the key and the gate are in two
