00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello youtube people today we are going to 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.510
 learn how to make a study of 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.410
 Photograph completely homemade and 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.550
 very economical spending just 50 euros 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.860
 one of the first things we have 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.750
 what to do is try to get the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.869
 pvc tubes we will approach the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.550
 hardware store or leroy merlin store and 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.200
 see tubes that prowl the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.970
 diameter of 5 centimeters 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.520
 and that more or less is done by eye you go 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.540
 seeing if it's stiff enough to 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.540
 hold the fabric or not 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.540
 that can come out roughly for a few 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.540
 20 euros 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.540
 here in the picture we can see my 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.540
 tubes of 5 centimeters in diameter 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.750
 the next step would be to get the 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.750
 cloth 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.210
 normally this kind of them the 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.000
 they sell on roll 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.329
 to approximately 78 euros in the metro 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.920
 no more expensive 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.879
 and here in the photo you can see that I 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.460
 I bought about three meters of fabric 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.259
 the fabric and the tubes have to be cut 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.899
 according to the desired measures 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.930
 depending on where you want 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.579
 place the study in this case I used 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.409
 the maximum width of the fabric that I 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.479
 sold in the store 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.520
 in my case I did a double to the web 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.189
 by the edges to make it more 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.310
 resistant and does not fray but that 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.770
 already to taste of each one 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.210
 from above he did a double so that 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.670
 there will be a hole inside to be able to 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.280
 pass the tube but also if not 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.909
 you want to use ctera and you want to buy a 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.380
 professional paper vinyl material 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.409
 will also simply split the tube 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.899
 and paper and inside tube 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.899
 pvc outside pvc tube forgiveness 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.960
 Then I bought some rings that 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.930
 They sell in any Chinese for 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.690
 place them on the cloth 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.100
 and to be able to grab them with rubber bands 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.270
 that the fabric was perfectly 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.149
 stretched as you can see in the photo 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.759
 on the side poles of the study with 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.220
 flanges tie one a few light bulbs 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.230
 to make the hair light the light that 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.930
 comes to bring the model that gives you a 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.930
 Aura effect around the hair 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.800
 the blue filter is because the light bulbs 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.900
 they are yellow that are cheaper and the 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.940
 yellow plus blue equals white 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.069
 then it gives a white light still being 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.200
 yellow light bulbs although if you put them 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.670
 very close the filter finishes burning like this 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.550
 that with that you have to be careful or if 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.030
 can you afford to buy light bulbs 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.250
 white that are the low consumption 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.620
 for lighting use two spotlights 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.720
 garden that was there old was 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.220
 place a blue filter and it's worth not worth 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.010
 very good for the model because it was a 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:55.430
 light very punctual but yes to illuminate the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.530
 background or illuminate through the fabric 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.269
 for the lighting of the model I opened 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.549
 that a bulb with a Chinese salad bowl 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.260
 and four light bulbs but we'll see that 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.780
 in the next tutorial 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.330
 below here you can see some 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.280
 how many photos I have made in my studio 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.650
 in the next tutorial we will see how 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.819
 make a bulb with a salad bowl 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.680
 four light bulbs 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.510
 and we will also see how a manufactured 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.840
 reflector everything in an economical way and 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.840
 homemade
