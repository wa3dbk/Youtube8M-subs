you<00:02:22.200> can<00:02:22.350> watch<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.620> video<00:02:22.740> on<00:02:22.920> how<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.460> that

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
you can watch a video on how to do that

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.600 
you can watch a video on how to do that
here<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:25.490> you<00:02:26.490> just<00:02:26.700> twist<00:02:27.030> one<00:02:27.300> two<00:02:27.630> three

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.930 

let<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.190> knock<00:02:44.310> ties<00:02:44.550> smoothly

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
let it so that the knock ties smoothly

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.000 
let it so that the knock ties smoothly
you<00:02:46.250> pull<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.370> tight<00:02:48.560> now<00:02:49.560> you're<00:02:49.680> gonna<00:02:49.770> have

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
you pull it tight now you're gonna have

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.140 
you pull it tight now you're gonna have
some<00:02:50.280> excess<00:02:50.930> on<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.230> fishing<00:02:52.790> not<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:54.030> you

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
have handy to do so so now basically

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.090 
have handy to do so so now basically
this<00:03:03.330> is<00:03:03.450> what<00:03:03.600> you<00:03:03.720> have<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.680> get<00:03:04.890> your

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
this is what you have you get your

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.020 
this is what you have you get your
weight<00:03:05.270> your<00:03:06.270> bead<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:07.350> your<00:03:07.560> swivel<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:09.780> the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
weight your bead and your swivel the the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.870 
weight your bead and your swivel the the
the<00:03:12.030> bead<00:03:12.240> protects<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.959> not<00:03:13.170> on<00:03:13.830> your<00:03:14.459> swivel

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
so that the weight doesn't fray or not

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.940 
so that the weight doesn't fray or not
and<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.630> lose<00:03:18.870> whatever<00:03:19.260> fish<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.709> catch

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.400 
and you lose whatever fish you catch
later<00:03:20.160> because<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.820> weight<00:03:21.030> will<00:03:21.410> snap

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
later because the weight will snap

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.140 
later because the weight will snap
you're<00:03:22.590> not<00:03:22.739> eventually<00:03:23.280> if<00:03:23.520> you<00:03:23.670> don't<00:03:23.910> have

an old roll sinker no roll sinkers or
just<00:05:51.050> like<00:05:51.230> this<00:05:51.440> they're<00:05:51.680> a<00:05:51.710> sliding<00:05:52.250> sinker

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
just like this they're a sliding sinker

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
that go right over your fishing line but

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.280 
that go right over your fishing line but
they're<00:05:55.220> flat<00:05:55.520> and<00:05:56.330> when<00:05:56.510> you<00:05:56.630> cast<00:05:56.870> out<00:05:57.110> and

they're flat and when you cast out and
they<00:05:57.410> hit<00:05:57.650> the<00:05:57.680> bottom

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
they hit the bottom

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.820 
they hit the bottom
they'll<00:05:58.970> stay<00:05:59.390> right<00:05:59.780> wherever<00:06:00.080> you<00:06:00.470> put<00:06:00.680> them

that<00:06:01.010> way<00:06:01.130> the<00:06:01.610> rivers<00:06:01.970> not<00:06:02.090> taking<00:06:02.480> the

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
that way the rivers not taking the

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.140 
that way the rivers not taking the
current<00:06:03.280> taking<00:06:04.280> your<00:06:04.400> weight<00:06:04.550> down<00:06:04.760> with<00:06:05.030> the

current taking your weight down with the

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.320 
current taking your weight down with the
currents<00:06:05.680> so<00:06:06.680> these<00:06:06.860> aren't<00:06:07.160> particles<00:06:08.120> to

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
currents so these aren't particles to

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.780 
currents so these aren't particles to
use<00:06:08.570> for<00:06:08.930> rivers<00:06:09.350> these<00:06:09.980> work<00:06:10.220> great<00:06:10.520> and

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
use for rivers these work great and

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.780 
use for rivers these work great and

a lot of undercurrent in lengths you can

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.310 
a lot of undercurrent in lengths you can
just<00:06:16.700> cast<00:06:16.910> out<00:06:17.210> plop<00:06:17.510> it<00:06:17.690> down<00:06:17.720> and<00:06:18.169> the

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
just cast out plop it down and the

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.990 
just cast out plop it down and the
current<00:06:18.650> won't<00:06:18.830> drag<00:06:19.130> your<00:06:19.370> line<00:06:19.550> everywhere
