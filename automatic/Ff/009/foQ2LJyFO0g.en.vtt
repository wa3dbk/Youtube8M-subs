00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:08.000
 hi girls in this video i want 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.000
 show you the attached processing 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.780
 here we begin immediately to explain that 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.179
 what is the garter link in the first video 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.000
 I had taught myself to do the right on 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.760
 reverse and also the clio in this case 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.210
 we will use the right shirt what i am 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.150
 he taught and we work practically 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.429
 all the irons yes and it went even of 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.250
 return way means doing everything a 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.280
 iron then turn the work around and make one 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.340
 other then that would be back e 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:49.530
 the back of the job would all be 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:52.050
 adhered we try also because I would like 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.199
 make you understand a garter st 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.949
 what kind of fantasy comes from doing it 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.949
 working it 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:27.320
 also the last point made right 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:30.340
 let's do another round always right 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.690
 if in an explanation you find precisely 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.640
 knit and 5 knitted garter st 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:41.290
 it means this is practically worth 5 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.290
 irons all joined 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.970
 let's do another one 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.760
 here now I will show you near by 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.690
 here's practically this would be the 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.300
 garter shirt 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.520
 what sets it apart we say from 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:05.770
 another point that practically is 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:10.890
 front that behind remains with question 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:17.250
 of in facts if you also see behind 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:19.870
 all good this is the down shirt 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.020
 here I hope that this video will also 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.930
 the next one may have been useful 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.060
 video I will show you the stockinette stitch e 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.360
 even the bathroom will explain what 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.880
 alive and what is this for the 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.450
 moment all and hello
