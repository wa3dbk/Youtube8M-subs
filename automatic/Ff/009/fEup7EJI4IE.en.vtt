and that says mode two over here so you
can<00:02:19.640> fly<00:02:19.850> in<00:02:19.910> mode<00:02:20.090> 1<00:02:20.270> mode<00:02:20.300> 2<00:02:28.330> LEDs<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.970> LEDs

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
can fly in mode 1 mode 2 LEDs the LEDs

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.000 
can fly in mode 1 mode 2 LEDs the LEDs
are<00:02:35.450> really<00:02:35.870> nice<00:02:36.050> they<00:02:36.350> can<00:02:36.530> be<00:02:36.680> seen<00:02:36.950> from

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
are really nice they can be seen from

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.300 
are really nice they can be seen from
underneath<00:02:37.700> really<00:02:37.940> well<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.900> side<00:02:39.200> on<00:02:40.190> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
underneath really well the side on the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.400 
underneath really well the side on the
top<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:41.030> also<00:02:41.330> these<00:02:41.450> red<00:02:41.690> blades<00:02:41.990> are<00:02:42.260> nice

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
top and also these red blades are nice

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.320 
top and also these red blades are nice
and<00:02:42.650> easy<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:43.010> see<00:02:43.220> they<00:02:43.670> distinguish<00:02:44.150> for

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
and easy to see they distinguish for

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.810 
and easy to see they distinguish for
your<00:02:44.420> orientation<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:46.160> just<00:02:46.370> flies<00:02:46.550> really

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
your orientation it just flies really

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.630 
your orientation it just flies really
well<00:02:47.000> it's<00:02:47.450> 2.4<00:02:48.110> gigahertz<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:48.680> has<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.860> 6<00:02:49.250> axis

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
well it's 2.4 gigahertz it has a 6 axis

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.260 
well it's 2.4 gigahertz it has a 6 axis
gyro<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:51.650> was<00:02:51.860> $30<00:02:52.490> on<00:02:52.640> Tmart

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
gyro it was $30 on Tmart

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.270 
gyro it was $30 on Tmart
so<00:02:53.870> it's<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.170> good<00:02:54.350> price<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.830> got<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.040> my<00:02:55.130> house

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
so it's a good price it got to my house

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.470 
so it's a good price it got to my house
in<00:02:55.459> 4<00:02:55.670> days<00:02:55.870> those<00:02:56.870> good<00:02:57.110> shipping<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:58.480> just

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
in 4 days those good shipping and just

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.570 
in 4 days those good shipping and just
flies<00:02:59.720> really<00:03:00.140> nice<00:03:00.350> it<00:03:01.130> doesn't<00:03:01.310> have<00:03:01.550> a

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
flies really nice it doesn't have a

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.949 
flies really nice it doesn't have a
whole<00:03:01.820> lot<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.090> power<00:03:02.330> so<00:03:02.660> when<00:03:02.780> you're<00:03:02.870> doing

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
whole lot of power so when you're doing

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.780 
whole lot of power so when you're doing
fast<00:03:03.380> maneuvers<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.190> can't<00:03:04.400> really<00:03:04.550> go<00:03:04.730> as

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
fast maneuvers you can't really go as

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.280 
fast maneuvers you can't really go as
fast<00:03:04.970> as<00:03:05.180> you<00:03:05.239> want<00:03:05.480> cuz<00:03:05.780> you<00:03:05.840> don't<00:03:05.959> dip<00:03:06.110> into

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
fast as you want cuz you don't dip into

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.199 
fast as you want cuz you don't dip into
the<00:03:06.440> ground<00:03:06.680> but<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.489> still<00:03:07.700> handles<00:03:08.030> really

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
the ground but it still handles really

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.000 
the ground but it still handles really
well<00:03:08.360> it's<00:03:09.110> definitely<00:03:09.350> one<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:09.560> my<00:03:09.620> favourite

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
well it's definitely one of my favourite

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.130 
well it's definitely one of my favourite
fliers<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.670> it's<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.540> really<00:03:11.720> good<00:03:11.959> night

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.520 

see<00:04:03.000> those<00:04:03.150> LEDs<00:04:03.630> are<00:04:03.840> really<00:04:04.080> nice<00:04:04.290> and

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
see those LEDs are really nice and

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
see those LEDs are really nice and
bright<00:04:07.790> there's<00:04:08.790> 80%<00:04:09.390> y'all<00:04:10.100> it's<00:04:11.100> a<00:04:11.280> little

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
bright there's 80% y'all it's a little

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.070 
bright there's 80% y'all it's a little
bit<00:04:11.700> on<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.910> slow<00:04:12.060> side<00:04:12.360> but<00:04:12.570> it's<00:04:12.720> still<00:04:12.900> real

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
bit on the slow side but it's still real

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.080 
bit on the slow side but it's still real
it's<00:04:13.290> still<00:04:13.530> pretty<00:04:13.770> decent<00:04:13.950> into<00:04:14.610> sliding

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
it's still pretty decent into sliding

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.650 
it's still pretty decent into sliding
movements<00:04:17.299> baby<00:04:18.299> percent<00:04:20.209> here<00:04:21.209> is<00:04:21.330> I'll<00:04:21.540> do

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
movements baby percent here is I'll do

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.910 
movements baby percent here is I'll do
some<00:04:21.840> flips<00:04:22.080> now<00:04:22.260> 100<00:04:25.670> loops<00:04:27.590> it's<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.680> little

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
some flips now 100 loops it's a little

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.830 
some flips now 100 loops it's a little
bit<00:04:29.070> hard<00:04:29.310> since<00:04:29.640> it<00:04:29.790> does<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.000> flip<00:04:30.330> as<00:04:30.540> soon<00:04:30.720> as

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
bit hard since it does a flip as soon as

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.260 
bit hard since it does a flip as soon as
you<00:04:30.960> give<00:04:31.140> right<00:04:31.350> input<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:32.760> can't<00:04:33.060> really

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
you give right input you can't really

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:43.260 
you give right input you can't really
use<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.540> right<00:04:33.720> stick<00:04:38.810> back<00:04:39.810> in<00:04:39.960> 280

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.600 

okay<00:05:04.500> I'll<00:05:04.620> bump<00:05:04.800> it<00:05:04.950> off<00:05:05.070> few<00:05:05.250> things<00:05:05.460> at<00:05:05.580> the

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
okay I'll bump it off few things at the

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:15.810 
okay I'll bump it off few things at the
top<00:05:05.700> guard<00:05:09.140> you<00:05:10.140> see<00:05:10.350> it<00:05:10.440> works<00:05:10.620> pretty<00:05:10.800> good

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.430 

I<00:05:15.850> don't<00:05:16.750> know<00:05:16.810> if<00:05:16.930> you<00:05:17.020> didn't<00:05:17.200> keep<00:05:17.320> it

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
I don't know if you didn't keep it

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.250 
I don't know if you didn't keep it
stealing<00:05:17.650> or<00:05:17.830> not<00:05:17.950> but<00:05:18.780> it<00:05:19.780> does<00:05:19.960> pretty

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
stealing or not but it does pretty

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:36.790 
stealing or not but it does pretty
actually<00:05:20.470> at<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:20.920> ceiling<00:05:21.250> also

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.089 

there's<00:05:37.729> 20%<00:05:38.090> y'all<00:05:38.629> that's<00:05:39.470> full<00:05:39.830> yah<00:05:40.039> right

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
there's 20% y'all that's full yah right
