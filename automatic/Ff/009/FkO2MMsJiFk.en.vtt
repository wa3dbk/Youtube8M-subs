00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 passed candidate in the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.700
 best mobile isolate of the country 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.380
 the fbi vehicle response team the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.500
 selection continues and the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.509
 requirements are daily harder 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.600
 The garage will find your equipment 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.820
 just adapted for you and only to 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.730
 Definitely a job to do 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.740
 once and for all the American 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.320
 Taxpayer invests millions of dollars 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.990
 in you we want that money 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.399
 worth 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.050
 We show you how we are the things 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.559
 regulates raase against cops that is the 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.210
 background story if you like 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.149
 may draw the new need for speed 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.620
 the words we have the pc version here 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.559
 and show you how it is 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.910
 to play head for me sees it now 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.610
 quite interesting I have yes 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.980
 just a little more the racer played the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.170
 spain hot pursuit in it what am I doing 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.180
 then again, that's exactly where I am as a cop 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.309
 go and try in this case 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.200
 to bring five lorries to the track 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.990
 with skillful maneuvers and with 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:14.939
 pursuit stack actions that are nail 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.700
 tapes or programs or apps I 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.360
 there on the razer use that with the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.939
 so that can pull out of the traffic 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.369
 Here you can see the selection of the car 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.350
 Of course these have different values 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.150
 You can different kinds of 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.360
 Build a tracking stack in these cars 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.090
 and as a head you get the cars 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.049
 but you have to be incredibly expensive 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:43.229
 for these technological gimmicks 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:46.079
 gifts cars I would have liked in 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.909
 racer part then you really have to do this 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.150
 spend speed points and here 's 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.340
 The speed points just for this 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.110
 Tech stories from here you can see 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.050
 how it works is easy 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.700
 a chase of the raser me 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.960
 over and I use both of my 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.280
 tech stories and zack it was from the 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.790
 traffic drawn I get the points 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.160
 that's definitely very nice for it 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.750
 also how high flown yes the fly 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.340
 always very spectacular from and when 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.860
 then you just call it 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.610
 arrested that want to access under three 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.860
 we are simply destroyed 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.930
 Here is in the end itself synonymous one 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.850
 typical race just that just me there 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.290
 do not try the others out of the 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.880
 to draw traffic to arrest her 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.850
 but trying to win the race 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.880
 I can do that by doing better or better 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.230
 just use the same means as the 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.620
 Police only have a little bit 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.140
 favorable for that I have to give my car 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.590
 There are also 20 different 2000 buy 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.980
 Visions 20 cars and I have the cars 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.070
 also 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.220
 June that was not done as a cop 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.050
 yes, yes, I think that that 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.790
 play as it looks and works so 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.709
 also the the whole text and gadget 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.920
 These can be used as a racer 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.989
 policeman that looks in the engine 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.910
 really very nice and very crispy 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.230
 also the speed feeling is very good 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.930
 available as you can here for example 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.660
 good both the game only with 30 frames 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.840
 What he really likes to do 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.940
 Critic of the technician is but 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.010
 walk very well 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.360
 the effects are also quite good from us 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.190
 have we already times the playstation 3 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.220
 Variant work viewed and looks 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:29.630
 not that good by far 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.760
 as have the racers side and there too 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.780
 There are cars to choose from that must like 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.610
 We said and after that if you buy 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.709
 a car has bought then you can 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.780
 For example, you first have your own 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.570
 wish to adjust color change 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.410
 then you can still find the rims 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.100
 to adjust 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.600
 times may be different 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.080
 stickers on the car on it 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.840
 etc 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.370
 There you will always be new again 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.200
 if you can unlock new cars free 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.819
 you also practically new 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.060
 still with coatings unlock 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.830
 but actually as other components 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.970
 Now you can do it as it is, for example 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.790
 earlier part no longer 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.090
 this is really just a pure upgrade 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.489
 for the paint or stop in for the 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.319
 optical and not somehow new 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.750
 Shock absorbers or something like that does not exist 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.609
 more of what they have deleted 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.300
 the hot curves at least away from 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.940
 The streets were in the still that 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.960
 but was quite discreetly ridiculous 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.970
 I also something very important 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.220
 is less that the thing visually 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.720
 looks pretty for me at least 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.780
 The performance upgrade is also the must 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.430
 I buy and for that too I have to speed 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.340
 Spend a price and this is how I get 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.380
 of course, where I do missions 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.570
 and if possible when I have the mission 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.220
 then done in my again 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.270
 return because you have to 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.200
 I also really take it to the dry 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.000
 bring the points 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.110
 because if you are from the police 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.110
 then they are all gone 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.910
 and then you lose another 100,000 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.530
 Speed bounce theme in the vehicle upgrades 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.500
 can invest the course a 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:09.229
 village yes that you do something like that, of course 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.960
 particularly hurt though with this with a 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.820
 tuned car and that's a whole 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.770
 typical time trial mission so what 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.740
 The same is true of police officers 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.900
 side there it is a quick one 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.940
 response or almost team mission and 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.710
 because you have to make sure that you just 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.810
 as little as possible 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.790
 Public property is destroyed here as 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.380
 You just have to race racer so fast 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.300
 how it is somehow come to the goal 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.910
 how was it ? 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.770
 already have appell upgrades 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.840
 Vehicle upgrades, it really is very 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.980
 noticeably that's okay i have 1 now 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.900
 on acceleration and does not realize that 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.970
 the box now properly deducted or 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.100
 Airbus has in comparison with others 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.660
 cars about singing so there are the 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.460
 then you realize the biggest differences 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.920
 hold when you say i have a car 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.380
 that has a value of 2.0 more 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.370
 speed then you notice it all 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.660
 very clear that parts is indeed 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.480
 technically quite well but it is 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.950
 synonymous not quite perfect so the pc 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.900
 version looks the best 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.250
 she works best, too 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.900
 laughed at 30 frames 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.870
 but here you are not completely immune 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.840
 had before fused driving errors 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.550
 some connection problems for that 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.340
 that I have already often to 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.750
 Example had to fly and yes, like us 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.890
 we fly hundreds of meters because you 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.120
 somewhere on the landmark on it 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.870
 So, that's what happened 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:29.510
 Of course, still must be final 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.750
 you never say speedo is everything 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:35.180
 better than the predecessor has a few 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.320
 small design bugs and it has technical 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.810
 not quite up 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.560
 despite frost at 3 engine but it still 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.560
 a good game
