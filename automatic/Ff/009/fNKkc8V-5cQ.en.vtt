00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.979
 hello friends how are you in this video 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:08.650
 to show wii version 10 041 of 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:10.660
 windows 10 the first thing we see is a 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.510
 redesign originally from the bar 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.880
 tasks and from the start panel that now 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.830
 it has a slight transparency if it 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.289
 we make big you can see more obvious 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.289
 here we would have the animations let's say 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.230
 recent or more common and here to the 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.320
 right the modern applications that is 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.349
 as he decided to call it microsoft 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.019
 we can give it a name to move it and so on 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.629
 as we already know we also see light 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:42.219
 tweaks on the icons for example here 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:44.079
 you go in the full or empty bin and the 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.359
 normal icons for example from the 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.989
 downloads folder documents and so on 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:53.960
 As you can see, they have a dubious design that 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.149
 the windows feedback application 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.309
 windows you know already is aware 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.050
 microsoft that we do not like the 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.449
 icons as you can see here 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.460
 this application we are communicating what 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.340
 we do not like or does not work to microsoft 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.440
 It's very good because you can tell him 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.020
 each paragraph what fails you or what 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.509
 you do not like it and many people agree 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.670
 that he does not like icons and is 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.100
 hopefully they are already working on a 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.570
 new icon package down here in the 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.090
 lower right margin that we see that 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.369
 the button to preview the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.410
 desktop or if we press it minimize 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.440
 everything or maximize all the animations 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.600
 minimized and maximized have also 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.280
 suffered a slight redesign a lot more 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.289
 nice and fluid than the previous one that 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.410
 we had in windows when dragging a 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.090
 window to the right or left margin 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.280
 windows suggests us to place in the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.490
 margin that is free for this 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.710
 way to give us a bit of work 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.780
 also significantly they improved the 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.270
 section of more desks or 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.880
 virtual desktops where we can 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.979
 add a new desktop and for 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.299
 example take us an application in the 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.140
 we want to work the screen 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.210
 complete 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.149
 simply dragging it we have several 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.490
 desks with which to separate so 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.289
 effective our workflow now 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.140
 As you can see, it has a more 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.450
 fluid and everything is more animated another of the 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.010
 new developments that are obvious is this 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.930
 search box that we have here 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.630
 down to the left that includes at last 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.519
 a cortana in Spanish and we can work 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.769
 with her asking him things or 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.739
 writing for example let's open it 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.620
 and we see that it shows us the time or 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.790
 We can directly ask you questions 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.790
 Hello 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.750
 hello there's something I can help you with 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.750
 but still given 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.600
 to everyone what do you think of apple 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.540
 the geometrical figure of his new headquarters 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.540
 love 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.580
 can you tell a joke 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.940
 knock Knock 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:03.260
 there is no one less good that I did not come 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.260
 you can sing a song 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.459
 I can sing this to the potato 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.560
 we will eat salad as they eat 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:22.049
 gentlemen oranges and lemons hp hp 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.049
 Sit down, I can see you 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:31.200
 I made a 500 year projection towards the 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.200
 future this was the result 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.240
 remind me to dominate the world tomorrow 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.590
 of course at what time 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.590
 cancel 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.170
 canceled reminder we see still 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.230
 certain inconsistencies between 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.930
 windows let's say normal or what 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.330
 would be those of modern applications like 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.160
 you see the buttons are something different 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.630
 according to the window that is open 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.630
 play my music 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.520
 according playing your music 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.370
 here you give the music application that 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.669
 As you can see, it has a very halo look windows 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.820
 8 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.850
 something remodeled and receives the name of 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.340
 xbox music down here on the right we see 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.090
 the notifications panel that has 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.979
 these dances fast new process in 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.720
 which we can do different 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.900
 actions such as activating the 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.210
 tablet screen mode etc let's see the 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.380
 beta store application to see what 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.380
 aspect has right now 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.010
 finally they have removed in the accesses with 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.980
 the right button and we have up here 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.770
 home applications games all divided 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.160
 in categories to get at the moment 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.590
 this update to windows 10 041 10 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.010
 technical preview you have to have 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.020
 activated if you are using the 9 926 the 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.990
 Quick updates in the menu 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.880
 windows update when updating safely 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.440
 you will find some problems like 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.470
 that for example these do not work 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.300
 applications of contacts and so on 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.520
 maybe you have some problems with the 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.320
 sound access to network settings has 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.420
 been slightly modified also and 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.730
 here we would get a wifi network if the 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.320
 we had or we can enter the 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.320
 adjustments directly from this one 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.490
 as you see the configuration section or 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.100
 adjustments is now much more colorful is 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.530
 very beautiful and it is organized in a very 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.390
 minimalist and effective this is the 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.270
 my pc information as you see is not 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.010
 great thing but windows 10 moves from 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.780
 wonder in the core we activate the mode 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.420
 tablet that good all it does is 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.280
 expand all applications to mode 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.050
 full screen and the start panel 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.150
 the full screen always opens 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.620
 we also see the icons a little more 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.690
 big 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.080
 and the cut access as a single 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.629
 button 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.970
 we can deactivate from here the 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:11.430
 tablet mode and good as a conclusion 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.530
 windows 10 is taking a path of 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.090
 optimization and very good performance 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.490
 you already know that if you want you can 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.530
 use it free until the exit 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.569
 official windows 10 to go 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.610
 communicating to microsoft the bugs or 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:25.080
 problems that you are finding there is 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.000
 recognize that the system has a pint 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.889
 incredible and that will undoubtedly be a great 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.780
 system at the moment there is no trace of 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.300
 spartan the new browser that 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.129
 it will replace internet explorer because 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.629
 good to assume that microsoft does not 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:38.280
 wants to show until it's not a 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:40.289
 round product since it has a large 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.129
 responsibility to wash the name of 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:42.930
 your browser 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:44.699
 that's all friends I hope that I have 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.560
 liked this look at windows 10 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:49.449
 see you in another review until soon 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.889
 goodbye cortana 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:52.889
 I hope you come back soon
