00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.660
 control existence of the brand is attacked 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.639
 many have written that how to take away the 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.240
 password because they can not enter from 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.760
 the computer screen 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.039
 this is because his footprint estrada del tÃº 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.920
 as an administrator then what are 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.890
 do is change user privileges 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.180
 to be able to enter then for that we are going to 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.880
 employees 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.530
 and here in the departments are their 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.930
 employees here 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.670
 let's find one that has here in 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.450
 privileges you have as administrator 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.940
 you do not have the user level 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.800
 nice user and pedrito has the 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.910

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.950
 I ask the supervisor 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.420

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.840
 we put you at the administrator level and 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.640
 we keep 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.160
 since we made this change the only one that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.470
 we would be upload these changes to the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.210

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.540

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.750
 here it is called door 1 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.540
 tell 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.760

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.470
 account because this orange arrow and 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.390

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.290

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.240
 selecting employees to upload 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.440

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.920
 you want 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.159
