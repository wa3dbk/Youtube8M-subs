so<00:00:01.570> if<00:00:02.570> you<00:00:02.659> get<00:00:02.780> your<00:00:02.960> main<00:00:03.110> bearings<00:00:03.590> I<00:00:03.649> know

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:03.710 
so if you get your main bearings I know

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.660 
so if you get your main bearings I know
I<00:00:03.800> talked<00:00:04.069> about<00:00:04.160> in<00:00:04.700> another<00:00:05.450> video<00:00:06.670> about

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
I talked about in another video about

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.379 
I talked about in another video about
the<00:00:08.509> correct<00:00:09.019> bearing<00:00:09.769> sizes<00:00:10.869> for<00:00:11.869> a<00:00:13.389> 4.7

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
the correct bearing sizes for a 4.7

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.200 
the correct bearing sizes for a 4.7
liter<00:00:14.860> engine<00:00:15.860> Dodge<00:00:16.160> Jeep<00:00:16.640> Chrysler<00:00:19.060> if<00:00:20.060> you

didn't<00:00:20.359> watch<00:00:20.449> that<00:00:20.480> video<00:00:20.869> I'll<00:00:20.990> kind<00:00:21.259> of

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
didn't watch that video I'll kind of

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.060 
didn't watch that video I'll kind of
explain<00:00:21.410> it<00:00:21.800> again<00:00:22.009> the<00:00:23.050> journal<00:00:24.050> sizes<00:00:24.710> on

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
explain it again the journal sizes on

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.249 
explain it again the journal sizes on
the<00:00:25.249> 4.7<00:00:26.179> liter<00:00:27.070> stock<00:00:28.070> crankshaft<00:00:29.079> vary<00:00:30.079> in

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
the 4.7 liter stock crankshaft vary in

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.410 
the 4.7 liter stock crankshaft vary in
size<00:00:30.499> there's<00:00:31.220> three<00:00:31.579> different<00:00:31.849> sizes<00:00:32.949> here

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
size there's three different sizes here

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.209 
size there's three different sizes here
for<00:00:35.420> your<00:00:35.660> journal<00:00:36.289> bearings<00:00:37.359> now<00:00:38.359> I<00:00:39.010> had<00:00:40.010> my

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
for your journal bearings now I had my

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.000 
for your journal bearings now I had my
crank<00:00:40.850> inspected<00:00:41.840> and<00:00:42.109> measured<00:00:42.710> each

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
crank inspected and measured each

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.389 
crank inspected and measured each
journal<00:00:43.539> by<00:00:44.539> the<00:00:44.600> machine<00:00:44.960> shop<00:00:45.199> and<00:00:45.500> these

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
journal by the machine shop and these

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.569 
journal by the machine shop and these
are<00:00:46.579> the<00:00:46.699> numbers<00:00:47.030> so<00:00:47.960> now<00:00:48.280> I'm<00:00:49.280> going<00:00:49.519> to

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
are the numbers so now I'm going to

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.729 
are the numbers so now I'm going to
match<00:00:49.760> these<00:00:50.030> up<00:00:50.090> that<00:00:50.510> I<00:00:50.539> would<00:00:50.840> say<00:00:51.050> honestly

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
match these up that I would say honestly

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.729 
match these up that I would say honestly
don't<00:00:52.100> go<00:00:52.309> by<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:52.789> letters<00:00:53.269> that<00:00:53.300> are<00:00:53.719> on<00:00:53.929> the

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
don't go by the letters that are on the

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.180 
don't go by the letters that are on the
tone<00:00:54.980> wheel<00:00:55.539> have<00:00:56.539> them<00:00:56.780> checked

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
tone wheel have them checked

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.310 
tone wheel have them checked
double-check<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:58.460> make<00:00:58.519> sure<00:00:58.789> and<00:00:59.269> then<00:01:00.170> when

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
double-check and make sure and then when

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.619 
double-check and make sure and then when
you<00:01:00.379> install<00:01:00.739> them<00:01:00.980> plasti<00:01:01.940> gauge<00:01:02.120> them<00:01:02.390> and

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
you install them plasti gauge them and

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.540 
you install them plasti gauge them and
triple<00:01:03.320> check<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:03.710> make<00:01:03.859> sure<00:01:03.890> this<00:01:04.400> is

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
triple check and make sure this is

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.060 
triple check and make sure this is
important<00:01:04.970> stuff<00:01:05.380> so<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:06.470> can<00:01:06.530> see<00:01:06.710> here<00:01:06.920> my

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
important stuff so you can see here my

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.010 
important stuff so you can see here my
journal<00:01:07.400> says<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:07.820> last<00:01:08.000> two<00:01:08.300> are<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.630> little

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
journal says the last two are a little

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.580 
journal says the last two are a little
different<00:01:09.320> but<00:01:09.620> they<00:01:09.770> all<00:01:09.800> fall<00:01:10.490> in<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:12.380> grade

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
different but they all fall in the grade

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.550 
different but they all fall in the grade
a<00:01:12.830> category<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:14.060> they're<00:01:15.610> undersized<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.560> I

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
a category so they're undersized so I

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.870 
a category so they're undersized so I
went<00:01:18.800> ahead<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.040> ordered<00:01:19.160> those<00:01:19.430> bearings

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
went ahead and ordered those bearings

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.990 
went ahead and ordered those bearings
but<00:01:20.420> since<00:01:21.200> I've<00:01:21.800> got<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.160> return<00:01:22.430> these<00:01:22.610> and

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
but since I've got to return these and

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.940 
but since I've got to return these and
it's<00:01:23.240> kind<00:01:23.450> of<00:01:23.480> a<00:01:23.570> problem<00:01:23.810> I<00:01:24.170> figured<00:01:24.800> I'd

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
it's kind of a problem I figured I'd

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.310 
it's kind of a problem I figured I'd
make<00:01:25.100> a<00:01:25.160> video<00:01:25.370> and<00:01:25.670> show<00:01:25.880> you<00:01:26.050> what<00:01:27.050> to<00:01:27.170> look

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
make a video and show you what to look

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.220 
make a video and show you what to look
for<00:01:27.650> if<00:01:27.830> you<00:01:27.980> order<00:01:28.310> new<00:01:28.430> bearings<00:01:28.850> this<00:01:29.810> one<00:01:30.020> I

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
for if you order new bearings this one I

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.870 
for if you order new bearings this one I
knew<00:01:30.380> immediately<00:01:30.710> when<00:01:31.220> I<00:01:31.250> open<00:01:31.550> this<00:01:31.640> box

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
knew immediately when I open this box

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.000 
knew immediately when I open this box
that<00:01:32.180> these<00:01:32.300> were<00:01:32.420> bad<00:01:32.660> this<00:01:33.350> is<00:01:33.560> horrible

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
that these were bad this is horrible

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.600 
that these were bad this is horrible
packaging<00:01:34.910> on<00:01:35.060> part<00:01:35.420> of<00:01:35.630> Opower<00:01:36.470> I<00:01:37.190> don't<00:01:37.550> know

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
packaging on part of Opower I don't know

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.790 
packaging on part of Opower I don't know
why<00:01:37.760> you<00:01:37.820> put<00:01:38.000> main<00:01:38.180> bearings<00:01:38.540> like<00:01:38.600> that<00:01:38.840> but

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
why you put main bearings like that but

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.970 
why you put main bearings like that but
this<00:01:39.980> one's<00:01:40.220> not<00:01:40.370> too<00:01:40.430> bad<00:01:40.700> it<00:01:41.480> looks<00:01:41.660> okay<00:01:42.110> but

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
this one's not too bad it looks okay but

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.020 
this one's not too bad it looks okay but
if<00:01:43.070> you'd<00:01:43.190> see<00:01:43.460> there<00:01:44.740> there<00:01:45.740> is<00:01:46.070> some<00:01:46.550> scoring

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
if you'd see there there is some scoring

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.530 
if you'd see there there is some scoring
and<00:01:47.360> if<00:01:47.450> I<00:01:47.570> put<00:01:47.840> my<00:01:47.990> finger<00:01:48.050> on<00:01:48.710> that<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:49.540> can

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
and if I put my finger on that I can

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.640 
and if I put my finger on that I can
feel<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:52.490> scoring<00:01:52.970> on<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:53.270> this<00:01:54.050> bearing<00:01:54.530> is

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
feel the scoring on it this bearing is

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.280 
feel the scoring on it this bearing is
no<00:01:54.860> good<00:01:55.100> if<00:01:55.220> I<00:01:55.310> put<00:01:55.550> this<00:01:55.670> in<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:55.940> engine<00:01:56.330> my

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
no good if I put this in the engine my

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.080 
no good if I put this in the engine my
engine<00:01:57.740> is<00:01:57.860> going<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.160> fail<00:01:58.370> pretty

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
engine is going to fail pretty

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.420 
engine is going to fail pretty
prematurely<00:01:59.930> this<00:02:00.350> one's<00:02:00.590> not<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:00.950> bad<00:02:01.160> but

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
prematurely this one's not that bad but

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.610 
prematurely this one's not that bad but
let<00:02:01.640> me<00:02:01.700> see<00:02:01.820> if<00:02:01.910> I<00:02:02.000> can<00:02:02.180> find<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.290> one<00:02:03.320> here

let me see if I can find you one here
that's<00:02:03.770> just<00:02:03.980> I<00:02:04.460> was<00:02:05.360> kind<00:02:05.600> of<00:02:05.690> upset<00:02:05.980> because

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
that's just I was kind of upset because

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.929 
that's just I was kind of upset because
I<00:02:08.299> was<00:02:08.840> hoping<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.259> get<00:02:09.409> my<00:02:09.470> engines<00:02:09.950> start<00:02:10.519> put

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:10.939 
I was hoping to get my engines start put

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.929 
I was hoping to get my engines start put
together<00:02:11.060> this<00:02:11.390> weekend<00:02:11.810> but<00:02:12.370> no<00:02:13.370> they<00:02:13.670> sent

together this weekend but no they sent

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.000 
together this weekend but no they sent
me<00:02:14.060> bearings<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.569> are<00:02:15.010> absolutely

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
me bearings that are absolutely

them<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.150> situation<00:02:59.359> with<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.840> bearings

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
them the situation with the bearings

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.110 
them the situation with the bearings
they're<00:03:01.069> going<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.280> send<00:03:01.489> me<00:03:01.579> some<00:03:01.760> new<00:03:01.879> ones

days delay but at least I'll get some
hopefully<00:03:11.420> get<00:03:12.169> some<00:03:12.349> bearings<00:03:12.709> that<00:03:12.739> aren't

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
hopefully get some bearings that aren't

scored<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:13.549> asked<00:03:13.819> them<00:03:13.910> this<00:03:14.060> time<00:03:14.269> if<00:03:14.449> they

scored I asked them this time if they

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.990 
scored I asked them this time if they
could<00:03:14.750> at<00:03:14.840> least<00:03:15.129> open<00:03:16.129> up<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.370> box<00:03:16.609> and<00:03:16.819> look

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
could at least open up the box and look

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.460 
could at least open up the box and look
at<00:03:17.180> on<00:03:17.329> before<00:03:17.720> they<00:03:17.810> sent<00:03:17.989> them<00:03:18.079> to<00:03:18.109> me<00:03:18.319> so

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
at on before they sent them to me so

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.720 
at on before they sent them to me so
yeah<00:03:21.470> if<00:03:21.620> you<00:03:21.709> ever<00:03:21.739> get<00:03:21.980> some<00:03:22.190> bearings<00:03:22.549> make

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
yeah if you ever get some bearings make

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.509 
yeah if you ever get some bearings make
sure<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:23.030> look<00:03:23.150> at<00:03:23.389> them<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.690> inspect<00:03:24.019> them

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
sure you look at them and inspect them

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:31.180

in a box on here and a plastic wrap them

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.149 
in a box on here and a plastic wrap them
so<00:03:41.590> they<00:03:42.590> can't<00:03:42.889> bounce<00:03:43.190> around<00:03:44.769> use<00:03:45.769> my<00:03:45.949> rod

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
so they can't bounce around use my rod

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.430 
so they can't bounce around use my rod
bearings<00:03:46.780> see<00:03:47.780> that's<00:03:47.959> how<00:03:48.109> you<00:03:48.139> package

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.430 
bearings see that's how you package
bearings<00:03:49.510> get<00:03:50.510> them<00:03:50.629> all<00:03:50.750> there<00:03:50.989> they<00:03:51.199> can't

don't<00:04:00.979> understand<00:04:02.319> why<00:04:03.319> you<00:04:03.379> would<00:04:03.650> do<00:04:04.639> that

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
don't understand why you would do that

don't understand why you would do that
but<00:04:05.750> I<00:04:06.319> guess<00:04:07.190> another<00:04:07.370> important<00:04:08.060> thing<00:04:08.150> to

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
but I guess another important thing to

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.479 
but I guess another important thing to
cover<00:04:08.449> is<00:04:09.819> your<00:04:10.819> rod<00:04:11.810> bolts<00:04:12.079> as<00:04:12.379> well<00:04:12.620> since

cover is your rod bolts as well since

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.300 
cover is your rod bolts as well since

to ship myself I'm just $60 worth of

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.130 
to ship myself I'm just $60 worth of
bolts<00:05:01.070> and<00:05:02.070> have<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:02.640> connecting<00:05:03.150> rod<00:05:03.180> cap<00:05:03.690> fall

bolts and have a connecting rod cap fall
off<00:05:04.350> while<00:05:04.680> I'm<00:05:04.800> driving<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.460> engine<00:05:05.580> so<00:05:05.970> I'm

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
off while I'm driving the engine so I'm

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.660 
off while I'm driving the engine so I'm
going<00:05:06.630> to<00:05:06.660> go<00:05:06.780> ahead<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.080> replace<00:05:07.290> those<00:05:07.670> same

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
going to go ahead and replace those same

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:16.610 
going to go ahead and replace those same
with<00:05:11.060> your<00:05:13.370> head<00:05:14.370> bolts<00:05:14.760> go<00:05:15.210> ahead<00:05:15.450> and<00:05:16.320> get<00:05:16.590> a

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
with your head bolts go ahead and get a

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.700 
with your head bolts go ahead and get a
new<00:05:16.860> set<00:05:17.160> of<00:05:17.190> head<00:05:17.430> bolts<00:05:18.230> because<00:05:19.230> these<00:05:19.470> need

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
new set of head bolts because these need

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.910 
new set of head bolts because these need
to<00:05:19.770> be<00:05:19.830> replaced<00:05:19.920> if<00:05:20.670> you<00:05:20.910> change<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.390> heads

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
to be replaced if you change the heads

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.280 
to be replaced if you change the heads
when<00:05:22.920> you<00:05:22.950> talk<00:05:23.220> torque<00:05:23.550> these<00:05:23.670> down<00:05:24.290> they're

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
when you talk torque these down they're

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.750 
when you talk torque these down they're
torque<00:05:25.560> to<00:05:25.680> Europe<00:05:25.950> yield<00:05:26.220> so<00:05:26.430> these<00:05:26.550> things

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
torque to Europe yield so these things

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.510 
torque to Europe yield so these things
stretch<00:05:27.180> so<00:05:27.540> you<00:05:27.600> can<00:05:28.020> reuse<00:05:28.770> them<00:05:29.070> in<00:05:29.280> my

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
stretch so you can reuse them in my

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.700 
stretch so you can reuse them in my
opinion<00:05:29.910> that's<00:05:30.060> kind<00:05:30.240> of<00:05:30.270> stupid<00:05:30.710> because

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
opinion that's kind of stupid because

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.610 
opinion that's kind of stupid because
now<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:32.070> got<00:05:32.370> to<00:05:32.490> buy<00:05:32.610> all<00:05:32.760> new<00:05:32.880> bolts<00:05:33.330> but

now I got to buy all new bolts but
you're<00:05:34.620> going<00:05:34.740> to<00:05:34.830> rebuild<00:05:35.100> an<00:05:35.190> engine<00:05:35.250> you're

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
you're going to rebuild an engine you're

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.510 
you're going to rebuild an engine you're
going<00:05:35.669> to<00:05:35.730> do<00:05:35.850> it<00:05:35.940> right<00:05:36.120> you<00:05:36.390> don't<00:05:36.930> want<00:05:37.140> to

you<00:05:41.520> don't<00:05:41.640> want<00:05:41.880> to<00:05:42.150> cut<00:05:42.720> corners<00:05:42.890> when

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
you don't want to cut corners when

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.170 
you don't want to cut corners when
you're<00:05:44.100> building<00:05:44.310> a<00:05:44.430> motor<00:05:44.640> that<00:05:44.880> you<00:05:44.940> want<00:05:45.120> to

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
you're building a motor that you want to

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.290 
you're building a motor that you want to
depend<00:05:45.450> on<00:05:45.600> so<00:05:46.610> remember<00:05:47.640> inspect<00:05:48.210> your

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
depend on so remember inspect your

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.800 
depend on so remember inspect your
bearings<00:05:49.820> don't<00:05:50.820> hesitate<00:05:51.240> to<00:05:51.300> send<00:05:51.540> it<00:05:51.660> back

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
bearings don't hesitate to send it back

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.270 
bearings don't hesitate to send it back
get<00:05:52.110> new<00:05:52.260> ones<00:05:52.500> until<00:05:52.680> they<00:05:52.830> get<00:05:52.950> it<00:05:53.070> right

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
get new ones until they get it right

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.810 
get new ones until they get it right
this<00:05:53.820> is<00:05:54.030> important<00:05:54.480> stuff<00:05:55.669> change<00:05:56.669> your
