I know<00:02:14.189> that<00:02:14.459> sounds<00:02:14.879> like<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:16.459> little

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
I know that sounds like a little

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.080 
I know that sounds like a little
redundant<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:18.769> it's<00:02:19.769> much<00:02:19.950> easier<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.579> zest<00:02:20.879> a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
redundant but it's much easier to zest a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.670 
redundant but it's much easier to zest a
full<00:02:21.359> lemon<00:02:21.719> than<00:02:21.870> half<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.200> lemon

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
full lemon than half a lemon

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.069 
full lemon than half a lemon
so<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.340> brightened<00:02:24.030> up<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.389> mayonnaise<00:02:24.599> or

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
so I brightened up the mayonnaise or

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.250 
so I brightened up the mayonnaise or
aioli<00:02:25.650> with<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.489> little<00:02:26.790> lemon<00:02:27.060> juice<00:02:27.260> chili

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.399
