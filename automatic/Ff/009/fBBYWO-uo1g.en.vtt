well<00:01:08.830> as<00:01:08.980> I<00:01:09.220> see<00:01:09.550> it<00:01:09.750> all<00:01:11.160> religions<00:01:12.720> mystics

philosophers<00:01:14.590> are<00:01:14.830> dealing<00:01:15.370> with<00:01:15.400> this

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
philosophers are dealing with this

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.150 
philosophers are dealing with this
precise<00:01:16.450> issue<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:18.310> my<00:01:18.910> take<00:01:19.240> on<00:01:19.420> it<00:01:19.480> is<00:01:19.690> that

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
precise issue and my take on it is that

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.230 
precise issue and my take on it is that
it<00:01:21.690> begins<00:01:22.690> with<00:01:22.870> consciousness<00:01:23.470> and<00:01:24.240> that

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
it begins with consciousness and that

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.390 
it begins with consciousness and that
all<00:01:25.480> that<00:01:25.900> is<00:01:25.930> all<00:01:26.380> there<00:01:26.590> really<00:01:26.650> is<00:01:26.950> is

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
all that is all there really is is

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.570 
all that is all there really is is
consciousness<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:29.500> could<00:01:29.890> simplified

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
consciousness and you could simplified

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.770 
consciousness and you could simplified
say<00:01:30.970> we<00:01:31.930> are<00:01:32.140> a<00:01:32.440> thought<00:01:32.830> where<00:01:33.370> we<00:01:33.700> are

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
say we are a thought where we are

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.530 
say we are a thought where we are
experiences<00:01:34.780> within<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.170> bug<00:01:35.850> but<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:37.150> be<00:01:37.510> a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
experiences within a bug but to be a

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.000 
experiences within a bug but to be a
little<00:01:37.810> more<00:01:38.020> specific<00:01:38.260> I<00:01:38.770> think

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
little more specific I think

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.650 
little more specific I think
the<00:01:40.520> Creator<00:01:41.030> can<00:01:41.690> I<00:01:41.870> do<00:01:42.040> separate<00:01:43.660> creator

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
the Creator can I do separate creator

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.380 
the Creator can I do separate creator
from<00:01:45.140> God<00:01:45.500> but<00:01:45.890> I<00:01:45.950> think<00:01:46.220> those<00:01:46.460> are<00:01:46.490> perhaps

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
from God but I think those are perhaps

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.370 
from God but I think those are perhaps
two<00:01:47.810> different<00:01:48.820> definitions<00:01:49.820> of<00:01:50.380> something

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
two different definitions of something

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.300 
two different definitions of something
greater<00:01:51.680> than<00:01:51.830> us<00:01:52.010> but<00:01:52.760> I<00:01:53.000> believe<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:54.310> the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
greater than us but I believe that the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.350 
greater than us but I believe that the
Creator<00:01:55.810> was<00:01:57.250> consciousness<00:01:58.250> that's<00:01:59.000> all

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
Creator was consciousness that's all

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.680 
Creator was consciousness that's all
there<00:01:59.660> was<00:01:59.690> there<00:02:00.530> was<00:02:00.860> no<00:02:01.220> space<00:02:01.790> there<00:02:02.390> was

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
there was there was no space there was

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.220 
there was there was no space there was
no<00:02:02.960> time<00:02:03.380> there<00:02:04.160> was<00:02:04.460> no<00:02:04.760> matter<00:02:05.150> there<00:02:06.050> was

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
no time there was no matter there was

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.020 
no time there was no matter there was
just<00:02:06.590> consciousness<00:02:07.370> in<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.820> boy

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
just consciousness in a boy

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.050 
just consciousness in a boy
and<00:02:10.039> he<00:02:11.840> consciousness<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:14.060> self-awareness

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
and he consciousness is self-awareness

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.330 
and he consciousness is self-awareness
and<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:16.560> as<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.550> was<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.720> existed<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.740> wondered

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
and so as it was it existed it wondered

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.640 
and so as it was it existed it wondered
about<00:02:20.610> itself<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.990> said<00:02:23.090> who<00:02:24.090> am<00:02:24.360> i<00:02:24.650> what

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.250 
absolutely everything we have large and
small<00:02:43.110> we<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:44.130> fast<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.970> slow<00:02:45.269> have<00:02:45.840> light

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
small we have fast and slow have light

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.320 
small we have fast and slow have light
and<00:02:46.560> dark<00:02:46.980> all<00:02:48.019> possibilities<00:02:49.019> had<00:02:49.920> to

and dark all possibilities had to

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.630 
and dark all possibilities had to
simultaneously<00:02:51.380> come<00:02:52.380> into<00:02:52.769> existence<00:02:52.950> in

simultaneously come into existence in

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.460 
simultaneously come into existence in
that<00:02:54.360> very<00:02:54.630> moment<00:02:54.860> of<00:02:55.860> creation<00:02:56.660> now<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.720> go<00:02:58.140> a

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
that very moment of creation now to go a

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.240 
that very moment of creation now to go a
little<00:02:59.100> bit<00:02:59.310> further

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
little bit further

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.630 
little bit further
I<00:03:00.310> guess<00:03:01.030> what<00:03:01.180> I'm<00:03:01.240> saying<00:03:01.360> is<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:03.130> creator

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
I guess what I'm saying is the creator

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.930 
I guess what I'm saying is the creator
of<00:03:04.170> everything<00:03:05.910> is

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.230 

the<00:03:09.330> cosmos<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.550> everything<00:03:11.550> in<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.710> is

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
the cosmos and everything in it so it is

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:21.020 
the cosmos and everything in it so it is
the<00:03:15.240> tree<00:03:16.220> as<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:18.450> Buddhist<00:03:18.900> reversed<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:20.580> is

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
the tree as the Buddhist reversed it is

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.860 
the tree as the Buddhist reversed it is
me<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.910> it's<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:24.210> stuff<00:03:24.810> between

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
me and you and it's a stuff between

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.490 
me and you and it's a stuff between
all<00:03:28.280> matter<00:03:29.280> or<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.819> parent<00:03:30.390> matter<00:03:30.659> and<00:03:31.080> we<00:03:31.290> can

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
all matter or a parent matter and we can

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.920 
all matter or a parent matter and we can
talk<00:03:31.709> about<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.819> reality<00:03:33.390> of<00:03:33.420> matter<00:03:33.750> in

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
talk about the reality of matter in

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.880 
talk about the reality of matter in
another<00:03:34.260> episode<00:03:35.540> is<00:03:36.890> consciousness

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
another episode is consciousness

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:44.410 
another episode is consciousness
manifest<00:03:38.790> so<00:03:39.780> we<00:03:40.080> are<00:03:40.319> the<00:03:41.900> creator<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.410> the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
manifest so we are the creator and the

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.170 
manifest so we are the creator and the
purpose<00:03:45.420> of<00:03:45.569> us<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:46.530> for<00:03:46.890> him<00:03:47.129> to<00:03:47.430> understand

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
purpose of us is for him to understand

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
who he is now like us we have our bolts

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.990 
who he is now like us we have our bolts
and<00:03:57.950> perhaps<00:03:59.329> get<00:04:00.799> our<00:04:01.799> life<00:04:02.160> is<00:04:02.430> just<00:04:02.700> to

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
and perhaps get our life is just to

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.680 
and perhaps get our life is just to
determine<00:04:03.859> the<00:04:04.859> good<00:04:05.099> and<00:04:05.280> bad<00:04:05.340> of<00:04:05.549> us<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.299> to

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
determine the good and bad of us and to

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.979 
determine the good and bad of us and to
weed<00:04:06.959> out<00:04:07.609> we<00:04:08.609> try<00:04:08.849> to<00:04:08.879> overcome<00:04:09.269> our

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
weed out we try to overcome our

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.890 
weed out we try to overcome our
iniquities<00:04:10.980> or<00:04:11.220> maybe<00:04:11.519> as<00:04:11.970> Christians<00:04:12.690> say

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
iniquities or maybe as Christians say

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.279 
iniquities or maybe as Christians say
sin<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.799> that<00:04:14.090> is<00:04:15.090> what<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.629> experience<00:04:15.900> of

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
sin and that is what the experience of

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.750 
sin and that is what the experience of
our<00:04:17.959> our<00:04:18.959> existence<00:04:19.680> is<00:04:19.859> in<00:04:20.130> this<00:04:20.370> dimension

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
our our existence is in this dimension

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.670 
our our existence is in this dimension
is<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.770> understand<00:04:23.310> ourselves<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:24.150> to

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
is to to understand ourselves and to

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.710 
is to to understand ourselves and to
perfect<00:04:25.680> ourselves<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.460> become<00:04:26.720> better

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
perfect ourselves to become better

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.640 
perfect ourselves to become better
people<00:04:28.350> better<00:04:29.250> father<00:04:29.729> better

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
people better father better

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.110 
people better father better
husband<00:04:31.610> and<00:04:31.759> just<00:04:32.389> a<00:04:32.509> better<00:04:32.780> human<00:04:33.590> being

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
husband and just a better human being

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.840 
husband and just a better human being
now<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.449> think<00:04:36.380> that<00:04:36.770> is<00:04:36.919> true<00:04:37.130> for<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.520> Creator

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
now I think that is true for the Creator

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.980 
now I think that is true for the Creator
I<00:04:38.150> think<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.080> Creator<00:04:39.610> is<00:04:40.610> saying<00:04:40.990> who

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
I think that the Creator is saying who

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.360 
I think that the Creator is saying who
am<00:04:42.199> i<00:04:42.490> what<00:04:43.490> am<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.330> we<00:04:45.320> are<00:04:45.470> playing<00:04:45.979> that

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
am i what am I and we are playing that

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.570 
am i what am I and we are playing that
song<00:04:46.699> and<00:04:48.220> he<00:04:49.220> is<00:04:49.370> coming<00:04:50.330> to<00:04:50.600> understand

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
song and he is coming to understand

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.300 
song and he is coming to understand
himself<00:04:53.380> through<00:04:54.520> our<00:04:55.660> existence<00:04:56.660> and<00:04:56.930> our

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
himself through our existence and our

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.580 
himself through our existence and our
experiences<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:58.490> more<00:04:59.210> importantly<00:04:59.750> our

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
experiences and more importantly our

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.969 
experiences and more importantly our
choices<00:05:02.229> we<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:04.340> I<00:05:04.699> think<00:05:04.970> all<00:05:05.770> religions<00:05:06.770> at

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
choices we and I think all religions at

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.870 
choices we and I think all religions at
least<00:05:07.310> as<00:05:07.669> they<00:05:08.060> manifest<00:05:08.660> today<00:05:09.639> have<00:05:10.639> it

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
least as they manifest today have it

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.480 
least as they manifest today have it
wrong<00:05:11.620> they<00:05:12.620> tend<00:05:13.010> to<00:05:13.160> externalize<00:05:15.070> as<00:05:16.070> they

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
wrong they tend to externalize as they

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.439 
wrong they tend to externalize as they
refer<00:05:16.910> to<00:05:17.120> God<00:05:17.720> and<00:05:18.139> the<00:05:18.830> Creator<00:05:19.250> as<00:05:19.669> though

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
refer to God and the Creator as though

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.290 
refer to God and the Creator as though
he's<00:05:20.690> separate<00:05:21.289> and<00:05:21.560> that<00:05:21.740> he<00:05:21.979> does<00:05:22.460> thanks<00:05:22.880> to

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
he's separate and that he does thanks to

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.189 
he's separate and that he does thanks to
them<00:05:23.570> he<00:05:24.470> determines<00:05:25.340> who<00:05:25.639> they<00:05:25.940> are<00:05:26.150> and<00:05:26.479> I

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
them he determines who they are and I

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.089 
them he determines who they are and I
think<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:28.400> more<00:05:28.820> accurate<00:05:29.120> view<00:05:29.990> is<00:05:30.349> that<00:05:30.440> we

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
think the more accurate view is that we

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:33.760 
think the more accurate view is that we
and<00:05:32.020> this<00:05:33.020> is<00:05:33.199> going<00:05:33.380> to<00:05:33.470> sound<00:05:33.620> very

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
and this is going to sound very

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.620 
and this is going to sound very
blasphemous<00:05:34.510> initially<00:05:35.530> we<00:05:36.970> determine<00:05:37.970> who

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
blasphemous initially we determine who

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.510 
blasphemous initially we determine who
the<00:05:38.810> Creator<00:05:39.260> is<00:05:40.300> because<00:05:41.300> only<00:05:41.660> in<00:05:42.020> that

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
the Creator is because only in that

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.340 
the Creator is because only in that
format<00:05:43.520> can<00:05:44.300> we<00:05:44.660> have<00:05:45.500> total<00:05:46.159> free<00:05:46.460> will

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
format can we have total free will

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.070 
format can we have total free will

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
the Christians and other such religions

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.000 
the Christians and other such religions
look<00:06:00.580> at<00:06:00.790> the<00:06:00.970> question<00:06:01.480> of<00:06:01.660> good<00:06:02.620> and<00:06:02.860> evil

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
look at the question of good and evil

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.630 
look at the question of good and evil
and<00:06:03.370> that<00:06:03.430> that<00:06:03.940> struggle<00:06:04.630> that<00:06:04.780> we<00:06:04.840> all<00:06:05.080> have

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
and that that struggle that we all have

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.090 
and that that struggle that we all have
internally<00:06:06.640> and<00:06:07.350> amongst<00:06:08.350> in<00:06:08.650> between<00:06:09.070> each

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
internally and amongst in between each

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.290 
internally and amongst in between each
other<00:06:09.490> is<00:06:10.140> the<00:06:11.140> determination<00:06:11.860> of<00:06:12.340> who<00:06:13.000> he<00:06:13.270> is

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
other is the determination of who he is

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.880 
other is the determination of who he is
and<00:06:14.340> so<00:06:15.340> it<00:06:15.490> is<00:06:15.670> a<00:06:15.700> battle<00:06:16.120> between<00:06:17.020> good<00:06:17.680> and

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
and so it is a battle between good and

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.060 
and so it is a battle between good and
light<00:06:18.130> he<00:06:18.850> is<00:06:19.030> he<00:06:19.780> is<00:06:19.810> absolutely<00:06:21.780> finding<00:06:22.780> out

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
light he is he is absolutely finding out

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.920 
light he is he is absolutely finding out
what<00:06:24.070> parts<00:06:24.340> of<00:06:24.580> him<00:06:24.880> he<00:06:25.360> might<00:06:25.540> want<00:06:25.750> to

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
what parts of him he might want to

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.620 
what parts of him he might want to
discard<00:06:26.410> and<00:06:27.280> that's<00:06:27.640> where<00:06:28.000> we're<00:06:28.180> going<00:06:28.420> to

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:28.630 
discard and that's where we're going to

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.980 
discard and that's where we're going to
inevitably<00:06:28.870> end<00:06:29.500> up<00:06:29.710> and<00:06:30.490> I<00:06:30.610> think<00:06:30.990> sooner

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
inevitably end up and I think sooner

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.250 
inevitably end up and I think sooner
than<00:06:32.140> later<00:06:32.380> but<00:06:33.340> we<00:06:33.520> all<00:06:33.730> have<00:06:33.930> that<00:06:34.930> choice

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
than later but we all have that choice

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.790 
than later but we all have that choice
we<00:06:36.130> all<00:06:36.370> have<00:06:36.610> that<00:06:36.820> path<00:06:37.180> and<00:06:37.620> rather<00:06:38.620> than

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
we all have that path and rather than

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.260 
we all have that path and rather than
thinking<00:06:39.670> in<00:06:40.390> terms<00:06:41.140> of<00:06:41.640> being<00:06:42.640> a<00:06:42.820> good<00:06:43.000> person

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
thinking in terms of being a good person

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.590 
thinking in terms of being a good person
for<00:06:43.810> the<00:06:43.900> sake<00:06:44.170> of<00:06:44.200> being<00:06:44.500> good<00:06:45.330> we<00:06:46.330> should

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:46.600 
for the sake of being good we should

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
for the sake of being good we should
maybe<00:06:46.840> think<00:06:47.020> of<00:06:47.500> it<00:06:47.680> as<00:06:47.950> I<00:06:48.340> make<00:06:49.210> the<00:06:50.170> choice

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
maybe think of it as I make the choice

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.940 
maybe think of it as I make the choice
of<00:06:51.070> what<00:06:51.670> I<00:06:51.700> am<00:06:52.110> what<00:06:53.110> I<00:06:53.170> stand<00:06:53.320> and<00:06:54.280> how<00:06:55.270> I<00:06:55.300> live

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
of what I am what I stand and how I live

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.800 
of what I am what I stand and how I live
is<00:06:56.950> more<00:06:57.430> than<00:06:57.670> just<00:06:57.910> about<00:06:58.120> me<00:06:58.510> it<00:06:59.350> is<00:06:59.500> about

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
is more than just about me it is about

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.710 
is more than just about me it is about
the<00:07:01.810> eternal<00:07:02.380> creator<00:07:02.700> him<00:07:03.700> am<00:07:04.120> I<00:07:04.300> going<00:07:04.570> to

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 
the eternal creator him am I going to

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.610 
the eternal creator him am I going to
help<00:07:04.960> him<00:07:05.140> determine<00:07:05.580> that<00:07:06.580> he<00:07:06.880> is<00:07:07.620> righteous

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
help him determine that he is righteous

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.880 
help him determine that he is righteous
and<00:07:09.090> beautiful<00:07:10.090> and<00:07:10.210> perfect<00:07:10.690> or<00:07:11.260> am<00:07:11.530> I<00:07:11.680> going

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:11.890 
and beautiful and perfect or am I going

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:16.790 
and beautiful and perfect or am I going
to<00:07:12.250> go<00:07:12.460> to<00:07:12.520> the<00:07:12.820> dark<00:07:13.060> side<00:07:13.390> and<00:07:14.790> therefore

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
to go to the dark side and therefore

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.200 
to go to the dark side and therefore
determined<00:07:17.800> that<00:07:17.889> he<00:07:18.100> is<00:07:18.190> not<00:07:18.490> those<00:07:18.880> things

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
determined that he is not those things

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.629 
determined that he is not those things
may<00:07:19.750> be<00:07:19.780> the<00:07:20.110> opposite<00:07:20.770> but<00:07:21.160> it's<00:07:21.310> in<00:07:21.490> our

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 
may be the opposite but it's in our

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:25.080 
may be the opposite but it's in our
hands<00:07:22.000> this<00:07:22.780> world<00:07:23.260> is<00:07:23.740> in<00:07:24.010> our<00:07:24.130> hands<00:07:24.460> we're

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.090 
hands this world is in our hands we're

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.470 
hands this world is in our hands we're
going<00:07:25.389> to<00:07:25.750> and<00:07:26.080> we<00:07:26.260> are<00:07:26.470> every<00:07:27.220> moment<00:07:27.639> but<00:07:28.240> as

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:28.480 
going to and we are every moment but as

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.120 
going to and we are every moment but as
as<00:07:30.180> time<00:07:31.180> progresses<00:07:31.840> we<00:07:32.200> are<00:07:32.350> determining

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.130 
as time progresses we are determining

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:38.430 
as time progresses we are determining
whether<00:07:33.430> we<00:07:34.360> are<00:07:34.570> a<00:07:34.600> righteous<00:07:35.470> earth<00:07:36.100> and<00:07:37.440> a

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 
whether we are a righteous earth and a

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.330 
whether we are a righteous earth and a
good<00:07:38.710> people<00:07:39.419> seeking<00:07:40.419> truth<00:07:40.840> or<00:07:41.200> whether<00:07:41.950> we

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:42.340 
good people seeking truth or whether we

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:47.330 
good people seeking truth or whether we
are<00:07:42.660> seeking<00:07:44.310> deception<00:07:45.310> and<00:07:45.520> lie<00:07:46.150> and<00:07:46.660> power

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:47.340 
are seeking deception and lie and power

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.220 
are seeking deception and lie and power
because<00:07:48.340> it<00:07:48.460> really<00:07:48.730> is<00:07:49.000> a<00:07:49.030> struggle<00:07:49.480> between

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:50.230 
because it really is a struggle between

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.700 
because it really is a struggle between
light<00:07:50.740> and<00:07:50.950> dark<00:07:51.400> or<00:07:51.669> and<00:07:52.240> it<00:07:52.810> is<00:07:53.290> probably

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:53.710 
light and dark or and it is probably

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.130 
light and dark or and it is probably
better<00:07:53.950> understood<00:07:54.520> this<00:07:54.700> way<00:07:54.910> it<00:07:55.870> is<00:07:56.110> a

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:56.140 
better understood this way it is a

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:01.110 
better understood this way it is a
struggle<00:07:56.530> between<00:07:57.180> love<00:07:58.180> and<00:07:58.510> fear<00:07:59.110> and<00:08:00.120> that

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 
struggle between love and fear and that

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.110 
struggle between love and fear and that
is<00:08:01.360> the<00:08:01.630> struggle<00:08:01.960> that<00:08:02.410> he<00:08:03.040> has<00:08:03.340> from<00:08:04.060> the

is the struggle that he has from the
