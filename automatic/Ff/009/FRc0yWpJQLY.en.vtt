so what you're gonna do is thread the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.820 
so what you're gonna do is thread the
needle<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.210> there<00:01:47.960> are<00:01:48.110> threader's<00:01:48.590> out

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
needle and there are threader's out

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.310 
needle and there are threader's out
there<00:01:49.100> I<00:01:49.280> end<00:01:49.610> up<00:01:49.910> sometimes<00:01:51.490> what<00:01:52.490> I<00:01:52.520> do<00:01:52.670> is<00:01:53.120> I

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
there I end up sometimes what I do is I

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.230 
there I end up sometimes what I do is I
turn<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.560> end<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.190> it<00:01:55.310> doesn't<00:01:55.580> fray<00:01:55.910> at<00:01:56.060> the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
turn the end so it doesn't fray at the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.890 
turn the end so it doesn't fray at the
end<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:56.660> I<00:01:57.350> try<00:01:57.620> to<00:01:57.650> fit<00:01:57.980> it<00:01:58.100> through<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:59.690> just

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
end and I try to fit it through and just

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.200 
end and I try to fit it through and just
kind<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.200> jam<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.770> in<00:02:00.890> there<00:02:01.100> till<00:02:01.910> I<00:02:02.000> get

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
kind of jam it in there till I get

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.610 
kind of jam it in there till I get
enough<00:02:02.480> of<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.720> piece<00:02:02.960> where<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:03.200> can<00:02:03.380> pull<00:02:03.590> it

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
enough of a piece where I can pull it

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.430 
enough of a piece where I can pull it
through<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:07.240> if<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:08.330> frays<00:02:08.660> I<00:02:08.990> just<00:02:09.170> kind<00:02:09.350> of

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
through and if it frays I just kind of

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.080 
through and if it frays I just kind of
twist<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:09.800> back<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:13.160> what<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.520> typically<00:02:14.060> do<00:02:14.450> is

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
twist it back and what I typically do is

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.480 
twist it back and what I typically do is
in<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.510> again<00:02:18.080> everyone<00:02:18.770> does<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.340> little

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
in and again everyone does it a little

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.470 
in and again everyone does it a little
bit<00:02:19.670> different<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.360> way<00:02:20.540> works<00:02:20.840> for<00:02:21.020> me<00:02:22.480> so

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
bit different this way works for me so

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
bit different this way works for me so
I'm<00:02:23.570> going<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.750> go<00:02:23.840> ahead<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.110> show<00:02:24.230> you<00:02:24.290> what

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
I'm going to go ahead and show you what

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.180 
I'm going to go ahead and show you what
I<00:02:24.530> do<00:02:24.680> I'm<00:02:25.490> just<00:02:25.550> going<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:25.820> turn<00:02:26.030> my<00:02:26.209> work<00:02:27.190> like

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
I do I'm just going to turn my work like

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.350 
I do I'm just going to turn my work like
so<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:31.040> just<00:02:31.730> start<00:02:32.000> weaving<00:02:32.300> in<00:02:34.270> some<00:02:35.270> of

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
so and I just start weaving in some of

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.770 
so and I just start weaving in some of
these<00:02:35.450> stitches<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:38.060> just<00:02:38.300> kind<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.600> go

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
these stitches and I just kind of go

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.979 
these stitches and I just kind of go
every<00:02:39.290> other<00:02:39.320> one<00:02:40.030> kind<00:02:41.030> of<00:02:41.209> push<00:02:41.450> my<00:02:41.750> needle

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
every other one kind of push my needle

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.160 
every other one kind of push my needle
through

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.260 

there's<00:02:45.170> not<00:02:45.380> really<00:02:45.770> a<00:02:45.950> perfect<00:02:46.520> way<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:46.910> do

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
there's not really a perfect way to do

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:54.820 
there's not really a perfect way to do
this<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.730> just<00:02:52.760> take<00:02:53.630> this<00:02:53.959> I<00:02:54.230> kind<00:02:54.530> of<00:02:54.590> hold

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
this and I just take this I kind of hold

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.699 
this and I just take this I kind of hold
this<00:02:55.220> end<00:02:55.550> right<00:02:56.209> here<00:02:58.989> and<00:02:59.989> I<00:03:00.170> just<00:03:00.200> pull

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
this end right here and I just pull

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.470 
this end right here and I just pull
through<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:04.370> then<00:03:04.550> what<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:04.730> do<00:03:04.880> is<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.180> kind<00:03:05.360> of

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
through and then what I do is I kind of

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.860 
through and then what I do is I kind of
pull<00:03:05.840> it<00:03:05.870> down<00:03:06.800> pull<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:08.030> little<00:03:08.209> bit<00:03:08.300> more<00:03:08.600> out

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
pull it down pull a little bit more out

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.340 
pull it down pull a little bit more out
and<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:10.730> snip<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.390> end<00:03:13.600> so<00:03:14.600> that<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:14.900> kind<00:03:15.110> then

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
and I snip the end so that it kind then

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.199 
and I snip the end so that it kind then
I<00:03:15.410> kind<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:15.650> pull<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:16.250> again<00:03:16.520> so<00:03:16.760> that<00:03:16.910> it<00:03:17.000> kind

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
I kind of pull it again so that it kind

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:24.160 
I kind of pull it again so that it kind
of<00:03:17.860> tucks<00:03:18.860> itself<00:03:19.310> back<00:03:19.550> in<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:21.650> that's<00:03:21.980> it
