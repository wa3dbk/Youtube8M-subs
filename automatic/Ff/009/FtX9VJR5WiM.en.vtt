my<00:00:38.850> lime<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.719> what<00:00:39.899> makes<00:00:40.050> me<00:00:40.200> feel

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
my lime and this is what makes me feel

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.220 
my lime and this is what makes me feel
like<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:41.010> need<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.579> scramble<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.180> when<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.870> don't

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
like I need to scramble and when I don't

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.660 
like I need to scramble and when I don't
have<00:00:43.410> any<00:00:43.530> pressure<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.370> go<00:00:44.520> out<00:00:44.640> to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
have any pressure as I go out to

have any pressure as I go out to
scramble<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.450> also<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:45.930> subsequently

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
scramble this is also what subsequently

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.930 
scramble this is also what subsequently
makes<00:00:46.620> me<00:00:46.770> take<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.950> look<00:00:47.160> at<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> replay<00:00:47.489> Kaz

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.670 
makes me take a look at a replay Kaz
what<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> expected<00:00:48.780> fundamentally<00:00:49.500> from

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
what I expected fundamentally from

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.889 
what I expected fundamentally from
football<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.340> didn't<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.000> replicated<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:51.750> this

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
football I didn't see replicated so this

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.930 
football I didn't see replicated so this
is<00:00:52.050> what<00:00:52.230> makes<00:00:52.829> me<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.309> myself<00:00:53.460> okay

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
is what makes me think to myself okay

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.340 
is what makes me think to myself okay
need<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.210> go<00:00:54.329> back<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.539> take<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> look<00:00:54.989> at<00:00:55.230> this

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
need to go back and take a look at this

about here is Justin Tuck because tuck

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.939 
about here is Justin Tuck because tuck
actually<00:01:00.180> rushes<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.320> outside<00:01:01.800> of

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
actually rushes to the outside of

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.039 
actually rushes to the outside of
chairlifts<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.329> don't<00:01:03.510> mind<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.930> he

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
chairlifts and I don't mind that he

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.020 
chairlifts and I don't mind that he
stops<00:01:04.350> right<00:01:04.619> here<00:01:04.650> as<00:01:04.949> i<00:01:05.189> go<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> scramble<00:01:05.909> out

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
stops right here as i go to scramble out

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.609 
stops right here as i go to scramble out
and<00:01:06.240> maybe<00:01:06.420> assess<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> different<00:01:07.229> angle<00:01:07.530> but

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
and maybe assess a different angle but

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.170 
and maybe assess a different angle but
what<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.799> don't<00:01:07.890> understand<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> angle<00:01:09.060> he

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
what I don't understand is the angle he

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.210 
what I don't understand is the angle he
ultimately<00:01:09.540> takes<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.200> mean<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.890> can<00:01:11.010> see

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
ultimately takes I mean you can see

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.580 
ultimately takes I mean you can see
we're<00:01:11.369> lucky<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.060> see<00:01:12.210> where<00:01:12.360> he<00:01:12.540> is

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
we're lucky as you can see where he is

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.320 
we're lucky as you can see where he is
where<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.770> he<00:01:13.920> running<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.939> pursuit

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
where is he running to in this pursuit

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.060 
where is he running to in this pursuit
it's<00:01:15.540> not<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.930> where<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> quarterback<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.590> I

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
it's not to where the quarterback is I

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.190 
it's not to where the quarterback is I
mean<00:01:17.580> he's<00:01:17.759> basically<00:01:18.210> running<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.810> halo

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
mean he's basically running in a halo

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.469 
mean he's basically running in a halo
around<00:01:19.380> me<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.799> about<00:01:20.040> five<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.880> eight<00:01:20.970> yards

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
around me of about five to eight yards

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.539 
around me of about five to eight yards
so<00:01:22.140> that's<00:01:22.470> something<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.860> don't<00:01:22.890> understand

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
so that's something I don't understand

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.160 
so that's something I don't understand
but<00:01:23.700> more<00:01:23.850> importantly<00:01:24.360> when<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:24.659> go<00:01:24.810> back<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
but more importantly when we go back and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.039 
but more importantly when we go back and
we<00:01:25.229> take<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> look<00:01:25.680> at<00:01:25.830> Jill<00:01:26.580> reads<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.150> how<00:01:27.840> is

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
we take a look at Jill reads here how is

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.160 
we take a look at Jill reads here how is
he<00:01:28.080> able<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.619> find<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.729> way<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.780> get<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.049> this

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
he able to find a way to get in this
