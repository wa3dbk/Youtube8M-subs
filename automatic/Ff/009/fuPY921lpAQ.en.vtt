00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:10.889
 rome in tiel is a point namely 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.669
 learn everything about the pension agreement in these lessons 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.759
 at the end, no less than 3 0 can play accor 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.480
 we are short here 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.589
 a new record 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.050
 shortened by this week 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.480
 in the handbook you can read all the information as well as existing 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.539
 chords also printed 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.230
 that recognizes its own corps most importantly because you have the number of lessons 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.650
 first break 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.530
 play this 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.300
 and in that case, two years shorter 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.300
 And put your forefinger sometimes 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.510
 for example when f was agreed and if you can do this you can do almost all 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.450
 play cordell 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.830
 the coalition agreement 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.050
 it has a detail like the a6 h 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.930
 very easy in this case was in the previous game 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.290
 can see 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.390
 that the strings 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.180
 daan 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.280
 not expensive 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.110
 then go 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.110
 speaks that that is the name of the lock 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.940
 That means you have to read quietly 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.520
 but keep your promises that is also the puddle bought last year 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.010
 and this is also important to know because in the last lessons lee to the 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.009
 to play along with pop music on the basis of bass tones 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.490
 well we start so with an agreement geert the blanket shop is like bark anp 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.950
 then you always put first in forefinger 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.950
 in this case at the first position of the mind 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.800
 your middle finger is there 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.400
 that's the fine boy in the second position today and then you still have 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.350
 ring finger 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.880
 in second position of this horrible inc that 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.510
 today it is nice that i have the carillon 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.920
 equip the man 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.260
 little boy in the center getting really hard when we got the 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.460
 Breuer Short to play I think about your attitude to 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.999
 a guitar on his knee 

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:07.200
 the dunes in the middle fine as 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.789
 Estate Bugense that you have no heavy cracking and then you can play 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.400
 at reactor 2 you can do all 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.949
 senna the attacks 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:19.029
 and you can now start playing four-quarters with the work 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:20.579
 with this coalition agreement 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.579
 a tough climb from sohar 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.309
 well then they immediately go home 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:31.879
 videos and pay more attention to it 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.359
 You are going to make yourself easy instead of making it difficult 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:36.480
 play chord now 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.199
 and then your index finger may enter the reserve bank 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.199
 pity I think you are planned on which you like 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.169
 playing in a new chord and with growth that something 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:48.279
 trieste immediately agrees 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:51.700
 yes but no problem there was the light at the end of the tunnel 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.539
 and 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.979
 that is your index finger back 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:57.979
 we want to be a happy one again 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.059
 the handbook is divided into four short clear ones 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.169
 now the food 7 agrees 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:11.859
 and a 7 short is often one or just so short of it and yes another accord 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.539
 the parking lot to an agreement 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:17.799
 so it's used to it and now you get we think I went off 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.270
 and if you don't know what you like, then 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.039
 can form students do he is that it is harder to move wisely 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:30.999
 There are plenty of people who give your nails different colors of nail polish or animals 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:33.699
 let's speak the letters on them 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:35.909
 it is also over again 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.009
 as from it concerns out 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:41.729
 watch what you do rows the finger that goes up in the air in jan de vries 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:42.949
 stay 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:47.359
 I have everything together and and your proofs are shortened 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:50.540
 all in all 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.720
 learning how to play limburg in short, and that in three 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.439
 variants the coalition agreement 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.009
 an agreement 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.009
 that shortened this week 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.929
 next to these agreements with the bree 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:09.139
 then you can play all possible chords the two over number of lessons 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:13.419
 In this case, for example, can give 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.409
 g minor 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.409
 not a shit 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:22.809
 happy goes now is practicing these chords for that I have a special or one 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:24.509
 video empathy again 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:26.659
 can also bother you 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.199
 and then i could go tip print chords from the handbook out at home 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.229
 on the wall you can sail or put your monitor on simon or make up a place 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.460
 can play easily from traveling 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.710
