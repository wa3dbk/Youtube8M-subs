top of the packaging and again what

top of the packaging and again what
really<00:00:24.210> makes<00:00:24.600> me<00:00:25.289> really<00:00:25.650> like<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.519> new<00:00:26.699> 2009

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
really makes me really like the new 2009

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.880 
really makes me really like the new 2009
packaging<00:00:27.840> it's<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> lot<00:00:28.109> easier<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.740> find

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
packaging it's a lot easier to find

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.589 
packaging it's a lot easier to find
characters<00:00:29.340> rather<00:00:29.640> than<00:00:29.880> looking<00:00:30.150> for<00:00:30.390> on

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
characters rather than looking for on

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.540 
characters rather than looking for on
the<00:00:31.109> left<00:00:31.320> or<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.590> right<00:00:31.679> side<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> base

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the left or the right side of the base

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.700 
the left or the right side of the base
of<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.820> package<00:00:33.210> when<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.899> shuffling

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
of the package when you shuffling

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.380 
of the package when you shuffling
through<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> pegs<00:00:35.190> it's<00:00:35.700> easy<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.030> find<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
through the pegs it's easy to find the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.780 
through the pegs it's easy to find the
character<00:00:36.780> because<00:00:37.110> they're<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.800> big<00:00:38.489> picture

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
character because they're a big picture

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.910 
character because they're a big picture
of<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> character<00:00:39.300> close<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> picture<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.710> on

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
of the character close a picture is on

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.819 
of the character close a picture is on
the<00:00:41.790> top<00:00:42.120> part<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.050> while<00:00:43.320> you're<00:00:43.469> looking

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.740 
the top part so while you're looking
through<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> shelves<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.730> know<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:45.390> easier

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
through the shelves you know it's easier

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.160 
through the shelves you know it's easier
to<00:00:45.870> find<00:00:46.079> them<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.500> very<00:00:46.770> very<00:00:47.100> cool<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:48.170> this

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
to find them so very very cool and this

image<00:01:31.439> from<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:32.130> Clone<00:01:32.340> Wars<00:01:32.369> series<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
image from the Clone Wars series the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.690 
image from the Clone Wars series the
animated<00:01:34.140> series<00:01:34.409> episode<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:35.670> I

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
animated series episode and this one I

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.630 
animated series episode and this one I
believe<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.299> from<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.400> where<00:01:38.549> they're

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
believe is from the one where they're

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.380 
believe is from the one where they're
looking<00:01:38.880> for<00:01:39.090> r2d2<00:01:40.820> possibly<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.880> think<00:01:41.939> it's

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
looking for r2d2 possibly I think it's

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.710 
looking for r2d2 possibly I think it's
this<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.869> dual<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.259> droids<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.520> very<00:01:45.450> very

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
this is dual of the droids so very very

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.039 
this is dual of the droids so very very
cool

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
cool

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.190 
cool
and<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.829> course<00:01:47.070> pictures<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:49.079> other

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
and of course pictures of all the other

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.899 
and of course pictures of all the other
action<00:01:49.530> figures<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.920> wave<00:01:50.070> well<00:01:50.579> not<00:01:50.729> all

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
action figures in the wave well not all

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.399 
action figures in the wave well not all
of<00:01:50.939> them<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.210> most<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.540> them<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.840> you'll

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.000 
you'll notice that it's great that the
lines<00:04:21.780> are<00:04:21.930> very<00:04:21.989> thin<00:04:22.440> I<00:04:22.470> think<00:04:22.770> they<00:04:22.860> should

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
lines are very thin I think they should

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.300 
lines are very thin I think they should
have<00:04:23.040> made<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.370> little<00:04:23.550> bit

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
have made it a little bit

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.790 
have made it a little bit
because<00:04:24.820> if<00:04:24.970> you<00:04:25.060> look<00:04:25.330> at<00:04:25.660> the<00:04:25.990> close-up

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
because if you look at the close-up

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.170 
because if you look at the close-up
image<00:04:27.570> of<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:28.660> character<00:04:29.310> okay<00:04:30.310> or<00:04:30.550> even<00:04:30.610> here

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180
