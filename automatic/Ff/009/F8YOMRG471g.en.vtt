controller as a 360 driver on your

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.029 
controller as a 360 driver on your
computer<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.140> go<00:00:43.440> ahead<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.620> open<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:46.039> go

controller<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:04.519> alright<00:01:05.519> I'm<00:01:05.610> gonna<00:01:05.820> put<00:01:06.030> my

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
controller so alright I'm gonna put my

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.840 
controller so alright I'm gonna put my
controller<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.750> start<00:01:07.670> alright

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
controller so you start alright

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.810 
controller so you start alright
so<00:01:09.630> when<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:09.990> open<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.320> up<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:11.549> gonna<00:01:11.670> say

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
so when you open that up it's gonna say

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.550 
so when you open that up it's gonna say
no<00:01:12.000> controllers<00:01:12.420> detected<00:01:12.930> whatever

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
no controllers detected whatever

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.260 
no controllers detected whatever
whatever<00:01:14.330> go<00:01:15.330> ahead<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.100> use<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.460> think<00:01:18.180> you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
whatever go ahead and use I think you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.789 
whatever go ahead and use I think you
can<00:01:18.390> use<00:01:18.509> Bluetooth<00:01:18.900> too<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.259> your<00:01:19.409> computer

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
can use Bluetooth too if your computer

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.679 
can use Bluetooth too if your computer
has<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.920> Bluetooth<00:01:20.189> driver<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.540> use

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
has a Bluetooth driver but I just use

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.030 
has a Bluetooth driver but I just use
the<00:01:21.810> wire<00:01:22.110> because<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.530> easier<00:01:22.890> and

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the wire because it's easier and

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.560 
the wire because it's easier and
probably<00:01:23.670> better<00:01:23.759> response<00:01:24.119> time<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.479> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
probably better response time and it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.399 
probably better response time and it
doesn't<00:01:24.720> die<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.140> me

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
doesn't die on me

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.219 
doesn't die on me
so<00:01:26.330> plug<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.450> your<00:01:27.540> controller<00:01:27.869> with<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
so plug in your controller with the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.600 
so plug in your controller with the
cable<00:01:30.350> they<00:01:31.350> give<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> ps4<00:01:31.950> you're<00:01:32.520> gonna

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
cable they give you the ps4 you're gonna

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.690 
cable they give you the ps4 you're gonna
get<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.850> noise<00:01:34.100> probably<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.310> then<00:01:35.460> you're

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
get that noise probably and then you're

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.160 
get that noise probably and then you're
gonna<00:01:35.790> get<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.240> show<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:36.960> going<00:01:37.110> to

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
gonna get this show up it's going to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.530 
gonna get this show up it's going to
show<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.530> IDB<00:01:37.920> controller<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.909> status<00:01:39.420> if

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
show the IDB controller the status if

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.569 
show the IDB controller the status if
it's<00:01:39.659> plugged<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.079> or<00:01:40.320> bluetooth<00:01:40.650> battery

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
it's plugged in or bluetooth battery

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.130 
it's plugged in or bluetooth battery
full<00:01:41.790> whatever<00:01:42.540> selected<00:01:42.930> profile<00:01:45.140> it's

full whatever selected profile it's

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.230 
full whatever selected profile it's
gonna<00:01:46.320> say<00:01:46.470> default<00:01:46.759> but<00:01:47.759> we're<00:01:47.880> gonna<00:01:47.970> change

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
gonna say default but we're gonna change

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.149 
gonna say default but we're gonna change
that<00:01:48.540> because<00:01:48.899> for<00:01:49.229> me<00:01:49.290> default<00:01:49.860> wasn't

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
that because for me default wasn't

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:57.350 
that because for me default wasn't
working<00:01:52.790> go<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.850> profile<00:01:55.640> well<00:01:56.640> if<00:01:57.210> you

have the 360 drivers in order to emulate
this<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> way<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.239> computer<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.929> recognize

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
this so I way the computer can recognize

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.719 
this so I way the computer can recognize
it

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
it

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.229

yeah<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:11.959> go<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.230> profile<00:02:12.790> we're<00:02:13.790> gonna<00:02:13.970> start

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
yeah so go to profile we're gonna start

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.190 
yeah so go to profile we're gonna start
a<00:02:14.420> brand<00:02:14.720> new<00:02:14.870> one<00:02:16.480> it's<00:02:17.480> real<00:02:17.660> simple<00:02:17.900> once

the<00:04:59.110> arrow<00:04:59.790> pointing<00:05:00.790> up<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.169> then<00:05:02.169> to<00:05:02.320> aim

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
the arrow pointing up and then to aim

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.130 
the arrow pointing up and then to aim
down<00:05:02.830> I'm<00:05:03.730> gonna<00:05:03.940> push<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.450> right<00:05:04.600> stick<00:05:04.930> down

down I'm gonna push the right stick down
gonna<00:05:05.650> pop<00:05:05.830> up<00:05:06.010> again<00:05:06.270> and<00:05:07.270> it's<00:05:07.480> the<00:05:07.570> same

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
gonna pop up again and it's the same

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.980 
gonna pop up again and it's the same
thing<00:05:08.669> so<00:05:09.669> just<00:05:09.910> keep<00:05:10.030> doing<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:10.360> until<00:05:10.570> you

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
thing so just keep doing that until you

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.530 
thing so just keep doing that until you
completely<00:05:11.530> a<00:05:11.730> jet<00:05:12.730> it<00:05:12.850> to<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.060> way<00:05:13.180> you<00:05:13.240> like

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540

completely a jet it to the way you like
it<00:05:13.570> and<00:05:13.870> everything<00:05:14.320> and<00:05:14.500> it<00:05:15.490> should<00:05:16.680> be

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
it and everything and it should be

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.560 
it and everything and it should be
smooth<00:05:18.250> sailing<00:05:18.729> from<00:05:18.880> there<00:05:18.940> you'll<00:05:19.390> be<00:05:19.450> able

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
smooth sailing from there you'll be able

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.520 
smooth sailing from there you'll be able
to<00:05:19.720> just<00:05:19.870> open<00:05:20.620> this<00:05:20.979> up<00:05:21.040> and<00:05:22.200> open<00:05:23.200> each<00:05:23.320> hour

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
to just open this up and open each hour

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.290 
to just open this up and open each hour
and<00:05:23.800> it'll<00:05:23.979> automatically<00:05:24.430> just<00:05:24.700> start<00:05:24.970> going

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
and it'll automatically just start going

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.100 
and it'll automatically just start going
so<00:05:25.919> so<00:05:26.919> it's<00:05:27.100> basically<00:05:27.479> name<00:05:28.479> your<00:05:28.660> profile

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
so so it's basically name your profile

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.540 
so so it's basically name your profile
then<00:05:29.919> save<00:05:30.310> it<00:05:30.490> and<00:05:31.290> then<00:05:32.290> from<00:05:32.740> now<00:05:32.860> on<00:05:33.070> so

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
then save it and then from now on so

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.340 
then save it and then from now on so
when<00:05:33.790> you<00:05:33.910> open<00:05:33.940> this<00:05:34.240> program<00:05:37.050> and<00:05:38.050> you<00:05:38.200> plug

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
when you open this program and you plug

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.159 
when you open this program and you plug
your<00:05:38.410> controller<00:05:38.830> in<00:05:39.750> you're<00:05:40.750> gonna<00:05:40.870> have<00:05:41.050> the

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
your controller in you're gonna have the

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.320 
your controller in you're gonna have the
same<00:05:41.380> thing<00:05:41.460> make<00:05:42.460> sure<00:05:42.700> you<00:05:42.820> select<00:05:43.060> a

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
same thing make sure you select a

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.680 
same thing make sure you select a
profile<00:05:44.220> whatever<00:05:45.220> you<00:05:45.310> named<00:05:45.550> it<00:05:45.729> test<00:05:46.330> or

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
profile whatever you named it test or

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.110 
profile whatever you named it test or
h-hour<00:05:47.320> or<00:05:47.440> whatever<00:05:47.680> I<00:05:47.890> have<00:05:48.070> mine<00:05:48.250> HR<00:05:48.669> but<00:05:48.850> I

everything so I'm not gonna change it

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.360 
everything so I'm not gonna change it
once<00:05:55.960> you<00:05:56.080> do<00:05:56.229> that<00:05:56.260> you<00:05:56.680> pretty<00:05:56.919> much<00:05:57.040> just<00:05:57.100> go

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
once you do that you pretty much just go

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.280 
once you do that you pretty much just go
ahead<00:05:57.430> and<00:05:57.669> open<00:05:57.729> H<00:05:58.090> our<00:05:58.300> and<00:05:58.600> start<00:05:59.020> playing

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
once you start using a controller it

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.890 
once you start using a controller it
automatically<00:06:02.620> will<00:06:03.630> start<00:06:04.630> doing<00:06:04.810> the

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
automatically will start doing the

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
had the vibration in the controller when
