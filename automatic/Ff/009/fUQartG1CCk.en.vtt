00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.639 
potent for MMA because you can build
well<00:01:51.780> he<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.049> load<00:01:52.170> up<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.320> drops<00:01:52.500> down

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
well he can load up the drops down

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.609 
well he can load up the drops down
hereish<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.340> then<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:53.820> fly<00:01:53.970> straight<00:01:54.000> him

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
hereish and then just fly straight him

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.600 
hereish and then just fly straight him
something<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.649> he<00:01:55.799> undoes<00:01:56.189> need<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.520> be<00:01:56.579> a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
something that he undoes need to be a

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.100 
something that he undoes need to be a
little<00:01:56.820> bit<00:01:56.909> careful<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.780> only<00:01:57.960> worse

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
little bit careful the only worse

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.050 
little bit careful the only worse
positions<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:58.979> if<00:01:59.130> MMA<00:01:59.490> was<00:01:59.700> here

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
positions and that is if MMA was here

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.819 
positions and that is if MMA was here
because<00:02:00.479> then<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.960> course<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.530> land<00:02:01.710> on

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
because then of course you can land on

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.010 
because then of course you can land on
this<00:02:02.040> cliffy<00:02:02.579> area<00:02:02.909> which<00:02:03.390> obviously<00:02:03.840> is

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
this cliffy area which obviously is

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.240 
this cliffy area which obviously is
quite<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> long<00:02:04.469> way<00:02:04.619> away<00:02:04.740> from<00:02:05.130> your

quite a long way away from your

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.249 
quite a long way away from your
naturally<00:02:05.700> make<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.180> quite<00:02:06.630> awkward<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.140> come

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
naturally make it quite awkward to come

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.589 
naturally make it quite awkward to come
in<00:02:07.380> there<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.590> defend<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.979> but<00:02:08.069> yeah<00:02:08.300> CC<00:02:09.300> first

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599

production tab because here at any

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.209 
production tab because here at any
moment<00:03:04.959> could<00:03:05.469> start<00:03:05.799> getting<00:03:06.010> pretty

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:06.219 
moment could start getting pretty

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:08.490 
moment could start getting pretty
aggressive<00:03:06.699> larvae<00:03:07.540> arm<00:03:07.750> banked<00:03:08.079> up<00:03:08.169> yet

aggressive larvae arm banked up yet

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.629 
aggressive larvae arm banked up yet
because<00:03:08.739> obviously<00:03:08.829> he<00:03:09.010> needs<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.370> Queen's

because obviously he needs the Queen's
out<00:03:09.879> but<00:03:10.120> he<00:03:10.840> could<00:03:10.959> suddenly<00:03:11.139> start<00:03:11.469> putting

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
out but he could suddenly start putting

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.959 
out but he could suddenly start putting
on<00:03:11.709> a<00:03:11.769> bit<00:03:11.889> of<00:03:11.980> pain<00:03:12.129> if<00:03:12.340> he<00:03:12.489> wants<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.819> in<00:03:12.909> the

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
near future this overlord coming in just

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.830 
near future this overlord coming in just
trying<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:15.819> get<00:03:15.969> some<00:03:16.060> scouting<00:03:16.299> information

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
trying to get some scouting information

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.939 
trying to get some scouting information
gonna<00:03:16.989> be<00:03:17.049> like<00:03:17.169> okay<00:03:17.409> what's<00:03:17.590> coming<00:03:17.829> down

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:17.949 
gonna be like okay what's coming down

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.039 
gonna be like okay what's coming down
we'll<00:03:18.129> see<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.370> factory<00:03:18.780> when<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:19.870> by<00:03:19.989> the

we'll see the factory when I by the

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.929 
we'll see the factory when I by the
timings<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:20.680> this<00:03:20.859> was<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.250> command<00:03:21.879> center
