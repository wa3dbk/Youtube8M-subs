basically really the only difference

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.869 
basically really the only difference
from<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:52.230> previous<00:00:52.320> controller<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
from the previous controller is the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.439 
from the previous controller is the
thumbsticks<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.170> d-pad<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.370> ABX<00:00:56.789> y<00:00:57.000> buttons

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
thumbsticks the d-pad the ABX y buttons

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.779 
thumbsticks the d-pad the ABX y buttons
and<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.020> controller<00:00:58.410> color<00:00:58.680> itself<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
and the controller color itself on the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.689 
and the controller color itself on the
controller<00:01:00.120> color<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> really<00:01:01.140> nice<00:01:01.699> flat

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
controller color is a really nice flat

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.299 
controller color is a really nice flat
silver<00:01:03.329> color<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.350> looks<00:01:04.619> really<00:01:04.949> good

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
and actually it kind of gives it a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.179 
and actually it kind of gives it a
little<00:01:08.369> bit<00:01:08.580> more<00:01:08.700> grip<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.150> your<00:01:09.270> hands<00:01:10.189> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
different shades of grey so it's kind of

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.999 
different shades of grey so it's kind of
different<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.549> cool<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:22.259> thumbsticks

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
had on them on the previous version so

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.929 
had on them on the previous version so
they're<00:01:28.259> kind<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.590> really<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:28.920> flat<00:01:29.610> um

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.480 
they're kind of really just flat um
they're<00:01:30.509> actually<00:01:30.900> not<00:01:30.930> too<00:01:31.470> bad<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:32.009> honestly

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
they're actually not too bad I honestly

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.030 
they're actually not too bad I honestly
prefer<00:01:33.020> ps3<00:01:34.020> thumbsticks<00:01:34.530> took<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.950> my

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
prefer ps3 thumbsticks took one of my

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.580 
prefer ps3 thumbsticks took one of my
controllers<00:01:35.549> but<00:01:35.759> that's<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.210> me<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
controllers but that's just me and the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.140 
controllers but that's just me and the
biggest<00:01:37.920> thing<00:01:38.159> about<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.729> controller

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
biggest thing about the controller

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.910 
biggest thing about the controller
that's<00:01:39.270> new<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.689> d-pad<00:01:40.700> now<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:42.680> it's<00:01:43.680> got

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that's new is the d-pad now it it's got

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.289 
that's new is the d-pad now it it's got
two<00:01:44.130> different<00:01:44.430> things<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.820> kind<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.119> just

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
two different things you kind of just

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.230 
two different things you kind of just
spin<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.649> either<00:01:46.770> stays<00:01:47.430> how<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
spin it and it either stays how the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.660 
spin it and it either stays how the
previous<00:01:49.140> one<00:01:49.320> was<00:01:49.560> or<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.040> spin<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
previous one was or you spin it to the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.999 
previous one was or you spin it to the
left<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.270> kind<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.600> becomes<00:01:52.290> embossed<00:01:52.770> so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
left and it kind of becomes embossed so

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.209 
left and it kind of becomes embossed so
it's<00:01:53.189> raised<00:01:53.490> up<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.090> controller<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:55.219> that

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
it's raised up up the controller on that

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.980 
it's raised up up the controller on that
really<00:01:56.490> doesn't<00:01:56.700> do<00:01:56.939> anything<00:01:57.270> for<00:01:57.329> me<00:01:57.630> you

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
really doesn't do anything for me you

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.039 
really doesn't do anything for me you
know<00:01:58.020> i<00:01:58.259> barely<00:01:59.070> use<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.610> like<00:02:00.360> because<00:02:00.750> mainly

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
