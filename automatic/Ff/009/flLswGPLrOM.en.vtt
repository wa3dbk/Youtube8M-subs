00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
holding over that area is already joined

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.320 
holding over that area is already joined
where<00:01:49.130> I<00:01:49.190> get<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.340> little<00:01:49.460> bit<00:01:49.670> more<00:01:49.820> tricky<00:01:50.060> you

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
where I get a little bit more tricky you

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.520 
where I get a little bit more tricky you
want<00:01:50.480> to<00:01:50.540> make<00:01:50.630> sure<00:01:50.660> that<00:01:50.900> you<00:01:51.020> don't<00:01:51.110> open<00:01:51.440> it

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
want to make sure that you don't open it

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:11.250

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
now we're getting towards the end of the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.520 
now we're getting towards the end of the
pages<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.599> it's<00:02:13.720> just<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.959> good<00:02:14.080> idea<00:02:14.170> to

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
pages and it's just a good idea to

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.449 
pages and it's just a good idea to
reinforce<00:02:15.040> these<00:02:15.220> pages<00:02:17.190> putting<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.310> glue

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
reinforce these pages putting the glue

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.890 
reinforce these pages putting the glue
in<00:02:18.580> this<00:02:18.730> area<00:02:19.060> it's<00:02:19.180> not<00:02:19.360> going<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:19.629> hurt<00:02:19.780> it

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
in this area it's not going to hurt it

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.300 
in this area it's not going to hurt it
it's<00:02:20.019> only<00:02:20.200> going<00:02:20.409> to<00:02:20.530> strengthen<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:21.010> amount

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
it's only going to strengthen the amount

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:31.660 
it's only going to strengthen the amount
of<00:02:21.400> youth<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.209> it'll<00:02:22.480> be<00:02:22.599> what<00:02:22.810> they<00:02:22.930> have

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.910

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.570 

I<00:02:37.110> should<00:02:38.110> be<00:02:38.230> fine<00:02:38.470> now<00:02:38.740> this<00:02:39.040> is<00:02:39.190> an<00:02:39.310> area

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
I should be fine now this is an area

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.100 
I should be fine now this is an area
that<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.819> typically<00:02:40.150> find<00:02:40.270> in<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.780> Bible
