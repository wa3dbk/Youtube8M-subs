00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.420
 today we prepare some skewers of baby squid with the ingredients 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.880
 squid small onions and parsley 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.810
 we started by cleaning the squid well under the water jet 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:21.779
 We separate the head and stomach and clean the outside by removing the skin and 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.779
 fins 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.169
 then we remove the pen and turn them over 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.630
 Now we count the onion 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.920
 juliana if we put it to poach in a pan over low heat 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.380
 after about an hour it will be ready if we remove it from the fire 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.230
 we also prepare a parsley oil with the blender 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.370
 and we cut the bread into infinite elongated slices 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.360
 finally cha we sound the baby squid 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.590
 and we alter ourselves in a pan with a little oil 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.590
 just a couple of minutes per side 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.780
 they only remain for the skewer 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.780
 place the onion on top of the bread 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.360
 then the baby squid 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.110
 we finish with a little more security 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.029
 a little chopped parsley over 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:14.029
 a few drops of parsley oil on the plate 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.839
 and that's it 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:20.369
