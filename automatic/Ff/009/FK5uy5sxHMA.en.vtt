to<00:00:53.400> offering<00:00:53.790> a<00:00:53.910> little<00:00:54.150> bit<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.600> yeah<00:00:55.200> we<00:00:55.320> got

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
to offering a little bit but yeah we got

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.540 
to offering a little bit but yeah we got
a<00:00:55.470> little<00:00:55.710> bit<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.920> snippet<00:00:56.310> there<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
a little bit of snippet there and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.980 
a little bit of snippet there and
actually<00:00:56.640> quality<00:00:57.120> was<00:00:57.450> really<00:00:57.690> impressive

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 
actually quality was really impressive

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.480 
actually quality was really impressive
and<00:00:58.140> even<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.560> freeze<00:00:58.860> frame<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.190> mean<00:00:59.400> it

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
and even on that freeze frame I mean it

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.990 
and even on that freeze frame I mean it
really<00:00:59.700> tailed

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
really tailed

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.790 
really tailed
gasps<00:01:02.630> a<00:01:02.660> little<00:01:02.870> even<00:01:03.590> though<00:01:03.680> it's

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
gasps a little even though it's

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.770 
gasps a little even though it's
buffering<00:01:04.100> now<00:01:04.309> after<00:01:04.850> member<00:01:05.210> so<00:01:05.420> that'll

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
buffering now after member so that'll

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.980 
buffering now after member so that'll
probably<00:01:05.990> smooth<00:01:06.320> out<00:01:06.530> of<00:01:06.710> it<00:01:07.060> yeah<00:01:08.060> BAM<00:01:08.690> lip

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
probably smooth out of it yeah BAM lip

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.610 
probably smooth out of it yeah BAM lip
is<00:01:09.230> just<00:01:09.260> not<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:11.750> resolution<00:01:12.229> acts<00:01:12.380> really

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
is just not the resolution acts really

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.830 
is just not the resolution acts really
isn't<00:01:13.280> anywhere<00:01:13.850> except<00:01:14.210> for<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.420> CES<00:01:14.810> show

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
isn't anywhere except for the CES show

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
have the EPG built right into the app so

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.340 
have the EPG built right into the app so
rather<00:01:59.800> than<00:01:59.980> have<00:02:00.130> defaulted<00:02:00.610> BG<00:02:01.150> on<00:02:01.450> the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
rather than have defaulted BG on the
