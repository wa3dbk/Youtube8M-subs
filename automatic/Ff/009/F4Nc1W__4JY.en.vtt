 dotcom letters and today I'm going to show you 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.919
 the content of the pokemon deck in the 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:21.550
 white friends and red this March has 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:23.250
 is based on the energies of fire and 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.070
 fight 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.840
 we have opened it and inside we can see 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.340
 that we have a currency in this case of 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.340
 red and black color 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.030
 a card in which from behind 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.920
 comes a code that we introduce in 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.470
 this page that is the official page of the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.770
 Pokemon online card game 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.780
 and we can play for these same cards 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.490
 online but of course to get this 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.290
 code you will have to buy the deck of 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.290
 pokemon of the white frenzy red 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.110
 then we have here the counters of 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.130

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.270

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.270
 the paper mat 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.940
 that using a couple of times 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.940
 it deteriorates a lot 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.810
 I recommend, as always, that you buy 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.009
