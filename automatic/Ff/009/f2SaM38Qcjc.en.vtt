00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.240
 Hey 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:23.590
 good day i'm chris upstairs 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.590
 have been in one industry for a few years 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.720
 just like many colleagues even though you 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.560
 I want fast cars for it 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.910
 make myself one too 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.910
 and then ordered and everyone 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.280
 I think so 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.530
 possibly succeeded 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.840
 problems then try to make it quickly 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.690
 is that now that I am always stuck with it 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.360
 fact that it is in writing at the bin 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.000
 has sitting and not on the wheels of 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.050
 the suspension 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.020
 So you're actually 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.760
 you can hang AV drains in it 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.060
 after which I register more than I have 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.850
 so no more brakes 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.250
 search for another gearbox 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.930
 a strong and gearbox then and then 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.909
 one to the bin 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.249
 came 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.659
 but I had the idea and US Bank but vs 

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:13.850
 bank is only 65 hp 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.280
 someone told me half a note 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.799
 sit in it 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.409
 no, so write to the man 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.590
 search for a super pac 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.420
 and the man I had the suit from 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.119
 how much grace that time attracts to it 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.570
 level equal alpha distress because you 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:37.040
 can even set an alpha 33m 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.040
 that fits so well that has 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.210
 the 95hp is not in this way 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.570
 stock engines are looking for someone 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:50.130
 the outward point 7- hour v-engine at 190 hp 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.280
 parts and I wanted very natural 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.310
 like to have to put this car 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.299
 building the car is 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.850
 then started with a 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:04.220
 Arie super bogies name 100l 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.539
 the same actually always 100 l only 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.700
 songs heavy strong stronger connected 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:13.330
 and hami super that all had four-cylinder 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.430
 engine so you actually with 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.610
 inspections would be less likely 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.610
 to get 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.159
 Oh 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.709
 that amici suppose we have 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.870
 natural hair must fit to 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.220
 to put that alpha engine there and 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.500
 to lay therein 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.180
 it is also slanted 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.620
 because otherwise not on top of the front 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.569
 bridge bath 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.120
 not so much that it is tilted 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.549
 at least of course no more oil 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.470
 In addition, I am actually the house there 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.450
 build around it 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.569
 of places and engine in the car 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.629
 a car to save man 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.819
 the most part with this car is your heart 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.920
 you a 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.680
 that you constantly think he is everyone 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.920
 With your will you can read your feet really 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.989
 do not hold the accelerator pedal 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.599
 Normally all those religions can be an inch 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.969
 up from a really beautiful car 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.340
 I think that is very successful 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:14.540
 my have a picture because make and 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.130
 in addition, it can also be one 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.870
 horribly fast 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.570
 and the funny thing is that as people 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.370
 indeed after your trip they stick the thumb 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.900
 up from london nice car you have and 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.450
 then you give a point to guests who have that 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.340
 I can only do one more 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.710
 is a big disadvantage to Jews 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.480
 not really only runs on six then unfortunately 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.670
 foot of the accelerator pedal not to 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.260
 fold 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.810
 therefore you really drive on 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.550
 six if you are quiet so rows of series 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.550
 maybe the one 12 or something but then 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.980
 it is almost never possible 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.690
 funny is that the quito km 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.560
 counter 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.560
 I beat for measured 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.500
 but yes nowadays very nice ones 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.810
 everything 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.810
 hereby we are gone via gps 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.620
 that is a lot of accuracy than mine 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:04.220
 count my own at my gallery 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.740
 well anyway 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.720
 the you already give 100 that they do 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.490
 at my counter lap time then row 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.880
 you around 140 or so and so 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.760
 go that 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.650
 if you drive the 120, I will jamal out of the 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.069
 counter driven here 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.110
 and then about 180 drove 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:27.250
 but that is reflected in the rich scents of 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.250
 two centimeters open
