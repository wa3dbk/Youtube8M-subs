00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.140 
right so yeah there's another village
here<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.130> don't<00:02:41.610> think<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:41.819> one<00:02:42.000> has<00:02:42.120> a

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
here I don't think this one has a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.720 
here I don't think this one has a
blacksmith<00:02:42.630> either<00:02:43.580> just<00:02:44.580> more<00:02:44.760> food<00:02:45.290> so

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
blacksmith either just more food so

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.259 
blacksmith either just more food so
that's<00:02:47.730> good<00:02:48.480> right

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
that's good right

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.720 
that's good right
so<00:02:51.269> far<00:02:51.540> Savannah<00:02:51.959> plateaux<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.700> then<00:02:53.700> I

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
so far Savannah plateaux and then I

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.559 
so far Savannah plateaux and then I
believe<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:55.110> next<00:02:55.380> place<00:02:55.860> if<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:57.060> remember

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
believe the next place if I remember

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.199 
believe the next place if I remember
correctly<00:02:58.049> is<00:02:58.319> pretty<00:02:58.769> much<00:02:58.980> West<00:02:59.819> with<00:03:00.180> a

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.019 
I didn't really actually honestly see it
so<00:05:16.159> I<00:05:17.439> think<00:05:18.439> the<00:05:18.770> gravel<00:05:19.400> may<00:05:19.550> have<00:05:19.669> just

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:20.029 
so I think the gravel may have just

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:21.879 
so I think the gravel may have just
updated<00:05:20.289> because<00:05:21.289> I<00:05:21.379> came<00:05:21.439> by<00:05:21.710> here<00:05:21.860> before

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
updated because I came by here before

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.350 
updated because I came by here before
and<00:05:22.310> I<00:05:22.370> don't<00:05:22.430> recall<00:05:22.759> seeing<00:05:23.469> that<00:05:24.469> hole<00:05:24.680> so

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
and I don't recall seeing that hole so

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.659 
and I don't recall seeing that hole so
yeah<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:27.289> next<00:05:27.529> way<00:05:27.949> we<00:05:28.099> want<00:05:28.310> to<00:05:28.339> go<00:05:28.460> is

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
yeah the next way we want to go is

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.029 
yeah the next way we want to go is
actually<00:05:29.110> pretty<00:05:30.110> much<00:05:30.199> follow<00:05:30.469> the<00:05:30.650> border

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
actually pretty much follow the border

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.899 
actually pretty much follow the border
between<00:05:31.479> the<00:05:32.479> plains<00:05:32.719> and<00:05:33.500> little<00:05:34.400> stretch<00:05:34.789> of

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:34.909 
between the plains and little stretch of

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:37.269 
between the plains and little stretch of
desert<00:05:35.000> and<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.779> Mesa<00:05:35.930> as<00:05:36.469> you<00:05:36.589> can<00:05:36.680> see<00:05:36.800> it's

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:37.279 
desert and the Mesa as you can see it's

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:40.089 
desert and the Mesa as you can see it's
good<00:05:37.460> Mesa<00:05:37.669> that's<00:05:38.629> a<00:05:38.779> decent<00:05:38.960> size<00:05:39.169> it's<00:05:39.889> not

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
good Mesa that's a decent size it's not

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.999 
good Mesa that's a decent size it's not
like<00:05:40.490> overly<00:05:40.879> massive<00:05:41.330> but<00:05:41.779> it's<00:05:42.259> got<00:05:42.529> plenty

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 
like overly massive but it's got plenty

it's<00:05:57.919> in<00:05:58.039> between<00:05:58.129> the<00:05:58.370> Mesa<00:05:58.669> and<00:05:59.349> where

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:00.819 
it's in between the Mesa and where

there's a desert temple over here

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.219 
there's a desert temple over here
somewhere

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.389

stuff to the east and there's more stuff

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:57.689 
stuff to the east and there's more stuff
from<00:06:55.209> spawn<00:06:55.599> to<00:06:55.899> the<00:06:55.989> West<00:06:56.289> I<00:06:56.919> just<00:06:57.429> figured

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:57.699 
from spawn to the West I just figured

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:59.989 
from spawn to the West I just figured
you<00:06:57.819> know<00:06:57.879> take<00:06:58.179> a<00:06:58.209> little<00:06:58.419> trip<00:06:58.599> to<00:06:58.929> the<00:06:59.349> Mesa

00:06:59.989 --> 00:06:59.999 
you know take a little trip to the Mesa

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:02.819 
you know take a little trip to the Mesa
because<00:07:00.999> you<00:07:01.569> know<00:07:01.659> Mesa<00:07:02.229> is<00:07:02.379> always<00:07:02.619> good

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:02.829 
because you know Mesa is always good

00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:04.919 
because you know Mesa is always good
with<00:07:02.979> the<00:07:03.129> clay<00:07:03.339> and<00:07:03.610> the<00:07:03.729> and<00:07:04.209> the<00:07:04.329> things<00:07:04.569> and

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:04.929 
with the clay and the and the things and

00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:09.600 
with the clay and the and the things and
the<00:07:05.049> stuff<00:07:05.789> so<00:07:06.789> yeah<00:07:07.559> that's<00:07:08.559> pretty<00:07:08.949> much<00:07:09.039> it

for<00:07:10.329> this<00:07:10.509> one

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 
for this one

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:13.709 
for this one
there<00:07:12.369> will<00:07:12.519> be<00:07:12.550> an<00:07:12.699> overview<00:07:12.819> map<00:07:13.269> so<00:07:13.509> if<00:07:13.629> you

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:13.719

want to see what's what's around you get
some<00:07:16.349> floaty<00:07:17.349> bits<00:07:17.679> of<00:07:17.860> Mesa<00:07:18.489> here<00:07:19.079> that's<00:07:20.079> a

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199 
some floaty bits of Mesa here that's a

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:24.659 
some floaty bits of Mesa here that's a
nice<00:07:20.409> plateau<00:07:20.829> so<00:07:21.669> yeah<00:07:22.349> yeah<00:07:23.379> again<00:07:23.679> I<00:07:23.889> know<00:07:24.639> I

nice plateau so yeah yeah again I know I

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:25.879 
nice plateau so yeah yeah again I know I
just<00:07:24.879> said<00:07:24.969> it<00:07:25.089> but<00:07:25.269> there<00:07:25.479> will<00:07:25.599> be<00:07:25.659> an

overview map so if you want to see what

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:29.759 
overview map so if you want to see what
