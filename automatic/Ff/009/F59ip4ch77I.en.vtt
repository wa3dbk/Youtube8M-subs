00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:39.875
 Ok, Sylvain? I will follow you, huh? 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.971
 I finally found you! I have a very important reason here: 

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.924
 I want to know the secrets of Perigore's French foie gras. 

00:00:45.027 --> 00:00:46.111
 Ok, let's go, what is the secret? 

00:00:46.332 --> 00:00:48.061
 I want to disappoint you: there is no secret at all! 

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:49.522
 what? 

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:52.861
 No, just the craftsmanship and the sun of Perigord. 

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:55.084
 How did the reputation of Perigord's French foie gras come from? 

00:00:56.517 --> 00:00:59.001
 Very simple, ancestral craft 

00:00:59.503 --> 00:01:00.606
 It is extended year after year 

00:01:01.096 --> 00:01:02.639
 Generation from generation to generation 

00:01:18.332 --> 00:01:19.505
 This is still a legal name for the country of origin. 

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:21.376
 Legal name of the place of origin: Perigore French foie gras 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:22.948
 What can this legal name of the origin guarantee? 

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.819
 This legal name of the origin guarantees you 

00:01:26.337 --> 00:01:27.054
 These ducks, these are behind 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.650
 They are raised in Perigord and processed in Perigord. 

00:01:33.131 --> 00:01:34.537
 What do I eat with foie gras? 

00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:35.900
 How do you like to eat? 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.429
 As far as I am concerned, I like and 

00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:40.690
 a piece of fresh rustic bread, 

00:01:41.322 --> 00:01:42.420
 Come a little pepper 

00:01:42.906 --> 00:01:44.190
 Sprinkle on this foie gras, if you like the taste a little spicy. 

00:01:44.988 --> 00:01:46.840
 You can also add some salt flowers. We can all do 

00:01:47.347 --> 00:01:48.530
 Well, all the flavors are coming out. 

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:50.260
 It is easy to eat foie gras. 

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:51.860
 What wine is it with? 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.180
 Of course it is a small bottle of Mombasiank wine.
