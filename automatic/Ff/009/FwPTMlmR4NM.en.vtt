the<00:00:54.899> first<00:00:55.110> experiment<00:00:55.710> I'm<00:00:55.829> going<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.129> do<00:00:56.250> is

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the first experiment I'm going to do is

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.479 
the first experiment I'm going to do is
Newton's<00:00:57.120> disc<00:00:57.530> for<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.710> you'll<00:00:59.100> need<00:00:59.309> one

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
Newton's disc for this you'll need one

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.389 
Newton's disc for this you'll need one
of<00:00:59.609> your<00:00:59.699> cardboard<00:00:59.969> discs<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.039> your<00:01:02.039> paper

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
of your cardboard discs and your paper

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.800 
of your cardboard discs and your paper
disc<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.870> divided<00:01:04.589> segments<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.810> then

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
disc with the divided segments on then

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.840 
disc with the divided segments on then
you'll<00:01:07.140> need<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.320> use<00:01:07.470> your<00:01:07.650> pens<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.610> color

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
you'll need to use your pens to color

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.289 
you'll need to use your pens to color
each<00:01:09.150> segment<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.439> different<00:01:10.950> color<00:01:11.520> so

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
each segment in in a different color so

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.440 
each segment in in a different color so
you<00:01:12.420> should<00:01:12.720> end<00:01:12.960> up<00:01:13.200> with<00:01:13.549> a<00:01:14.549> disc<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.240> looks

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
you should end up with a disc that looks

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.560 
you should end up with a disc that looks
like<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:16.049> I've<00:01:16.740> stuck<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.909> onto<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> back

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
like that I've stuck this onto the back

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.899 
like that I've stuck this onto the back
of<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.990> my<00:01:19.080> cardboard<00:01:19.619> discs<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.759> it's

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
of one of my cardboard discs so it's

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.080 
of one of my cardboard discs so it's
nice<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.330> sturdy<00:01:21.619> then<00:01:22.619> what<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.490> do<00:01:23.700> is

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
nice and sturdy then what you can do is

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.210 
nice and sturdy then what you can do is
put<00:01:24.600> your<00:01:25.110> pencil<00:01:25.500> or<00:01:25.619> barbecue<00:01:25.979> stick

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
put your pencil or barbecue stick

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.780 
put your pencil or barbecue stick
through<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.390> make<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.720> little<00:01:27.869> spinning<00:01:28.470> top<00:01:28.799> so

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
through to make a little spinning top so

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.359 
through to make a little spinning top so
like<00:01:30.060> that

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
like that

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.730 
like that
now<00:01:32.369> how<00:01:32.610> Newton's<00:01:33.150> disc<00:01:33.329> works<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.590> when

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
now how Newton's disc works is that when

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.130 
now how Newton's disc works is that when
you<00:01:34.890> spin<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.670> won't<00:01:36.360> see<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> colors

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
you spin it you won't see the colors

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.310 
you spin it you won't see the colors
you'll<00:01:37.920> see<00:01:38.159> no<00:01:38.579> colors<00:01:38.939> at<00:01:39.060> all<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.960> I've<00:01:40.110> got

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
you'll see no colors at all so I've got

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.789 
you'll see no colors at all so I've got
a<00:01:40.350> motor<00:01:41.090> I'm<00:01:42.090> going<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.450> use<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.560> demonstrate

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
a motor I'm going to use to demonstrate

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.470 
a motor I'm going to use to demonstrate
it<00:01:44.460> spinning<00:01:44.790> really<00:01:45.119> fast

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.490 

so<00:01:48.480> I'm<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:48.690> going<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.900> use<00:01:49.050> a<00:01:49.080> bit<00:01:49.260> of<00:01:49.290> blue

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
so I'm just going to use a bit of blue

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.680 
so I'm just going to use a bit of blue
tack<00:01:50.900> put<00:01:51.900> on<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> back<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.590> my<00:01:52.830> desk<00:01:53.690> I'm

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
tack put on the back of my desk I'm

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.020 
tack put on the back of my desk I'm
going<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.930> attach<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.430> top<00:01:56.730> of<00:01:56.910> my

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
going to attach that to the top of my

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:08.950 
going to attach that to the top of my
motor<00:01:59.330> then<00:02:00.330> just<00:02:00.870> link<00:02:01.080> these<00:02:01.200> up

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.390 

I'm<00:02:09.560> just<00:02:09.710> going<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.860> attach<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.250> battery

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
I'm just going to attach the battery

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.920 
I'm just going to attach the battery
should<00:02:11.260> see<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.350> colors<00:02:12.620> disappear

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.300 

now<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:17.990> next<00:02:18.350> experiment<00:02:18.770> we're<00:02:19.070> going<00:02:19.220> to

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
now the next experiment we're going to

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.220 
now the next experiment we're going to
do<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.850> Venom's<00:02:20.540> disk

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
do is Venom's disk

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.220 
do is Venom's disk
she's<00:02:21.590> similar<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:22.880> this<00:02:23.030> time<00:02:23.420> we're<00:02:24.050> going

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
she's similar so this time we're going

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.020 
she's similar so this time we're going
to<00:02:24.320> see<00:02:24.650> colors<00:02:25.010> instead<00:02:25.460> of<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.760> colors

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
to see colors instead of the colors

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.820 
to see colors instead of the colors
disappearing<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:29.030> is<00:02:29.360> where<00:02:29.780> our<00:02:30.080> black

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
disappearing so this is where our black

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.880 
disappearing so this is where our black
and<00:02:31.010> white<00:02:31.450> decorated<00:02:32.450> disk<00:02:32.690> comes<00:02:32.900> in<00:02:33.170> so

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
and white decorated disk comes in so

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.310 
and white decorated disk comes in so
again<00:02:34.160> we<00:02:35.150> attach<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.020> cardboard

again with the motor now this time you

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:59.400 
again with the motor now this time you
should<00:02:47.780> see<00:02:48.200> colors<00:02:49.270> attach<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.510> motor<00:02:57.580> now

should see colors attach the motor now
touch<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.440> battery<00:03:02.020> you<00:03:03.020> should<00:03:03.290> see<00:03:05.590> circles

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
touch the battery you should see circles

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.710 
touch the battery you should see circles
of<00:03:06.980> color<00:03:07.840> as<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:08.990> spins<00:03:09.170> around<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:10.720> there

you<00:03:11.840> go<00:03:12.340> that's<00:03:13.340> how<00:03:13.490> to<00:03:13.640> do<00:03:13.910> cool<00:03:14.420> light

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
you go that's how to do cool light

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.620 
you go that's how to do cool light
