00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 Hello everyone, today I'll show you in 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.880
 little lion steen little knife 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.250
 closable produced precisely by the line 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.410
 hostile as usual we start from 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.100
 knife packaging that arrives in the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.160
 classic cardboard box from 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.619
 line steel on one side is shown 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.109
 the knife code 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:31.349
 I took the version with sleeve 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:38.700
 in g10 inside find the knife 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:42.320
 which arrives wrapped in white type paper 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.149
 wax paper that I recommend you use 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:51.510
 to preserve it and later I will also tell you 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:56.879
 because as usual in the package 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:00.660
 find a small certificate of 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.890
 guarantee with standards on 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.860
 maintenance in the rear a 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:12.780
 summary of the steels used by the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:17.670
 line style we see the knife 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:25.610
 the version I have on my sleeve 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:29.790
 in g10 there are other versions with 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.890
 handle in aluminum and also in fiber 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.259
 carbon 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.240
 the latter a little more expensive for 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.900
 how much instead concerns the blade beyond 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.600
 to the classic version I took 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.330
 all models are also available 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.390
 with 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:53.500
 the manera noted the handle as said 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:58.120
 consists of two cheeks in g 10 on 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:05.350
 which was created an end of green a 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:09.160
 tour a that is very grip before the hands 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.240
 are applied to two folders in 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.110
 underlying steel 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.020
 fixed through three torx screws in the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:24.960
 complex construction 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:28.380
 is therefore very robust clip 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.960
 rear allowing the port of the 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.710
 knife and position keep up then with 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:38.750
 tip up repositionable on the side 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:44.240
 opposite small hole for a strap 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.240
 rear perhaps a little too small 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.240
 in the upper part on the back of the 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:55.380
 nico was created before a 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:58.680
 their nature to encourage the taking when 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:07.620
 relatively open knife 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:11.640
 I would say effective openable knife to one 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:17.810
 hand through the classic town stubs for 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.810
 ideal knife opening for left-handed people 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:27.150
 easy opening dry click as 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:32.360
 see the form recalls that of a 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:38.080
 hence the name of the knife from here 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:40.930
 blade profile is a drop point 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.920
 just barely mentioned is almost one 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:50.830
 spinning with a fake against wire 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:54.370
 upper found on one side under the 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:58.630
 cams todd the name of the company from 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.670
 hostility ii and the steel used 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.580
 that the d2 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.920
 on the other side the name of the rais maker 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.720
 who designed the knife that max 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:16.030
 willow sanna shaped knife 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:19.930
 extremely linear of easy good 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.820
 contestability with a very good grip 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.420
 solid 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.810
 the blade forms a block with the handle 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:31.360
 there is practically no game at all 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.340
 a knife that also given the cost 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.470
 quite content 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:42.110
 we are between 60 and 70 euros you can 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:46.550
 use without too many concerns 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:49.130
 also for uses a little more burdensome among 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.600
 quotes can definitely be a lot 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.810
 useful as 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.110
 small backup knife for 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:01.130
 hiking tours in the mountains 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:06.720
 the only comment I can make 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:09.570
 relative to the steel that the d2 i 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.500
 major enthusiasts will know that the di 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:16.860
 two lately it is very much fashion 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.570
 definitely used very high performance 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.750
 I did some tests as usual 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:25.530
 he has no problem with passing the usual tests 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.350
 on the apple on the salami 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:32.000
 on paper the cardboard the cut of the 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:35.040
 engraving rope of small twigs 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.320
 however this is also one 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.500
 a well-known characteristic is a steel seed 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:45.060
 you give the sign you sow oxidizable thing 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:47.430
 it means it means that being the 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:52.790
 chrono percentage less than 13 per 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:54.930
 one hundred is what guarantees 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:06:01.949
 rust 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:03.539
 steel is not classified 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:07.380
 all effects between steels 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:10.259
 stainless and actually I could 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.750
 note that if it is not stored with 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:15.560
 particular precautions therefore maybe 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.900
 taking care to clean the blade well 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:22.199
 pass over a thin layer of oil 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.930
 of Vaseline to keep it closed maybe 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:27.210
 inside the map allied with 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.070
 which comes in the package 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.169
 here without these precautions the blade 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.509
 can form some oxide I don't have 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.970
 wanted to clean it 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.830
 I don't know if you can see it has formed 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:41.190
 a little oxide in the central part 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:45.270
 where you have been kept for a couple of 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:47.060
 months without special care we say for 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.639
 which my advice is for those who wish 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.979
 use it as a backup knife 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:55.800
 especially in outdoor environments then 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:58.699
 exposed to moisture and to buy 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:03.900
 the version with the black lady was established 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:05.880
 otherwise it is definitely a knife a 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:10.440
 my opinion a valid one especially if 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:16.070
 you want to stay content with with glue 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:16.070
 very sharp robust solid expense 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:23.580
 the it all blocking system that is a 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:28.050
 acronym that stands for tactics 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:34.530
 at the operation locke is an unaxis locke 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:37.650
 modified with the fingers on the 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:42.229
 and two lever all the parties unlocks 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:44.699
 the blade with a little practice you succeed in 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:45.120
 open it and also close it with one hand 

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:47.189
 one 

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.150
 I will show you here for simplicity 

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:50.150
 with two hands 

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.560
 a cute knife
