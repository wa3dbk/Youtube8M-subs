00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.270

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.630
 Christmas and Christmas 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.190
 I had the ipad mini then the ipad mini 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.650
 which is a very good apple product 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.940
 I wanted it since its release and well 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.699
 today the 25th of December, 2012 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.100
 I froze had so for montluel I am 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.070
 super happy then you have to know that 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.510
 I already started using it but 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.099
 I still wanted to do this 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.929
 little unpacking video for you 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:37.350
 show then we go right away 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:40.230
 open it so here is this 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.120
 beautiful product so I have not my 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.420
 phone on me I wanted you 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:51.480
 show the difference in size but by 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:57.660
 example here is the ipad 1 and we're going out 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:00.300
 ipad mini here we will put it as 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.489
 that's to look at the difference in size 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.630
 between ipad 1 and ipad neither 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.119
 it's impressive there is clearly 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.640
 already it is really lighter 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.140
 really finer look at that 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.189
 if he is really good score 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.000
 gorgeous apple products 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:22.170
 so I pray them in black so it's a 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.960
 ipad mini 32 gigas black so we go there 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.229
 come back later then in the box 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.740
 classic 1 as in the video of 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.130
 the ipad 4 that I did yesterday the cable 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.939
 lightning to usb to plug your 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.380
 ipad 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:43.770
 here the little jacket for everything 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.420
 just the small records 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.890
 apple apples that we have with each 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.530
 in every unpacking of apple products 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.470
 simply and the AC adapter 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.149
 who is like these is the same as 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.450
 for the iphone so that's a good 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.469
 new we do not need them to have 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.159
 a big box 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.899
 so we will go back to the mini ipad but 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.209
 before I wanted to tell you that I 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.700
 bought also the smart cover so that 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.560
 itunes 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.640
 as if it's a small page actually 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.480
 to magnetize to be able to unlock 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:25.840
 and lock your ipad mini so I 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:29.480
 I'm going to the void 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:34.849
 so this is the first time I see 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.700
 this is how it's hop there so we put 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.900
 like that like these have the clip this and 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.420
 here is the ipad mini 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.450
 it is like that so green and black is 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.769
 rather nice then I find for 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.989
 unlock we turn the page 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.019
 and here is the ipad mini and I wanted 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.540
 says gg not synchronized with my itunes 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.890
 or yet but so here I have some 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.060
 apps like facebook 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.920
 so he at the chip a5 pity he 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.599
 does not have a retina screen 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.360
 that's the only thing he's missing 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:09.200
 seriously so he has serial 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.720
 hello so they have 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.170
 the voice assistant says who is really 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.170
 very good 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.930
 so here is a little answer so 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.760
 he comes he is available from the moment of purchase 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.450
 with llewellys so we can see it with 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.730
 the clock 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.910
 so we're going to put bets in me I'm at 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.040
 paris so so all this news 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.139
 applications that are available with 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.600
 the ipad mini simply 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:40.280
 so this is a very very good product 1 I 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.380
 will not stop doing tests in 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.340
 view it's mine while ipad 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.540
 ipad 4 was not mine to me no I you 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.209
 to do tests I will tell you 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.239
 everything that is whether it's good or not 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.099
 but finally the first glimpse 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.549
 it's really small 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.459
 in the hand 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.260
 he's really great so I'm going 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.630
 continue to test it obviously 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.940
 but I wanted to show you this little 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.829
