ago I think and it really hasn't lasted

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.740 
ago I think and it really hasn't lasted
Botox<00:00:49.890> should<00:00:50.129> last<00:00:50.399> three<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> four<00:00:51.300> months

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
little bit I find that my eyes tear when

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.789 
little bit I find that my eyes tear when
the<00:01:39.750> needles<00:01:40.049> going<00:01:40.409> in

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the needles going in

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.300 
the needles going in
I<00:01:40.829> don't<00:01:41.460> mind<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.150> probably<00:01:43.159> six<00:01:44.159> or

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
I don't mind it it's probably six or

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.740 
I don't mind it it's probably six or
eight<00:01:44.460> jabs<00:01:44.759> with<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.060> needle<00:01:45.360> all<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
eight jabs with the needle all in the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.859 
eight jabs with the needle all in the
same<00:01:45.930> area<00:01:46.579> so<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.670> hurts<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.970> bit<00:01:48.090> sometimes<00:01:48.479> it

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
and you have to be going back like 12

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.420 
and you have to be going back like 12
weeks<00:06:11.700> like<00:06:11.910> clockwork<00:06:12.389> it<00:06:12.780> wears<00:06:12.990> off<00:06:13.430> then

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
weeks like clockwork it wears off then

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.879 
weeks like clockwork it wears off then
after<00:06:15.000> that<00:06:15.150> it<00:06:15.870> should<00:06:15.960> start<00:06:16.440> lasting

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889 
after that it should start lasting

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.000 
after that it should start lasting
longer<00:06:17.130> for<00:06:18.120> months<00:06:18.630> maybe<00:06:18.930> up<00:06:19.080> to<00:06:19.350> six<00:06:19.650> months
