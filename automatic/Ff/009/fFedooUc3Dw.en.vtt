that they've applied toward it I say get

that they've applied toward it I say get
on<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.190> right<00:02:59.340> side<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.640> history<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.240> that<00:03:00.480> is

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
on the right side of history and that is

on the right side of history and that is
support<00:03:01.170> equality<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:03.620> gay<00:03:04.620> rights<00:03:04.650> but

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
that's that's not necessarily where

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
they're going with this I tend to think

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.670 
they're going with this I tend to think
that<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.000> argument<00:03:09.510> people<00:03:09.750> are<00:03:09.870> using<00:03:10.140> for

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
that the argument people are using for

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.320 
that the argument people are using for
this<00:03:10.830> is<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.460> know<00:03:11.640> she<00:03:11.700> had<00:03:11.970> no<00:03:12.000> love

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
this is that you know she had no love

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.440 
this is that you know she had no love
interest<00:03:13.580> if<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:14.730> don't<00:03:15.000> have<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.180> love

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
interest if you don't have a love

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.580 
interest if you don't have a love
interest<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:15.960> doesn't<00:03:15.990> mean<00:03:16.290> you're<00:03:16.410> gay

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
interest it doesn't mean you're gay

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.410 
interest it doesn't mean you're gay

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
think that what it also shows is that

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.410 
think that what it also shows is that
despite<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.550> fact<00:03:29.730> that<00:03:29.820> people<00:03:30.000> will<00:03:30.239> maybe

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
despite the fact that people will maybe

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.420 
despite the fact that people will maybe
say<00:03:30.780> I'm<00:03:31.290> fully<00:03:31.800> in<00:03:31.950> support<00:03:32.070> of<00:03:32.310> gay<00:03:32.400> marriage

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
say I'm fully in support of gay marriage

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.420 
say I'm fully in support of gay marriage
that<00:03:33.180> there<00:03:33.510> still<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:34.130> sort<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.190> stuck<00:03:35.400> in

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
that there still is sort of stuck in

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.210 
that there still is sort of stuck in
this<00:03:35.700> concept<00:03:36.300> that<00:03:36.450> like<00:03:36.600> any<00:03:36.870> kind<00:03:37.200> of<00:03:37.410> woman

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
this concept that like any kind of woman

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.350 
this concept that like any kind of woman
in<00:03:38.520> a<00:03:39.980> fantasy<00:03:40.980> movie<00:03:41.010> or<00:03:41.370> any<00:03:41.489> kind<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:41.790> story

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
in a fantasy movie or any kind of story

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.810 
in a fantasy movie or any kind of story
needs<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.930> have<00:03:43.140> some<00:03:43.470> sort<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.920> love<00:03:44.400> interest

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
needs to have some sort of love interest

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.030 
needs to have some sort of love interest
for<00:03:44.910> her<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.450> be<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:45.989> normal<00:03:46.410> human<00:03:46.500> being<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:46.950> I

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
for her to be a normal human being and I

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.510 
for her to be a normal human being and I
think<00:03:47.220> that<00:03:47.880> is<00:03:48.060> absurd<00:03:48.390> yeah<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:50.040> also

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
think that is absurd yeah and I also

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.690 
think that is absurd yeah and I also
think<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:50.850> maybe<00:03:51.150> it's<00:03:51.630> like<00:03:52.580> we're<00:03:53.580> at<00:03:53.670> a

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
think that maybe it's like we're at a

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.860 
think that maybe it's like we're at a
point<00:03:53.940> now<00:03:54.180> where<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:56.430> is<00:03:56.730> very<00:03:57.000> much<00:03:57.209> in<00:03:57.510> the

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
point now where it is very much in the

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.330 
point now where it is very much in the
cultural<00:03:58.380> conversation<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.070> talk<00:03:59.190> about

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
cultural conversation to talk about

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.070 
cultural conversation to talk about
issues<00:03:59.550> like<00:03:59.760> this<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.360> whether<00:04:00.660> or<00:04:00.930> not

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
issues like this and whether or not

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.930 
issues like this and whether or not
Disney<00:04:01.650> even<00:04:02.040> when<00:04:02.190> they<00:04:02.280> intended<00:04:02.640> to<00:04:02.730> create

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
Disney even when they intended to create

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.510 
Disney even when they intended to create
a<00:04:03.030> strong<00:04:03.690> female<00:04:04.110> character<00:04:04.500> like<00:04:04.680> Elsa<00:04:05.100> it

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
a strong female character like Elsa it

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.810 
a strong female character like Elsa it
meant<00:04:06.270> anything<00:04:06.660> by<00:04:07.140> it<00:04:07.200> we<00:04:07.980> have<00:04:08.280> no<00:04:08.430> idea

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
meant anything by it we have no idea

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.030 
meant anything by it we have no idea
whether<00:04:09.810> or<00:04:09.930> not<00:04:10.080> they<00:04:10.230> they<00:04:10.590> were<00:04:10.650> really

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
whether or not they they were really

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.250 
whether or not they they were really
going<00:04:11.459> for<00:04:11.730> creating<00:04:12.480> a<00:04:12.570> character<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:13.050> had

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
going for creating a character that had

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.500 
going for creating a character that had
some<00:04:13.530> kind<00:04:13.739> of<00:04:13.800> lesbian<00:04:14.580> undertones<00:04:15.360> or

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
some kind of lesbian undertones or

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.099 
some kind of lesbian undertones or
anything<00:04:15.660> like<00:04:15.840> that

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
anything like that

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.210 
anything like that
we<00:04:16.950> don't<00:04:17.100> know<00:04:17.190> also<00:04:17.609> I<00:04:18.150> think<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.570> maybe

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
we don't know also I think that maybe

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.370 
we don't know also I think that maybe
people<00:04:20.220> like<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:21.030> see<00:04:21.299> what<00:04:21.870> they<00:04:22.020> would<00:04:22.200> like

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
people like to see what they would like

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.930 
people like to see what they would like
to<00:04:22.530> see<00:04:22.680> in<00:04:22.830> certain<00:04:23.100> situations<00:04:23.580> there's<00:04:23.880> a

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
to see in certain situations there's a

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.690 
to see in certain situations there's a
confirmation<00:04:24.510> bias<00:04:24.690> where<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:25.470> say<00:04:25.680> hey<00:04:26.100> it

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
confirmation bias where you say hey it

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.800 
confirmation bias where you say hey it
would<00:04:26.820> be<00:04:26.850> great<00:04:27.150> if<00:04:27.360> this<00:04:27.450> was<00:04:27.630> what

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
would be great if this was what

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.140 
would be great if this was what
was<00:04:27.900> happening<00:04:28.139> let<00:04:28.919> me<00:04:29.040> go<00:04:29.220> and<00:04:29.520> try<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.880> dig

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
was happening let me go and try to dig

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
doing I would say they would take a very

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.700 
doing I would say they would take a very
safe<00:05:45.390> route<00:05:45.630> much<00:05:45.960> safer<00:05:46.289> than<00:05:46.350> the<00:05:46.470> rumors

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710
