00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.510
 Good day to all, this is Alla Roy 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.369
 and today I am a little non-standard 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.320
 video format as you can see i am not in 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.019
 my world and I will show today 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.119
 the mechanism of his authorship as a person 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.060
 a reference to which you will find in the corner 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.910
 the screen is my friend anybody raymond 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.770
 fest and if anyone is interested you can 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.309
 go to his channel you also leg does 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.899
 video well then let's begin so 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.989
 the mechanism that I want to show you 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.629
 today it is a beacon for teleportation 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.940
 let's see i walk up to the lighthouse me 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.879
 issued iron which name is remote 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.430
 control teleport I have a storeroom iron 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.500
 in this slot and choose speed 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.360
 that is, we have one place and how 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.879
 see me teleports to green 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.309
 sector let 's again i come up to me 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.170
 control panel is issued again and now 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.439
 I am teleporting elsewhere I am 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.600
 choose another effect or me now 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:14.210
 teleports to the red sector let's 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.170
 the third time as you can see if now in the game 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.150
 damage resistance it will be 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.900
 another sector and me now 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.680
 teleports to the orange sector and if 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:30.409
 I will finally choose the jumping ability from me 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.000
 should teleport to the blue sector 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.900
 shelves lead me teleported not 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.460
 sector 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.190
 let's not figure out how this 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.100
 the mechanism works like many of you already 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.530
 could guess this mechanism works 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.420
 due to the fact that we can shoot with 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.970
 players various effects that gives 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.860
 my and let's see first with us 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.350
 There is an ordinary clock generator on the hopper 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.290
 them and from him she withdraws three lines 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.090
 let's deal with the first one 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.820
 command block checks for graco 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.370
 radius of four blocks from the lighthouse further 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.260
 we know this command block 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.390
 regeneration again by the same players 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.000
 within a radius of four blocks this is needed because 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.480
 the fact that the command unit forgive beacon 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.670
 produces a regeneration effect when you 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.660
 you enter and its radius is further worn 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.680
 the signal is taken off by the comparator and 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.060
 connects here to this command 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.910
 block which gives us the iron named 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.459
 remote control teleport and through 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.810
 signal inversion connected here to this 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.870
 command block which we have 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.000
 cleans iron that is when we enter 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.250
 radius of 4 blocks to us iron is issued 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.500
 when we move out of this radius iron 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.440
 we are cleared let me show you we 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.150
 logged in iron if we go out iron 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.080
 it feels like when we go in 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.900
 red torch 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.720
 goes out and when we go out he 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.120
 lights up the second line which departs 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.920
 from the generator club promises for keywords and 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.320
 let's see what happens here 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.670
 each of these team blogs clears 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.980
 the player who is in radius 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.320
 four blocks from a beacon a certain 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.090
 the effect that is here he let's clean 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.040
 jump if we are in a lighthouse 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.989
 bouncy that after a while to us 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.239
 this effect is given accordingly 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.519
 the command block clears this effect 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.590
 and sends a signal here on this block which 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.780
 In turn, I write down 2 teams badly 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.910
 this one that teleports us to 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.310
 certain sector and this one which 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.630
 puts in his place and to the air the same 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.440
 the same thing happens to everyone else 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.800
 my comparator is just here with us 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.410
 different effects and due to this we can 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.080
 teleport to different places 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.480
 using different effects and finally 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.430
 the last part is needed in order to 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.410
 simply 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.030
 restart this those reportages and so 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.070
 this command block is checking us 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.590
 the presence of a block of air in the place where 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.510
 there is a lighthouse and if there is a block 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.150
 air then this comparator 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.000
 activated and sends a signal to the commands 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.590
 the block that sets up the beacon there 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.660
 such a simple but interesting mechanism 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.270
 I believe that in its construction nothing 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.010
 there is no such exceptional but if anyone 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.500
 that is interesting then the link to the teams will be 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.540
 in the description and on this for today everything is all 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.580
