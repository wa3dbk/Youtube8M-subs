since everyone else is talking about

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.430 
since everyone else is talking about
what<00:00:03.360> they've<00:00:03.510> done<00:00:03.720> with<00:00:03.899> these<00:00:04.080> power

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
what they've done with these power

what they've done with these power
supplies<00:00:04.560> on<00:00:05.040> YouTube<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.759> figured<00:00:06.420> idea<00:00:06.690> the

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
supplies on YouTube I figured idea the

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.960 
supplies on YouTube I figured idea the
same<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.410> just<00:00:07.710> point<00:00:08.189> out<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.370> few<00:00:08.580> things<00:00:08.730> on

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
same and just point out a few things on

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.730 
same and just point out a few things on
this<00:00:10.400> first<00:00:11.400> off<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:11.880> just<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.389> standard

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
this first off this is just a standard

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.580 
this first off this is just a standard
power<00:00:13.740> supply<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.960> don't<00:00:16.020> know<00:00:16.199> if<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.379> can

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
power supply and I don't know if you can

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.130 
power supply and I don't know if you can
see<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.580> information<00:00:18.420> on<00:00:18.570> there

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
see that the information on there

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.160 
see that the information on there
it's<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:20.130> y2k<00:00:20.970> power<00:00:21.300> supply<00:00:21.630> which<00:00:21.869> means

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
it's a y2k power supply which means

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.519 
it's a y2k power supply which means
probably<00:00:22.410> it's<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.740> little<00:00:23.039> old<00:00:23.900> maybe<00:00:24.900> pretty

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
of see that the orange is back here and

of see that the orange is back here and
the<00:02:39.510> red<00:02:39.829> these<00:02:40.829> two<00:02:41.129> here<00:02:41.459> are<00:02:41.489> actually<00:02:42.329> we

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
the red these two here are actually we

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.229 
the red these two here are actually we
looked<00:02:43.109> up<00:02:43.230> here<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.859> get<00:02:44.609> my<00:02:44.730> hand<00:02:44.939> all<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.209> way

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
looked up here I get my hand all the way

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.869 
looked up here I get my hand all the way
of<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.480> light<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.950> blue<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:48.079> the<00:02:49.079> white

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
of the light the blue and the white

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.039 
of the light the blue and the white
because<00:02:50.879> I<00:02:50.909> cut<00:02:51.180> them<00:02:51.299> a<00:02:51.329> little<00:02:51.450> too<00:02:51.840> short

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
because I cut them a little too short

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.369 
because I cut them a little too short
the<00:02:52.680> blue<00:02:52.889> is<00:02:53.069> actually<00:02:53.459> this<00:02:53.639> yellow<00:02:54.379> leading

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
the blue is actually this yellow leading

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.530 
the blue is actually this yellow leading
to<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.590> minus<00:02:55.829> 12<00:02:56.069> volts<00:02:56.129> and<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:57.180> white<00:02:57.359> is

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
to the minus 12 volts and the white is

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.580 
to the minus 12 volts and the white is
the<00:02:57.569> minus<00:02:57.989> 5<00:02:58.200> volts<00:02:59.389> simple<00:03:00.389> enough<00:03:00.690> in<00:03:00.900> this

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
the minus 5 volts simple enough in this

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.099 
the minus 5 volts simple enough in this
case<00:03:01.829> very<00:03:03.379> portable<00:03:04.879> and<00:03:05.879> that<00:03:06.480> allows<00:03:06.900> you

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
case very portable and that allows you

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.490 
case very portable and that allows you
to<00:03:07.260> do<00:03:07.409> things<00:03:07.650> like<00:03:08.989> let's<00:03:09.989> see<00:03:10.139> if<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.290> can<00:03:10.409> do

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
to do things like let's see if I can do

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:18.530 
to do things like let's see if I can do
this<00:03:10.680> with<00:03:10.859> one<00:03:11.010> hand<00:03:16.790> there's<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.000> ground<00:03:18.209> on

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
this with one hand there's the ground on

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.900 
this with one hand there's the ground on
that<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.299> need<00:03:21.359> another<00:03:21.720> alligator<00:03:22.260> clip

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:33.650 

here<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.329> 12<00:03:27.599> volt<00:03:31.699> again<00:03:32.699> me<00:03:33.329> trying<00:03:33.629> to

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
here to the 12 volt again me trying to

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:48.500 
here to the 12 volt again me trying to
work<00:03:33.810> with<00:03:33.989> one<00:03:34.139> hand

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
me feeling to work with one hand there

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.180 
me feeling to work with one hand there
did<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:03.370> brings<00:04:03.760> up<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.570> fancy<00:04:05.440> well

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
did it and that brings up the fancy well

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.590 
did it and that brings up the fancy well
it's<00:04:06.370> kind<00:04:06.550> of<00:04:06.580> hard<00:04:06.640> to<00:04:06.940> see<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.180> temperature

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
it's kind of hard to see the temperature

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.810 
it's kind of hard to see the temperature
