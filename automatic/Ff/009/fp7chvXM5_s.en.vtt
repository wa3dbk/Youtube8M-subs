00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.350
 open animal also with double-click and then 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.920
 Here you can see a minecraft one year 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.810
 celebration you do with right click and 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.360
 opened her with winrar archive 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.979
 this opens a fold the downlink 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.740
 by winrar which you sometimes 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.750
 the description will pack so that 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.460
 Let's just close it then you see 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.489
 Here is your minecraft minimized here 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.020
 her first time so here also had in 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.690
 minecraft and the first thing I have now 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.050
 you delete meter info 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.860
 So it goes on right-click files 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:24.000
 delete and confirm that deleted 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:31.020
 that and now minimize that and open 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.750
 your deep 1 15 and 1 hd ultra 778 the 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.570
 you can also open it with a double click 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.010
 until the message arrives at the far right 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.520
 the wall does not really matter 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.820
 You do not need that anymore 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.430
 stronger get you then and then copied 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.730
 you all files here from the deep 1 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.820
 1.5 point one copies all the files 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.820
 from the very top to the very high without dispo 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.360
 folder and runs in here just 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.060
 a goal confirms that you have 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.660
 so see if deep 1 installed that is 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.630
 they can be deep 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.080
 Now you open your your shape here 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.160
 spot opens it with a double-click 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.400
 Wait a bit more needs to get 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.470
 not come with you 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.020
 then you will see a lot here 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.959
 Files returning them all to the 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.450
 wall and mark all files again 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.020
 who are in here and just pull them 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.600
 in here 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:35.340
 so now this is all in here and you 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.480
 can now conclude both 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.989
 your shader and your minecraft 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.769
 works close 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.810
 now you start again minecraft and 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.769
 This time you do not force update to 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.769
 goes directly to login 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.989
 Start now is my strength now 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:57.120
 would have then right here a shaders place 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.930
 must have formed so here on 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.959
 options shaders then you see yours here 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.330
 shadows that now nothing in it still me 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.570
 Now click on your open shaders photo 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.510
 just make it a click 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.250
 then minimize minecraft and now 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.570
 open your shader packs with 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.570
 double click, of course 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.090
 and then you see a skull text here 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.620
 order makes the opened with 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:31.349
 double click then you see two now 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:34.409
 files of a sv 08 standard vcr c7 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.039
 ultra the 2 marks her and pulls her 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:38.340
 in here 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.990
 So you moved in here that is 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.659
 you can close both again 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.639
 it would have to be at your minecraft here 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:47.370
 Two things have formed exactly 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.710
 you see the location shader pack and 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.270
 the ultrasound topic now my because 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.650
 the city â€‹â€‹makes three and can now 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.870
 you do not have a Schiller 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.960
 chosen that if you go on now 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.580
 you have not selected a shield then 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.690
 you just go into some which 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.370
 create a new world like that and then 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.770
 will you soon see that the skull 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.129
 has worked wonderfully and you can 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:20.759
 then enjoy the shade right away 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:21.349
 logic board with merkels monster too 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:24.000
 Super 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.710
 you see you are your minecraft world 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.419
 normal 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.810
 and if you are here now the car 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:34.289
 then click here on standard.at 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:38.310
 do you see this soft already here 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:40.759
 this movement will shadow this again 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.930
 keep those cool shadows 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:46.590
 yes that was it from now on 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.900
 Installation tutorial if you still 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.539
 the ultra select then move 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:56.310
 I will be the leaves for that now 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:06:01.220
 very briefly make a tree because you and 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:03.360
 we have a pretty stupid spawn point 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:07.260
 if we are a bit next 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.210
 that's not so good so you look at that 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.449
 normal shader pack is not 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:16.139
 that the leaves move when now 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:18.479
 but the ultra selected ceos of 10 rc 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.510
 ultra seen that the leaves 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:22.320
 move and there is exactly the motto 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.639
 also in it 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.979
 really cool motto shape and yes that was 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.960
 It's actually a tutorial if it is 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:32.310
 has helped or has fallen 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.979
 Of course I would like to have one 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.880
 positive feedback 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:37.680

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.150

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.110
 I would like to have a personal one 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.850
 Write a message 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.580
 I am then about your problem 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.680
