00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.020
 equal to kids that good in the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.480
 today's video we're going to see a tutorial of 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.369
 how to get quicksand and good 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.140
 the truth is that it's pretty good what 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.330
 We are going to need any material with 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.990
 seriousness so nothing let's see it 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.519
 well let's see it the first thing is maybe 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.850
 generates a bit of the one that comes in comfortable to 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.380
 lately very bad computer 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.930
 well I'll do it first survival 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.670
 is impute the button this which is what 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.820
 I'm going to turn it on, we can replace it 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.880
 because of the lobe that's why if you have 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.640
 seen my last video that is is the one of the 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.680
 password and automatic gate two 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.030
 forms I will do it at the end of the video what 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.190
 I echo here like this with a button to make it 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.620
 more comfortable and good this is quite 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.390
 slow I will apply while I fall 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.650
 I'm falling and now I'll put it in 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.480
 fast camera because if I'm not going to take 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.930
 a lot while he dies 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.030
 player and good as you can see I can not break 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.530
 good at the moment yes but when it is 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.690
 inside the block you can not break anything 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.010
 so impossible to escape so 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.010
 nothing, I'm going to put it in a fast camera 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.560
 well we are going to need all these 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.830
 materials that are going to be a piston 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.040
 normal one sticky rest on a button 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.230
 cobweb a re peter 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.940
 sand pressel plate and a block of 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.650
 construction for good then for 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.720
 build it here I made a test 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.980
 but I've done it wrong while I was 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.980
 recording and good the reality 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.300
 so it 's the first thing we're going to build 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.790
 a tower 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.130
 and you have to calculate the height goes wrong 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.680
 no following and no 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.689
 I do not know what's going on I'm not going to do three 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.210
 of three but you could do it 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.590
 as long as you want 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.740
 well here I will place already directly 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.740
 the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.460
 the button 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.479
 and now what you have to think is that 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.400
 you can not drop the sand 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.409
 You see, it's going so badly that I can not 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.670
 you have to place it in a block to 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.400
 that the sand does not fall and here it goes to 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.079
 be the block that we're going to where it's going 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.079
 to go the person the player 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.860
 then this is all he's going to do is 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.780
 that this goes to here we can not 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.900
 place it here directly because if not 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.750
 he is not going to fall we have to give him one of 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.820
 space 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.700
 if the trick is not going to work and it's worth 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:46.379
 from here we have to place 12 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.720
 and the third one is this where space here 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.790
 they will go the pressure plate would go 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.030
 rest that is going to ignite we take it out 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.780
 outwards already 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.220
 and to the level below this serial 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:05.410
 this we put 12 blocks and here 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.180
 we put 3 pistons 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.790
 sticky like that 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.980
 ok and here I'm going to place this block 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.150
 I would also recommend that it not be sand 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.510
 by the sand it can break easily 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.860
 and this block does not 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.180
 I the only thing we have to do is 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.180
 upload it to the rest is not here 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.030
 seriously I 'm going too bad we're going 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.770
 sugar 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.180
 because this computer has never gone 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.040
 bad and that is that I'm playing in 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.640
 team 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.109
 in super short vision and above with 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.680
 all turned off and I keep going 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:46.650
 I imagine badly hits me jerks I go to 80 fps 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.230
 and 90 10 is very strange and good since 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.990
 It should work because I 've spent 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.380
 I will not be able to give the button 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.270
 Now, from here, I'm not going to 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.900
 put on fast camera because if it's not going to 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.900
 last a long time 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.420
 well I'm going to fall but I'm going to throw 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.579
 out because a block and I 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.130
 crush follows nothing I'll show you the 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.490
 tutorial on how to build the is 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.590
 impune the texfor command let's go to it 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.510
 well let's build it this is very 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.720
 simple but we need to copy the 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.940
 coordinate of a site 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.490
 and well I'll explain it we need 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.840
 all these materials and to get 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.340
 the command block because it is not in 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.530
 the creative menu we are going to have to 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.729
 put this command that is gif 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.360
 your Nick 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:46.689
 that is to say your name and 137,1 now all 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.400
 ok let's start fast let's go 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.289
 place it in its first place and now 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.920
 let's make a clock called sea 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:56.200
 and how clocks are built 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.890
 the most simple and the one that I use 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:03.190
 It is always this and how I know 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:05.740
 we have to place a nominee like this 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.960
 to one side and the other to the other re 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.890
 peters and give it once is to say to the 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.480
 tics we give with reston and we remove it and the 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.030
 we put quickly and will do this 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.010
 this is going to do 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.110
 that is all the time coming you pointed 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:24.449
 the command block since we're going to 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.919
 fort write the test command 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.999
 and this command what you are going to do is 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:32.219
 check and check and well we can 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:34.650
 check if a person is in a 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:37.770
 coordinate we put 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:41.099
 what it means all players 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:45.210
 we put this is placed with high grace and 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:48.419
 next there is a key of the p good already 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.520
 we open like a parenthesis and we put the 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.379
 coordinates that I do not right now 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.809
 I have so I'm going to try the command 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.300
 good texfor I will not copy them and already the 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:59.120
 I put assigned 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:02.180
 it's worth with some coordinates that are the 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:06.349
 of this block in this good position 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.160
 how they are copied are copied with xyyz 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.750
 OK 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.030
 and the only thing we have to do is the 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:17.410
 same command from before that it would be t sword 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.670
 ok they were our here copied 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.670
 -400 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:26.470
 93 point you have to put as important 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:30.100
 52 318 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.810
 and now we put comma as I'll put 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.970
 me 1 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.790
 that's the radius you want the most 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:41.550
 It is recommended that you put 1 or 2 as 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:46.020
 what do you want to do and how do you see this now? 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:47.910
 is going to invest as an equal 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.860
 this is going to turn on or off as you see 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.860
 when I approach it turns on and when I 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.540
 I'm going away so it's that simple 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.430
 guys, the only thing you have to do 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.740
 is to put a repeater here so that the 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:02.130
 signal is not spent and can take it 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.510
 redstone everything you want and 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.200
 the only thing that you will have to do is 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:08.610
 put it here and nothing guys guys 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.900
 this has been the tutorial of today I hope 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.510
 that you liked to like 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.190
 subscribe to my channel and well even though I know 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.010
 that the computer is very bad for me and it looks 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:20.780
 a little bit badly I do what I can and nothing 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.780
 just that a greeting and until next time
