over here where I'll try is a brand new
technology<00:00:10.380> envelopes<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.219> brought<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.360> out

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
technology envelopes and brought it out

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.749 
technology envelopes and brought it out
to<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.719> market<00:00:12.870> last<00:00:13.769> year<00:00:13.980> it's<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.429> really

to the market last year it's a really

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.359 
to the market last year it's a really
amazing<00:00:15.240> technology<00:00:16.020> because<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.920> keeps<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
amazing technology because it keeps the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.160 
amazing technology because it keeps the
glove<00:00:17.609> from<00:00:17.820> loading<00:00:18.180> water<00:00:18.390> if<00:00:18.990> you're

have<00:00:21.420> been<00:00:21.449> manufactured<00:00:22.320> they<00:00:22.800> have<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> great

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
have been manufactured they have a great

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.640 
have been manufactured they have a great
big<00:00:23.670> almost<00:00:24.150> like<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.390> medical<00:00:24.869> gloves<00:00:24.960> insert

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
big almost like a medical gloves insert

shoved<00:00:26.130> into<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> shin<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.849> shell<00:00:27.119> and

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
shoved into the shin to the shell and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.870 
shoved into the shin to the shell and
how<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.660> fold<00:00:27.960> itself<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.500> there<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.730> end

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
how to fold itself in there and you end

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.389 
how to fold itself in there and you end
up<00:00:30.000> having<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.539> gap<00:00:30.869> between<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.619> insert<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
up having a gap between that insert and

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.400 
up having a gap between that insert and
the<00:00:32.520> outer<00:00:32.850> shell<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.329> glove<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:34.140> can't

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
the outer shell of the glove you can't

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.780 
the outer shell of the glove you can't
take<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.710> glove<00:00:34.980> because<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.309> all<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> funny

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
take a glove because of all the funny

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.819 
take a glove because of all the funny
seems<00:00:36.090> all<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> curves<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.350> that's<00:00:37.559> been<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
seems all the curves so that's been the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.530 
seems all the curves so that's been the
only<00:00:37.860> way<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> past<00:00:38.430> up<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.969> provide<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
only way in the past up to provide and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.020 
only way in the past up to provide and
out<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.930> water<00:00:40.170> pump<00:00:40.469> lover<00:00:40.800> but<00:00:41.430> now<00:00:41.700> what

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
out of water pump lover but now what

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.080 
out of water pump lover but now what
I'll<00:00:42.090> try<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.540> doing<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.050> they're<00:00:43.200> actually

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
I'll try is doing is they're actually

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.540 
I'll try is doing is they're actually
laminating<00:00:45.090> an<00:00:45.300> insert<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.590> insert<00:00:47.219> is

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
laminating an insert the insert is

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.459 
laminating an insert the insert is
laminated<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.629> shelter<00:00:48.989> there's<00:00:49.170> no<00:00:49.289> air

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
laminated to the shelter there's no air

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.069 
laminated to the shelter there's no air
space<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.890> between<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.520> won't<00:00:50.700> let<00:00:51.079> water

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
space in between that it won't let water

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.840 
space in between that it won't let water
collect<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.829> between<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.250> insert<00:00:53.640> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
collect in between that insert and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.639 
collect in between that insert and

this is the out dry clothes put them

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.130 
this is the out dry clothes put them
into<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> cold<00:01:02.250> water<00:01:02.870> will<00:01:03.870> saturate

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
into to the cold water will saturate

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.600 
into to the cold water will saturate
both<00:01:04.589> gloves<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:06.200> even<00:01:07.200> within<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.950> minute<00:01:08.310> or

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
both gloves and even within a minute or

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.240 
both gloves and even within a minute or
two<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:09.540> can<00:01:09.720> feel<00:01:10.080> my<00:01:10.530> left<00:01:10.770> hand<00:01:10.979> with<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
two you can feel my left hand with the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.800 
two you can feel my left hand with the
conduit<00:01:11.549> glove<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.060> getting<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> little<00:01:12.570> bit

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
conduit glove is getting a little bit

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.620 
conduit glove is getting a little bit
colder<00:01:13.260> than<00:01:13.770> now<00:01:14.010> track<00:01:14.369> club<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.820> that's

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
colder than now track club and that's

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.870 
colder than now track club and that's
because<00:01:16.020> water<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.979> getting<00:01:17.220> trapped<00:01:17.580> in

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
because water is getting trapped in

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.550 
because water is getting trapped in
between<00:01:18.000> those<00:01:18.360> two<00:01:18.600> layers<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.110> outer<00:01:19.259> layer

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
between those two layers the outer layer

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.950 
between those two layers the outer layer
and<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> inner<00:01:20.159> membrane<00:01:20.430> layer<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.750> hard

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
and the inner membrane layer it's hard

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.020 
and the inner membrane layer it's hard
to<00:01:22.080> see<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> video<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.430> what<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.880> can

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
to see in the video but what you can

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.969 
to see in the video but what you can
feel<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.509> your<00:01:24.630> hand<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.290> my<00:01:25.500> left<00:01:25.740> hand<00:01:25.890> is

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
feel in your hand is my left hand is

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.280 
feel in your hand is my left hand is
much<00:01:26.220> heavier<00:01:26.490> now<00:01:26.880> than<00:01:26.909> my<00:01:27.750> right<00:01:28.020> hand

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
much heavier now than my right hand

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.140 
much heavier now than my right hand
because<00:01:29.100> there's<00:01:29.250> water<00:01:29.490> trapped<00:01:29.579> inside

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
