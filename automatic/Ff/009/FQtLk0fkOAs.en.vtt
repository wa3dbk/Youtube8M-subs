00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
fast right you miss a meal and then

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.789 
fast right you miss a meal and then
you're<00:01:29.850> starving<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.540> all<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.170> food<00:01:31.530> is

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
you're starving so all of this food is

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.030 
you're starving so all of this food is
going<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.430> hit<00:01:32.610> your<00:01:32.700> stomach<00:01:32.960> super<00:01:33.960> fast<00:01:34.200> but

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
now there's not enough juice to help

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.660 
now there's not enough juice to help
break<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.350> down<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.979> then<00:01:38.250> what<00:01:38.549> your

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
break that down so then what your

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.370 
break that down so then what your
stomach<00:01:39.000> does<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> kind<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.509> overcompensate

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
stomach does it kind of overcompensate

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.770 
stomach does it kind of overcompensate
mm-hmm<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.369> starts<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.820> dump<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.329> tons

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
mm-hmm and so it starts to dump in tons

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.990 
mm-hmm and so it starts to dump in tons
of<00:01:43.170> gastric<00:01:43.619> juice<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.610> actually<00:01:44.880> what

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
of gastric juice this is actually what

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.880 
of gastric juice this is actually what
causes<00:01:45.090> heartburn<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.810> was<00:01:46.020> gonna<00:01:46.200> say<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.500> felt

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
causes heartburn I was gonna say I felt

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.889 
causes heartburn I was gonna say I felt
that<00:01:47.009> before<00:01:47.430> if<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:47.820> go<00:01:47.970> out<00:01:48.119> eat<00:01:48.360> too<00:01:48.570> much

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
that before if we go out eat too much

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.260 
that before if we go out eat too much
and<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.320> just<00:01:49.350> feel<00:01:49.740> adjustable<00:01:50.670> yes

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
and you just feel adjustable yes

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.270 
and you just feel adjustable yes
awful<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:51.990> not<00:01:52.110> necessarily<00:01:52.649> spicy<00:01:52.979> food

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
awful so it's not necessarily spicy food

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.440 
awful so it's not necessarily spicy food
which<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.490> kind<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.880> what<00:01:54.030> people<00:01:54.299> think

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
which is kind of what people think

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.060 
which is kind of what people think
usually<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.409> what<00:01:55.500> we're<00:01:55.590> gonna<00:01:55.649> do<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:55.979> we're

the<00:02:19.550> muscles<00:02:19.940> inside<00:02:20.720> your<00:02:20.930> stomach<00:02:21.260> would<00:02:21.380> do

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
the muscles inside your stomach would do

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.050 
the muscles inside your stomach would do
wouldn't<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:22.010> right<00:02:22.250> right<00:02:22.520> there<00:02:22.700> turning

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
wouldn't it right right there turning

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.090 
wouldn't it right right there turning
around<00:02:23.300> they're<00:02:23.990> using<00:02:24.320> that<00:02:24.440> acid<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:24.980> help

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
around they're using that acid to help

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.920 
around they're using that acid to help
break<00:02:25.400> down<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.850> food<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.600> acid

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
break down the food and the acid

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.630 
break down the food and the acid
actually<00:02:27.050> has<00:02:27.350> two<00:02:27.620> jobs<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.160> one<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.490> to

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
actually has two jobs the one is to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.100 
actually has two jobs the one is to
break<00:02:28.820> down<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.090> food<00:02:29.210> to<00:02:29.420> kind<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.660> start<00:02:29.870> the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
break down the food to kind of start the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.260 
break down the food to kind of start the
nutrients<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.860> be<00:02:31.370> absorbed<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:32.000> then<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
nutrients to be absorbed and then the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.390 
nutrients to be absorbed and then the
other<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:33.110> kill<00:02:33.350> any<00:02:33.530> bacteria<00:02:33.560> that's<00:02:34.220> in

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
other is to kill any bacteria that's in

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.620 
other is to kill any bacteria that's in
there<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.200> go<00:02:36.200> ahead<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.590> smash<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.130> up<00:02:37.430> okay

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
there so go ahead and smash that up okay

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.020 
there so go ahead and smash that up okay
now<00:02:39.080> everybody's<00:02:39.470> digestive<00:02:40.100> tract<00:02:40.760> takes

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
now everybody's digestive tract takes

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.840 
now everybody's digestive tract takes
them<00:02:41.240> a<00:02:41.420> different<00:02:41.630> amount<00:02:41.990> of<00:02:42.080> time<00:02:42.140> okay<00:02:42.950> so

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
them a different amount of time okay so

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.210 
them a different amount of time okay so
that's<00:02:44.120> looking<00:02:44.390> pretty<00:02:44.740> pretty<00:02:45.740> good<00:02:45.920> should

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
that's looking pretty pretty good should

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.890 
that's looking pretty pretty good should
we<00:02:46.250> take<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.760> closer<00:02:47.180> look<00:02:47.300> at<00:02:47.540> it

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
we take a closer look at it

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.130 
we take a closer look at it
I<00:02:48.310> think<00:02:49.310> yeah<00:02:50.180> now<00:02:50.450> remember<00:02:50.810> this<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:50.990> just

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
I think yeah now remember this is just

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.520 
I think yeah now remember this is just
the<00:02:51.350> first<00:02:51.620> part<00:02:51.860> of<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.390> digestive<00:02:53.390> process

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
the first part of the digestive process

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.720 
the first part of the digestive process
after<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.680> stomach<00:02:54.980> it's<00:02:55.160> gonna<00:02:55.280> go<00:02:55.459> into<00:02:55.640> the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
after the stomach it's gonna go into the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.310 
after the stomach it's gonna go into the
small<00:02:55.970> intestine<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.750> then<00:02:56.840> into<00:02:57.110> large

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
small intestine and then into large

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.590 
small intestine and then into large
intestine<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:58.610> let's<00:02:58.760> take<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:58.970> look<00:02:59.180> at<00:02:59.390> it

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
intestine so let's take a look at it

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.320 
intestine so let's take a look at it
before<00:03:00.020> it<00:03:00.410> completes<00:03:00.860> its<00:03:01.010> journey<00:03:01.340> okay<00:03:01.820> so

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
before it completes its journey okay so

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.380 
before it completes its journey okay so
we're<00:03:02.450> gonna<00:03:02.540> put<00:03:02.840> this<00:03:02.989> in<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.290> bowl<00:03:04.390> alright

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
we're gonna put this in a bowl alright

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.270 
we're gonna put this in a bowl alright
that's<00:03:05.900> pretty<00:03:06.080> gross<00:03:06.380> now<00:03:06.860> I<00:03:06.890> brought<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.250> a

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
that's pretty gross now I brought you a

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.729 
that's pretty gross now I brought you a
for<00:03:07.519> publishing<00:03:07.880> your<00:03:08.150> goal<00:03:08.360> okay<00:03:08.930> alright<00:03:09.530> so

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
for publishing your goal okay alright so

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.470 
for publishing your goal okay alright so
let's<00:03:10.070> go<00:03:10.190> ahead<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.400> kind<00:03:10.850> of<00:03:10.940> investigate

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
let's go ahead and kind of investigate

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.390 
let's go ahead and kind of investigate
what's<00:03:11.690> left<00:03:11.959> in<00:03:12.140> there<00:03:12.350> so<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:12.950> can<00:03:13.040> see<00:03:13.220> all

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
what's left in there so you can see all

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.490 
what's left in there so you can see all
that<00:03:13.610> bread<00:03:13.880> is<00:03:14.090> broken<00:03:14.330> down<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:15.110> meat<00:03:15.320> is

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
that bread is broken down the meat is

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.070 
that bread is broken down the meat is
starting<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:15.980> break<00:03:16.160> down<00:03:16.459> but<00:03:17.090> take<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:17.900> look

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
starting to break down but take a look

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.259 
starting to break down but take a look
at<00:03:18.170> this<00:03:18.260> lettuce<00:03:18.650> over<00:03:18.860> here<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:20.000> doesn't

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
at this lettuce over here that doesn't

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.460 
at this lettuce over here that doesn't
really<00:03:20.390> look<00:03:20.450> much<00:03:20.600> different<00:03:21.080> than<00:03:21.170> we<00:03:21.290> first

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
really look much different than we first

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.560 
really look much different than we first
dumped<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.160> not<00:03:22.340> at<00:03:22.459> all<00:03:22.640> because<00:03:23.300> it's<00:03:23.480> a

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
dumped it in not at all because it's a

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.530 
dumped it in not at all because it's a
high<00:03:23.750> fiber<00:03:24.550> vegetable<00:03:25.550> okay<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:26.180> we<00:03:26.390> get<00:03:26.480> a

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
high fiber vegetable okay so we get a

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.970 
high fiber vegetable okay so we get a
little<00:03:26.690> bit<00:03:26.930> of<00:03:27.019> nutrients<00:03:27.410> out<00:03:27.530> of<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:27.799> but

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
little bit of nutrients out of it but

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.890 
little bit of nutrients out of it but
it's<00:03:28.100> not<00:03:28.280> very<00:03:28.549> soluble<00:03:29.030> in<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.450> stomach<00:03:29.870> so

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
it's not very soluble in the stomach so

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.140 
it's not very soluble in the stomach so
it<00:03:30.049> doesn't<00:03:30.350> break<00:03:30.500> down<00:03:30.560> very<00:03:30.950> easily<00:03:31.150> same

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
it doesn't break down very easily same

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.050 
it doesn't break down very easily same
thing<00:03:32.390> with<00:03:32.600> those<00:03:32.780> pickles<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.940> looks<00:03:34.940> like

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
thing with those pickles and looks like

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.520 
thing with those pickles and looks like
there's<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.330> lot<00:03:35.600> of<00:03:35.750> corn<00:03:35.930> left<00:03:36.110> in<00:03:36.350> there

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
there's a lot of corn left in there

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.190 
there's a lot of corn left in there
certainly<00:03:36.980> does<00:03:37.190> alright<00:03:37.940> now<00:03:38.660> what's

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
certainly does alright now what's

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.750 
certainly does alright now what's
interesting<00:03:39.380> about<00:03:39.709> that<00:03:40.010> corn<00:03:40.310> is<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:40.610> can

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
interesting about that corn is you can

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.960 
interesting about that corn is you can
actually<00:03:41.090> do<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.500> experiment<00:03:42.500> at<00:03:42.830> home<00:03:42.970> it's

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
actually do a experiment at home it's

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.670 
actually do a experiment at home it's
kind<00:03:44.120> of<00:03:44.209> test<00:03:44.510> your<00:03:44.750> digestive<00:03:45.260> tract<00:03:45.470> all

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
kind of test your digestive tract all

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.060 
kind of test your digestive tract all
right

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
right

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.430 
right
so<00:03:46.519> if<00:03:46.610> you<00:03:46.730> take<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.060> big<00:03:47.480> bowl<00:03:47.720> of<00:03:47.750> corn<00:03:48.170> and

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
so if you take a big bowl of corn and

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.650 
so if you take a big bowl of corn and
you<00:03:48.470> eat<00:03:48.799> it<00:03:48.950> then<00:03:49.940> you're<00:03:50.090> gonna<00:03:50.180> start<00:03:50.510> your

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
you eat it then you're gonna start your

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.539 
you eat it then you're gonna start your
watch<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.290> were<00:03:51.410> gonna<00:03:51.590> wait<00:03:51.799> and<00:03:52.070> wait

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
watch and you were gonna wait and wait

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.870 
watch and you were gonna wait and wait
so<00:03:53.390> then<00:03:53.870> eventually<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:55.340> is<00:03:55.400> going<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.790> be

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
so then eventually this is going to be

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.270 
so then eventually this is going to be
identifiable<00:03:56.690> later<00:03:56.930> uh-huh<00:03:57.620> so<00:03:57.980> when<00:03:58.130> you

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
identifiable later uh-huh so when you

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.390 
identifiable later uh-huh so when you
see<00:03:58.549> this<00:03:58.790> I<00:03:59.090> know<00:03:59.720> a<00:03:59.840> second<00:04:00.290> time<00:04:00.500> you're

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
see this I know a second time you're

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.800 
see this I know a second time you're
gonna<00:04:01.519> know<00:04:01.760> just<00:04:01.790> how<00:04:02.150> long<00:04:02.299> it<00:04:02.420> takes<00:04:02.630> your

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
gonna know just how long it takes your

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.289 
gonna know just how long it takes your
digestive<00:04:03.290> tract<00:04:03.560> to<00:04:03.830> work<00:04:04.610> everything<00:04:04.880> is<00:04:05.060> a

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
digestive tract to work everything is a

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.600 
digestive tract to work everything is a
very<00:04:05.510> adventurous<00:04:05.780> science<00:04:06.500> experiment<00:04:07.130> is<00:04:07.280> I

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
very adventurous science experiment is I

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.820 
very adventurous science experiment is I
understand<00:04:08.240> where<00:04:08.390> you're<00:04:08.480> going

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
understand where you're going

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.470 
understand where you're going
with<00:04:08.920> it<00:04:09.070> too<00:04:09.280> but<00:04:09.550> that's<00:04:09.880> all<00:04:10.000> about<00:04:10.120> gross

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
with it too but that's all about gross

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.900 
with it too but that's all about gross

experiments we're going to be talking
about<00:04:27.730> burps<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.630> snot<00:04:29.050> and<00:04:29.530> mucus<00:04:30.040> all<00:04:30.910> kinds

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
about burps and snot and mucus all kinds

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.510 
about burps and snot and mucus all kinds
of<00:04:31.390> really<00:04:31.720> gross<00:04:31.990> things<00:04:32.290> so<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:33.220> kid<00:04:33.430> that's

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
of really gross things so the kid that's

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.160 
of really gross things so the kid that's
like<00:04:33.640> to<00:04:33.910> check<00:04:34.000> it<00:04:34.180> out<00:04:34.330> okay<00:04:34.720> I've<00:04:34.840> learned<00:04:35.110> a

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
like to check it out okay I've learned a

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.750 
like to check it out okay I've learned a
little<00:04:35.350> bit<00:04:35.500> of<00:04:35.650> science<00:04:35.860> doing<00:04:36.280> that<00:04:36.520> -<00:04:36.730> I

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
little bit of science doing that - I

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.910 
little bit of science doing that - I
think<00:04:36.970> it's<00:04:37.300> okay<00:04:37.720> satisfies<00:04:38.290> mom<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:38.770> dad

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
think it's okay satisfies mom and dad

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.920 
think it's okay satisfies mom and dad
and<00:04:39.100> they<00:04:39.190> have<00:04:39.400> fun<00:04:39.670> doing<00:04:39.700> it<00:04:40.120> so<00:04:40.360> of<00:04:40.690> course

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
and they have fun doing it so of course
