drums<00:00:23.090> we're<00:00:24.090> going<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.480> start<00:00:24.840> basically

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
drums we're going to start basically

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.419 
drums we're going to start basically
with<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:26.939> conga<00:00:27.810> drum<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.289> see<00:00:28.439> here<00:00:28.800> he

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
with the conga drum that you see here he

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.939 
with the conga drum that you see here he
doesn't<00:00:29.640> have<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> head<00:00:30.269> at<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.689> point<00:00:31.050> but

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
doesn't have a head at this point but

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.470 
doesn't have a head at this point but
it's<00:00:32.189> very<00:00:32.340> important<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:34.410> have<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:35.480> very

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
it's very important that we have a very

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.240 
it's very important that we have a very
clean<00:00:36.930> very<00:00:37.230> an<00:00:37.860> edge<00:00:38.360> so<00:00:39.360> with<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> cloth

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
clean very an edge so with the cloth

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.440 
clean very an edge so with the cloth
usually<00:00:41.250> damped<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.629> go<00:00:42.780> around<00:00:43.910> with<00:00:44.910> on

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
usually damped I can go around with on

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.420 
usually damped I can go around with on
the<00:00:45.690> rim<00:00:45.930> just<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.800> make<00:00:46.950> sure<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.250> it's

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the rim just to make sure that it's

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.020 
the rim just to make sure that it's
clean<00:00:48.379> this<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:50.070> Evans<00:00:50.840> conga<00:00:51.840> head<00:00:53.030> which

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
clean this is the Evans conga head which

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.099 
clean this is the Evans conga head which
is<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> synthetic<00:00:54.570> head<00:00:55.340> very<00:00:56.340> practical<00:00:57.000> for

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
is a synthetic head very practical for

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.150 
is a synthetic head very practical for
countries<00:00:58.109> where<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> weather<00:00:58.590> changes

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
countries where the weather changes

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.760 
countries where the weather changes
drastically<00:01:00.109> the<00:01:01.109> next<00:01:01.440> thing<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.559> we're

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
drastically the next thing that we're

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.219 
drastically the next thing that we're
going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.949> pick<00:01:02.160> up<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.760> hook<00:01:03.750> make<00:01:04.049> sure

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
going to pick up is the hook make sure

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.350 
going to pick up is the hook make sure
that<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.790> all<00:01:05.790> clean<00:01:06.950> is<00:01:07.950> very<00:01:08.430> important<00:01:09.180> to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that is all clean is very important to

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.859 
that is all clean is very important to
have<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:10.670> clean<00:01:11.670> maybe<00:01:12.060> every<00:01:12.450> two<00:01:12.600> weeks

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
have it clean maybe every two weeks

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.070 
have it clean maybe every two weeks
every<00:01:13.260> month<00:01:13.670> depending<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.909> how<00:01:15.210> busy<00:01:15.689> you

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
every month depending on how busy you

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.210 
every month depending on how busy you
are<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:17.189> your<00:01:17.970> traveling<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.979> how<00:01:19.979> much

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
are with your traveling and how much

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.929 
are with your traveling and how much
dust<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.060> drum<00:01:21.299> collects<00:01:21.780> does<00:01:22.439> basically

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
dust the drum collects does basically

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.510 
dust the drum collects does basically
make<00:01:23.939> sure<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.450> sits<00:01:25.200> well<00:01:25.590> as<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.369> can

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
make sure that it sits well as you can

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.050 
make sure that it sits well as you can
see<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.570> very<00:01:27.600> well

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
see it is very well

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.500 
see it is very well
with<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.240> head<00:01:31.510> and<00:01:32.500> these<00:01:32.680> are<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:32.980> locks<00:01:33.510> in

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
with the head and these are the locks in

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.460 
with the head and these are the locks in
this<00:01:34.780> case<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.300> conga<00:01:40.600> drum<00:01:40.810> we<00:01:40.930> have<00:01:41.110> six

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
this case on the conga drum we have six

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.300 
this case on the conga drum we have six
of<00:01:41.710> them<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.970> basically<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.950> got<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.190> make

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
of them so basically you got to make

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.210 
of them so basically you got to make
sure<00:01:45.490> that<00:01:45.820> you<00:01:46.570> put<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.960> six<00:01:47.260> loops<00:01:47.890> and

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
sure that you put the six loops and

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.800 
sure that you put the six loops and
getting<00:01:49.090> them<00:01:49.180> up<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:52.180> point<00:01:52.420> where<00:01:52.660> they

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
getting them up to the point where they

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:02.120 
getting them up to the point where they
stop

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.279 

this<00:02:02.729> particular<00:02:03.270> rubber<00:02:03.600> piece<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.140> you

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
this particular rubber piece that you

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.160 
this particular rubber piece that you
see<00:02:04.530> here<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.250> basically<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.689> protect<00:02:06.899> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
see here is basically to protect the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.680 
see here is basically to protect the
drum<00:02:07.469> from<00:02:07.710> getting<00:02:08.009> scratched<00:02:08.280> by<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.300> drum

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
drum from getting scratched by the drum

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:19.750 
drum from getting scratched by the drum
beside<00:02:10.140> it

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.520

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
that I want I want to make sure also

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.280 
that I want I want to make sure also
that<00:03:56.970> after<00:03:57.970> I<00:03:58.090> start<00:03:58.360> playing<00:03:58.630> he's<00:03:59.110> not

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
that after I start playing he's not

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.250 
that after I start playing he's not
gonna<00:03:59.530> go<00:03:59.760> out<00:04:00.760> of<00:04:00.820> tune<00:04:01.300> either<00:04:01.540> so<00:04:04.260> I'm

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
gonna go out of tune either so I'm

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.910 
gonna go out of tune either so I'm
banging<00:04:06.040> it<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:06.310> way<00:04:06.490> or<00:04:07.210> you<00:04:07.480> can<00:04:07.680> brace<00:04:08.680> it

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
banging it that way or you can brace it

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.220 
banging it that way or you can brace it
this<00:04:09.040> way

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
this way

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.110 
this way
depends<00:04:11.230> where<00:04:11.380> you<00:04:11.530> are<00:04:11.760> you're<00:04:12.760> tuning

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
depends where you are you're tuning

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.050 
depends where you are you're tuning
after<00:04:13.570> this<00:04:13.780> is<00:04:13.900> gonna<00:04:14.080> be<00:04:14.290> easier<00:04:14.920> because<00:04:15.640> as

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
after this is gonna be easier because as

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.300 
after this is gonna be easier because as
you're<00:04:16.209> playing<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.570> drum<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.830> head<00:04:18.070> will

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
you're playing the drum the head will

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.950 
you're playing the drum the head will
start<00:04:18.580> having<00:04:18.940> a<00:04:19.000> relationship<00:04:19.540> with<00:04:20.520> the

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
start having a relationship with the

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.110 
start having a relationship with the
with<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.080> bearing<00:04:23.440> edge<00:04:23.560> of<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:23.860> drum<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:24.970> it

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
with the bearing edge of the drum and it

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.660 
with the bearing edge of the drum and it
will<00:04:25.270> be<00:04:25.450> just<00:04:25.660> much<00:04:26.080> easier<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.650> turn<00:04:26.860> and<00:04:27.520> at

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
will be just much easier to turn and at

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.990 
will be just much easier to turn and at
first<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:29.080> second<00:04:29.680> room<00:04:29.890> on<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.610> familiy<00:04:30.970> of

first the second room on the familiy of

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.190 
first the second room on the familiy of
Congress<00:04:31.450> is<00:04:31.630> called<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.050> tomb<00:04:32.320> bar<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:35.020> too

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
Congress is called the tomb bar the too

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.100 
Congress is called the tomb bar the too
much<00:04:35.440> lower<00:04:35.860> than<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.670> conga<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.720> philtrum

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
much lower than the conga the philtrum

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.590 
much lower than the conga the philtrum
is<00:04:38.170> the<00:04:38.380> Quinta<00:04:38.800> which<00:04:38.950> is<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.250> soloist<00:04:39.760> but

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
is the Quinta which is the soloist but

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.760 
is the Quinta which is the soloist but
basically<00:04:41.160> why<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:43.360> most<00:04:43.690> common<00:04:44.200> tuning

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
basically why the most common tuning

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.860 
basically why the most common tuning
that<00:04:44.890> we<00:04:45.070> use<00:04:45.340> is<00:04:47.310> seeing<00:04:48.310> on<00:04:48.670> the<00:04:48.820> conga<00:04:49.240> as<00:04:49.570> we

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
that we use is seeing on the conga as we

00:04:49.870 --> 00:05:01.790 
that we use is seeing on the conga as we
move<00:04:51.330> energy<00:04:54.060> only<00:04:56.220> below<00:04:57.220> on<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.460> tuba<00:05:00.360> and

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
move energy only below on a tuba and

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.860 
move energy only below on a tuba and
therefore<00:05:02.800> lay<00:05:02.980> everything<00:05:03.610> as<00:05:03.910> popular<00:05:04.540> a

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
therefore lay everything as popular a

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.840 
therefore lay everything as popular a
given<00:05:05.590> dream<00:05:05.740> as<00:05:05.860> popular<00:05:06.190> as<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.400> war<00:05:06.610> on
