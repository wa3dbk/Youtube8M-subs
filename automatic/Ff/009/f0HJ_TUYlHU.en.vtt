00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
this is this is critical you know when

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.219 
this is this is critical you know when
my<00:01:37.890> diet<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.430> consistent<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.540> my<00:01:39.990> water

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
my diet is consistent and my water

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.710 
my diet is consistent and my water
intake<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.890> inconsistent<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.820> notice<00:01:42.360> my<00:01:42.479> body

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
intake is inconsistent I notice my body

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.539 
intake is inconsistent I notice my body
hangs<00:01:43.020> onto<00:01:43.200> water<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> reason<00:01:44.340> for<00:01:44.369> that

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
hangs onto water and the reason for that

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.270 
hangs onto water and the reason for that
is<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.180> goes<00:01:45.360> into<00:01:45.600> scarcity<00:01:46.200> mode<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.829> cut

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
is it goes into scarcity mode so you cut

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.130 
is it goes into scarcity mode so you cut
your<00:01:47.460> water<00:01:47.670> intake<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.540> starts<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.899> hang

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
your water intake and it starts to hang

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.469 
your water intake and it starts to hang
on<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.680> your<00:01:49.770> water<00:01:50.040> or<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.640> water<00:01:50.970> you're

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
on to your water or to the water you're

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.060
