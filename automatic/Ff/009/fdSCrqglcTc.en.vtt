this<00:00:09.120> video<00:00:09.930> is<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.680> explain<00:00:11.780> grafting<00:00:12.780> and

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
this video is to explain grafting and

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.430 
this video is to explain grafting and
the<00:00:13.410> preparation<00:00:14.160> for<00:00:14.550> it<00:00:14.670> if<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.840> want<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.290> be

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
the preparation for it if you want to be

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.470 
the preparation for it if you want to be
successful<00:00:16.680> at<00:00:17.250> grafting<00:00:17.790> you<00:00:17.940> have<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.330> know

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
successful at grafting you have to know

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.320 
successful at grafting you have to know
several<00:00:18.810> things<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:20.090> techniques<00:00:21.090> of

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
several things the techniques of

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.350 
several things the techniques of
grafting<00:00:21.810> are<00:00:21.960> very<00:00:22.500> important<00:00:23.070> but<00:00:23.910> one<00:00:24.210> of

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
grafting are very important but one of

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.440 
grafting are very important but one of
the<00:00:24.450> things<00:00:24.720> that's<00:00:24.930> equally<00:00:25.410> important<00:00:25.950> is

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
the things that's equally important is

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.230 
the things that's equally important is
preparing<00:00:27.450> your<00:00:28.050> budwiq<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:29.280> budwood<00:00:29.700> is<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
preparing your budwiq the budwood is the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.310 
preparing your budwiq the budwood is the
tree<00:00:30.710> that<00:00:31.710> you're<00:00:32.040> going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.430> have

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
tree that you're going to have

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.710 
tree that you're going to have
ultimately<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.970> material<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
ultimately that is the material a

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.530 
ultimately that is the material a
genetic<00:00:37.140> material<00:00:37.650> you've<00:00:38.280> selected<00:00:38.610> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
genetic material you've selected to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.970 
genetic material you've selected to
graft<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.199> the<00:00:40.530> rootstock

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
graft on to the rootstock

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.420 
graft on to the rootstock
so<00:00:41.699> your<00:00:41.940> bud<00:00:42.150> wood<00:00:42.390> needs<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.870> prepared<00:00:43.589> so

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
so your bud wood needs to be prepared so

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.670 
so your bud wood needs to be prepared so
it's<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.970> the<00:00:45.089> best<00:00:45.120> possible<00:00:45.839> condition<00:00:46.409> in

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it's in the best possible condition in

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.369 
it's in the best possible condition in
order<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.220> use<00:00:47.400> it<00:00:47.430> for<00:00:47.729> grafting<00:00:48.150> this<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.199> a

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
order to use it for grafting this is a

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.719 
order to use it for grafting this is a
tree<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.250> we're<00:00:50.519> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.879> use<00:00:51.089> as<00:00:51.680> our

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:52.729 
tree that we're going to use as our

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.020 
tree that we're going to use as our
donor<00:00:53.750> for<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.930> bud<00:00:55.110> wood<00:00:55.699> it's<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.850> good

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
donor for the bud wood it's a good

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.200 
donor for the bud wood it's a good
variety<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:58.680> as<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.250> see<00:00:59.309> by<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.760> end<00:01:00.030> of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
variety and as you can see by the end of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.930 
variety and as you can see by the end of
this<00:01:00.390> terminal<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.100> it's<00:01:02.100> got<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.400> new<00:01:02.640> growth

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
this terminal here it's got a new growth

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.740 
this terminal here it's got a new growth
area<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.530> kind<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.220> greenish<00:01:05.460> got<00:01:06.420> some

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
area and it's kind of greenish got some

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.130 
area and it's kind of greenish got some
life<00:01:07.620> in<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.400> looks<00:01:08.610> healthy<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> what

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
life in it it looks healthy so what

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.499 
life in it it looks healthy so what
we're<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.590> do<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.979> we're<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.640> to

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
we're going to do is we're going to to

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.130 
we're going to do is we're going to to
tell<00:01:13.289> this<00:01:13.500> plant<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.180> want<00:01:15.420> more<00:01:15.659> energy

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
tell this plant that we want more energy

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.569 
tell this plant that we want more energy
going<00:01:16.590> into<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:18.079> terminal<00:01:19.079> here<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:20.399> do

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
going into this terminal here and we do

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.709 
going into this terminal here and we do
that<00:01:20.789> by<00:01:21.240> clipping<00:01:21.689> off<00:01:21.899> the<00:01:22.619> leaves<00:01:23.719> what

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:24.719 
that by clipping off the leaves what

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.849 
that by clipping off the leaves what
we're<00:01:24.899> doing<00:01:25.140> here<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:26.310> we're<00:01:27.469> going<00:01:28.469> to<00:01:28.560> send

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
we're doing here is we're going to send

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.219 
we're doing here is we're going to send
a<00:01:28.979> message<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.880> tree<00:01:30.350> that<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.560> needs<00:01:31.859> to

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
a message to the tree that it needs to

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.749 
a message to the tree that it needs to
get<00:01:34.229> some<00:01:34.500> more<00:01:34.710> growth<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.219> the<00:01:35.340> end<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
get some more growth on the end of it

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.429 
get some more growth on the end of it
because<00:01:36.390> all<00:01:36.539> of<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.750> sudden<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.079> leaves<00:01:37.289> are

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
because all of a sudden the leaves are

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.609 
because all of a sudden the leaves are
gone<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.909> what<00:01:38.909> will<00:01:39.060> happen<00:01:39.570> over<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> next

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
gone so what will happen over the next

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.520 
gone so what will happen over the next
four<00:01:41.039> or<00:01:41.070> five<00:01:41.159> days<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.990> I've<00:01:42.990> clipped<00:01:43.289> off

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
four or five days is I've clipped off

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.859 
four or five days is I've clipped off
the<00:01:44.250> leaf<00:01:44.460> itself<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.179> left<00:01:45.390> these<00:01:45.570> stumps

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
the leaf itself and left these stumps

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.080 
the leaf itself and left these stumps
because<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.950> don't<00:01:47.189> want<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.399> damage<00:01:47.609> the<00:01:47.789> bud

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
because I don't want to damage the bud

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.080 
because I don't want to damage the bud
wood<00:01:48.270> itself<00:01:48.619> but<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.890> tree<00:01:50.189> will<00:01:50.579> go<00:01:50.789> ahead

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
wood itself but the tree will go ahead

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.380 
wood itself but the tree will go ahead
and<00:01:51.359> it<00:01:51.600> will<00:01:52.159> it<00:01:53.159> will<00:01:53.399> dry<00:01:53.729> out<00:01:53.759> these<00:01:54.210> little

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and it will it will dry out these little

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.959 
and it will it will dry out these little
stumps<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.020> within<00:01:55.920> four<00:01:56.460> or<00:01:56.549> five<00:01:56.700> days

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
stumps and within four or five days

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.810 
stumps and within four or five days
these<00:01:57.420> will<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.899> fall<00:01:58.320> off<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.890> we'll<00:01:59.670> take

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
these will just fall off and we'll take

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.270 
these will just fall off and we'll take
a<00:01:59.880> picture<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.450> later

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
a picture of that later

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.140 
a picture of that later
when

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
when

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.510 
when
happens<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.170> tree<00:02:04.470> is<00:02:04.680> starting<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.130> send

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
happens the tree is starting to send

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.620 
happens the tree is starting to send
energy<00:02:06.290> into<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.950> little<00:02:08.610> branch<00:02:08.970> here<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
energy into this little branch here the

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.980 
energy into this little branch here the
stick<00:02:10.020> our<00:02:10.710> piece<00:02:11.040> of<00:02:11.220> bud<00:02:11.370> wood<00:02:11.660> when<00:02:12.660> these

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
stick our piece of bud wood when these

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.700 
stick our piece of bud wood when these
buds<00:02:13.500> start<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.430> swell<00:02:15.080> that's<00:02:16.080> when<00:02:16.560> it's

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
buds start to swell that's when it's

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.860 
buds start to swell that's when it's
ready<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:17.670> prime<00:02:18.000> condition<00:02:18.030> for

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
ready and in prime condition for

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.910 
ready and in prime condition for
grafting<00:02:19.580> so<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.910> will<00:02:21.360> show<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:21.630> next<00:02:22.080> where

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
grafting so I will show you next where

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.530 
grafting so I will show you next where
we<00:02:23.100> have<00:02:23.430> these<00:02:23.580> little<00:02:23.790> stumps<00:02:24.180> come<00:02:24.360> off

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
we have these little stumps come off
