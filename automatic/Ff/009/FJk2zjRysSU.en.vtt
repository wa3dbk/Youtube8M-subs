00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.890
 or the one that just vanessa towers and I want 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.100
 teach them to make this card 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.040
 gingerbread house this 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.550
 card has the particularity that 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.519
 We will place a device 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.339
 called action eggs that in what 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:22.579
 allows is that things move like this 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.579
 in this way 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.570
 and that's the way inside let's start to 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.119
 make this card we are going to need a 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.910
 piece of blue construction paper five and a half 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.100
 by eight and a half inches we're also going 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.070
 to need a piece of cardboard 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.170
 white muffled 4 x 5 and a quarter 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.839
 this is the mold number 1 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.329
 with mold number 2 we are going to need 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.940
 a piece of white cardboard of 3 and 3 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.920
 rooms by 5 inches 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.760
 we are going to need a piece of paper 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.850
 decorated with the mold number 3 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.300
 a piece of blue cardboard with the mold 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.430
 number 4 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.949
 and a piece of paper decorated with the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.290
 mold number 5 to this piece what are we going 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.930
 to do is that we are going to use 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.230
 one of the word thinkers of raisins 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.130
 tapes to do so well then we're going to 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.580
 place the ribbon in red half fabric 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.580
 inch 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.020
 we are also going to need the plates 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.909
 from the happy Christmas house and the two 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.950
 mini kilos of biscuit 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.960
 and this is the device that the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.659
 stand that we're going to paste the little house 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.939
 cookies but if you can not get it 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.200
 do not worry you can do it in a way 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.929
 manual this is one that I did so very 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.569
 home but it also works and what 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:52.890
 we do the following way we take 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:54.959
 a piece of wire and four circles 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.569
 on cardboard and in this case the 10 and 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:00.299
 white katrina does not matter the color 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:03.680
 then let's take the wire and what 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:07.340
 let's go rolling 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.490
 I wish in a pencil or something like that 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.850
 century of that size and we're going to 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.310
 go rolling until 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.080
 we roll it once we have 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.080
 let's put rubber 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.920
 enough rubber that yes on one side you 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.209
 we put 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:38.090
 at each end two circles to think 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.090
 the edge and we will then be a 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.319
 so it's a little thing where we will 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.620
 paste the house of ge and so that it 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.330
 move in that way 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.129
 the next thing we're going to do is that 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.840
 let's take the piece of blue cardboard 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.129
 of five and a half by eight and a half the 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.420
 let's fold in half 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:58.670
 I said alternate corners and the shadow 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.250
 with coffee and delineates with a gel pen 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.320
 silver 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.180
 I also took the piece of cardboard 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.980
 white in bosa and I did the same 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.140
 alternating corners and zombie also with 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.140
 coffee and we're going to paste it 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.740
 and the face of the card 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.740
 with silicone rubber 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.400
 well focused that we are not going to cover the 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.400
 delineated that we just did 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.130
 as I told you we are going to take the piece of 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.530
 Paper decorated with mold 5 we make it 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.230
 the edge with a bowl puncher 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:43.790
 you pass ribbons and we will pass the tape 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.790
 in half-inch red and we're going to paste 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.769
 in the finishing part 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.070
 we take the piece of paper decorated with 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.710
 the mold number 3 and we put rubber of 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.660
 silicon also 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.610
 I'm going to paste the center here but 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.060
 you can give another as if you 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.060
 like 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.840
 to the center 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.330
 to the piece of 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:24.640
 blue cardboard with mold number 4 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.640
 we put double assembly tape 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.260
 and we're going to paste it on the piece of 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.260
 decorated paper 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.720
 remove the protective papers 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.720
 and we are going to center 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:50.180
 all the pieces of the sheet we are going 

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:52.980
 to cut 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:57.900
 by the edge 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:02.070
 let's cut the house and take 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.690
 the gadget either this one or the one 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.850
 Looking to do now if it is the landlord 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.539
 nothing else we put rubber and paste it 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.550
 here and we do not hit it here has been 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:14.130
 even a little more lifted up but 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.759
 I'm going to use this then let's 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.759
 remove 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.230
 this part 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.430
 and this is where we 're going to hit the 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.770
 piece 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.530
 in this case the house but they can 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:42.430
 do it in any other of the figures 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:47.380
 that they will want to use 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:49.510
 this piece and we now remove the 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.690
 Protective pieces of the part of 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.690
 behind 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.879
 and we're going to paste the center 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.790
 and ready we have left 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.180

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:11.900
 let's make a bow on red ribbon 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.900
 we hit the center 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:22.970
 the estuary of merry christmas can you 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.970
 stick on one side or you can paste it 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.660
 up here if you like the one I'm going to paste 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.729
 sideways 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:34.330
 and we paste here 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:36.009
 now for the inside we take 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.789
 the piece of white card with the 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:38.789

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.630
 some of the products that there are 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.639
 in the market to give it shine 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:29.719
 I'll put so shine 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:29.719
