00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
not quite as quick and precise when it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.260 
not quite as quick and precise when it
comes<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.070> soft<00:01:14.340> snow<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.820> mellow<00:01:15.000> pile

seeing<00:01:15.570> as<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.780> old<00:01:15.930> pontoon<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.250> one

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
seeing as the old pontoon but this one

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.880 
seeing as the old pontoon but this one
really<00:01:17.970> gives<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.360> kind<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.869> next<00:01:19.560> level

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890
