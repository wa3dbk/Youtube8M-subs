00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.760 

by<00:00:00.539> hardening<00:00:00.960> there's<00:00:01.170> a<00:00:01.230> technique<00:00:01.620> in

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
by hardening there's a technique in

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.830 
by hardening there's a technique in
which<00:00:01.920> you<00:00:02.100> heat<00:00:02.340> wood<00:00:02.580> so<00:00:02.909> much<00:00:03.149> that<00:00:03.780> the

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
which you heat wood so much that the

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.809 
which you heat wood so much that the
cells<00:00:04.110> close<00:00:04.440> up<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:04.799> it<00:00:04.920> becomes<00:00:05.190> very<00:00:05.339> very

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
cells close up and it becomes very very

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.730 
cells close up and it becomes very very
hard<00:00:06.180> it's<00:00:06.660> quite<00:00:06.870> often<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.109> technique<00:00:07.470> used

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
hard it's quite often a technique used

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.009 
hard it's quite often a technique used
in<00:00:07.919> bushcraft<00:00:08.490> where<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.450> need<00:00:09.660> something

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
in bushcraft where you need something

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.249 
in bushcraft where you need something
quick<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.500> easy<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:11.040> stab<00:00:11.389> users<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> spear<00:00:12.929> or

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
quick and easy to stab users a spear or

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.200 
quick and easy to stab users a spear or
to<00:00:13.769> dig<00:00:14.040> then<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.490> need<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.820> end<00:00:15.000> obviously

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
to dig then you need the end obviously

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.460 
to dig then you need the end obviously
very<00:00:15.929> hard<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:17.130> withstand<00:00:17.660> not<00:00:18.660> just<00:00:18.900> one<00:00:19.140> step

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
very hard to withstand not just one step

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.410 
very hard to withstand not just one step
but<00:00:19.740> numerous<00:00:20.369> stabs<00:00:20.699> without<00:00:21.029> losing<00:00:21.330> that

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
but numerous stabs without losing that

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.200 
but numerous stabs without losing that
nice<00:00:21.570> little<00:00:21.779> point<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.170> end<00:00:22.910> I've<00:00:23.910> seen<00:00:23.970> a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
nice little point on the end I've seen a

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.560 
nice little point on the end I've seen a
few<00:00:24.420> videos<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:26.119> quite<00:00:27.119> often<00:00:27.330> people

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
few videos on it and quite often people

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.450 
few videos on it and quite often people
have<00:00:27.779> said<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.109> can<00:00:28.289> make<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:29.099> same

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
have said you can make the same

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.049 
have said you can make the same
technique<00:00:29.910> work<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.689> bladed<00:00:31.260> edge<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.880> had<00:00:32.880> my

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
technique work on bladed edge I had my

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.959 
technique work on bladed edge I had my
doubts<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.800> I<00:00:34.800> wanted<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.130> test<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.579> out<00:00:35.670> is

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
doubts but I wanted to test it out is

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.170 
doubts but I wanted to test it out is
this<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:37.129> thing<00:00:38.129> people<00:00:38.370> say<00:00:38.550> because<00:00:39.059> I

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
this just a thing people say because I

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.840 
this just a thing people say because I
have<00:00:39.390> not<00:00:39.540> found<00:00:39.750> anything<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.460> it

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
have not found anything on this and it

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.360 
have not found anything on this and it
seems<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.480> what<00:00:43.469> people<00:00:43.710> would<00:00:43.950> be<00:00:44.010> doing

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
seems like what people would be doing

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.750 
seems like what people would be doing
this<00:00:44.520> especially<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.420> sword<00:00:45.690> makers<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.760> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
this especially you sword makers and and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.340 
this especially you sword makers and and
just<00:00:48.690> general<00:00:49.050> hobbyists<00:00:49.820> bit<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.910> fun

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
just general hobbyists bit of fun

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.500 
just general hobbyists bit of fun
nothing<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.920> let's<00:00:53.100> find<00:00:53.250> out<00:00:53.489> first<00:00:54.270> off<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
nothing so let's find out first off I

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.000 
nothing so let's find out first off I
just<00:00:54.539> wanted<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> get<00:00:55.050> my<00:00:55.170> technique<00:00:55.530> down<00:00:55.739> on

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
just wanted to get my technique down on

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.790 
just wanted to get my technique down on
just<00:00:56.610> generally<00:00:57.030> hardening<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.629> I've<00:00:58.590> seen

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
just generally hardening it I've seen

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.069 
just generally hardening it I've seen
lots<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.039> people<00:00:59.309> say<00:00:59.460> do<00:00:59.879> it<00:00:59.910> over<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.329> fire<00:01:00.570> but

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
lots of people say do it over a fire but

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.889 
lots of people say do it over a fire but
it<00:01:01.170> under<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> fire<00:01:01.890> put<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.430> coals<00:01:02.899> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
it under a fire put it in coals the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.170 
it under a fire put it in coals the
point<00:01:04.140> sounds<00:01:04.530> bit<00:01:04.680> generally<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:06.000> want

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
point sounds bit generally you just want

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.730 
point sounds bit generally you just want
to<00:01:06.270> heat<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.479> up<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:06.990> did<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.350> under<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
to heat it up so I did it under the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.520 
to heat it up so I did it under the
grill<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.729> sense<00:01:09.770> it's<00:01:10.770> not<00:01:10.890> an<00:01:11.070> easy<00:01:11.189> for<00:01:11.490> me

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
grill like sense it's not an easy for me

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.550 
grill like sense it's not an easy for me
that's<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.619> test<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.540> just<00:01:15.540> simply<00:01:16.200> hammered

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
that's to test it I just simply hammered

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.219 
that's to test it I just simply hammered
a<00:01:16.799> nail<00:01:17.210> into<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.659> piece<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.900> wood<00:01:20.360> down<00:01:21.360> into<00:01:22.170> a

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
a nail into a piece of wood down into a

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.140 
a nail into a piece of wood down into a
piece<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.439> wood<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.430> fire<00:01:23.640> heart<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.030> down

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
piece of wood and a fire heart and down

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.520 
piece of wood and a fire heart and down
into<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.509> piece<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.930> wood<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.350> what

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
into this piece of wood and see what

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.840 
into this piece of wood and see what
happens<00:01:25.830> see<00:01:25.979> what<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.220> difference<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.670> where

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
happens see what the difference is where

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.069 
happens see what the difference is where
and<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.140> can<00:01:28.229> see<00:01:28.520> beyond<00:01:29.520> hardened<00:01:29.939> L<00:01:30.090> did

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
and as you can see beyond hardened L did

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.350 
and as you can see beyond hardened L did
nothing<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.729> blunted<00:01:32.729> straightaway<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
nothing it just blunted straightaway and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.100 
nothing it just blunted straightaway and
fell<00:01:33.570> down<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.350> hard<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:35.420> stayed<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
fell down the hard one stayed in and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.490 
fell down the hard one stayed in and
although<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.130> not<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.460> video<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.439> did<00:01:40.439> a

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
although it's not in this video I did a

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.899 
although it's not in this video I did a
couple<00:01:40.650> more<00:01:40.829> times<00:01:41.100> after<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.820> it

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
couple more times after that and it

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.639 
couple more times after that and it
still<00:01:42.119> stayed<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:43.049> retained<00:01:43.470> its

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
still stayed in it it retained its

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.399 
still stayed in it it retained its
sharpness<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> degree<00:01:45.180> but<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> heart<00:01:46.350> is

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
sharpness to a degree but the heart is

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.990 
sharpness to a degree but the heart is
still<00:01:46.740> allowed<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.310> penetrate<00:01:47.520> into<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
still allowed it to penetrate into the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.100 
still allowed it to penetrate into the
wood<00:01:48.180> which<00:01:48.299> makes<00:01:48.509> sense<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.810> guess<00:01:48.960> because

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
wood which makes sense I guess because

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.840 
wood which makes sense I guess because
that's<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.590> people<00:01:49.770> are<00:01:49.979> using<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.610> for

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
that's what people are using it for for

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.560 
that's what people are using it for for
stabbing<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.020> killing<00:01:52.970> prey<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.000> suppose<00:01:54.390> I

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
stabbing and killing prey I suppose I

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.709 
stabbing and killing prey I suppose I
don't<00:01:54.630> know<00:01:54.840> what<00:01:54.960> piece<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:56.450> now<00:01:57.450> because

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
don't know what piece it now because

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.319 
don't know what piece it now because
it's<00:01:57.840> hardened<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.530> anything<00:01:59.009> else<00:01:59.329> I'm

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
it's hardened like anything else I'm

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.310 
it's hardened like anything else I'm
thinking<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:01.320> must<00:02:01.619> become<00:02:02.219> brittle<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.140> did

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
thinking it must become brittle so I did

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.600 
thinking it must become brittle so I did
a<00:02:04.350> little<00:02:04.469> test<00:02:04.710> than<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.070> just<00:02:05.310> simply

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
a little test than that just simply

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.499 
a little test than that just simply
chucked<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.119> vise<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.829> yanked<00:02:07.829> Elliott

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
chucked in the vise and yanked Elliott

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.729 
chucked in the vise and yanked Elliott
along<00:02:09.509> with<00:02:09.690> obviously<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.050> unhardened<00:02:10.530> down

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
along with obviously the unhardened down

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.010 
along with obviously the unhardened down
and<00:02:10.920> see<00:02:11.099> what<00:02:11.310> happened<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
and see what happened and

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.360 
and see what happened and
now<00:02:13.710> behold<00:02:14.040> yet<00:02:14.430> it's<00:02:14.730> really<00:02:15.480> brittle<00:02:15.690> and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
now behold yet it's really brittle and

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.620 
now behold yet it's really brittle and

oak<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.790> don't<00:02:36.060> know<00:02:36.150> if<00:02:36.240> it's<00:02:36.360> because<00:02:36.570> of

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
oak and I don't know if it's because of

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.180 
oak and I don't know if it's because of
the<00:02:36.750> grain<00:02:36.960> but<00:02:37.200> when<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.440> get<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.710> a<00:02:37.740> fine

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
the grain but when you get to a fine

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.880 
the grain but when you get to a fine
point<00:02:38.460> in<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.820> it<00:02:39.810> starts<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.290> crumble<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.710> lot

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
point in it it starts to crumble a lot

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.830 
point in it it starts to crumble a lot
especially<00:02:41.430> when<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:41.940> fine<00:02:42.120> especially

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
especially when it's fine especially

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.050 
especially when it's fine especially
when<00:02:42.960> it's<00:02:43.080> very<00:02:43.230> brittle<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:44.610> just<00:02:44.790> kind<00:02:45.030> of

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
when it's very brittle it just kind of

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.260 
when it's very brittle it just kind of
crumbles<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:46.020> it's<00:02:46.980> got<00:02:47.190> no<00:02:47.370> edge<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:48.120> it

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
crumbles and it's got no edge to it

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.250 
crumbles and it's got no edge to it
which<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:49.250> strange<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.670> thought<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.240> would<00:02:51.420> hold

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
which is strange I thought it would hold

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.820 
which is strange I thought it would hold
up<00:02:52.470> better<00:02:52.680> but<00:02:53.040> weirdly<00:02:53.490> pine<00:02:54.710> holds<00:02:55.710> up

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
up better but weirdly pine holds up

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.470 
up better but weirdly pine holds up
really<00:02:56.010> well<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.670> edge<00:02:56.820> doesn't<00:02:57.150> if<00:02:57.330> it's

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
really well the edge doesn't if it's

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.320 
really well the edge doesn't if it's
because<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.900> long<00:02:58.260> thick<00:02:58.590> grains<00:02:59.150> but<00:03:00.150> it

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
because of the long thick grains but it

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.030 
because of the long thick grains but it
holds<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.720> edge<00:03:00.870> quite<00:03:01.140> nicely<00:03:01.380> now<00:03:01.740> i<00:03:01.770> tried

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
holds the edge quite nicely now i tried

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.790 
holds the edge quite nicely now i tried
this<00:03:02.160> loads<00:03:02.520> of<00:03:02.760> times<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:04.490> and<00:03:05.490> it<00:03:06.240> just<00:03:06.800> you

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
this loads of times and and it just you

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.420 
this loads of times and and it just you
can<00:03:07.950> get<00:03:08.130> an<00:03:08.250> edge<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.880> it's<00:03:09.210> kind<00:03:09.420> of<00:03:09.480> sharp

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
can get an edge and it's kind of sharp

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.450 
can get an edge and it's kind of sharp
but<00:03:11.430> it's<00:03:11.870> it's<00:03:12.870> nothing<00:03:13.110> special<00:03:13.410> i<00:03:13.800> tried

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
but it's it's nothing special i tried

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.400 
but it's it's nothing special i tried
applying<00:03:14.670> varnish<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:15.930> because<00:03:16.170> i<00:03:16.230> thought

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
applying varnish to it because i thought

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.220 
applying varnish to it because i thought
maybe<00:03:16.620> if<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.980> edge<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.190> plastic<00:03:18.230> not

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
maybe if the edge is plastic not

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.630 
maybe if the edge is plastic not
technically<00:03:19.680> whoop<00:03:19.980> then<00:03:20.220> i<00:03:20.310> could<00:03:20.460> sharpen

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
technically whoop then i could sharpen

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.150 
technically whoop then i could sharpen
it<00:03:20.880> better<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.960> can<00:03:22.080> get<00:03:22.230> better<00:03:22.410> rich<00:03:22.710> but

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
it better and I can get better rich but

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.830 
it better and I can get better rich but
that<00:03:23.460> flaked<00:03:23.760> more<00:03:24.060> than<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.450> wood<00:03:24.660> did

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
that flaked more than the wood did

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.990 
that flaked more than the wood did
strangely<00:03:25.280> so<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.520> went<00:03:26.730> out<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.880> window

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
strangely so that went out the window

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.930 
strangely so that went out the window
and<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.570> just<00:03:27.810> used<00:03:28.320> boiled<00:03:29.310> linseed<00:03:29.400> oil<00:03:29.730> in

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
and I just used boiled linseed oil in

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.880 
and I just used boiled linseed oil in
the<00:03:30.000> end<00:03:30.120> which<00:03:30.900> seemed<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.200> work<00:03:31.320> quite<00:03:31.710> nice

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
the end which seemed to work quite nice

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.270 
the end which seemed to work quite nice
but<00:03:32.850> even<00:03:33.060> with<00:03:33.330> my<00:03:33.480> best<00:03:33.780> test<00:03:34.140> pieces<00:03:34.350> the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
but even with my best test pieces the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.580 
but even with my best test pieces the
edge<00:03:35.430> stills<00:03:35.850> nothing<00:03:36.510> nothing<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.410> write

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
edge stills nothing nothing to write

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.320 
edge stills nothing nothing to write
home<00:03:37.620> about<00:03:37.860> if<00:03:38.490> I<00:03:38.550> still<00:03:38.760> wanted<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.000> round<00:03:39.210> it

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
home about if I still wanted to round it

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.840 
home about if I still wanted to round it
up<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:40.020> larger<00:03:40.650> sword<00:03:40.950> just<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.580> see<00:03:41.730> what

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
up to it a larger sword just to see what

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.720 
up to it a larger sword just to see what
happened<00:03:42.180> maybe<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.710> fact<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.250> longer

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
happened maybe the fact that is a longer

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.420 
happened maybe the fact that is a longer
edge<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.630> more<00:03:45.990> sort<00:03:46.770> of<00:03:46.830> friction<00:03:47.190> on<00:03:47.280> that

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
edge and a more sort of friction on that

fine edge to cut into something worth a
try<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.120> guess<00:03:51.350> so<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.410> hit<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.590> with<00:03:52.740> the<00:03:52.800> angle

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
try I guess so I hit it with the angle

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.340 
try I guess so I hit it with the angle
grinder<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.670> made<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.820> very<00:03:54.180> very<00:03:54.570> rough<00:03:54.990> sword

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
grinder and made a very very rough sword

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:02.510 
grinder and made a very very rough sword
and<00:03:55.800> good<00:03:56.730> enough<00:03:56.940> for<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.090> test<00:03:58.250> and<00:04:01.340> as<00:04:02.340> you

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
and good enough for a test and as you

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.500 
and good enough for a test and as you
can<00:04:02.670> see<00:04:02.940> on<00:04:03.270> my<00:04:03.330> little<00:04:04.520> test<00:04:05.520> cuts<00:04:05.880> on<00:04:06.360> this

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
can see on my little test cuts on this

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.900 
can see on my little test cuts on this
Apple<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:07.740> did<00:04:07.950> nothing<00:04:08.100> pretty<00:04:08.580> much<00:04:08.700> hit<00:04:08.880> the

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
Apple it did nothing pretty much hit the

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.830 
Apple it did nothing pretty much hit the
Apple<00:04:09.240> the<00:04:09.510> apple<00:04:10.250> flew<00:04:11.250> off<00:04:11.430> like<00:04:11.760> Mars<00:04:12.750> or

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
Apple the apple flew off like Mars or

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.650 
Apple the apple flew off like Mars or
just<00:04:13.050> hit<00:04:13.140> it<00:04:13.170> with<00:04:13.380> a<00:04:13.410> bat<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:14.510> there<00:04:15.510> was

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
just hit it with a bat and there was

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.680 
just hit it with a bat and there was
some<00:04:15.840> evidence<00:04:16.200> of<00:04:16.410> some<00:04:16.470> bits<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:17.910> chopping

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
some evidence of some bits to chopping

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.530 
some evidence of some bits to chopping
off<00:04:18.810> but<00:04:19.739> he<00:04:19.830> didn't<00:04:20.070> slice<00:04:20.430> through<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:20.910> it

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
off but he didn't slice through it it

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.000 
off but he didn't slice through it it
just<00:04:21.720> kind<00:04:21.900> of<00:04:22.020> chopped<00:04:22.380> it<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:22.740> think<00:04:22.800> it's

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
just kind of chopped it and I think it's

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.909 
just kind of chopped it and I think it's
just<00:04:23.160> split<00:04:23.520> from<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.390> force<00:04:24.750> of<00:04:24.960> hitting<00:04:25.260> it

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
just split from the force of hitting it

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.480 
just split from the force of hitting it
and<00:04:26.069> I<00:04:26.689> took<00:04:27.689> it<00:04:27.780> to<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:27.960> ground<00:04:28.139> I<00:04:28.439> did<00:04:29.400> the

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
and I took it to the ground I did the

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.920 
and I took it to the ground I did the
same<00:04:29.639> thing<00:04:29.699> just<00:04:30.120> hit<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.270> on<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:30.479> ground<00:04:30.689> and

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
same thing just hit it on the ground and

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.369 
same thing just hit it on the ground and
as<00:04:31.800> you<00:04:31.889> can<00:04:31.979> see<00:04:32.039> you<00:04:32.280> just<00:04:33.110> just<00:04:34.110> kind<00:04:34.289> of

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:34.379 
as you can see you just just kind of

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:35.510 
as you can see you just just kind of
split<00:04:34.710> up<00:04:34.740> might<00:04:34.949> as<00:04:35.009> well<00:04:35.069> just<00:04:35.249> hit<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.430> with

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
split up might as well just hit it with

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.100 
split up might as well just hit it with
a<00:04:35.639> piece<00:04:35.819> of<00:04:35.939> wood<00:04:36.090> didn't<00:04:36.479> really<00:04:36.810> do

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
a piece of wood didn't really do

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.040 
a piece of wood didn't really do
anything

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
anything

myth busted on that one

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:44.510 
myth busted on that one
unless<00:04:42.719> anyone<00:04:43.139> can<00:04:43.349> show<00:04:43.800> me<00:04:43.979> actual

evidence<00:04:44.879> of<00:04:45.090> a<00:04:45.180> cutting<00:04:45.800> sword<00:04:46.800> like<00:04:47.400> a

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
evidence of a cutting sword like a

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.760 
evidence of a cutting sword like a
properly<00:04:47.999> cutting<00:04:48.419> sword<00:04:48.689> I've<00:04:49.110> seen<00:04:49.379> a<00:04:49.409> few

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
properly cutting sword I've seen a few

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.189 
properly cutting sword I've seen a few
videos<00:04:49.830> where<00:04:50.930> they<00:04:51.930> hid<00:04:52.169> in<00:04:52.349> a<00:04:52.439> piece<00:04:52.620> of

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
videos where they hid in a piece of

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.510 
videos where they hid in a piece of
newspaper<00:04:55.199> with<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.710> very<00:04:55.889> tip<00:04:56.069> of<00:04:56.249> the<00:04:56.340> sword

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
newspaper with the very tip of the sword

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.890 
newspaper with the very tip of the sword
yeah<00:04:56.729> that's<00:04:56.969> a<00:04:57.060> point<00:04:57.389> and<00:04:57.599> you're<00:04:57.689> hitting

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
yeah that's a point and you're hitting

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.290 
yeah that's a point and you're hitting
it<00:04:57.990> very<00:04:58.020> quick<00:04:58.349> that<00:04:58.529> all<00:04:58.680> happened<00:04:59.120> but<00:05:00.120> as

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
it very quick that all happened but as

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.990 
it very quick that all happened but as
in<00:05:01.169> terms<00:05:01.379> of<00:05:01.710> actually<00:05:02.069> cutting<00:05:02.370> with<00:05:02.759> the

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
in terms of actually cutting with the

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.809 
in terms of actually cutting with the
blade<00:05:03.409> it<00:05:04.409> just<00:05:04.680> doesn't<00:05:04.949> work<00:05:05.099> it<00:05:05.759> doesn't

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
blade it just doesn't work it doesn't

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:09.110 
blade it just doesn't work it doesn't
act<00:05:06.750> like<00:05:07.229> a<00:05:07.259> blade<00:05:07.560> does<00:05:07.830> it<00:05:08.490> just<00:05:08.759> acts<00:05:08.969> like

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
act like a blade does it just acts like

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.899 
act like a blade does it just acts like
a<00:05:09.240> thin<00:05:09.509> point<00:05:10.069> and<00:05:11.069> you<00:05:11.159> don't<00:05:11.340> really<00:05:11.639> need

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
a thin point and you don't really need

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.990 
a thin point and you don't really need
to<00:05:12.150> fire<00:05:12.509> harden<00:05:12.810> it<00:05:12.900> all<00:05:13.020> under<00:05:13.199> set<00:05:14.000> because

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
to fire harden it all under set because

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.730 
to fire harden it all under set because
if<00:05:15.120> you're<00:05:15.240> hitting<00:05:15.419> anything<00:05:15.629> hard<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.349> it's

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
if you're hitting anything hard and it's

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.619 
if you're hitting anything hard and it's
the<00:05:16.919> thin<00:05:17.159> edge<00:05:17.370> and<00:05:17.610> it's<00:05:17.819> obviously<00:05:18.150> brittle

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:18.629 
the thin edge and it's obviously brittle

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.170 
the thin edge and it's obviously brittle
from<00:05:18.779> way<00:05:18.960> to<00:05:19.020> fire<00:05:19.259> hardened<00:05:19.710> it<00:05:19.969> it's<00:05:20.969> gonna

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
from way to fire hardened it it's gonna

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.600 
from way to fire hardened it it's gonna
snap<00:05:21.509> this<00:05:21.719> gonna<00:05:21.930> come<00:05:22.800> in<00:05:22.949> at<00:05:23.129> weird<00:05:23.400> angles

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
snap this gonna come in at weird angles

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.820 
snap this gonna come in at weird angles
and<00:05:23.969> snap<00:05:24.150> it<00:05:24.270> off<00:05:24.389> as<00:05:25.050> a<00:05:25.110> point<00:05:25.439> is<00:05:25.589> fine

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
and snap it off as a point is fine

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.899 
and snap it off as a point is fine
because<00:05:25.979> you're<00:05:26.129> going<00:05:26.310> straight<00:05:26.639> against

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
because you're going straight against

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.300 
because you're going straight against
the<00:05:27.029> wood<00:05:27.210> and<00:05:27.620> you've<00:05:28.620> obviously<00:05:28.949> got<00:05:29.249> the

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
the wood and you've obviously got the

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.999 
the wood and you've obviously got the
tapered<00:05:29.939> edge<00:05:30.120> that<00:05:30.509> supports<00:05:30.960> that<00:05:31.139> point<00:05:31.379> so

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
tapered edge that supports that point so

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.939 
tapered edge that supports that point so
yeah<00:05:32.159> that<00:05:32.460> makes<00:05:32.639> sense<00:05:33.240> that<00:05:33.479> works<00:05:33.719> but<00:05:34.020> for

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
yeah that makes sense that works but for

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:39.079 
yeah that makes sense that works but for
a<00:05:35.009> blade<00:05:35.219> no<00:05:36.120> way<00:05:36.360> I<00:05:36.680> could<00:05:37.680> not<00:05:37.889> get<00:05:38.129> a<00:05:38.460> decent

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:39.089 
a blade no way I could not get a decent

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.379 
a blade no way I could not get a decent
edge<00:05:39.539> well<00:05:40.409> a<00:05:40.439> decent<00:05:40.800> cutting<00:05:41.099> edge<00:05:41.250> and<00:05:41.610> it

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
edge well a decent cutting edge and it

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:47.990 
edge well a decent cutting edge and it
takes<00:05:42.599> a<00:05:42.719> lot<00:05:42.870> of<00:05:42.930> work<00:05:45.020> you<00:05:46.020> can<00:05:46.199> I<00:05:46.849> don't<00:05:47.849> see

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
takes a lot of work you can I don't see

why you would need to if you was out in
the<00:05:49.740> wild<00:05:50.159> you<00:05:50.310> would<00:05:50.490> just<00:05:50.610> use<00:05:50.819> a<00:05:50.849> stick<00:05:51.240> or<00:05:51.419> a

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
the wild you would just use a stick or a

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:56.029 
the wild you would just use a stick or a

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
spear of rock and if you're not in a

spear of rock and if you're not in a
while<00:05:56.189> and<00:05:56.310> you're<00:05:56.370> just<00:05:56.520> making<00:05:56.819> a<00:05:56.879> cutting

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
while and you're just making a cutting

implement you don't even dream at the
time<00:06:01.110> it<00:06:01.259> takes<00:06:01.490> just<00:06:02.490> a<00:06:02.610> standard<00:06:03.029> bit<00:06:03.210> of

that

finally all tests but ultimately kind of
pointless
