00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.030 

we've<00:00:11.630> got<00:00:11.900> basically<00:00:12.500> three<00:00:12.740> key<00:00:12.889> components

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
we've got basically three key components

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.890 
we've got basically three key components
that<00:00:13.490> make<00:00:13.639> up<00:00:13.670> the<00:00:14.180> weather<00:00:14.330> system<00:00:14.750> that

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
that make up the weather system that

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.180 
that make up the weather system that
there's<00:00:15.110> the<00:00:15.230> visual<00:00:15.440> effects<00:00:15.740> so<00:00:16.010> in<00:00:16.129> the

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
there's the visual effects so in the

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.940 
there's the visual effects so in the

part<00:00:32.630> of<00:00:32.720> the<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:33.290> weather<00:00:33.470> system<00:00:33.830> is

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
part of the the weather system is

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.230 
part of the the weather system is
actually<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.460> effect<00:00:34.760> it<00:00:34.910> has<00:00:35.030> on<00:00:35.060> the

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.240 
actually the effect it has on the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.510 
actually the effect it has on the
gameplay<00:00:35.660> it<00:00:36.230> just<00:00:36.410> changes<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:36.920> attitude<00:00:37.430> of

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
gameplay it just changes the attitude of

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.040 
gameplay it just changes the attitude of
the<00:00:37.670> car<00:00:37.850> completely<00:00:38.030> in<00:00:38.450> terms<00:00:38.780> of<00:00:38.900> driving

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
the car completely in terms of driving

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.650 
the car completely in terms of driving
in<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:39.860> dryer<00:00:40.100> or<00:00:40.250> fully<00:00:40.760> wet<00:00:40.940> or<00:00:41.090> partially

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
in the dryer or fully wet or partially

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.240 
in the dryer or fully wet or partially
damp<00:00:41.870> track<00:00:42.080> so<00:00:42.470> it's<00:00:42.590> all<00:00:42.680> about<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:43.070> sort

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
damp track so it's all about the sort

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.710 
damp track so it's all about the sort
strategy<00:00:43.670> elements<00:00:44.000> at<00:00:44.090> these<00:00:44.210> points<00:00:44.420> where

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
strategy elements at these points where

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.230 
strategy elements at these points where
the<00:00:45.110> tracks<00:00:45.620> changing<00:00:45.950> from<00:00:46.040> wet<00:00:46.220> to<00:00:46.250> dry<00:00:46.520> the

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
the tracks changing from wet to dry the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.880 
the tracks changing from wet to dry the
track<00:00:47.480> will<00:00:47.660> evolve<00:00:47.900> as<00:00:48.320> each<00:00:48.560> car

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
track will evolve as each car

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.030 
track will evolve as each car
individually<00:00:49.670> drives<00:00:49.910> on<00:00:50.120> that<00:00:50.240> surface<00:00:50.480> and

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
individually drives on that surface and

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.980 
individually drives on that surface and
yeah<00:00:52.040> very<00:00:52.310> very<00:00:52.610> accurate<00:00:53.030> a<00:00:53.240> track<00:00:53.720> surface

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:53.990 
yeah very very accurate a track surface

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.780 
yeah very very accurate a track surface
actually<00:00:54.470> knows<00:00:54.620> how<00:00:54.650> wet<00:00:55.040> is<00:00:55.190> you'll

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
actually knows how wet is you'll

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.310 
actually knows how wet is you'll
actually<00:00:55.910> find<00:00:56.180> that<00:00:56.330> the<00:00:56.600> game<00:00:56.780> is<00:00:56.990> on<00:00:57.080> wet

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
actually find that the game is on wet

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.870 
actually find that the game is on wet
tires<00:00:57.560> on<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:57.950> drying<00:00:58.190> track<00:00:58.460> will<00:00:58.670> try<00:00:58.820> and

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
tires on the drying track will try and

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.190 
tires on the drying track will try and
seek<00:00:59.090> out<00:00:59.270> those<00:00:59.420> puddles<00:00:59.630> to<00:00:59.870> call<00:01:00.050> their

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
seek out those puddles to call their

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.960 
seek out those puddles to call their
tires<00:01:00.380> and<00:01:00.680> stop<00:01:00.830> them<00:01:00.950> from<00:01:01.010> damaging<00:01:01.520> when

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
tires and stop them from damaging when

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.670 
tires and stop them from damaging when
you're<00:01:02.090> in<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.300> car<00:01:02.510> you've<00:01:02.810> really<00:01:03.320> got<00:01:03.440> no

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
you're in the car you've really got no

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.560 
you're in the car you've really got no
idea<00:01:03.950> what<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.189> web<00:01:04.339> is<00:01:04.460> doing<00:01:04.759> but<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.330> teams

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
idea what the web is doing but the teams

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.870 
idea what the web is doing but the teams
they<00:01:06.049> know<00:01:06.320> by<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:06.680> radar<00:01:07.220> where<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.759> weather

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
they know by the radar where the weather

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.490 
they know by the radar where the weather
is<00:01:08.119> coming<00:01:08.390> in<00:01:08.630> from<00:01:08.900> and<00:01:09.110> how<00:01:09.200> long<00:01:09.380> it's

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
is coming in from and how long it's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.230 
is coming in from and how long it's
going<00:01:09.619> to<00:01:09.680> last<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.189> that's<00:01:10.910> something<00:01:11.090> that

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
going to last and that's something that

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.120 
going to last and that's something that
will<00:01:11.450> be<00:01:11.570> added<00:01:12.260> into<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.530> game<00:01:12.650> as<00:01:12.920> well

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
will be added into the game as well

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.130 
will be added into the game as well
you'll<00:01:13.670> be<00:01:13.820> aware<00:01:14.330> of<00:01:14.390> what<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.840> weather's

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
you'll be aware of what the weather's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.200 
you'll be aware of what the weather's
doing<00:01:15.470> roughly<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.310> then<00:01:16.670> you<00:01:16.790> can<00:01:16.940> make<00:01:17.030> your

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
doing roughly and then you can make your

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.920 
doing roughly and then you can make your
court<00:01:17.480> just<00:01:17.720> like<00:01:17.840> you<00:01:17.960> would<00:01:18.080> in<00:01:18.200> real<00:01:18.230> life

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
court just like you would in real life

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.330 
court just like you would in real life
the<00:01:20.930> weather<00:01:21.110> system<00:01:21.500> is<00:01:21.650> set<00:01:21.800> up<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:22.100> be

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
the weather system is set up to be

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.610 
the weather system is set up to be
linear<00:01:22.730> dynamic<00:01:23.180> for<00:01:23.420> career<00:01:23.780> it<00:01:24.080> changes

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
linear dynamic for career it changes

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.820 
linear dynamic for career it changes
over<00:01:24.650> time<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.640> you<00:01:26.420> go<00:01:26.540> to<00:01:26.600> spa<00:01:26.990> typically

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
over time so you go to spa typically

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.410 
over time so you go to spa typically
very<00:01:28.070> unpredictable<00:01:28.400> track<00:01:28.940> then<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:29.270> need

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
very unpredictable track then you need

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.600 
very unpredictable track then you need
to<00:01:29.510> be<00:01:29.600> prepared<00:01:29.690> to<00:01:30.050> alter<00:01:30.890> your<00:01:30.920> car<00:01:31.250> balance

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
to be prepared to alter your car balance

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.540 
to be prepared to alter your car balance
as<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.570> race<00:01:32.840> weekend<00:01:33.230> progresses<00:01:33.830> so<00:01:34.370> that

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
as the race weekend progresses so that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.130 
as the race weekend progresses so that

when you're heading towards that Sunday
race<00:01:36.350> day<00:01:36.620> you<00:01:37.190> think<00:01:37.460> you've<00:01:37.940> got<00:01:37.970> a<00:01:38.120> you've

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
race day you think you've got a you've

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.000 
race day you think you've got a you've
got<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.630> car<00:01:38.840> setup<00:01:39.140> is<00:01:39.320> going<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:39.560> be<00:01:39.620> balanced

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
got a car setup is going to be balanced

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.880 
got a car setup is going to be balanced
