it<00:03:34.989> all<00:03:35.320> depends<00:03:35.769> on<00:03:35.860> what<00:03:36.070> sort<00:03:36.280> of<00:03:36.400> job<00:03:36.459> you

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
it all depends on what sort of job you

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.400 
it all depends on what sort of job you
wanted<00:03:37.000> I<00:03:37.090> mean<00:03:37.120> that's<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.570> mecca<00:03:37.780> flexplay

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
wanted I mean that's a mecca flexplay

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.140 
wanted I mean that's a mecca flexplay
job<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:38.739> mean<00:03:38.860> that's<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:39.250> bit<00:03:39.400> dearer<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:39.970> just

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
job I mean that's a bit dearer and just

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.660 
job I mean that's a bit dearer and just
the<00:03:40.299> normal<00:03:40.720> like<00:03:40.959> cellulose<00:03:41.620> paint<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:42.549> know

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
the normal like cellulose paint you know

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.660 
the normal like cellulose paint you know
yeah<00:03:43.019> roughly<00:03:44.019> this<00:03:44.320> this<00:03:44.680> scoot<00:03:45.010> had<00:03:45.220> done<00:03:45.430> it

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
yeah roughly this this scoot had done it

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.190 
yeah roughly this this scoot had done it
would<00:03:45.760> probably<00:03:46.030> cost<00:03:46.360> you<00:03:46.600> around<00:03:46.750> about<00:03:47.170> a

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
would probably cost you around about a

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.319 
would probably cost you around about a
gram<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:47.620> 1500<00:03:48.370> pound<00:03:48.579> depending<00:03:49.090> what<00:03:49.209> you

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
gram to 1500 pound depending what you

gram to 1500 pound depending what you
wanted<00:03:49.660> don't<00:03:49.870> done<00:03:50.140> on<00:03:50.260> it<00:03:50.410> it<00:03:51.070> seems<00:03:51.370> younger

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
wanted don't done on it it seems younger

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.890 
wanted don't done on it it seems younger
vibe<00:03:51.910> for<00:03:52.060> money<00:03:52.180> because<00:03:52.390> I<00:03:52.450> couldn't<00:03:52.720> fish
