00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.920
 O 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.190
 the appearance can not camouflage the essence 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.790
 she feels also of resistance 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.790
 of people 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.400
 I have to the city's success time 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.779
 whole I feel inside of you 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.070
 of this movement 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.140
 I live in the city much more than 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.470
 my own because my own 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.470
 House 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.110
 O 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.630
 I think the city is the show she offers 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.860
 an incredible visual repertoire the time 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.840
 all in 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.450
 We can walk down the same street a 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.559
 million times but every day will be a 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.510
 different path 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.270
 the day will be different, student is 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.120
 different the smell will be the other will 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.890
 interweaving more and more his life 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.930
 with the city in a way that it 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.930
 becomes an extension of your home 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.440
 my main goal is always to create 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.680
 a job that has a motor would 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.259
 see that it was thought to exist 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.840
 not simply a copy of a form 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.940
 which perhaps can give you right 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.640
 I always have a concern that 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.979
 spaces have a soul is that they do not 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.660
 look like a showroom leo romano begins with 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.470
 the way my machine answers 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.840
 The telephone 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.600
 I depend on everyone so my 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.830
 can be presented in the best possible 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.680
 possible way 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.930
 I say we are a team I have 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.750
 who do design but I have to 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.360
 infects them once they being 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.320
 infected they also feel part of 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.330
 of the process 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.880
 the creative work if I'm 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.360
 involved that everyone is involved 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.659
 his chance and it works for him is very 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.659
 great 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.480
 urban is to fit within this 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.030
 dynamic is that the city â€‹â€‹the character that 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:20.270
 traffic station 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.970
 socializing and learning that you have your 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.130
 space within this universe 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.260
 I take care of the street as if she were mine. 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.260
 I take care of the sidewalk as if it were a 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.840
 day I as he was also my April 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:39.709
 imagine that I 'm not alone here 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.420
 that with all the differences and 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.610
 possibilities the world offers me 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.610
 I have to do this it works 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.030
 the urban mixer is inserted within the 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.030
 collective 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:01.489
 and it's what makes you 're a happy one, eh? 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.489
 my daily life is this
