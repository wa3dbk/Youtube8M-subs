00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.990
 [Music] 

00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:09.940
 [Laughs] 

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:14.799
 [Music] 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:20.740
 well we are going to set the biggest one for 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:22.060
 see if there is luck in the network is the 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.610
 growth moment of trawling 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.469
 you throw the one in one place and over 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.040
 a pack below the river that is 

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:32.469
 lift out the largest 2,000 meters of 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.910
 bridge and we raise it already one hour and 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.489
 average more or less valmayor in the water 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.039
 we advance against the bridge there goes by 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.440
 where it arrives you do not touch each one goes 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.750
 arriving he goes scoring every 40 minutes 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.360
 a canoe goes out 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.760
 as you will see here there are many cannons in a 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.700
 average of every 30 or 40 minutes sometimes 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.080
 you have to wait up to 24 hours for 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.130
 develop the activity is going to be 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.439
 effective in our activity 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.439
 [Music] 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.829
 it has happened of all to know all the 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.270
 congresses about jobs you 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:11.159
 of heat-hungry mosquitoes costs a 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.929
 heap is not easy like everything I think 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.420
 ourselves from fishing if not 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:18.670
 we fish we do not eat easy there's a lot 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.740
 people who think that the ball is 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.180
 pulling the water becomes a millionaire 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.490
 if I give you the opportunity that says 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.450
 a greater one was pulling on the water and when 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.460
 the lift has to buy a 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:36.010
 bicycle seems can do the weight in 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.440
 daily as it can be 10 weight of a train 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.690
 there is very difficult season for the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.760
 picador where they spend months and months that 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.850
 they can not extract any kind of 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.930
 species but I sinned to the market I think 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.980
 that a little the downpipe of the cold that 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.530
 also fish by air moves 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.510
 we believe we believe that the only 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.120
 help that is preside over the farm or anything 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.390
 more and having to fight to receive a 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.550
 mine or maybe fifteen twenty years had 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.830
 very few fishermen the amount of 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.180
 fish that was there was to be shared 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.890
 with four or five fishermen 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.630
 now there are many who see it from outside 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.250
 they say there's no more fish there's no more to 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.440
 the cake of the same nothing that there is now 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.550
 to eat it among a lot more people 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.790
 the wedding is thrown has a single removed the 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.790
 zone 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:34.620
 but at the same time 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.620
 there 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.850
 there it was finished 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:45.720
 and there is one more window of luck 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.720
 what is done in which God helps him 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.000
 [Music] 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.960
 [Applause] 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.810
 but 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.970
 [Music] 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.750
 but it's a lie because we were like 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.030
 an average fish since it has desolated 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.650
 ten times five times the greatest 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.810
 I would have to have the only thing alive 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.100
 what you have to do is respect the size 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.170
 of mesh and extract from the river good 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.310
 a species that has been fulfilled sign 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.310
 [Music] 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.409
 to us sin has to go through 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.329
 our court for us taking out 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.209
 they carry their lures their live bait 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.099
 fish and golden strike a toad carlos 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.629
 Perez when they get a gold because they 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.500
 lead to sharing from a low family 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.390
 the shadow and golden 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.160
 now watch what happens with our 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.120
 activity we also bring us 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.230
 a fish out there we fit it sapucay 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.390
 but because we know that our family 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.550
 are going to have to eat look at the 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.040
 difference that there is between toad caixa 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.380
 tabs 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.200
 so 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.290
 survive because 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.680
 achieve nothing more for daily food 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.680
 and nothing more 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.730
 and 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.020
 finish 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.020
