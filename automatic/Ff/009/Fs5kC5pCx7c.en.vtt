console the difference in between the

through details of how to create an

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.760 
through details of how to create an
autoexec<00:01:21.600> file<00:01:21.810> because<00:01:22.170> there's<00:01:22.470> many

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
autoexec file because there's many

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.800 
autoexec file because there's many
resources<00:01:23.220> available<00:01:23.430> for<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.330> just

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
resources available for that but just

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.170 
resources available for that but just
what<00:01:25.290> brief<00:01:25.680> options<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.310> think<00:01:26.549> are<00:01:26.640> useful<00:01:26.820> in

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
what brief options I think are useful in

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.380 
what brief options I think are useful in
the<00:01:28.170> console<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.009> autoexec<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.909> which<00:01:30.150> ones

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
the console and autoexec and which ones

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.920 
the console and autoexec and which ones
I<00:01:30.630> use<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.500> i<00:01:31.530> actually<00:01:32.220> only<00:01:32.430> use<00:01:32.790> these<00:01:33.329> for

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
I use so i actually only use these for

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.990 
I use so i actually only use these for

firstly<00:03:51.319> i'm<00:03:51.410> used<00:03:51.590> to<00:03:51.709> it<00:03:51.739> secondly<00:03:52.250> i<00:03:52.579> didn't

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
firstly i'm used to it secondly i didn't

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.120 
firstly i'm used to it secondly i didn't
like<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.630> fact<00:03:53.810> that<00:03:53.989> when<00:03:54.200> i<00:03:54.230> wanted<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.799> move

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
like the fact that when i wanted to move

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.670 
like the fact that when i wanted to move
teammates<00:03:55.760> move<00:03:56.359> sorry<00:03:56.870> follow<00:03:57.109> teammates<00:03:57.530> i

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
teammates move sorry follow teammates i

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.080 
teammates move sorry follow teammates i
had<00:03:58.069> to<00:03:58.250> move<00:03:58.700> click<00:03:59.090> on<00:03:59.269> them<00:03:59.450> instead<00:03:59.690> of

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
had to move click on them instead of

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.759 
had to move click on them instead of
just<00:04:02.090> right<00:04:02.299> clicking<00:04:02.510> on<00:04:02.690> them<00:04:02.900> but<00:04:03.170> i<00:04:03.410> think

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
just right clicking on them but i think

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.150 
just right clicking on them but i think
that's<00:04:03.920> a<00:04:04.100> pretty<00:04:04.489> small<00:04:05.680> pretty<00:04:06.680> small<00:04:06.950> thing

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
that's a pretty small pretty small thing

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.830 
that's a pretty small pretty small thing
compared<00:04:07.549> to<00:04:07.819> this<00:04:08.239> i<00:04:08.299> think<00:04:08.480> this<00:04:08.690> would

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
compared to this i think this would

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.840 
compared to this i think this would
actually<00:04:08.959> be<00:04:09.260> pretty<00:04:09.470> useful<00:04:09.850> disabled

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
actually be pretty useful disabled

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.030 
actually be pretty useful disabled

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
this is

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.850 
this is

if you accidentally scroll a lot and it

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.600

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
you want and lastly very useful one is

dota<00:04:45.980> mini-map<00:04:46.520> misclick<00:04:47.180> time<00:04:47.620> this<00:04:48.620> one<00:04:48.980> is

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
dota mini-map misclick time this one is

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.190 
dota mini-map misclick time this one is
particularly<00:04:49.730> useful<00:04:49.970> if<00:04:50.540> you're<00:04:50.720> radiant

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
particularly useful if you're radiant

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.460 
particularly useful if you're radiant
because<00:04:52.100> if<00:04:52.220> you're<00:04:52.310> radiant<00:04:52.700> you're<00:04:53.000> usually

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
because if you're radiant you're usually

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.800 
because if you're radiant you're usually
clicking<00:04:54.470> down<00:04:55.280> and<00:04:55.700> left<00:04:56.060> because<00:04:56.570> that's

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
clicking down and left because that's

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.250 
clicking down and left because that's
closer<00:04:57.380> to<00:04:57.700> the<00:04:58.700> radiant<00:04:59.150> base<00:04:59.360> so<00:04:59.840> let's<00:05:00.140> say

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
closer to the radiant base so let's say

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.900 
closer to the radiant base so let's say
you're<00:05:00.410> getting<00:05:00.620> chased<00:05:00.860> at<00:05:01.040> the<00:05:01.130> mid<00:05:01.310> t2<00:05:01.670> and

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
you're getting chased at the mid t2 and

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.270 
you're getting chased at the mid t2 and
you<00:05:02.540> want<00:05:02.690> to<00:05:02.750> go<00:05:02.780> back<00:05:02.990> to<00:05:03.020> base<00:05:03.290> so<00:05:03.650> you<00:05:03.740> start

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
you want to go back to base so you start

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.130 
you want to go back to base so you start
constantly<00:05:04.790> clicking<00:05:05.150> on<00:05:05.300> your<00:05:05.660> bottom<00:05:05.810> left

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
constantly clicking on your bottom left

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.710 
constantly clicking on your bottom left
of<00:05:06.200> your<00:05:06.260> screen<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:07.280> try<00:05:08.150> and<00:05:08.270> go<00:05:08.360> home<00:05:08.540> and

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
of your screen to try and go home and

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.110 
of your screen to try and go home and
the<00:05:08.990> mini<00:05:09.170> maps<00:05:09.350> right<00:05:09.500> there<00:05:09.710> so<00:05:10.070> if<00:05:10.370> you

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
the mini maps right there so if you

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.820 
the mini maps right there so if you
actually<00:05:11.360> go<00:05:11.690> a<00:05:11.720> little<00:05:11.960> bit<00:05:12.140> too<00:05:12.290> far<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:12.740> the

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
actually go a little bit too far to the

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.240 
actually go a little bit too far to the
south<00:05:13.070> west<00:05:13.370> you<00:05:14.030> might<00:05:14.210> actually<00:05:14.450> click<00:05:14.930> on

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
south west you might actually click on

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.280 
south west you might actually click on
the<00:05:16.250> complete<00:05:17.030> opposite<00:05:17.630> side<00:05:17.690> of<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.110> map

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
the complete opposite side of the map

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.659 
the complete opposite side of the map
where<00:05:18.440> you're<00:05:18.560> going<00:05:18.800> to<00:05:18.950> because<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.430> top

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
where you're going to because the top

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.850 
where you're going to because the top
right<00:05:19.940> of<00:05:19.970> the<00:05:20.120> mini-map<00:05:20.419> is<00:05:20.630> a<00:05:20.660> dire<00:05:20.960> base<00:05:21.260> so

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
right of the mini-map is a dire base so

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.710 
right of the mini-map is a dire base so
if<00:05:22.220> you<00:05:22.520> go<00:05:22.669> a<00:05:22.700> little<00:05:22.880> bit<00:05:23.060> too<00:05:23.210> far<00:05:23.419> and<00:05:23.660> you

if you go a little bit too far and you

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.480 
if you go a little bit too far and you
miss<00:05:23.960> click<00:05:24.230> there<00:05:24.410> you<00:05:24.680> just<00:05:25.010> run<00:05:25.340> straight

miss click there you just run straight

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.830 
miss click there you just run straight
back<00:05:25.790> into<00:05:25.940> the<00:05:26.090> enemy<00:05:26.360> and<00:05:26.480> then<00:05:26.570> you<00:05:26.660> just

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
back into the enemy and then you just

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.580 
back into the enemy and then you just
straight<00:05:27.290> die<00:05:27.669> and<00:05:28.669> that<00:05:28.700> is<00:05:29.450> a<00:05:29.720> you<00:05:30.470> know

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
straight die and that is a you know

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.440 
straight die and that is a you know
somewhat<00:05:30.890> common<00:05:31.160> mistake<00:05:31.490> so<00:05:31.910> to<00:05:31.970> counteract

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
somewhat common mistake so to counteract

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.000 
somewhat common mistake so to counteract
that<00:05:32.780> you<00:05:32.960> can<00:05:33.080> have<00:05:33.200> a<00:05:33.230> minimum<00:05:33.530> time<00:05:33.710> after

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
that you can have a minimum time after

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.710 
that you can have a minimum time after
mouse<00:05:34.250> enters<00:05:34.610> the<00:05:34.730> mini-map<00:05:35.060> before

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
mouse enters the mini-map before

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.510 
mouse enters the mini-map before
accepting<00:05:36.080> a<00:05:36.140> move<00:05:36.320> command<00:05:36.620> I<00:05:36.890> think<00:05:37.340> it's<00:05:37.460> a

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
accepting a move command I think it's a

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.760 
accepting a move command I think it's a
millisecond<00:05:37.970> so<00:05:38.450> if<00:05:38.630> you<00:05:38.750> want<00:05:38.960> it<00:05:39.050> to<00:05:39.140> be<00:05:39.169> like

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
millisecond so if you want it to be like

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.070 
millisecond so if you want it to be like
half<00:05:39.980> a<00:05:40.070> second<00:05:40.460> before<00:05:40.580> it<00:05:41.510> accepts<00:05:41.840> a<00:05:41.900> moot

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
half a second before it accepts a moot

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.810 
half a second before it accepts a moot
command<00:05:42.410> and<00:05:42.650> you'll<00:05:42.740> be<00:05:42.860> pretty<00:05:43.310> safe<00:05:43.550> from

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
command and you'll be pretty safe from

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.909 
command and you'll be pretty safe from
