00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:08.350
 today we make a little vest a little 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.640
 different from the usual 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:16.970
 just use small tricks for 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.200
 have something different even if then 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:24.260
 the fairly common woven fabric 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.590
 but full of life for the summer 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:32.570
 these paper patterns of the back I have 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.780
 arranged according to the measures I have 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.800
 need this is the front than with the 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:43.580
 resumed in case he wanted to do it by 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:47.770
 fabric however helps me to do ed 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:51.670
 widen to the sides like here and mine 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:56.990
 Here is the shirt 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:02:01.580
 result around I made the size e 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.920
 sew that here I also opened on the back 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.290
 also on the front because the t-shirt 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.489
 quite close to the neck and how 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:18.650
 I said around he cut and sew 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:22.790
 quite it is thick and very pretty and da 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:26.390
 a bit of imagination in addition to the flowers 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:31.050
 to the t-shirt clearly and we will go 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:34.890
 forward creating by giving a little touch 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.190
 ours we will see a little what that 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.190
 lighthouse 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.420
 ok this is the front and front 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.000
 we have the back 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.460
 so we have one shoulder in front 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.150
 to the other this is a necklace that 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:57.200
 I have practically reduced many 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:59.480
 small pieces with which I will go to create 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.440
 my model 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:07.800
 I want to close the opening with one of 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.740
 these little gems therefore they circled by 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:16.410
 your sides the two sides of the opening so 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:21.150
 here do the same thing on the 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:27.210
 behind so I will have the seal also 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:29.670
 behind and even in front of the shoulder not there 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.870
 I close with a seam but rather 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:37.350
 I will also take the jewel and the ok here 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:42.480
 I will come out between the two shoulders 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.770
 leaving a few centimeters bare 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.489
 that's how you can see it better 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:51.420
 clearly the same thing then I'll do it 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:56.190
 for the other shoulder after sewing a 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:04:01.850
 hand the little gems and what I will have to 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:05.510
 only let the sides go out, ie from the 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:08.340
 from the armpit to the bottom and the t-shirt 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.370
 she will be ready 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.430
 see you at the next good video 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.430
 fun 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.160
