it<00:00:48.329> means<00:00:48.620> abstract<00:00:49.789> yes<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.969> would<00:00:51.120> make<00:00:51.360> a

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
it means abstract yes I would make a

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.920 
it means abstract yes I would make a
circle<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:53.129> start<00:00:53.430> out<00:00:53.550> with<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:54.090> circle<00:00:54.840> of

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
circle as you start out with a circle of

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.389 
circle as you start out with a circle of
a<00:00:55.050> person<00:00:55.559> 10<00:00:56.059> then<00:00:57.059> I'll<00:00:57.300> make<00:00:57.570> lines<00:00:58.399> out

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
a person 10 then I'll make lines out

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.380 
a person 10 then I'll make lines out
coming<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> circle<00:01:01.520> then<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.940> end<00:01:03.149> of

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
coming in a circle then at the end of

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.490 
coming in a circle then at the end of
the<00:01:03.539> lines<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.110> would<00:01:04.229> make<00:01:04.670> squares<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.320> on

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the lines I would make squares and so on

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.109 
the lines I would make squares and so on
and<00:01:07.979> then<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.299> would<00:01:09.479> make<00:01:09.780> these<00:01:10.650> curves<00:01:11.460> from

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
and then I would make these curves from

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.130 
and then I would make these curves from
the<00:01:13.049> squares<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.450> next<00:01:15.689> square

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the squares and going to the next square

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.210 
the squares and going to the next square
and<00:01:17.180> then<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> want<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.540> make<00:01:19.700> swirl<00:01:20.700> going<00:01:22.220> into

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
and then I want to make swirl going into

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.130 
and then I want to make swirl going into
the<00:01:23.369> circle<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.240> will<00:01:24.540> make<00:01:24.750> an

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the circle and that will make an

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.190 
the circle and that will make an
abstract<00:01:26.040> painting<00:01:26.570> now<00:01:27.570> that's<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.960> great

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
abstract painting now that's a great

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.760 
abstract painting now that's a great
story

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
story

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.710 
story
I<00:01:28.920> guess<00:01:29.430> people<00:01:29.610> everywhere<00:01:30.090> have<00:01:30.299> an<00:01:30.390> artist

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
I guess people everywhere have an artist

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.960 
I guess people everywhere have an artist
die<00:01:31.040> look<00:01:32.040> what<00:01:32.159> these<00:01:32.310> artists<00:01:32.700> are<00:01:32.790> creating

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
die look what these artists are creating

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.380 
die look what these artists are creating
in<00:01:33.299> Jamaica<00:01:34.579> they<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:35.729> making<00:01:35.939> tie-dye

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
in Jamaica they are making tie-dye

shirts<00:01:37.070> tie-dyeing

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
shirts tie-dyeing

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.100 
shirts tie-dyeing
is<00:01:38.460> one<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.820> oldest<00:01:39.299> dyeing<00:01:39.540> techniques

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
is one of the oldest dyeing techniques

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.140 
is one of the oldest dyeing techniques
in<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> world<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.009> guess<00:01:41.579> where<00:01:41.759> its<00:01:41.909> roots

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
in the world and guess where its roots

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.639 
in the world and guess where its roots
traced<00:01:42.479> back<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:43.280> China<00:01:45.079> people<00:01:46.079> often<00:01:46.619> use
