00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
trinkets accordingly I might do like a

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.350

separate<00:05:28.410> video<00:05:28.650> on<00:05:28.830> trinkets<00:05:29.789> because<00:05:30.060> some

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
separate video on trinkets because some

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.690 
separate video on trinkets because some
of<00:05:30.390> the<00:05:30.479> trinkets<00:05:30.810> are<00:05:30.900> pretty<00:05:31.050> cool<00:05:31.280> and

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
of the trinkets are pretty cool and

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.270 
of the trinkets are pretty cool and
I<00:05:32.730> don't<00:05:33.510> think<00:05:33.570> this<00:05:33.990> is<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.320> place<00:05:34.530> or<00:05:35.130> the

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
I don't think this is the place or the

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.390 
I don't think this is the place or the
type<00:05:35.550> of<00:05:35.580> video<00:05:35.880> to<00:05:35.910> talk<00:05:36.120> about<00:05:36.180> trinkets<00:05:37.020> and

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
type of video to talk about trinkets and

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.880 
type of video to talk about trinkets and

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
up I get thrown back and I'm kind of

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.920 
up I get thrown back and I'm kind of
stuck<00:06:26.790> down<00:06:27.060> here<00:06:27.090> we<00:06:27.450> had<00:06:27.600> a<00:06:27.630> couple<00:06:27.840> of

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
stuck down here we had a couple of

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.170 
stuck down here we had a couple of
attempts<00:06:28.260> on<00:06:28.350> this<00:06:28.530> and<00:06:28.740> I<00:06:29.550> intervened

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
attempts on this and I intervened

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.270 
attempts on this and I intervened
through<00:06:30.660> the<00:06:30.780> wall<00:06:30.930> before<00:06:31.320> but<00:06:31.830> um<00:06:32.010> I

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
through the wall before but um I

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.330 
through the wall before but um I
couldn't<00:06:32.820> intervene<00:06:33.240> I<00:06:34.230> think<00:06:35.010> you<00:06:35.190> can

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
couldn't intervene I think you can
