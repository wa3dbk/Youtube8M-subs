00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.019
 the manager 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.019
 We begin 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.079
 what is this about 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.010
 kpn 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.380
 who become users 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.040
 the bee 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.040
 if that is the case 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.900
 on 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.640
 because of this you can take a long time to faint 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.940
 but I like that then 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.480
 but fits well 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.690
 but what they miss that evening does not make 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.610
 all of them 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.610
 as long as necessary 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.650
 anp 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.650
 so it stays here 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.670
 on Twitter 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.950
 the plans for writing and the advertising revenue have been other 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.950
 hurry up 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.890
 Hey 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.000
 everything about that is stated in the advice from it 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.399
 another blows when it stops 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:14.399
 fantastic 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:21.969
 6 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:28.199
 that was it 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:31.199
