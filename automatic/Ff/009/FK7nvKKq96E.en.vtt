00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.670 
drugstore foundation and that I've liked
as<00:02:03.210> much<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.689> as<00:02:03.750> much<00:02:04.500> as<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.219> and

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
as much of this as much as this and and

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.430 
as much of this as much as this and and
the<00:02:07.680> only<00:02:07.979> downside<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.929> look<00:02:09.929> how<00:02:10.110> thin<00:02:10.410> that

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
the only downside is look how thin that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.490 
the only downside is look how thin that
is

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
is

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.290 
is
and<00:02:11.620> that's<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.010> amount<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.430> product<00:02:12.850> you<00:02:13.150> get

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
and that's the amount of product you get

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:22.550 
and that's the amount of product you get
in<00:02:13.450> there<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:19.860> point<00:02:20.860> forty<00:02:21.520> nine

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
in there and it is a point forty nine

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.040 
in there and it is a point forty nine
ounces<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:24.220> it's<00:02:24.400> 14<00:02:24.880> grams<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.480> that's<00:02:25.690> not<00:02:25.990> a

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
ounces so it's 14 grams and that's not a

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.340 
ounces so it's 14 grams and that's not a
lot<00:02:26.500> at<00:02:26.530> all<00:02:26.890> but<00:02:27.610> i<00:02:27.640> really<00:02:28.240> think<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.660> the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
lot at all but i really think that the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.910 
lot at all but i really think that the
way<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.560> apply<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:32.230> makes<00:02:32.500> us<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:32.860> you

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
way you apply it it it makes us so you

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.680 
way you apply it it it makes us so you
don't<00:02:33.130> need<00:02:33.370> much<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:33.910> i<00:02:34.030> know<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.270> lot<00:02:34.510> of
