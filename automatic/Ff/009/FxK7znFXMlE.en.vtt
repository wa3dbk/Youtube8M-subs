00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.260 
to have to rake the leaves yes yes I
mean<00:01:28.950> that's<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.310> much<00:01:29.460> easier<00:01:29.850> than<00:01:30.000> what<00:01:30.180> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
mean that's so much easier than what you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.910 
mean that's so much easier than what you
really<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.869> do<00:01:30.960> with<00:01:30.990> grass<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.530> then

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
really have to do with grass and then

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.560 
really have to do with grass and then
really<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.400> less<00:01:32.549> water<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.180> dress<00:01:33.450> to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
really it's less water you dress to

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.179 
really it's less water you dress to
water<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:33.900> plants<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.500> flowers<00:01:34.650> but<00:01:35.070> you

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
water your plants and flowers but you

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.710 
water your plants and flowers but you
don't<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.579> constantly<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:36.210> watering

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
don't have to constantly be watering

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.270 
don't have to constantly be watering
there's<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.200> lot<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> south<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
there's a lot of this in the south and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.240 
there's a lot of this in the south and
Arizona<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.600> Nevada<00:01:40.079> things<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.829> that

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
Arizona and Nevada things like that

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.370 
Arizona and Nevada things like that
so<00:01:41.430> we've<00:01:41.670> got<00:01:41.850> some<00:01:42.030> pictures<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.229> is

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
so we've got some pictures and this is

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.730 
so we've got some pictures and this is
all<00:01:43.590> designed<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.729> imagine<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.200> looks

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
all designed to I I imagine so it looks

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.969 
all designed to I I imagine so it looks
I<00:01:47.130> now<00:01:47.340> weigh<00:01:47.549> all<00:01:47.820> right<00:01:48.030> look<00:01:48.750> at<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.079> so

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
I now weigh all right look at that so

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.920 
I now weigh all right look at that so
you<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.250> see<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.759> use<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.240> any<00:01:51.509> your

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
you can see you can use that in any your

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.000 
you can see you can use that in any your
husband's<00:01:52.619> ever

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
husband's ever

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.770 
husband's ever
we're<00:01:53.100> thinking<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.820> conversion<00:01:54.270> by<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
we're thinking of this conversion by the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.170 
we're thinking of this conversion by the
way<00:01:54.990> right<00:01:55.710> now<00:01:55.980> so<00:01:56.370> for<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.790> women<00:01:57.060> who<00:01:57.090> are
