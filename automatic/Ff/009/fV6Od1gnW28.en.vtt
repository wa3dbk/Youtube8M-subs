00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 You do not always have to sing and people 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.299
 It's a pleasure to do it 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.519
 is enough to whisper now and then 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.170
 namely the whisper one is now 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.599
 again in action he will this time too 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.330
 a shetland pony did not call that and 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.640
 not to tame and the 29 year old 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.140
 Luxembourg is this time with the problem 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.369
 laurie is facing the ranking 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.289
 ten years old 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.840
 For three years he lives with his 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.720
 study paulinchen at family nigl than 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.239
 He came to the eagles and had to be neutered 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:46.170
 because he was so wild that has become 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:59.449
 unfortunately not changed since then 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:01:11.820
 big problem it makes him lie down 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:14.369
 he thinks he might jump around us 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.290
 to demonstrate norris behavior 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.250
 the nickels the two shetland ponies in 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.890
 direction pasture 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.500
 first the wallach gets restless then 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.110
 he jostles and pushes he is even outside 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.330
 when the camera is off 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.130
 Nori even raises his owner 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.229
 that means he is on the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.619
 backed up and you with his 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.270
 front legs kicked in the back 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.759
 little dangerous for an adult 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.229
 the small willi would have the ball 8 with it 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.380
 but already hurt 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.560
 unthinkable if even bigger 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.950
 The Whisperer lohr a man is already in 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.950
 march 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:13.239
 recieved today 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:17.989
 I think he is distracted and 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:20.810
 not normal drain observed first 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:35.769
 laura man the pony and his owner 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:38.989
 the lead is determined 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:42.230
 yes it's been so impetuous so far 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.780
 The white has exactly the same as the energy 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.260
 is running and knows what he wants and then 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.019
 The owner does not quite true 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.900
 but tries his own life too 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.790
 lead next to that is a dominance 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.049
 problem then so the horse is not around 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.720
 That's really not what he is 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.489
 So the horse tries to stop it 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.859
 do what it wants but not now because 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.480
 it is evil because it is for some 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.670
 but do not want to go along 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.370
 clear limits set 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.650
 Basically, the horse is supposed to do that 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.609
 what man wants without it 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.560
 is subjected 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.840
 horses are the same 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.630
 dogs around the rank order and the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.670
 norrie and isabella nigl 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.040
 both are not yet clear 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.060
 distance between man and horse 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.920
 The horse had to make that easy 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.660
 does not always work alongside a stick that does 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.130
 you have the goalkeeper you always have 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.670
 the endangered one goes at shoulder height 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.560
 about but in the biological 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.150
 behavioral level is the horse actually 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.680
 behind us we are the leader 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.859
 go our way and the horse follows 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.470
 we are practiced on the street with it 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.150
 not yet distracted by the grass 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.130
 and he'll do it first 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.620
 that they really stand before you 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:59.750
 horse he really like a brick wall because 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:02.510
 really stood in front of the horse exactly 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.280
 This is where the 1 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.650
 you do not drive here now 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.620
 So a wide wall because you can drive 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.739
 It absolutely does not pass that one 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.639
 bit on the horse then restless 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:19.070
 to approach the horse is backwards 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.720
 So, actually , that's the limit 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.900
 very good the horse in his move 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.900
 on 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.070
 that's ideal 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.860
 you can really see it for a long time and make it funny 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.130
 for knit hand by the horse stands there 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.820
 Investigator does not go on 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:40.850
 or you do it before and isabella nigl 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.919
 tried to imitate the animal 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.870
 Whisperer the exercise falls to own 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.630
 indications easier because he has no 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.430
 emotional attachment to the pony has to 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.300
 But it also works at the end 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.050
 Isabella never does quite well, it does not work 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.850
 you have to say 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.949
 So you have the problem with them 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.289
 he really very close sticks that one the 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.910
 first distance can not produce 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.710
 but you have already seen 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.080
 the little bit about what we did 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.849
 on the other hand already tense on for 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.500
 he is not yet in the knit 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.630
 position where should I not yet behind 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.610
 but it really tells us 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:18.349
 not further, especially since he is a very good one 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:20.650
 progress and he responds to that as well 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.110
 Naturally 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.110
 you have to keep practicing it and he does 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.000
 the wall speaks, maybe it will be the way 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.889
 at some point after all 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.070
 relaxed walk for the two 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:35.259
 Now it is said to stay consistent then 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.030
 could actually be a norrie from Norway 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:39.509
 relaxed the pony like Paulie 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.509
 become 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.920
 that was our goal whispering laumann
