00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
on a single block it makes it quite

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.120 
on a single block it makes it quite
fiddly

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
fiddly

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.860

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.700 
you're designing your first airship it
actually<00:04:34.240> becomes<00:04:34.510> really<00:04:34.780> fiddly<00:04:35.200> because

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
actually becomes really fiddly because

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.850 
actually becomes really fiddly because
it's<00:04:35.890> it's<00:04:36.430> so<00:04:36.820> micro<00:04:37.630> scale<00:04:37.960> in<00:04:38.260> terms<00:04:38.560> of<00:04:38.740> the

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
size the blocks that it's so so easy to

make a mistake that it becomes quite

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.440 
make a mistake that it becomes quite

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
although it can be a little bit

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.860 
although it can be a little bit
frustrating<00:05:27.280> because<00:05:27.490> as<00:05:27.820> I've<00:05:27.970> said<00:05:28.180> if<00:05:28.450> you

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
frustrating because as I've said if you

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.290 
frustrating because as I've said if you
do<00:05:29.080> miss<00:05:29.410> your<00:05:29.620> grapple<00:05:30.070> hook<00:05:30.220> and<00:05:30.460> you<00:05:31.120> will

do miss your grapple hook and you will

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.240 
do miss your grapple hook and you will
just<00:05:31.450> end<00:05:31.690> up<00:05:31.870> dying<00:05:32.170> and<00:05:32.440> it<00:05:32.590> becomes<00:05:32.950> quite

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
just end up dying and it becomes quite

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.730 
just end up dying and it becomes quite
annoying<00:05:33.610> especially<00:05:34.600> if<00:05:34.810> you're<00:05:35.050> quite<00:05:35.380> far

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
annoying especially if you're quite far

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
respawn at a town and it means a lot of

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.080 
respawn at a town and it means a lot of
travel<00:05:40.810> time<00:05:41.020> again<00:05:41.380> however<00:05:42.130> its<00:05:42.760> biggest

the<00:05:43.840> fun<00:05:44.110> factor<00:05:44.560> for<00:05:44.830> me<00:05:45.040> was<00:05:45.640> airship

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
the fun factor for me was airship

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.930 
the fun factor for me was airship

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
as I said enemy airships and it's really

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.340 
as I said enemy airships and it's really
fun<00:05:57.010> and<00:05:57.880> it's<00:05:58.330> the<00:05:58.540> biggest<00:05:58.840> draw<00:05:59.080> to<00:05:59.140> the

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
fun and it's the biggest draw to the

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.800 
fun and it's the biggest draw to the
game<00:05:59.560> from<00:06:00.130> games<00:06:00.430> like<00:06:00.550> terraria<00:06:01.060> I'm<00:06:01.540> not<00:06:01.780> a

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
game from games like terraria I'm not a

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.930 
game from games like terraria I'm not a
huge<00:06:02.110> fan<00:06:02.170> of<00:06:02.590> the<00:06:02.860> game's<00:06:03.070> graphical<00:06:03.610> design

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
huge fan of the game's graphical design

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.760 
huge fan of the game's graphical design
I<00:06:04.150> don't<00:06:04.480> like<00:06:04.660> some<00:06:04.900> of<00:06:04.990> the<00:06:05.050> textures<00:06:05.590> that

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
I don't like some of the textures that

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.500 
I don't like some of the textures that
they<00:06:05.890> used<00:06:06.190> on<00:06:06.400> some<00:06:06.610> of<00:06:06.730> the<00:06:06.820> color<00:06:07.030> schemes<00:06:07.360> I

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
they used on some of the color schemes I

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.900 
they used on some of the color schemes I
think<00:06:07.720> everything<00:06:08.260> looks<00:06:08.560> a<00:06:08.710> bit<00:06:08.740> too<00:06:09.400> bland

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
think everything looks a bit too bland

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.930 
think everything looks a bit too bland
and<00:06:10.300> a<00:06:10.450> bit<00:06:10.600> too<00:06:10.780> brown<00:06:11.050> and<00:06:11.320> grey<00:06:11.590> and<00:06:12.580> I<00:06:12.700> think

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
and a bit too brown and grey and I think

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.910 
and a bit too brown and grey and I think
it<00:06:13.060> can<00:06:13.300> look<00:06:13.450> a<00:06:13.540> bit<00:06:13.690> boring<00:06:13.960> and<00:06:14.290> I<00:06:14.650> think

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:14.920 
it can look a bit boring and I think

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.290 
it can look a bit boring and I think
that<00:06:15.130> what<00:06:15.370> they<00:06:15.460> should<00:06:15.640> have<00:06:15.670> actually<00:06:16.090> done

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
that what they should have actually done

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.780 
that what they should have actually done
is<00:06:16.690> put<00:06:17.500> a<00:06:17.530> bit<00:06:17.710> more<00:06:17.770> color<00:06:18.220> a<00:06:18.340> bit<00:06:18.550> more

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:18.790 
is put a bit more color a bit more

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.360 
is put a bit more color a bit more
vibrancy<00:06:19.300> into<00:06:19.690> the<00:06:19.810> game<00:06:20.020> to<00:06:20.260> make<00:06:20.440> it<00:06:20.500> feel<00:06:21.070> a

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
vibrancy into the game to make it feel a

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.030 
vibrancy into the game to make it feel a
little<00:06:22.090> bit<00:06:22.300> more<00:06:22.540> different<00:06:22.810> but<00:06:23.620> that<00:06:23.800> being

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
little bit more different but that being

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.070 
little bit more different but that being
said<00:06:24.130> overall<00:06:24.910> it's<00:06:25.300> actually<00:06:25.750> a<00:06:25.780> pretty
