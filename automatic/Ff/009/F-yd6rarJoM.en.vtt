00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
the journey time there'll be a lot more

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.670 
the journey time there'll be a lot more
regular<00:00:37.309> up<00:00:37.579> to<00:00:37.850> 110<00:00:38.719> minutes<00:00:39.050> maybe<00:00:39.350> even

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
regular up to 110 minutes maybe even
