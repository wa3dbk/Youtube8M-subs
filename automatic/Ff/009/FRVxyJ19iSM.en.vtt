although<00:03:24.549> this<00:03:24.760> one<00:03:24.939> isn't<00:03:25.239> bad<00:03:25.389> either<00:03:25.689> um

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
although this one isn't bad either um

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.899 
although this one isn't bad either um
kinda<00:03:26.620> hard<00:03:26.829> to<00:03:26.889> decide<00:03:27.280> which<00:03:27.549> one<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:27.819> the

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
kinda hard to decide which one is the

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:28.259 
kinda hard to decide which one is the
best

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
best

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.420 
best

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
but yeah face sculpt wise it's different

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.210

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
I do like this more about the rest of

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.560 
I do like this more about the rest of
the<00:05:00.400> figure<00:05:00.580> is<00:05:00.760> basically<00:05:01.120> saying<00:05:01.450> the

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
the figure is basically saying the

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.550 
the figure is basically saying the
jacket<00:05:01.930> is<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:02.890> same<00:05:03.480> but<00:05:04.480> yeah<00:05:04.720> it's<00:05:05.170> kind<00:05:05.320> of

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
jacket is the same but yeah it's kind of

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.960 
jacket is the same but yeah it's kind of
hard<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.860> decide<00:05:06.160> which<00:05:06.400> one<00:05:06.610> is<00:05:06.640> the<00:05:06.760> better

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
hard to decide which one is the better

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.080 
hard to decide which one is the better
one<00:05:07.090> of<00:05:07.210> the<00:05:07.420> two<00:05:07.890> and<00:05:08.890> that<00:05:08.920> they<00:05:09.550> made<00:05:09.820> a<00:05:09.850> lot

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
but this is basically the small

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.990 
but this is basically the small
comparison<00:05:48.550> video<00:05:49.000> and<00:05:49.090> as<00:05:49.210> you<00:05:49.330> can<00:05:49.450> see<00:05:49.510> yeah

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
comparison video and as you can see yeah

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.430 
comparison video and as you can see yeah
kind<00:05:52.000> of<00:05:52.030> hard<00:05:52.210> to<00:05:52.240> decide<00:05:52.600> which<00:05:52.810> one<00:05:52.960> to<00:05:52.990> go

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
kind of hard to decide which one to go

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.220 
kind of hard to decide which one to go
for<00:05:53.580> but<00:05:54.580> either<00:05:55.150> one<00:05:55.450> should<00:05:55.810> be<00:05:55.960> fine

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
for but either one should be fine
