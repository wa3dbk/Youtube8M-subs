00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.250
 hi guys beauty that is here today so 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.740
 to show you 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.840
 this new channel project that I'm 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.090
 doing together with the giovanni with the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.760
 And we started listening today. 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.920
 here is at least three more two 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.680
 hours there to make the serve 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:34.140
 isaac was initially meant to be a 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:41.040
 design a map of trf-2 for those already 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:45.539
 saw already the guardian staff who is a 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.390
 map of f2 played only with swords and 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.379
 so I tried to do it here, it just does not work 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.719
 very sure 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.289
 so today I tried to get more or less 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.090
 The idea of ​​the map and I made it here then is with 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.309
 You can see here it has a castle and 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.770
 this castle here has a system that 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.660
 you have to capture the point then the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.180
 map name more or less is it 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.820
 conquer the public castle you have 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:14.549
 which is a pvp that will have classes of 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:17.040
 bukvic etc is what ue will have and then you 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.869
 will have to conquer this castle that 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.470
 You have to stay here for a while. 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.180
 I think I do not know, I think it's 8 seconds and 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.200
 he will show you here 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.159
 and when it arrives at the last one here it the date 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.259
 but we will change 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.960
 The jean that made this system here and I think 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.479
 which is more or less this is the map goes 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.979
 have some classes and these can be 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.560
 are balanced between each other and for 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.860
 I saw that he's going to have an ax in fact. 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.659
 he will be able to use an ax and will 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.060
 have more or less armor 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.299
 already the archer he will have an armor 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.939
 very bad but it will have a bow and a 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.890
 sword type of hand so it just will not 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.040
 to draw a lot, but ultimately what will be 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.960
 quite advanced but if this project 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.899
 All is well now I 'm going to redo 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.160
 fully map of the droid team that is 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.160
 of trf 2 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.590
 And I think it looks pretty cool. 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.970
 because the map teaching tfd is already pretty cool 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.700
 same 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.220
 So you liked the idea and want 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.720
 I continue with this project in dance is 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.580
 favorite to help in the dissemination of this 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.200
 video and to say that you want me to 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.010
 continue with this series with this 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.930
 map 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.690
 then probably in the next episode 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.300
 If you like the map, I'll bring it. 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.450
 download and the end of this map already 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.620
 you and that was all that was 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.230
 Speak here in the corner and jump here you go 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.110
 be a bearer then you will die 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.800
 type in the debate ips you skip that you 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.560
 passes away 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.810
 So you put it down then it was because 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.510
 otherwise people will stay here popular 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.320
 here and you will stay here forever in 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.420
 cattle map 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.790
 So, this one, do not forget that one. 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.160
 only if you have to give in the cell phone was 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.380
 after renewal and will be written on the 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.030
 channel sign up and beauty then this 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.090
 then it was a very strong arm and I spoke 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.090
 some
