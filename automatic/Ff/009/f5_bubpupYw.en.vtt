kind of dark in here but I don't go home
right<00:05:13.949> there<00:05:14.280> I<00:05:15.650> was<00:05:16.650> like<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:16.770> second<00:05:17.310> signal

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
right there I was like a second signal

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:25.010 
right there I was like a second signal
are<00:05:17.699> dug<00:05:18.000> today<00:05:18.650> and<00:05:21.020> getting<00:05:22.020> here<00:05:22.139> light<00:05:24.020> and

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
are dug today and getting here light and

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.980 
are dug today and getting here light and
it's<00:05:25.169> a<00:05:25.349> peas<00:05:26.750> either<00:05:27.750> to<00:05:27.990> a<00:05:28.280> artillery<00:05:29.990> shell

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
it's a peas either to a artillery shell

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.580 
it's a peas either to a artillery shell
or<00:05:31.259> a<00:05:31.289> cannonball<00:05:31.949> I<00:05:33.020> think<00:05:34.020> it's<00:05:34.169> artillery

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
or a cannonball I think it's artillery

too

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:38.719 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:43.439 

but<00:05:39.289> it<00:05:39.379> was<00:05:39.469> only<00:05:39.799> down<00:05:39.979> probably<00:05:40.429> to<00:05:42.279> inches

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
but it was only down probably to inches

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.569 
but it was only down probably to inches
so<00:05:45.069> dig<00:05:46.069> around<00:05:46.219> here<00:05:46.519> a<00:05:46.549> little<00:05:46.669> bit<00:05:46.849> when<00:05:47.360> fun

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:48.579 
so dig around here a little bit when fun

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:51.729
