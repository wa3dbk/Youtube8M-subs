juice and if I was to tell you that you
could<00:00:16.369> have<00:00:16.490> random<00:00:16.820> a<00:00:16.939> potion<00:00:17.329> effects<00:00:17.810> while

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
could have random a potion effects while

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.019 
could have random a potion effects while
you<00:00:18.169> were<00:00:18.289> fighting<00:00:18.470> moms<00:00:18.859> watch<00:00:19.669> and<00:00:19.849> learn

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.489 

says<00:00:23.029> you've<00:00:23.300> been<00:00:23.480> given<00:00:23.779> a<00:00:23.839> strength<00:00:24.169> boost

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:26.499 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:30.929 

this<00:00:27.499> is<00:00:27.819> this<00:00:28.819> can<00:00:29.060> be<00:00:29.239> set<00:00:29.509> to<00:00:29.679> different

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
this is this can be set to different

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.430 
this is this can be set to different
probabilities<00:00:31.939> of<00:00:31.970> happening<00:00:32.689> right<00:00:33.379> now

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
probabilities of happening right now

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.400 
probabilities of happening right now
it's<00:00:34.010> actually<00:00:34.250> very<00:00:34.519> common<00:00:35.149> because<00:00:35.719> 1<00:00:36.140> 2<00:00:36.379> 3

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
it's actually very common because 1 2 3

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.009 
it's actually very common because 1 2 3
4<00:00:37.690> 9<00:00:38.690> times<00:00:39.160> during<00:00:40.160> just<00:00:40.579> those<00:00:41.030> zombies<00:00:41.780> I

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
4 9 times during just those zombies I

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.569 
4 9 times during just those zombies I
got<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.590> effect<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:43.760> uh<00:00:45.429> here's<00:00:46.429> the

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
got the effect and uh here's the

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.500 
got the effect and uh here's the
Redstone<00:00:47.239> behind<00:00:47.629> it<00:00:47.839> I<00:00:48.550> was<00:00:49.550> testing<00:00:50.000> with<00:00:50.480> a

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
Redstone behind it I was testing with a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.759 
Redstone behind it I was testing with a
design<00:00:51.230> like<00:00:51.260> this<00:00:52.480> which<00:00:53.480> is<00:00:53.929> a<00:00:55.390> much<00:00:56.769> more

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
design like this which is a much more

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.840 
design like this which is a much more
rare<00:00:58.070> to<00:00:58.339> get<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.609> potion<00:00:58.909> effect<00:01:00.219> but<00:01:01.219> if<00:01:01.670> I

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
rare to get the potion effect but if I

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.720 
rare to get the potion effect but if I
had<00:01:01.999> like<00:01:02.149> that<00:01:02.359> may<00:01:02.539> zombies<00:01:03.019> it<00:01:03.559> was<00:01:03.800> good

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
had like that may zombies it was good

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.360 
had like that may zombies it was good
probably<00:01:05.600> not<00:01:05.960> give<00:01:06.530> me<00:01:06.620> the<00:01:06.770> potion<00:01:06.950> effect

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
probably not give me the potion effect

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.060 
probably not give me the potion effect
by<00:01:07.610> killing<00:01:08.060> all<00:01:08.210> of<00:01:08.240> those<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:08.930> I<00:01:09.140> just<00:01:09.860> took

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
by killing all of those so I just took

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.730 
by killing all of those so I just took
off<00:01:10.250> this<00:01:10.490> a<00:01:10.550> little<00:01:10.850> bit<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:11.450> ensure<00:01:12.440> that<00:01:12.470> I

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
off this a little bit to ensure that I

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.340 
off this a little bit to ensure that I
would<00:01:13.010> actually<00:01:13.190> be<00:01:13.610> able<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:14.140> record<00:01:15.140> the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
would actually be able to record the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.530 
would actually be able to record the
fact<00:01:15.620> that<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:15.890> am<00:01:16.310> getting<00:01:16.820> new<00:01:17.120> potion

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
fact that I am getting new potion

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.770 
fact that I am getting new potion
effects<00:01:18.250> otherwise<00:01:19.250> it<00:01:19.490> is<00:01:19.520> possible<00:01:20.360> but<00:01:20.660> you

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
effects otherwise it is possible but you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.050 
effects otherwise it is possible but you
have<00:01:20.900> to<00:01:21.050> have<00:01:21.110> a<00:01:21.170> lot<00:01:21.470> more<00:01:21.800> mobs<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.520> it<00:01:22.940> is

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
have to have a lot more mobs and it is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.190 
have to have a lot more mobs and it is
much<00:01:23.330> more<00:01:23.360> rare<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.730> if<00:01:25.730> i<00:01:25.940> actually<00:01:26.300> just

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
much more rare so if i actually just

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.130 
much more rare so if i actually just
take<00:01:27.800> this<00:01:27.980> off<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.940> can<00:01:29.150> see<00:01:29.390> how<00:01:29.570> often<00:01:30.020> this

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
take this off you can see how often this

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.840 
take this off you can see how often this
pulses<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:32.740> you'd<00:01:33.740> have<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:34.130> have<00:01:34.160> this<00:01:34.640> would

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
pulses and you'd have to have this would

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.890 
pulses and you'd have to have this would
give<00:01:35.000> like<00:01:35.180> a<00:01:35.210> to<00:01:35.480> tick<00:01:35.720> pulse<00:01:35.990> i<00:01:36.350> think<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.900> it

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
give like a to tick pulse i think and it

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.390 
give like a to tick pulse i think and it
would<00:01:38.990> have<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:39.230> be<00:01:39.260> a<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.560> tick<00:01:39.770> pulse<00:01:39.980> during

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
would have to be a to tick pulse during

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.340 
would have to be a to tick pulse during
the<00:01:40.610> time<00:01:40.790> that<00:01:40.820> this<00:01:41.240> would<00:01:41.450> be<00:01:41.600> on<00:01:41.750> which<00:01:42.140> is

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
the time that this would be on which is

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.660 
the time that this would be on which is
kind<00:01:42.620> of<00:01:42.710> rare<00:01:43.690> so<00:01:44.690> there's<00:01:44.960> that<00:01:45.170> um<00:01:45.500> I<00:01:45.920> didn't

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
kind of rare so there's that um I didn't

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.770 
kind of rare so there's that um I didn't
make<00:01:46.760> it<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.500> yeah<00:01:48.500> here's<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.340> command<00:01:50.210> that

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
make it and yeah here's the command that

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.680 
make it and yeah here's the command that
just<00:01:51.230> tells<00:01:51.410> you<00:01:51.560> it's<00:01:51.800> recolored<00:01:52.340> this<00:01:53.240> gives

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
just tells you it's recolored this gives

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.300 
just tells you it's recolored this gives
you<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.990> effect<00:01:56.320> this<00:01:57.320> one<00:01:57.590> gives<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.100> player

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
you the effect this one gives the player

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.290 
you the effect this one gives the player
a<00:01:58.760> stone<00:01:59.600> sword<00:02:00.400> and<00:02:01.400> now<00:02:01.670> these<00:02:01.910> three<00:02:02.270> are

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
a stone sword and now these three are

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.700 
a stone sword and now these three are
the<00:02:02.420> real<00:02:02.810> ones<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.350> matter<00:02:03.590> um<00:02:05.560> so<00:02:06.560> what

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
the real ones that matter um so what

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.160 
the real ones that matter um so what
this<00:02:06.860> does<00:02:06.920> is<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.370> clears<00:02:07.880> all<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.840> nearest

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
this does is it clears all the nearest

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.740 
this does is it clears all the nearest
player<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.830> 272<00:02:10.460> with<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:11.030> damage<00:02:11.240> value<00:02:11.540> of

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
player of 272 with the damage value of

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.350 
player of 272 with the damage value of
one<00:02:11.960> so<00:02:12.260> she's<00:02:12.290> hit<00:02:12.770> one

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
one so she's hit one

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.530 
one so she's hit one
with<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.690> this<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.860> if<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.370> hit<00:02:15.580> two<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:15.970> this

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
with it this is if you hit two and this

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.110 
with it this is if you hit two and this
is<00:02:16.690> if<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:16.960> hit<00:02:17.110> three<00:02:17.350> just<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.800> ensure<00:02:18.120> that

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
is if you hit three just to ensure that

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.970 
is if you hit three just to ensure that
you<00:02:19.390> can<00:02:19.570> actually<00:02:19.750> have<00:02:20.230> your<00:02:20.380> sword<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.800> you

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
you can actually have your sword and you

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.280 
you can actually have your sword and you
won't<00:02:21.190> just<00:02:21.400> get<00:02:21.550> cleared<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:23.170> will

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
won't just get cleared and you will

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.440 
won't just get cleared and you will
actually<00:02:23.500> get<00:02:23.950> your<00:02:24.190> another<00:02:24.520> sword<00:02:24.790> back<00:02:25.060> so

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
actually get your another sword back so

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.470 
actually get your another sword back so
others<00:02:25.990> that<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:28.630> know<00:02:28.840> so<00:02:29.580> now<00:02:30.580> what

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
others that and you know so now what

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.270 
others that and you know so now what
these<00:02:31.750> do<00:02:31.990> they<00:02:32.320> give<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.560> comparator<00:02:33.220> output

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
these do they give a comparator output

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.840 
these do they give a comparator output
to<00:02:33.940> this<00:02:34.330> redstone<00:02:34.720> ore<00:02:35.080> this<00:02:35.530> block<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.250> that

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
to this redstone ore this block and that

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.900 
to this redstone ore this block and that
turns<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.300> off<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.920> random<00:02:39.400> chance<00:02:39.670> that

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
turns it off and the random chance that

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.760 
turns it off and the random chance that
this<00:02:40.090> would<00:02:40.300> actually<00:02:40.450> be<00:02:40.720> pulsing<00:02:41.170> all<00:02:41.590> this

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
this would actually be pulsing all this

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.610 
this would actually be pulsing all this
with<00:02:41.920> off<00:02:42.240> it's<00:02:43.240> what<00:02:43.810> gives<00:02:43.990> you<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.230> potion

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
with off it's what gives you the potion

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.520 
with off it's what gives you the potion
effect<00:02:45.100> so<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.510> gives<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.290> potion

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
effect so it gives you the potion

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.240 
effect so it gives you the potion
effective<00:02:48.160> strength<00:02:48.520> 45<00:02:49.240> seconds<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.830> yeah

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
effective strength 45 seconds so yeah

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.550 
effective strength 45 seconds so yeah
that's<00:02:51.520> really<00:02:52.180> all<00:02:52.360> there<00:02:52.390> is<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:53.050> this<00:02:53.230> it's

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
that's really all there is to this it's

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.810 
that's really all there is to this it's
really<00:02:54.220> simple<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:55.560> here's<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.890> much<00:02:57.430> more

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
really simple and here's the much more

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.420 
really simple and here's the much more
common<00:02:58.239> effect<00:02:58.660> you<00:02:59.530> could<00:02:59.709> give<00:02:59.890> a<00:02:59.920> strength

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
common effect you could give a strength

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.910 
common effect you could give a strength
effect<00:03:00.820> for<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:01.209> don't<00:03:01.630> know<00:03:01.840> two<00:03:02.200> seconds<00:03:02.709> if

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
effect for I don't know two seconds if

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.010 
effect for I don't know two seconds if
you<00:03:03.010> wanted<00:03:03.430> like<00:03:03.610> this<00:03:03.820> and<00:03:04.060> then<00:03:04.660> take<00:03:04.870> out

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
you wanted like this and then take out

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.630 
you wanted like this and then take out
the<00:03:05.140> chat<00:03:05.380> message<00:03:05.800> because<00:03:06.130> that<00:03:06.340> could<00:03:06.459> get

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
the chat message because that could get

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.100 
the chat message because that could get
kind<00:03:06.820> of<00:03:06.940> annoying<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:09.400> yeah<00:03:09.850> I<00:03:10.510> really<00:03:10.840> don't

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
kind of annoying so yeah I really don't

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.050 
kind of annoying so yeah I really don't
think<00:03:11.200> there's<00:03:11.739> much<00:03:12.190> more<00:03:12.610> to<00:03:12.670> talk<00:03:13.000> about

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
think there's much more to talk about
