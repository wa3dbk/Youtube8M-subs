00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.560
 hello dear friends like every year 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.170
 we are always up to date and show you 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.130
 the latest highlights of the season in 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.710
 Peking 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:19.020
 we now have the epson htw 6100 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.590
 Three years lamps guarantee what it's all about 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.560
 At Epson we're seeing fuller now 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.180
 What is there is we go 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.130
 assuming that the housing is not 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.800
 has changed and not the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.540
 it will be similar in scope of delivery 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.239
 last year but of course we are testing 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.219
 that has been really we have one 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.730
 to belong to a comprehensive catalog 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.399
 let's see what in the box have so well 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.870
 a remote control looks like that 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.700
 usual remote control here a something around 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.289
 defined accessory that we in 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.219
 a later test times under 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.520
 take the magnifying glass 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:00.930
 and we have the new epson lpgs 03 rf 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.750
 3D glasses 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.979
 according to epson, there is an essential here 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.340
 Improvements especially in the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.010
 connection quality and they are 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.979
 compatible with all other new ones 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.570
 Modern 3D eyewear so you do not 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.880
 always had to change your accessories 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:24.060
 future and we have one here, please 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.290
 is a charger for the glasses yes 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.530
 of course and the obligatory 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:35.189
 Power cable and an Epson 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.140
 manual with a cd in it like that 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:44.399
 Of course, now it's the actual thing 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:46.079
 highlight the epson anyway htw 6100 what you 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.990
 already can recognize housing color in 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:55.170
 black the white model is the 5910 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.299
 and the 6001 reserved 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.110
 that we are not referring there but 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.630
 for because it will be more later 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.130
 now we see the epson in the known 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.960
 housing from the previous year 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.860
 have a lamp bay up here 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.750
 open the controls on as in 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.720
 same source last year 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.780
 menu temperature switch for the lamp 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.950
 up here we have the objectively with 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:27.819
 Adjustment range once the sharpness then 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.650
 examined here in depth and still 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.500
 taped the age is for the 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.060
 keystone correction what you do in your home theater 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.430
 I hope not use that 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.110
 We also see at the back 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.760
 we have two hdmi inputs and boxes 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.530
 then another service entrance only 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.849
 be used by apps employees 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.400
 we should hopefully never 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.410
 then we need the video we have the 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.530
 audio inputs and we still have one 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.260
 analog full hd input comes like that 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.790
 called components input pc input 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.250
 is of course possible and one 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.650
 Interface for the RS232 room 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.870
 Control then let's go to the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.579
 back before we wait briefly we show 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.200
 again briefly the two boxes he 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.099
 you can see with the bars 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.989
 here and here 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.239
 That means the device can be natural 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.069
 Also stand alone with only one player in the 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.970
 mobile use possible or directly to 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.989
 the playstation 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.000
 then we go to the back 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.730
 Again, Epson offers five blankets 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.940
 bracket points which are also compatible 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.160
 are covering with our emfis.com forum 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.220
 brackets which we also have slow 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.829
 the feet in the case have only two 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.190
 but to adjust 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.930
 but the right one still showed that way and that 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.269
 behind a little down here on small 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.870
 rubber foot so the device is not 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.359
 slip off now we show the front how 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.639
 Last year, too, is here 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.260
 the hot air blown out to the front 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:56.799
 and as you can see, protect 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.410
 on the side so that it is not in the in 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.049
 the flying light goes away and you 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.359
 then unsightly things looks through this 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.540
 hot air and we have just that 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.880
 Zoom range of the lens shown more 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.940
 there is then directly in our 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.560
 mini test from the test lab would like 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.150
 Of course we also welcome you and 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.680
 maybe not forget that when you do that 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.239
 video has fallen 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.239
 thank youtube thumbs up
