the<00:04:21.810> sheet<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.140> paper<00:04:22.289> I'm<00:04:22.770> only<00:04:23.070> using<00:04:23.250> a

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
the sheet of paper I'm only using a

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.000 
the sheet of paper I'm only using a
fraction<00:04:23.520> of<00:04:24.090> it<00:04:24.300> today<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.560> point<00:04:25.770> is<00:04:25.919> so

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
fraction of it today and the point is so

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.170 
fraction of it today and the point is so
that<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.250> can<00:04:26.370> draw<00:04:26.550> really<00:04:26.700> low

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
that you can draw really low

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.150 
that you can draw really low
and<00:04:27.389> really<00:04:27.570> thin<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:28.350> it's<00:04:28.650> hard<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:28.919> read

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
and really thin so it's hard to read

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.800 
and really thin so it's hard to read
this<00:04:29.340> way<00:04:29.520> but<00:04:29.699> when<00:04:29.850> you<00:04:29.910> lift<00:04:30.270> up<00:04:30.419> the<00:04:30.630> piece

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
this way but when you lift up the piece

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.020 
this way but when you lift up the piece
of<00:04:30.840> paper<00:04:30.960> this<00:04:31.530> like<00:04:31.889> this<00:04:32.100> you<00:04:32.729> can<00:04:32.910> actually

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
of paper this like this you can actually

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.960 
of paper this like this you can actually
read<00:04:33.509> that<00:04:33.720> message<00:04:33.930> a<00:04:34.320> lot<00:04:34.979> better<00:04:35.280> but

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
read that message a lot better but

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.249 
read that message a lot better but
imagine<00:04:36.449> if<00:04:36.539> you<00:04:36.630> were<00:04:36.720> to<00:04:36.810> take<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.080> whole
