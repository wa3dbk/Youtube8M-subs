the matter enthusiasts over the years
we've<00:01:06.330> always<00:01:06.510> been<00:01:06.840> seen<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:07.350> somewhat<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.680> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
we've always been seen as somewhat of a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.740 
we've always been seen as somewhat of a
minority<00:01:08.070> because<00:01:09.030> we're<00:01:09.390> all<00:01:09.510> such

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
minority because we're all such

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.780 
minority because we're all such
individuals<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:11.070> know<00:01:11.100> you've<00:01:11.400> only<00:01:11.490> got<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
individuals you know you've only got to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.250 
individuals you know you've only got to
look<00:01:11.880> at<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> cars<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.600> are<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:12.900> today<00:01:13.049> you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
look at the cars that are here today you

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.200 
look at the cars that are here today you
know<00:01:13.500> they're<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.220> individuals<00:01:14.880> there<00:01:15.150> are

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
know they're all individuals there are

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.179 
know they're all individuals there are
individuals<00:01:15.689> alone<00:01:16.080> them<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:16.860> all<00:01:16.979> put

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
individuals alone them and they all put

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.120 
individuals alone them and they all put
their<00:01:17.220> own<00:01:17.340> spin<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.930> vehicle<00:01:19.259> therefore

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
their own spin on a vehicle therefore

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.060 
their own spin on a vehicle therefore
we've<00:01:20.610> seen<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.060> being<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.420> group<00:01:21.840> of

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
we've seen as being a group of

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.070 
we've seen as being a group of
individuals<00:01:23.070> as<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> minority<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.330> that's<00:01:24.780> in

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
individuals as a minority but that's in

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.710 
individuals as a minority but that's in
fact<00:01:25.380> very<00:01:25.740> far<00:01:26.040> from<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> truth<00:01:26.610> well<00:01:27.450> look

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
fact very far from the truth well look

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.289 
fact very far from the truth well look
it's<00:01:27.900> very<00:01:27.960> very<00:01:28.439> difficult<00:01:28.530> for

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
it's very very difficult for

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.810 
it's very very difficult for
bureaucracies<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.570> get<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> head<00:01:30.990> around<00:01:31.290> it

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
bureaucracies to get the head around it

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.069 
bureaucracies to get the head around it
individualism<00:01:32.820> can't<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.360> put<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.659> one<00:01:33.840> box

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
individualism can't be put in one box

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.350 
individualism can't be put in one box
and<00:01:34.439> therefore<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.310> makes<00:01:35.460> legislation<00:01:36.210> that

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
and therefore it makes legislation that

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.359 
and therefore it makes legislation that
much<00:01:36.540> more<00:01:36.780> difficult<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.500> them<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:38.189> that's

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
much more difficult for them but that's

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.929 
much more difficult for them but that's
no<00:01:38.579> reason<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:39.240> rid<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.479> us<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:41.460> we've<00:01:41.759> got

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
no reason to get rid of us and we've got

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.359 
no reason to get rid of us and we've got
to<00:01:42.030> embrace<00:01:42.240> our<00:01:42.509> individuality<00:01:43.369> it's

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
to embrace our individuality it's

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.100 
to embrace our individuality it's
something<00:01:44.700> which<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.180> clearly<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.750> display

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
something which is clearly on display

event<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.130> what<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.310> are<00:01:50.340> looking<00:01:50.610> for<00:01:50.820> is

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
event and what we are looking for is

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.260 
event and what we are looking for is
legislation<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.740> workable<00:01:53.270> affordable

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
legislation that is workable affordable

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.080 
legislation that is workable affordable
and<00:01:54.450> doable<00:01:55.100> so<00:01:56.100> we're<00:01:56.280> bringing<00:01:56.399> common

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
sense into the argument and that's where

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.280
