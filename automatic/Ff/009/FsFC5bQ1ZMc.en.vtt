00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
on fortune fortune so the code for

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.730

fortune<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:13.010> 35<00:02:14.010> type<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.090> 35<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:16.020> want<00:02:16.500> I'm

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
fortune is 35 type in 35 and I want I'm

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.280 
fortune is 35 type in 35 and I want I'm
not<00:02:16.800> even<00:02:17.220> sure<00:02:17.700> how<00:02:18.030> high<00:02:18.300> fortune<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.050> but

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
not even sure how high fortune is but

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.160 
not even sure how high fortune is but
I'm<00:02:19.380> just<00:02:19.530> going<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.770> guess<00:02:19.920> 3<00:02:20.340> there<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.360> you

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
I'm just going to guess 3 there and you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.620 
I'm just going to guess 3 there and you
can<00:02:22.350> add<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.800> 3<00:02:23.250> gents<00:02:23.970> that's<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.390> max

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
can add in 3 gents that's the max

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.380 
can add in 3 gents that's the max
obviously<00:02:25.319> for<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.920> some<00:02:26.160> kinds<00:02:26.580> some<00:02:27.270> of

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
obviously for you some kinds some of

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.730 
obviously for you some kinds some of
them<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.630> will<00:02:27.840> not<00:02:28.020> let<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.380> work<00:02:28.560> together

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
them it will not let you work together

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.940 
them it will not let you work together
but<00:02:29.700> it's<00:02:30.590> pretty<00:02:31.590> basic<00:02:31.770> so<00:02:33.230> now<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.260> want<00:02:34.860> to

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
but it's pretty basic so now I want to

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
but it's pretty basic so now I want to
enchants<00:02:35.400> my<00:02:35.610> bow<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.420> on

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
enchants my bow so on

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:45.450 
enchants my bow so on
to<00:02:37.300> go<00:02:40.590> add<00:02:42.840> infinity<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:45.220> code<00:02:45.430> for

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
to go add infinity so the code for

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.500 
to go add infinity so the code for
infinity<00:02:46.060> is<00:02:46.180> 51<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.440> then<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.730> think<00:02:49.270> you<00:02:49.360> can

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
infinity is 51 and then I think you can

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.400 
infinity is 51 and then I think you can
only<00:02:49.630> add<00:02:49.990> one<00:02:50.350> of<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:51.240> so<00:02:52.240> now<00:02:53.020> my<00:02:53.200> Bo's

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
only add one of it so now my Bo's

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.040 
only add one of it so now my Bo's
