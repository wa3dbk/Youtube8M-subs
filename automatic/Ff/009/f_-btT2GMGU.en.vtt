00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.590
 How many are 35 years good? 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.650
 we put in the world chronology is not 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.119
 nothing if we put it in the history of the 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.279
 video game industry is 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.430
 practically everything today we have here in 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.130
 retro a manufactured console 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.110
 originally by mattel electronics 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.149
 this firm that will be making toys 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.880
 and many other things they got 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.590
 to the market of video game consoles and 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.140
 this product your first product the 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:47.920
 original television went on the market in 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.950
 1979 about 35 years ago and 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.010
 well, this one 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.130
 and what I tell you about the design is not the color 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.400
 gold with wood or imitation way 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:03.300
 on one side so it will connect sixth to your 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.300
 TV through a modulator 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.370
 RF radio frequency where on the channel 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.460
 3 on channel 2 you could see the images 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.229
 of the console that is the console 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.320
 well he had he has these 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.720
 controls with your phone cord be 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.910
 nothing wireless and in fact you should 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.070
 be quite close to the console not 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.490
 You could put it too far because it did not 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.470
 the cable in the joyce good is not the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.869
 joystick the remote control had a 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.850
 numeric keypad a knob here for 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.260
 I saw and select buttons 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.900
 to the sides 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.330
 the players remember a little bit of 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.910
 the games what technical characteristics 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.410
 in this console or in a processor that 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.970
 was going to 800 megahertz that is to nothing not if 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.620
 what makes the watch that is in your 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.830
 house on the wall is pretty much what 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.320
 had a computing power of this 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.840
 console and good the part of course 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.240
 that complements the world of 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.490
 video games are the titles here or the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.280
 games here we have one era of cartridges 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.140
 is the game of the famous flogger that 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.990
 we already know that some people liked to 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.240
 blow him and others not some put him 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.090
 Eraser with cell and others not 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.010
 etcetera and good if you could not do it 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.760
 here on this side is the entrance to 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.910
 the cartridge the two connected and 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.320
 I turned on this console if everything worked 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.810
 as it should be generally 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.730
 they worked you had in the image of 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.660
 video games of your television and I could 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.310
 keep changing now that the team 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.800
 connectors not how many ports did this have 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.620
 console because one is not the only port 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.230
 what I had to do is put the rca cable 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.840
 rsa directly to the modulator so that 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.569
 you can see it on TV and how 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.159
 I mentioned here selecting how far 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.440
 it would be better if in the channel than this in 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.360
 channel 4 of the television and there you 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.489
 selected depending on the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.370
 interferences and this could be seen 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.750
 better in 3 or 4 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.129
 went out to the public in 1979 at a cost of 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.349
 299 dollars and it came with a game of 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.680
 gift that las vegas' poker and 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:13.170
 blackjack and well there started this 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.569
 discovery that really the 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.670
 business to sell and it's still in 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.370
 sell games not consoles 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.840
 then mattel to stay around 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.049
 products of the species while you are 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.109
 consoles puts about 460 programs 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:31.530
 for let's say complement the product and 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.060
 you end up leaving many titles about 16 18 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.079
 titles for the lifetime of the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.299
 console 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.569
 here we have several of them as well as 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.569
 watch 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:47.030
 there are more titles that we have and 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:50.510
 make them more zac zac 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.069
 boxing in almost all the sites are 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.480
 bowling 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:59.849
 in pure tennis sport tennis here in 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.329
 matrix and this consolation that this 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:06.239
 they lent host racing and another baseball 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.819
 and soccer etc, without a doubt one of 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.040
 the best known is the frogger and good 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.530
 a very interesting story this 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.359
 learn the console of the material 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.340
 electronics first and only inter vision 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.979
 then the company or the division of 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.120
 consoles sold it the purchase another 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.289
 person the television sector 2 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.120
 I'm in a story and pretty much 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.690
 cuts in time in years but good 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.440
 repeat the games this was how we 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.289
 We had fun 35 years ago, just like you 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.539
 you were born or equal yes or no 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.409
 you had a console and another small detail 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:45.529
 interesting is that 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:49.399
 for some games they came with their guide 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:52.279
 of use for the remote control environment 

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:55.669
 remote to control then you get here 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:57.739
 this is the guide and you could play it 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.679
 in agreement they will be numbers but for not 

00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:02.659
 lose you if the 3 was shooting or the 1 

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:04.969
 was doing another good thing here already with 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:07.009
 this you put these ends like 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.409
 stickers or labels and they could play 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.679
 in a little quieter way with 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:14.839
 this is the inter vision the app brand 

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:17.029
 on television comes from the two words 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:19.039
 which is smart and television or 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:23.289
 smart television 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.289
 which if it was not understood
