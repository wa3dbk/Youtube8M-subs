okay so we get dealt a jackal suit and a
small<00:00:03.899> blind<00:00:05.839> it<00:00:06.839> gets<00:00:07.049> folded<00:00:07.200> around<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.649> us

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
small blind it gets folded around to us

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.709 
small blind it gets folded around to us
it's<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.099> pretty<00:00:08.309> good<00:00:08.490> hand<00:00:08.700> for<00:00:08.970> x<00:00:09.120> vs<00:00:09.480> blind

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
it's a pretty good hand for x vs blind

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.049 
it's a pretty good hand for x vs blind
yeah<00:00:10.710> since<00:00:11.010> you're<00:00:11.099> out<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.370> position<00:00:11.490> it's

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
yeah since you're out of position it's

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.879 
yeah since you're out of position it's
better<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.450> end<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.719> hand<00:00:12.929> as<00:00:13.559> soon<00:00:13.799> as

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
better to end the hand as soon as

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.560 
better to end the hand as soon as
possible<00:00:14.370> since<00:00:14.910> you're<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.150> positional

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
possible since you're a positional

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.130 
possible since you're a positional
disadvantage<00:00:16.170> for<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.440> rest<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> hand

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
disadvantage for the rest of the hand

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.660 
disadvantage for the rest of the hand
for<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.170> reason<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.590> should<00:00:19.800> raise<00:00:19.980> also<00:00:20.490> is

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
for that reason you should raise also is

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.519 
for that reason you should raise also is
a<00:00:20.699> value<00:00:21.060> bet<00:00:21.240> since<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.600> lot<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.779> weekends<00:00:22.350> that

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
a value bet since a lot of weekends that

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.490 
a value bet since a lot of weekends that
your<00:00:22.740> opponent<00:00:22.949> might<00:00:23.340> hold<00:00:23.670> also<00:00:24.240> call<00:00:24.500> gives

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
your opponent might hold also call gives

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.870 
your opponent might hold also call gives
you<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.710> initiative<00:00:26.099> going<00:00:26.400> into<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.670> hand

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
you the initiative going into the hand

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.150 
you the initiative going into the hand
as<00:00:27.000> well<00:00:27.119> like<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.630> lot<00:00:27.779> easier<00:00:28.010> to<00:00:29.010> take

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
as well like it's a lot easier to take

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.349 
as well like it's a lot easier to take
it<00:00:29.310> down<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.609> bet<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.939> floor<00:00:30.150> if<00:00:30.330> you

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
it down with the bet on the floor if you

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.000 
it down with the bet on the floor if you
raise<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.630> yeah<00:00:32.000> so<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.059> raise<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.510> 60

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
raise it yeah so you raise it to 60

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.799 
raise it yeah so you raise it to 60
equals<00:00:35.010> doesn't<00:00:35.910> necessarily<00:00:36.420> show<00:00:36.450> too<00:00:36.780> much

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
equals doesn't necessarily show too much

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.330 
equals doesn't necessarily show too much
strength<00:00:37.260> since<00:00:37.530> you're<00:00:37.800> raising<00:00:38.040> from<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
strength since you're raising from the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.240 
strength since you're raising from the
small<00:00:38.610> blind<00:00:39.079> very<00:00:40.079> well<00:00:40.350> may<00:00:40.770> be<00:00:40.800> able<00:00:41.160> to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
small blind very well may be able to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.450 
small blind very well may be able to
take<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.520> down<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:41.969> flop<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:43.219> the<00:00:44.219> flop

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
take this down on the flop and the flop

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.170 
take this down on the flop and the flop
is<00:00:44.670> 298<00:00:45.390> rainbow<00:00:46.219> this<00:00:47.219> likely<00:00:47.550> missed<00:00:47.969> him

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
is 298 rainbow this likely missed him

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.479 
is 298 rainbow this likely missed him
your<00:00:48.510> hands<00:00:48.690> probably<00:00:49.200> best<00:00:49.469> but<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.129> very

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
your hands probably best but it's very

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.520 
your hands probably best but it's very
vulnerable<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.270> cast<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.140> lot<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.260> pressure

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
vulnerable I cast and a lot of pressure

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.290 
vulnerable I cast and a lot of pressure
so<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:53.250> probably<00:00:53.280> best<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.910> you're<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
so it's probably best that you're the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.779 
so it's probably best that you're the
one<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.570> bet<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.559> make<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.739> continuation<00:00:56.610> we're

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
one to bet to make a continuation we're

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.189 
one to bet to make a continuation we're
probably<00:00:57.059> about<00:00:57.180> half<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> posse's<00:00:57.780> well

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
probably about half the posse's well

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.889 
probably about half the posse's well
right<00:00:59.300> yep<00:01:00.469> and<00:01:01.469> he<00:01:02.039> calls<00:01:02.570> at<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.660> point

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
right yep and he calls at this point

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.509 
right yep and he calls at this point
it's<00:01:04.199> worthwhile<00:01:04.409> thinking<00:01:05.070> what<00:01:05.189> kind<00:01:05.369> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it's worthwhile thinking what kind of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.179 
it's worthwhile thinking what kind of
parents<00:01:05.820> he<00:01:05.880> might<00:01:06.119> hold<00:01:06.650> maybe<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.860> over

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
parents he might hold maybe just over

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.500 
parents he might hold maybe just over
cards<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.790> floating<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> flop<00:01:09.710> maybe<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.830> pair

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
cards and floating the flop maybe a pair

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.630 
cards and floating the flop maybe a pair
so<00:01:12.510> since<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.590> may<00:01:13.770> while<00:01:13.950> we<00:01:14.100> floating<00:01:14.460> which

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
so since you may while we floating which

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.950 
so since you may while we floating which
maybe<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.000> look<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.270> put<00:01:15.420> some<00:01:15.570> pressure<00:01:15.750> on

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
maybe you look to put some pressure on

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.230 
maybe you look to put some pressure on
with<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> good<00:01:16.409> turn<00:01:16.590> card<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.130> see<00:01:17.909> what<00:01:18.000> comes

might<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.259> able<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.470> successfully<00:01:46.829> block<00:01:47.340> off

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
might be able to successfully block off

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.270 
might be able to successfully block off
yeah<00:01:48.329> yes<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.409> would<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> tough<00:01:49.950> call<00:01:50.250> for

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
yeah yes it would be a tough call for

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.179 
yeah yes it would be a tough call for
anyone<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:50.850> an<00:01:50.939> eight<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.829> he<00:01:52.829> may<00:01:53.009> well

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
anyone with an eight and he may well

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.160 
anyone with an eight and he may well
fold<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.640> week<00:01:53.790> nine<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.299> yeah<00:01:54.840> yeah<00:01:55.020> it's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
fold a week nine here yeah yeah it's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.200 
fold a week nine here yeah yeah it's
possible<00:01:55.530> it's<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.310> really<00:01:56.490> good<00:01:56.700> spot<00:01:56.969> to

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
possible it's a really good spot to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.690 
possible it's a really good spot to
represent<00:01:57.780> strength<00:01:58.340> because<00:01:59.340> we<00:01:59.430> bet<00:01:59.579> on

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
represent strength because we bet on

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.459 
represent strength because we bet on
three<00:01:59.939> streets<00:02:00.270> as<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.630> were<00:02:00.750> representing<00:02:01.380> a

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
three streets as you were representing a

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.520 
three streets as you were representing a
really<00:02:01.710> big<00:02:01.890> hand<00:02:02.630> much<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.810> our<00:02:03.930> ponies<00:02:04.320> range

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
really big hand much of our ponies range

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.810 
really big hand much of our ponies range
is<00:02:04.710> going<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.950> fold<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.399> we're<00:02:05.759> giving

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
is going to fold and we're giving

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.240 
is going to fold and we're giving
ourselves<00:02:06.060> good<00:02:06.659> odds<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.170> bet<00:02:07.439> say<00:02:07.829> we<00:02:08.039> bet

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
ourselves good odds on a bet say we bet

ourselves good odds on a bet say we bet
roughly<00:02:08.670> half<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.819> port<00:02:09.239> we'd<00:02:09.569> only<00:02:09.690> need<00:02:09.929> to

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
roughly half the port we'd only need to
