 this week at the auto guide we put 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.480
 to test some pretty different cars the 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.490
 t-rex reverses high -speed air 13 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.039
 built here in quebec in boucherville 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.300
 by the firm campaign to motors that the 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.300
 distributes around the world 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.630
 the wisdom t-rex is the model 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.560
 original developed by campaign motors 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:46.440
 in 1988 we market it since 1994 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.050
 at the rear an engine from bmw 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.850
 the threshold 600 cc is actually a six 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.240
 cylinders in line that develops 160 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.100
 horses 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.809
 in this case it is paired with a box 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.970
 sequential six-speed 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.830
 we are aboard a door model 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.440
 the whole thus pays suspensions 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.879
 adjustable seat different and several 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.879
 elements in the sense of his style 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.470
 the tables of the bear grylls it's a 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.910
 model sold by campaign since 2011 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.770
 so it's their last baby 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.680
 at the rear there is a motor 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.630
 to help it béthune bislang 60 ° envy 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.210
 others without ceasing for a power 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.979
 of 125 horsepower engine is paired with a 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.380
 manual sequential box five 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.840
 relationships with a way backwards 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.910
 also his remark is a style 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.440
 roadster so open concept 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.729
 vadel much more classy and that we 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.960
 note by the finish that the 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.960
 different components on board 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.360
 in the light of an attacker we discover 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.190
 two similar machines sharing 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.990
 several components but which have 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.460
 totally different personalities 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.290
 the Nazarite is a machine 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.150
 much more sporty you can not 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.330
 accomplished one appreciates his attention to 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.670
 details while across the V13R 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.410
 is much rougher noisier 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.510
 machines we will like to walk around 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.180
 wander his valet having fun on a 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:15.440
