this<00:01:31.430> shotgun<00:01:31.670> talisha<00:01:32.180> I<00:01:32.360> think<00:01:32.540> it<00:01:32.659> possibly

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
this shotgun talisha I think it possibly

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.789 
this shotgun talisha I think it possibly
comes<00:01:33.350> a<00:01:33.470> hoary<00:01:33.710> a

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
comes a hoary a

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.069 
comes a hoary a
it<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:35.430> decent<00:01:35.880> save<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.270> having<00:01:36.630> Japanese

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
it is a decent save like having Japanese

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.749 
it is a decent save like having Japanese
up<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.439> he's<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.710> decent<00:01:38.100> position<00:01:38.219> but<00:01:38.670> he

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
up and he's in a decent position but he

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.450 
up and he's in a decent position but he
see<00:01:38.909> he<00:01:39.030> looks<00:01:39.149> one<00:01:39.450> footed<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:41.039> shop<00:01:41.280> until

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
see he looks one footed the shop until

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.039 
see he looks one footed the shop until
it's<00:01:41.759> go<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.909> don't<00:01:42.060> think<00:01:42.299> beats<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.659> cleanly

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
it's go I don't think beats in cleanly

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.230 
it's go I don't think beats in cleanly
I'm<00:01:43.170> sure<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.530> takes<00:01:43.679> a<00:01:43.799> nip<00:01:44.009> upper<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.490> PSG

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
I'm sure it takes a nip upper a PSG

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.880 
I'm sure it takes a nip upper a PSG
defender<00:01:45.659> here

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.380 

they're<00:01:48.430> pressing<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:48.850> game<00:01:49.030> high<00:01:49.180> up<00:01:49.270> the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
they're pressing the game high up the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.880 
they're pressing the game high up the
field<00:01:49.540> they<00:01:49.690> win<00:01:49.870> the<00:01:50.020> ball<00:01:50.230> back<00:01:50.260> high<00:01:50.680> on<00:01:50.740> the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
field they win the ball back high on the

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.460 
field they win the ball back high on the
field<00:01:51.130> four<00:01:51.340> shot<00:01:51.520> is<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.670> fierce<00:01:51.970> one<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:53.380> this

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
field four shot is a fierce one so this

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.630 
field four shot is a fierce one so this
could<00:01:53.680> does<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.890> right<00:01:54.040> thing<00:01:54.220> it<00:01:54.310> keeps<00:01:54.490> it

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
could does the right thing it keeps it

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.220 
could does the right thing it keeps it
on<00:01:54.670> target<00:01:55.150> this<00:01:55.420> is<00:01:55.570> think<00:01:55.750> it<00:01:55.840> comes<00:01:56.020> off<00:01:56.140> the

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
on target this is think it comes off the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.770 
on target this is think it comes off the
head<00:01:56.410> of<00:01:56.910> possibly<00:01:57.910> or<00:01:58.060> EA<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.480> then<00:01:58.600> that

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
head of possibly or EA and then that

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.510 
head of possibly or EA and then that
means<00:01:59.020> trappers<00:01:59.410> absolutely<00:01:59.890> no<00:02:00.070> chance<00:02:00.310> of

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
it seems to be tripped as well as a good

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.930 
it seems to be tripped as well as a good
ball<00:03:53.190> in<00:03:53.370> from<00:03:53.520> rabiot<00:03:53.870> to<00:03:54.870> me<00:03:54.990> as<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.170> foul<00:03:55.940> his

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940

running<00:03:58.530> away<00:03:58.710> from<00:03:58.770> him<00:03:59.130> but<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.310> think<00:03:59.460> the

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
running away from him but I think the

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.280 
running away from him but I think the
referee<00:03:59.940> really<00:04:00.180> should<00:04:00.330> have<00:04:00.450> blown<00:04:01.080> for<00:04:01.230> the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
referee really should have blown for the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:09.080 
referee really should have blown for the
first<00:04:01.530> challenge<00:04:02.010> if<00:04:02.400> not<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.730> second

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.030 

so<00:04:09.690> Julian's<00:04:10.140> is<00:04:10.260> always<00:04:10.530> about<00:04:10.770> to<00:04:10.950> be

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
so Julian's is always about to be

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.320 
so Julian's is always about to be
replaced

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
replaced
