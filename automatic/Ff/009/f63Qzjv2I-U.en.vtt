00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
diameter is most of these come in at

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.859 
diameter is most of these come in at
about<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> half-inch<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.420> one's<00:01:54.600> coming<00:01:54.720> in

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
about a half-inch this one's coming in

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.569 
about a half-inch this one's coming in
at<00:01:55.020> about<00:01:55.200> forty<00:01:55.530> seven<00:01:55.829> thousand<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.310> close

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
at about forty seven thousand so close

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.850 
at about forty seven thousand so close
enough<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> half-inch<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:58.320> half-inch<00:01:58.740> hole

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
enough to a half-inch so half-inch hole

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.530 
enough to a half-inch so half-inch hole
is<00:01:58.979> what<00:01:59.100> we're<00:01:59.219> looking<00:01:59.430> for<00:01:59.460> to<00:02:00.180> drill<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
is what we're looking for to drill the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.209 
is what we're looking for to drill the
hole<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.899> could<00:02:01.049> probably<00:02:01.259> come<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.799> with

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
hole you could probably come in with

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.609 
hole you could probably come in with
just<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.520> half-inch<00:02:03.030> Brad<00:02:03.840> point<00:02:04.110> bit<00:02:04.259> and

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
just a half-inch Brad point bit and

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.260 
just a half-inch Brad point bit and
drill<00:02:04.770> your<00:02:04.890> hole<00:02:05.040> however<00:02:05.460> what<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.119> to

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
drill your hole however what I like to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.389 
drill your hole however what I like to
do<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:07.170> start<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.560> pilot<00:02:07.829> hole<00:02:08.069> I'm<00:02:08.190> going<00:02:08.340> to

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
do is start a pilot hole I'm going to

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.130 
do is start a pilot hole I'm going to
start<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.759> quarter-inch<00:02:09.090> Brad<00:02:09.750> point<00:02:10.020> bit

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
start with a quarter-inch Brad point bit

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.010 
start with a quarter-inch Brad point bit
and<00:02:10.500> then<00:02:11.069> I'm<00:02:11.129> going<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.340> use<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:11.610> special

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
and then I'm going to use this special

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.580 
and then I'm going to use this special
step-up<00:02:13.020> bit

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
step-up bit

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.140 
step-up bit
to<00:02:13.769> step<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.190> all<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.340> way<00:02:14.459> up<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> half<00:02:14.910> inch

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
to step it all the way up to a half inch

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.570 
to step it all the way up to a half inch
it<00:02:16.019> tapers<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.739> reams<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.190> out<00:02:17.310> nice<00:02:17.550> and

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
it tapers it and reams it out nice and

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.540 
it tapers it and reams it out nice and
smooth<00:02:18.030> without<00:02:18.209> damaging<00:02:18.780> your<00:02:18.870> finish<00:02:19.550> now

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
smooth without damaging your finish now

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.570 
smooth without damaging your finish now
because<00:02:20.849> I<00:02:21.000> have<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.560> punch<00:02:22.560> hole<00:02:22.830> there<00:02:23.160> it's

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
because I have a punch hole there it's

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.130 
because I have a punch hole there it's
very<00:02:23.670> easy<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.180> place<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.599> tip<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:24.959> brad

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
very easy to place the tip of the brad

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.550 
very easy to place the tip of the brad
pointing<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.739> drill

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.070 

now<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.590> come<00:02:33.890> in<00:02:34.010> with<00:02:34.129> the<00:02:34.280> taper<00:02:34.520> bit<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.390> go

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
now I come in with the taper bit and go

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.500 
now I come in with the taper bit and go
ahead<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.319> remit<00:02:36.650> on<00:02:36.769> out<00:02:36.980> up<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.819> a<00:02:37.849> full<00:02:38.239> half
