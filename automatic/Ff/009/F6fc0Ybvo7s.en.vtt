 Welcome to Ahmed Kitchen, today we manufacture chicken slices 

00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:08.139
 Ingredients: 400 grams chicken 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:09.470
 2 onions 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.770
 2 peeled tomatoes 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.590
 2 fingers of garlic 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.190
 4 pepper 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.030
 Garlic perennial as decorative 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:26.100
 20g butter, 20g sweet pepper and 20 g flour 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.890
 Salt, pepper, pepper and thyme 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.890
 Let's start immediately 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.890
 Oil in the pan 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.820
 The pan must be hot 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.400
 This is 30 ml 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.980
 So this is already hot 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.950
 Chicken immediately 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.060
 Saute for 3 minutes 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.409
 Then comes onions 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:12.100
 As long as you cut onions 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.819
 Almost cut 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:17.279
 Water in the flesh now 

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:25.290
 You can see that the meat is fried and has a color 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.179
 Now the onion came 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:39.069
 Onions with garlic 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.840
 Now the peppers are cut 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.929
 We cut it diagonally 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.450
 Pepper is pure 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.179
 Fuss several times 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:00.409
 I'll leave it that way now 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.719
 Tomato dice 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.599
 Now in the pan 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.599
 ready 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:23.540
 Flipping everything together for two minutes 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:53.230
 Now place the pepper, butter and flour in the pan and stir 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:10.650
 Not long 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.140
 Pure spices, salt, etc 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:26.499
 And 30 ml of vegetable broth 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:27.499
 Move everything 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:33.790
 Cook for 2 minutes, then it is done 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.790
 Now it's over 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.340
 We can give the plate 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:55.689
 This is very much for someone 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:56.999
 This is what I eat, and this is Murad 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:01.099
 I've made more ribbons 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.560
 You can put it as a decoration 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.909
 You can eat it with bread, siyabata or bake bread 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.959
 Garlic perennial as decorative 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.549
 ready 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:21.440
 So you can serve them 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.030
 I wish you good appetite with chicken slices until next time, 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.800
