00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.610
 Hello, I am the teacher of 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.099
 Cruising will show you today how to 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.500
 the samsung galaxy note 2 with android 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.969
 4.0 offers the latest firmware 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.170
 version of the current edition and therefore 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.420
 I'll show you this like this 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.740
 everything is easy because of that 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.230
 from the url down in the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.490
 description is the package down the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.350
 should not be a big deal 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.029
 and then maybe we will 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.880
 tackle times how to unpack something 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.679
 either you already have program or you 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.600
 load by simply the program 7 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.640
 zip down too important is that here 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.559
 the usb driver assembly installed 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.210
 you can also find the video below 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.550
 description so we extract the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.680
 But all of the stuff starts up somewhere 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.570
 the pc on it that I relatively unimportant 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.070
 and when we extracted the folder 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.730
 open folder we find there once the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.420
 csv file or him in version 3.0 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.550
 point 9 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.969
 and so unimportant 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.289
 the configuration file actually 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.559
 but it is not important for us now 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.690
 great value first has so important 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.280
 Of course, if you route your mobile phone 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.090
 volt and do not know what is good, let 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.150
 the fingers of it 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.119
 inform yourself carefully and now 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.130
 Let's make the cell phone out first 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.420
 terrific transfer if you have the phone 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.030
 please be careful to make sure that 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.650
 you should have enough battery from 50% battery 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.970
 rich the more the better 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.619
 then you are safe too 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.400
 side that in any case very much 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.750
 important as a restart 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.159
 or mobile phone goes out first 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.570
 and now we go into the download 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.450
 mode we enter by volume 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.030
 loudness unfortunately the home button and 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.509
 press the switch at the same time and 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.040
 Keep pressed until now here, as it were 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.970
 Display to come we now 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.979
 have to confirm 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.430
 Do you really want to continue this year 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.540
 I want to volume up to continue to usb 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.399
 cable we have the mobile phone now 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.130
 ideally already connected with pc 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.380
 be the start so is the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.490
 great program here and choose from the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.820
 point ap now the cf autorun file the 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.829
 we just now packed with certain 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.369
 we look at the options 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.330
 two hook part in tribute and africa 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.190
 have set and we see already 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.390
 up here this ends that is it 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.910
 mobile phone was recognized end means we 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.620
 It can be easy 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.300
 but also press start and the rest 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.580
 make it first with the program 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.180
 running few bars around actually 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.320
 a wonderful thing yes the cell phone acts 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.330
 Now a bit of alone I 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.070
 I do not care about english flow here 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.390
 In any case, sandy does its job 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.300
 and in the meantime again the hint 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.860
 that you do it on your own responsibility 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.240
 that means doing well with this 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.160
 can you break your mobile phone 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.600
 that is very unlikely that 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.820
 that happens but it can happen that 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.130
 because of disclaimer neither me nor 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.620
 Anyone else is celebrating ten 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.080
 vip stick because you so your 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.360
 Warranty loses and a mistake 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.830
 Keep someone liable for that easily 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.510
 As I said you do not have to worry now 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.340
 have that something happened there 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.630
 very very unlikely 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.710
 I told you about this 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.930
 then nothing should happen 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.880
 but if something happens, it is liable 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.590
 no sow for it quite simply out of principle 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.740
 is indeed in the park and so if you 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.720
 a bird on his head says Rothschild 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.800
 then there is no one adhere to it 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.400
 every case here is super user 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.970
 required 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.200
 no matter how many times you want to start there 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.250
 just does not have to happen because of that 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.660
 wait a bit now 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.560
 that means a new one 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.270
 message come in safety notice 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.980
 try without authorization on one 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.330
 Safe area on your device 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.730
 access was blocked 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.620
 samsung is constantly working on one 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.920
 Improvement of safety guidelines 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.780
 device on which they stand so bla 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.040
 regalia be updated times and then 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.630
 now this English long English 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.850
 read text again and read the 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.300
 also confirm so now confirm one 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.060
 man 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:53.380
 the whole is being updated now takes 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:54.730
 also a few seconds new 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.950
 Security Policy has been updated 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.239
 wonderful thing and then we will 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.720
 now also upstairs the status 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.670
 Provided 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.470
 But even with super user was 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.360
 Updated if your superuser cent 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.830
 which customers do not have then go 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.110
 go to the play store and look for 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.640
 super user of chen celebration that the 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.950
 Developer and then invite you again 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.150
 down so super user now we can do it 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.770
 also run and of course that would have 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.200
 update again and come now 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:22.690
 the note for a recovery mode that 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:24.340
 means if you have cwm or tvp installed 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.490
 of course you should have this one 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.199
 Select from 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.550
 the button down there right and otherwise 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.919
 you just become the normal method 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.690
 like me now that way there now 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.430
 also a bit until he is the 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.750
 of course has updated all the stuff 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.000
 wait a bit longer 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.979
 but in itself the whole thing is relative 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.990
 just like that now samsung knox wants 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.259
 Of course again in between 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.120
 spark the great application of samsung 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.500
 who wants to make our life difficult 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.889
 but here it is still relatively easy 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.660
 Just move on immediately and the 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.090
 Software does its part around samsung 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.680
 Knox wipe away a wonderful thing yet 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.270
 just restart the phone and please 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.440
 Do not be surprised if neustadt now 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.919
 here at the red a little bit longer 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.930
 lasts 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.509
 that is no problem no worries 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.130
 it does not respond normally to 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.960
 even just this once in a while 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.210
 after booting your phone will run 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.169
 again as fast as before or 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.169
 slow depending on 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.150
 so cell phones rebooted so you want 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.520
 Let's see if we are really good 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.070
 Let's go the super user app 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.780
 so there is already open and would 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.730
 aha she probably does not crash 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.840
 that's good, so we have 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.190
 something done right 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.420
 Now let's see if she really does 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.980
 have root access with the 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.560
 free app lucek adidas then 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.150
 again suppressed there for us to staudt 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.940
 it simply verify good and 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.320
 pretty cool actually and it comes 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.080
 only super user request that they already 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.450
 very good and she will be too 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.970
 Well done so we have 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.980
 now really root-access relations 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.120
 the hotter sex and if you still have it 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.530
 have questions with any errors 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.260
 just write down in 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.400
 to answer the comment 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:05.380
 and hopefully in the exchange videos the 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.380
 to meet in the clearing up
