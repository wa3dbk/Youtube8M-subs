and<00:02:21.060> we<00:02:21.210> look<00:02:21.390> through<00:02:21.600> for<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.500> eight<00:02:22.650> of

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
and we look through for the eight of

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.620 
and we look through for the eight of
Spades<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.610> say<00:02:23.820> right<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.240> can<00:02:24.480> be<00:02:24.600> my

Spades and you say right this can be my

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.350 
Spades and you say right this can be my

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
prediction there is but what I'll do is

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.900 
prediction there is but what I'll do is
I'll<00:02:27.510> just<00:02:27.690> go<00:02:27.870> through<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.290> say<00:02:28.640> I've<00:02:29.640> got<00:02:29.790> on

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
and you don't need the rest of this pack

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.380 
and you don't need the rest of this pack
okay<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.580> say<00:02:47.760> right<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.180> going<00:02:48.330> to

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
okay and you say right this is going to

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.880 
okay and you say right this is going to
be<00:02:48.480> my<00:02:48.630> prediction<00:02:49.170> will<00:02:49.410> get<00:02:49.560> back<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.860> that

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
be my prediction will get back to that

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.330 
be my prediction will get back to that
in<00:02:50.040> seconds<00:02:50.730> all<00:02:51.600> come<00:02:51.840> out<00:02:51.960> of<00:02:52.110> this<00:02:52.230> pack<00:02:52.530> now

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
in seconds all come out of this pack now

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.830 
in seconds all come out of this pack now
you've<00:02:53.580> got<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.880> eight<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.300> Spades<00:02:54.540> on<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
you've got the eight of Spades on the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.960 
you've got the eight of Spades on the
top<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.590> what<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.070> can<00:02:56.190> do<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.460> just<00:02:56.490> give<00:02:56.820> them

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
top so what you can do is just give them

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.150 
top so what you can do is just give them
a<00:02:57.300> quick<00:02:57.810> shuffle<00:02:58.110> go<00:02:58.470> on<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.860> give<00:02:58.950> them<00:02:59.130> a

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
a quick shuffle go on and give them a

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.150 
a quick shuffle go on and give them a
shuffle<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.850> a<00:03:00.270> cut<00:03:00.570> now<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.590> cover-up

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
shuffle and a cut now this is a cover-up

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.660 
shuffle and a cut now this is a cover-up
to<00:03:02.910> get<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.090> break<00:03:03.560> where<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:05.010> eight<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.340> Spades

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
to get a break where the eight of Spades

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.110 
to get a break where the eight of Spades
is<00:03:05.960> okay<00:03:06.960> so<00:03:07.770> what<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.280> need<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.490> do<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:08.760> cut

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
is okay so what you need to do is cut

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.320 
is okay so what you need to do is cut
roughly<00:03:09.750> about<00:03:10.140> what's<00:03:11.070> that<00:03:11.310> about<00:03:12.210> a<00:03:12.270> third

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
roughly about what's that about a third

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.650 
roughly about what's that about a third
of<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.720> pack<00:03:12.990> cut<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.340> then<00:03:15.060> swing<00:03:15.420> pop

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
of the pack cut that and then swing pop

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.930 
of the pack cut that and then swing pop
the<00:03:15.750> rest<00:03:15.960> of<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.170> cards<00:03:16.560> onto<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.950> top<00:03:17.220> and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
the rest of the cards onto the top and

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.540 
the rest of the cards onto the top and
then<00:03:18.060> keep<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.690> break<00:03:18.960> okay<00:03:19.770> now<00:03:20.280> from<00:03:20.459> here

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
then keep that break okay now from here

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.580 
then keep that break okay now from here
you're<00:03:21.030> just<00:03:21.270> going<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.480> do<00:03:21.660> down<00:03:21.930> cards<00:03:22.440> until

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
you're just going to do down cards until

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.680 
you're just going to do down cards until
expect<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.310> tickle<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.730> stop<00:03:24.000> now<00:03:24.570> the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
expect a tickle you stop now the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.040 
expect a tickle you stop now the
likelihood<00:03:25.410> is<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.920> they<00:03:26.850> will<00:03:27.030> stop<00:03:27.450> before

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
likelihood is that they will stop before

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.880 
likelihood is that they will stop before
you<00:03:28.650> get<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:30.209> cards<00:03:30.989> okay<00:03:31.380> if<00:03:31.500> they<00:03:31.620> stop

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
you get to this cards okay if they stop

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.729 
you get to this cards okay if they stop
on<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.190> card<00:03:32.430> that's<00:03:32.580> perfect<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:34.470> if<00:03:34.650> they

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
on the card that's perfect and if they

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.440 
on the card that's perfect and if they
stop<00:03:34.980> after<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.400> car<00:03:35.610> dog<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.000> explain<00:03:36.300> that

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
stop after the car dog and explain that

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.650 
stop after the car dog and explain that
in<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.570> sec<00:03:36.840> but<00:03:37.110> let's<00:03:37.620> say<00:03:37.800> they<00:03:37.980> said<00:03:38.190> start

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.000 
right so let's say you were roughly
there<00:04:36.690> right<00:04:37.140> so<00:04:37.740> they<00:04:38.100> go<00:04:39.380> they<00:04:40.380> get<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.830> the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
there right so they go they get to the

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.880 
there right so they go they get to the
car<00:04:41.220> so<00:04:43.580> but<00:04:44.580> hear<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:45.720> say<00:04:45.930> you<00:04:46.230> sure<00:04:46.470> you

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
car so but hear you say you sure you

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.770 
car so but hear you say you sure you
don't<00:04:47.130> you<00:04:47.400> dumbass<00:04:47.760> top<00:04:48.000> yaar<00:04:48.240> me<00:04:48.450> you've<00:04:48.630> got

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
don't you dumbass top yaar me you've got

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.140 
don't you dumbass top yaar me you've got
a<00:04:48.810> long<00:04:49.110> way<00:04:49.350> and<00:04:49.650> what<00:04:50.490> you're<00:04:50.640> doing<00:04:50.760> there

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
a long way and what you're doing there

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
a long way and what you're doing there
is<00:04:51.390> you<00:04:52.110> need<00:04:52.500> to<00:04:52.530> look<00:04:52.830> up<00:04:53.150> look<00:04:54.150> up<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.570> the

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
is you need to look up look up and the

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.900 
is you need to look up look up and the
spectators<00:04:55.650> we<00:04:56.040> look<00:04:56.220> up<00:04:56.340> as<00:04:56.490> well<00:04:56.640> just

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
spectators we look up as well just

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.090 
spectators we look up as well just
perform<00:04:57.270> another<00:04:57.480> pass<00:04:57.750> and<00:04:58.140> say<00:04:58.350> a<00:04:58.380> nice<00:04:58.710> fun

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
perform another pass and say a nice fun

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.700 
perform another pass and say a nice fun
and<00:04:59.940> you<00:05:00.150> said<00:05:00.360> ok<00:05:00.690> just<00:05:01.080> call<00:05:01.260> stop<00:05:01.530> any

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
and you said ok just call stop any

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.220 
and you said ok just call stop any
anytime<00:05:02.430> you<00:05:02.850> go<00:05:02.970> little<00:05:03.270> bit<00:05:03.600> slow<00:05:03.810> this<00:05:03.840> time

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
anytime you go little bit slow this time

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.710 
anytime you go little bit slow this time
likelihood<00:05:05.130> is<00:05:05.400> they<00:05:05.670> will<00:05:05.850> call<00:05:06.060> stop<00:05:06.420> if

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
likelihood is they will call stop if

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.300 
likelihood is they will call stop if
they<00:05:07.320> don't<00:05:07.560> they're<00:05:07.770> just<00:05:07.950> being<00:05:08.100> difficult
