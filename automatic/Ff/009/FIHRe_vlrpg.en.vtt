so<00:01:40.390> here<00:01:40.750> when<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.110> put<00:01:41.320> your<00:01:41.590> your<00:01:41.950> bit<00:01:42.190> to

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
so here when you put your your bit to

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.700 
so here when you put your your bit to
the<00:01:42.520> wood<00:01:42.730> you<00:01:43.030> have<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.360> see<00:01:43.600> inside<00:01:44.140> that

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
the wood you have to see inside that

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
wood where it's going to end up rather

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.630 
wood where it's going to end up rather
than<00:01:46.479> it's<00:01:47.110> all<00:01:47.320> on<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.619> surface<00:01:48.040> so<00:01:48.220> here<00:01:48.430> you

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
than it's all on the surface so here you

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.640 
than it's all on the surface so here you
have<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.970> anticipate<00:01:49.270> where<00:01:50.260> it's<00:01:50.380> going<00:01:50.590> to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
have to anticipate where it's going to

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.469 
have to anticipate where it's going to
be<00:01:50.800> after<00:01:51.190> it's<00:01:51.310> finished<00:01:51.550> and<00:01:51.910> that's<00:01:52.000> that's

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
be after it's finished and that's that's

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.710 
be after it's finished and that's that's
challenging<00:01:53.080> less<00:01:54.070> is<00:01:54.280> more<00:01:54.550> often<00:01:54.910> it<00:01:55.270> is<00:01:55.450> but

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
challenging less is more often it is but

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.150 
challenging less is more often it is but
then<00:01:55.900> it's<00:01:56.110> hard<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.380> get<00:01:56.560> some<00:01:56.800> people<00:01:57.010> to

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
then it's hard to get some people to

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.080 
then it's hard to get some people to
take<00:01:57.369> enough<00:01:57.640> wood<00:01:57.850> oftentimes<00:01:59.580> this<00:02:00.580> general
