actually going out with this on

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.520 
actually going out with this on
definitely<00:01:37.330> yeah<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:37.870> because<00:01:38.080> it<00:01:38.290> dries<00:01:38.500> so

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
I could probably effect tunnel and then
