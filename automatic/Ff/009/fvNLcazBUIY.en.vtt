unfreeze these two gears they just fly
off<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.810> go<00:00:19.289> where<00:00:19.439> if<00:00:19.529> they<00:00:19.680> like<00:00:19.859> like

they're<00:00:20.250> not<00:00:20.400> welded<00:00:20.779> so<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.960> happens<00:00:22.320> now

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
they're not welded so that happens now

happen wall as well and then these ya
gotta<00:00:33.960> know<00:00:34.170> collide<00:00:35.270> just<00:00:36.270> use<00:00:36.390> no<00:00:36.630> cloak

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
gotta know collide just use no cloak

because<00:00:41.760> when<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> spins<00:00:42.360> will<00:00:42.600> try<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:42.930> hit

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
because when the spins will try and hit

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.010 
because when the spins will try and hit
that<00:00:44.390> never<00:00:45.390> give<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.079> little<00:00:46.260> spin<00:00:48.020> then

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
that never give it a little spin then

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.810 
that never give it a little spin then
through<00:00:50.059> now<00:00:51.059> if<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.449> grab<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:52.649> gear<00:00:53.070> all<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
through now if I grab that gear all the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.720 
through now if I grab that gear all the
power<00:00:54.030> goes<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.480> opposite<00:00:54.840> gear<00:00:55.460> grab<00:00:56.460> that

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
power goes the opposite gear grab that

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.520 
power goes the opposite gear grab that
gear<00:00:57.059> all<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> pair<00:00:57.690> goes<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.140> other<00:00:58.230> gear

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
gear all the pair goes the other gear

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.790 
gear all the pair goes the other gear
that's<00:00:59.430> how<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> diff<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.149> handy<00:01:00.539> when<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.590> turn

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
that's how a diff is handy when you turn

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.889 
that's how a diff is handy when you turn
a<00:01:01.829> corner<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.489> inside<00:01:03.000> wheel<00:01:03.210> has<00:01:03.390> more<00:01:03.629> grip

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
a corner the inside wheel has more grip

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.130 
a corner the inside wheel has more grip
when<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> outside<00:01:05.369> will<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.760> go<00:01:05.909> faster<00:01:06.450> so

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
when the outside will to go faster so

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.280 
when the outside will to go faster so
turn<00:01:07.439> faster<00:01:07.860> because<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.220> diff<00:01:08.400> allows<00:01:08.640> it

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
turn faster because the diff allows it

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.499 
turn faster because the diff allows it
isn't<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.380> amazing<00:01:10.560> children<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> that's

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
isn't that amazing children so that's

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.550 
isn't that amazing children so that's
your<00:01:15.630> diff<00:01:15.900> same<00:01:16.770> action<00:01:17.360> here<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.630> two

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
your diff same action here we have two

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.249 
your diff same action here we have two
massive<00:01:20.400> wheels<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.840> slightly

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
massive wheels this is a slightly

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.350 
massive wheels this is a slightly
reinforced<00:01:23.070> design<00:01:23.369> because<00:01:23.580> they're<00:01:23.759> these

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
reinforced design because they're these

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.990 
reinforced design because they're these
two<00:01:24.689> blocks<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.380> by<00:01:25.740> kip<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.100> cage<00:01:26.340> cage

everything<00:01:35.180> there<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.240> go<00:01:36.329> zero<00:01:37.250> I've<00:01:38.250> just

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
everything there you go zero I've just

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.609 
everything there you go zero I've just
got<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.640> done<00:01:38.909> off<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.150> thruster<00:01:39.630> wheel<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.500> a

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
got this done off a thruster wheel and a

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.469 
got this done off a thruster wheel and a
couple<00:01:40.920> thrusters<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> wheel<00:01:41.790> just<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.150> spin

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
couple thrusters on a wheel just to spin

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.590 
couple thrusters on a wheel just to spin
everything<00:01:42.509> around<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.850> grabbed<00:01:45.149> this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
everything around so I grabbed this

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.410 
everything around so I grabbed this
wheel<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.500> wheel<00:01:46.770> spins<00:01:47.159> for<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.700> grab<00:01:47.939> this

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
wheel that wheel spins for a grab this

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.200 
wheel that wheel spins for a grab this
wheel<00:01:48.689> starts<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> upper<00:01:49.500> wheel<00:01:49.619> spin<00:01:50.210> it's

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
wheel starts the upper wheel spin it's

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.370 
wheel starts the upper wheel spin it's
really<00:01:51.360> hard<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:51.840> when<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.259> all

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
really hard to see when you have it all

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.380 
really hard to see when you have it all
running<00:01:52.710> let<00:01:53.220> me<00:01:53.310> spin<00:01:53.670> these<00:01:53.820> up<00:01:54.060> because<00:01:54.270> if

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
running let me spin these up because if

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.380 
running let me spin these up because if
not<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.600> try<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.810> look<00:01:54.990> backwards

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.180 

yes<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.630> big<00:02:00.780> rear<00:02:01.050> gear<00:02:01.320> does<00:02:01.560> skip<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.070> lot

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
yes the big rear gear does skip a lot

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.300 
yes the big rear gear does skip a lot
you<00:02:02.970> can<00:02:03.060> fix<00:02:03.300> it<00:02:03.420> by<00:02:03.510> making<00:02:03.690> it<00:02:03.960> heavier<00:02:04.310> so

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
you can fix it by making it heavier so

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.109 
you can fix it by making it heavier so
if<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.670> turn<00:02:06.620> you<00:02:07.620> can<00:02:07.800> see<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.550> middle<00:02:08.940> gear

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
if I turn you can see the middle gear

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.130 
if I turn you can see the middle gear
just<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.570> crawls<00:02:10.140> around<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.800> little<00:02:11.810> not<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.840> lot

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
just so crawls around a little not a lot

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.680 
just so crawls around a little not a lot
because<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.670> deciding<00:02:15.210> not<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.390> work

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
because this is deciding not to work

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.620 
because this is deciding not to work
properly<00:02:16.940> there<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.000> goes<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.300> can<00:02:18.390> see<00:02:18.510> the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
properly there it goes you can see the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.270 
properly there it goes you can see the
middle<00:02:18.840> wheels<00:02:19.020> just<00:02:19.290> slowly<00:02:19.620> making<00:02:19.950> its<00:02:20.160> way

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
middle wheels just slowly making its way

around because we're only doing point
three<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.230> them<00:02:22.320> I'll<00:02:22.500> brow<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.260> whole

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
three of them I'll brow and the whole

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.199 
three of them I'll brow and the whole
thing's<00:02:25.680> giving<00:02:25.980> if<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.430> regularly<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.970> way

thing's giving if you regularly is way

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.410 
thing's giving if you regularly is way
more<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.780> will<00:02:27.870> work<00:02:28.080> better<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:29.610> more<00:02:29.850> gears

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
more it will work better the more gears

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.100 
more it will work better the more gears
way<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:32.370> more<00:02:32.610> power<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.090> can<00:02:33.330> sunk<00:02:33.720> through

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
way the more power you can sunk through

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.040 
way the more power you can sunk through
only<00:02:34.980> from<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.910> only<00:02:36.090> way<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.690> we'll<00:02:36.840> pay

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
only from is the only way and we'll pay

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.800 
only from is the only way and we'll pay
you<00:02:37.110> need<00:02:37.410> sunk<00:02:37.800> through<00:02:38.420> took<00:02:39.420> these<00:02:39.630> weigh

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
you need sunk through took these weigh

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.810 
you need sunk through took these weigh
like<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.470> thousand<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.340> need<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.550> lot<00:02:41.760> more

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
like a thousand that need a lot more

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.690 
like a thousand that need a lot more
power<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.450> spin<00:02:42.750> them<00:02:43.430> apparently<00:02:44.430> it's<00:02:44.550> just

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
power to spin them apparently it's just

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.640 
power to spin them apparently it's just
a<00:02:44.880> four<00:02:45.090> wheel<00:02:45.270> with<00:02:45.450> two<00:02:45.600> thrusters<00:02:46.140> bolted

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
a four wheel with two thrusters bolted

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.260 
a four wheel with two thrusters bolted
to<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:49.010> let's<00:02:50.010> give<00:02:50.160> this<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.340> shot<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.970> should

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
to it let's give this a shot I should

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.520 
to it let's give this a shot I should
work<00:02:51.480> nicely<00:02:51.770> hmm<00:02:52.910> fire<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.120> up<00:02:54.530> sticking

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
work nicely hmm fire that up sticking

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.530 
work nicely hmm fire that up sticking
fast<00:02:56.540> clutch<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.930> things<00:02:58.739> start<00:02:59.040> colliding

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.140 

okay

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.119 

we<00:03:09.450> as<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.569> can<00:03:10.689> see<00:03:10.959> they're<00:03:11.319> both<00:03:11.620> spinning

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
we as you can see they're both spinning

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.130 
we as you can see they're both spinning
out<00:03:12.250> weird<00:03:12.549> rate<00:03:13.360> because<00:03:13.659> they<00:03:13.810> both<00:03:13.959> have

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
out weird rate because they both have

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.479 
out weird rate because they both have
the<00:03:14.260> same<00:03:14.290> amount<00:03:14.530> of<00:03:14.709> grip<00:03:14.890> which<00:03:15.099> were<00:03:15.340> the

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
the same amount of grip which were the

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.119 
the same amount of grip which were the
spinning<00:03:15.879> opposite<00:03:16.209> directions<00:03:16.680> /<00:03:17.680> def<00:03:17.890> if

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
spinning opposite directions / def if

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.250 
spinning opposite directions / def if
you<00:03:18.280> if<00:03:18.909> both<00:03:19.239> wheels<00:03:19.569> off<00:03:19.689> the<00:03:19.870> floor<00:03:20.079> and<00:03:20.170> you

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
you if both wheels off the floor and you

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.199 
you if both wheels off the floor and you
spin<00:03:20.620> one<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:21.220> other<00:03:21.400> one<00:03:21.519> will<00:03:21.760> spin<00:03:22.030> the

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
spin one the other one will spin the

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.530 
spin one the other one will spin the
opposite<00:03:22.510> direction<00:03:23.250> if<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.400> stand<00:03:24.790> over<00:03:25.150> here

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
opposite direction if I stand over here

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.569 
opposite direction if I stand over here
you<00:03:25.840> can<00:03:26.019> see<00:03:26.230> this<00:03:26.379> gear<00:03:26.769> is<00:03:26.799> this<00:03:27.250> wheels

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
you can see this gear is this wheels

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.599 
you can see this gear is this wheels
move<00:03:28.000> if<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.359> grab<00:03:28.569> that<00:03:28.810> wheel<00:03:29.400> starts<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.459> move

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
move if I grab that wheel starts to move

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.839 
move if I grab that wheel starts to move
it's<00:03:31.480> not<00:03:31.599> amazing<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:32.230> now<00:03:33.220> grab<00:03:33.459> this<00:03:33.609> wheel

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
it's not amazing I now grab this wheel

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.140 
it's not amazing I now grab this wheel
that<00:03:34.390> one<00:03:34.629> should<00:03:34.840> start<00:03:35.109> remove<00:03:35.349> any<00:03:36.150> less

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
that one should start remove any less

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.640 
that one should start remove any less
I've<00:03:37.359> got<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.629> unfreeze<00:03:38.049> this<00:03:38.260> gear<00:03:40.650> this

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
I've got to unfreeze this gear this

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.839 
I've got to unfreeze this gear this
whole<00:03:41.709> thing<00:03:42.099> doesn't<00:03:42.220> work<00:03:42.400> quite<00:03:42.790> right

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
whole thing doesn't work quite right

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.399 
whole thing doesn't work quite right
because<00:03:43.239> it's<00:03:43.480> all<00:03:43.629> a<00:03:43.659> bit<00:03:43.870> wobbly<00:03:44.079> after

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
because it's all a bit wobbly after

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:51.569 
because it's all a bit wobbly after
being<00:03:44.709> duped<00:03:45.010> so<00:03:45.310> many<00:03:45.519> times<00:03:50.430> that's<00:03:51.430> your

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
being duped so many times that's your

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.420 
being duped so many times that's your
basic<00:03:51.730> little<00:03:52.090> diff<00:03:52.829> not<00:03:53.829> bad<00:03:54.010> for<00:03:54.040> five

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
basic little diff not bad for five

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.160 
basic little diff not bad for five
minutes<00:03:54.700> there's<00:03:55.030> a<00:03:55.060> bit<00:03:55.209> wobbly<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:56.019> can

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
minutes there's a bit wobbly and you can

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.360 
minutes there's a bit wobbly and you can
probably<00:03:56.439> make<00:03:56.530> it<00:03:56.680> better<00:03:56.859> by<00:03:57.010> making<00:03:57.159> the

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
probably make it better by making the

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.059 
probably make it better by making the
whole<00:03:57.489> thing<00:03:57.519> weigh<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.000> lot<00:03:58.239> more<00:03:58.950> but<00:03:59.950> it

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
whole thing weigh a lot more but it

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.740 
whole thing weigh a lot more but it
seems<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.370> work<00:04:00.609> for<00:04:00.760> me<00:04:00.939> I<00:04:01.120> mean<00:04:01.389> it<00:04:01.450> makes<00:04:01.569> my

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
seems to work for me I mean it makes my

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.030 
seems to work for me I mean it makes my
truck<00:04:02.079> go<00:04:04.230> sort<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.379> a<00:04:05.620> thought<00:04:06.250> fires<00:04:06.700> working

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
truck go sort of a thought fires working

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.960 
truck go sort of a thought fires working
eventually<00:04:09.040> this<00:04:09.159> thing<00:04:09.400> will<00:04:09.519> start<00:04:09.730> going

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
eventually this thing will start going

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.449 
eventually this thing will start going
forward<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:10.629> form<00:04:10.989> is<00:04:11.169> way<00:04:11.470> so<00:04:11.530> bloody<00:04:12.220> much

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
forward and form is way so bloody much

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.979 
forward and form is way so bloody much
it<00:04:12.609> takes<00:04:12.730> about<00:04:12.970> five<00:04:13.329> minutes<00:04:13.599> to<00:04:13.720> stop

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
it takes about five minutes to stop

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.500 
it takes about five minutes to stop
wobbling<00:04:14.730> let's<00:04:15.730> give<00:04:15.879> it<00:04:15.910> a<00:04:16.030> little<00:04:16.120> hand<00:04:18.510> and

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
wobbling let's give it a little hand and

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.170 
wobbling let's give it a little hand and
the<00:04:19.690> diffs<00:04:19.930> work<00:04:20.169> away<00:04:20.440> quite<00:04:20.769> Maryland<00:04:21.400> spin

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
the diffs work away quite Maryland spin

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.879 
the diffs work away quite Maryland spin
the<00:04:22.479> whole<00:04:22.599> thing<00:04:22.840> eventually<00:04:23.020> goes<00:04:23.470> forward

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
the whole thing eventually goes forward

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.890 
the whole thing eventually goes forward
seeing<00:04:24.520> that<00:04:24.699> gives<00:04:24.940> locked<00:04:25.210> up<00:04:25.419> now<00:04:25.630> because

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
seeing that gives locked up now because

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.540 
seeing that gives locked up now because
both<00:04:26.199> these<00:04:26.380> will<00:04:26.590> have<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:27.010> same<00:04:27.220> amount<00:04:27.460> of

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
both these will have the same amount of

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.770 
both these will have the same amount of
grip<00:04:28.470> then<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:29.560> for<00:04:29.680> me<00:04:29.889> is<00:04:29.949> a<00:04:30.130> bit<00:04:30.370> wobbly<00:04:30.720> as<00:04:31.720> i

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
grip then it for me is a bit wobbly as i

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.450 
grip then it for me is a bit wobbly as i
say<00:04:32.110> more<00:04:32.470> weight<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:33.010> it'll<00:04:33.099> probably<00:04:33.310> work

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
say more weight and it'll probably work

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.330 
say more weight and it'll probably work
