 Goods as we want to sell my 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.740
 in order to be adopted and I think the customers have fun there as well 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.740

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.450
 who owns himself 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.560
 these 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.560
 this supplier summits also small 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.200
 pallet wise to buy that 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.350

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.680

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.600
 good reputation does not know anybody rarely get now he is back 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.680

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.860
 Well for him, of course, name Mike's the best that I like right here 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.349
 I own the business and I can work independently here 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.749
 and that is one too 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.580
 and a personal conversation gives something 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.829
 the supermarkets is not available 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:23.689
 and for a simple life Dr I tell the customers just know and 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.299
 and they also accompany them with their worries and sorrows and that's just what 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.129
 simple and drum package here with us what we want what I personally very much 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.450
 nice to find that one 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.450
 go every day 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.449
 overlook 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.069
 88 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:00.479
 People have to 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:04.609
 10 9 26 34 4 6 12 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.609
 17 49 Beat 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:09.429
 Kutcher 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:11.719
 the sanitation 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:15.799
 So this business or whoever the whole house owns us the way we do 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.539
 make sure that is also very costly certainly 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:23.480
 and that is simply great because we Dirk a great 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.170
 Rent to pay if you would say that would not be profitable
