00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.070
 rolling on the floor like a giant croquette 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.250
 we're going to take half an onion and the 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.530

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.660

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.360
 pan with a good jet of oil 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.190
 let's add a laurel leaf and 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.019
 let's let it be done a little bit like that 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.750
 that we miss a little and then 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.660
 we take it out to flavor the oil 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.079
 add the onion a little salt and 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.119
 we let you porsche slightly after 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.090
 half a glass of white wine we let 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.270
 reduce and add 200 grams of meat 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.670
 minced pork or ostrich 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.250
 If you want, we'll make a good 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.039
 meat and add a spoonful of tomato 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.860
 crushed we remove well that everything is 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.539
 incorporate to perfection and then 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.830
 oregano my god this oregano 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:29.920
 I have brought this oregano 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.780
 with the harvest but good a good 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.300
 sobrasada that has a way then something 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.110
 peculiar the spicy good works of 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.990
 mallorca we make four slices and for 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.360
 for God to take away what has been the 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.300
 edge not because if you're not going to freak out what 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.220
 On the other hand, roquefort cheese 100 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.500
 grams we say say slices like 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.119
 you have seen spread on some toast 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.800
 that we have already toasted 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:02:00.430
 the meat and we put two slices two 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.410
 spicy sobrasada slices on top 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.660
 Well together one thing about the other is that 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.820
 look good and then over a 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:11.410
 Roquefort until covering it completely 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:14.410
 preheated to the maximum 250 x 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.180
 250 and you let it go by doing this 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.300
 it depends on your oven but it's going 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.730
 to deign bubbles, look if I'm 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.550
 salivating as a layer is believed 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.739
 Toastita is ready to eat and to 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.880
 that you burst your arteries all 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.950
 It's like the Roquefort table and 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.300

 that the noses order salt and oil 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:48.020
 and it's so short this recipe is so short 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.870
 and it stays there in the michelÃ­n of 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:55.330
 You already understand me, not very well 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.330
