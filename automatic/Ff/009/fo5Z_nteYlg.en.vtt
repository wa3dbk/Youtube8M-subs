 others are just pleased right now 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.489
 But for me that is already real 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.850
 bombastic and I'm really happy 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.620
 then let's start and there 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.809
 I want you first the logona 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.000
 lover earth to heart I have 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.780
 I recently bought and I think that 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.690
 really cool somehow everything gets really 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.059
 down and I always assume so 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.530
 a little bit of water was left in the package 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.010
 then fall and it swells up 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.989
 I then wear the coconut oil from bio 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.080
 planet just such a little spoon 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.360
 and then to rat my skin with it 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.430
 gay and I must say I have 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.100
 that is very well maintained it comes a lot 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.600
 others down and you have to 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.110
 after that, I can not get what is 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.939
 very cool and you have but also 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.619

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.689

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.780
 skin sticks I hate it all over 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.100
 yes and therefore prefer one 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.439

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.700
 very well together and next 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:36.090
 I want you to gel that aloe vera 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:41.369
 cream we show you from the pharmacy 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.620

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.530

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.990
 lipstick from mac that's the color 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.610
 store looks is a matte finish and is 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.590
 in orange red is also very nice 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.080
 I drive on my notebook if you like 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.090
 she wants to see applied and 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.210
 also holds a very long-winded and 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.070
 you eat and it has held 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:47.690
 about 70 hours in each case 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:49.340
 after that went off and then next 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.140
 I still have a pen that is the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.790
 color heartbreaker is also once 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.209
 Finnish and that is to speak 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.800
 now also on the lips and me 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.459
 also somehow reminds me so 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.780
 A flower meadow is a bright pink 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:07.130
 ecoroute somehow and me very nice there 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.890
 I was in my closet for two years 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:14.600
 and ne I have not worn it but 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.209
 this year I find him in the class 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.200
 and I think that's really good 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.060
 despite the smartphones has a very 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.240
 creamy consistency and if you have it 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.460
 really a long time 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.200
 Half an hour would have been very good too 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.630
 so if you are not right now 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.280
 order what drinks now the one needs 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.810
 little bit around 110 so everything with 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.400
 lipsticks i need around 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.750
 But then collect and keep 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.700
 it also costs six to seven 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.640
 euro and I think is really a great 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.970
 Price for the quality and is also very 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.220
 well pigmented I think then I have 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.050
 again from victory a place for 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.150
 I discovered again there was something 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.340
 longer in over mintal in the drawer 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.180
 is making pietsch he knows and is 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.590
 an orange choral I really earls 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.880
 really nice in this too 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.810
 flowery film summer and I like it very much 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.550
 very nice and next 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.020
 I also already higher here theirs 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.960
 leave the palette for me 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.910
 beautiful pink tones are so out of this one 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.740
 pink or that is something 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.549
 darker unsaid for a walk or 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.640
 i here such a dodgy russa and 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.049
 I also like these berry tones here 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.700
 I think that's pretty and pretty and 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.120
 suits me very much for this spring 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.130
 Well 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.840
 the only thing that puts me at this 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.790
 old is the donation not quite so 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.720
 good in my opinion but for the 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.250
 everyday life is completely sufficient without can 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.500
 I also recommend a nice one 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:45.590
 palette but who a little stronger mac off 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:48.720
 before that should not access it 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.430
 And finally I have these 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.000
 I am here for you 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.610
 ordered that are carriers of kimi costs 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.710
 But 70 euro is real leather and me 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.470
 love this school about everything because I 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.820
 am 176 relatively tall and my friend is 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.760
 the same size as me and it always like this 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.200
 a bit difficult and I love the 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.990
 I think I'm kind of chic too 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.030
 suitable for any occasion for the 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.800
 work or a cocktail in the evening 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.610
 I also think it's great to go drinking 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.040
 beautiful 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.970
 suitable for succumbing or 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.890
 the jeans and yes me and that was it too 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.280
