00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
especially when they were raw and we

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.410 
especially when they were raw and we
should<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.860> raw<00:03:02.160> produce<00:03:02.550> this<00:03:02.910> is<00:03:03.060> we're

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
should have raw produce this is we're

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.390 
should have raw produce this is we're
the<00:03:03.510> only<00:03:03.720> creatures<00:03:04.440> in<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.770> world<00:03:05.100> that

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
the only creatures in the world that

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.100 
the only creatures in the world that
cook<00:03:05.550> our<00:03:05.700> food<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.480> don't<00:03:06.660> see<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.810> gorilla

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
cook our food you don't see a gorilla

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.840 
cook our food you don't see a gorilla
with<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.320> barbecue<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:07.890> know<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:08.430> we<00:03:08.580> need

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
with a barbecue you know and so we need

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.570 
with a barbecue you know and so we need
raw<00:03:09.090> produce<00:03:09.540> but<00:03:10.080> raw<00:03:10.290> broccoli<00:03:10.560> no<00:03:11.220> raw

raw produce but raw broccoli no raw
Brussels<00:03:12.030> sprouts<00:03:12.390> no<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.740> I<00:03:13.800> thought<00:03:14.130> you

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
Brussels sprouts no so I thought you

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.110 
Brussels sprouts no so I thought you
know<00:03:14.310> what<00:03:14.520> if<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:15.090> can't<00:03:15.390> eat<00:03:15.660> them<00:03:17.000> what<00:03:18.000> can

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
know what if I can't eat them what can

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.460 
know what if I can't eat them what can
you<00:03:18.209> do<00:03:18.330> with<00:03:18.420> them<00:03:18.510> then<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:18.690> found<00:03:18.900> out<00:03:19.050> every

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
you do with them then I found out every

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.410 
you do with them then I found out every
single<00:03:19.650> fruit<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.040> vegetable<00:03:20.430> has<00:03:20.580> over<00:03:20.880> 80%

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
single fruit and vegetable has over 80%

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.830 
single fruit and vegetable has over 80%
pure<00:03:22.290> organic<00:03:22.590> liquid<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.910> it's<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.330> liquid

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
pure organic liquid and it's the liquid

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.070 
pure organic liquid and it's the liquid
contained<00:03:25.470> has<00:03:26.130> 95%<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.420> all<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.660> nutrients

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
contained has 95% of all the nutrients

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.290 
contained has 95% of all the nutrients
so<00:03:28.590> if<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:28.830> can<00:03:29.010> extract<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.519> juice<00:03:29.550> contain

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
so if I can extract the juice contain

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.270 
so if I can extract the juice contain
within<00:03:30.540> surely<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.260> can<00:03:31.380> make<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.620> nice<00:03:31.860> drink

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
within surely I can make a nice drink

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.850 
within surely I can make a nice drink
and<00:03:32.580> I<00:03:33.000> can<00:03:33.150> drink<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.870> instead<00:03:34.350> of<00:03:34.410> eat<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.800> and

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860
