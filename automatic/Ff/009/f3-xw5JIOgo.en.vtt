00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.640
 On asphalt 8 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:09.130
 Come on online using Bolt 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.300
 I will go me no matter doing 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.300
 First is the course to choose 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.860
 Maybe I will be in Tokyo 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.900
 A little bit 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.900
 Tokyo 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:32.040
 It Since the sunny course is usually of the circuit course of fine weather will be in the configuration of the 1 lap 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.600
 Standing 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.600
 Come on bolt today 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.079
 Now at the bolt 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.079
 I mean Do shortest course if I say 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.680
 I will try to run a course that feels good 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.390
 For the time being, I will aim for 1st place 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:05.149
 Because it is in real condition 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.149
 I think the kana Let's run to some extent appropriate 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.930
 than is beyond the pledge status 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.870
 Take the middle 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.130
 I will go here g 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:28.289
 Let's be careful as we will have children 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.289
 I'm gonna slide this but 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.740
 It's a bit depressed but Japan 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.740
 To have taken the auger 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.980
 The middle Oite 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.980
 I'm definitely going to flat Spain here 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.670
 Why is it perfect nitro 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.970
 The left side of the tunnel Ya 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.630
 In this tunnel 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.620
 Because it cuts off with nitration 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:05.250
 Take one drift after taking this 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.880
 Do not put so much year deeply drift 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.880
 Do not go down 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.920
 Masu Tei 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:26.560
 You have the most to enter from here, you do not go straight that person 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.560
 I like this kind of logo . 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.110
 Oh taking now the 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.140
 I think that the way you run will change again if you are back in 1 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.610
 Like 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.330
 It is he this do 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.330
 9 consecutive who 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.250
 Here was perfect nitro 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.250
 At the exit at the flat spin 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.970
 And here also on Parfait Street 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.430
 In we'd have here banquet 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.690
 When I get here, I see it and slip 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.480
 Let's be careful 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.920
 It looks like Tokyo 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.810
 Also, because I think let's raise the duck order next and that other courses 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.489
 Thanking you in advance 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.489
 Thank you for watching
