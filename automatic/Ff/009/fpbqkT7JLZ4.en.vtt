00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.460
 Welcome to the post vegan 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.289
 I have a nice product again 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.109
 for you what you want to show and that 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.390
 The point as clean that's there 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.769
 Definitely buying a market and I believe 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:32.510
 Anyway, you can use it anyway 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.280
 Super delicious ice cream place and create the 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.230
 Packing instructions are a little inaccurate and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.540
 That's why I would like to do it 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.899
 show what you have left for it 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.930
 500 grams of fruit needed and no matter 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.670
 which fruits and I think should be there 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.170
 it actually already differ because 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.550
 some fruits are like them 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.280
 are so cute that is together with the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.109
 fruit ice cream magic would simply result 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.850
 which would be just too sweet for 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.620
 for example, if you pick fruits 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.480
 take what a little sugar on it 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.729
 then it would not be more 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.640
 edible or melon, for example 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.740
 and again there are some early ones 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.740
 help him so angry that he now 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.860
 can not compensate for example 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.590
 johannisbeeren 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.610
 I even have a little sugar there 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.860
 That's why I wanted mine 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.320
 show small small variation like her 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.180
 but can easily compensate 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.070
 First of all I give the fruits in now 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.060
 my mixa you can, too 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.490
 live a blender 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.369
 I think so with the mixer but 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:41.159
 not so bad i got out of here 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.500
 glass 200 grams I think I have 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.880
 drain and then have 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.610
 I still have a few epcam 200 km 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.640
 and then something comes so jurt to if 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.610
 you just wanted to take blogger then then 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.729
 I would recommend about 350 grams 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.509
 to take bloggers and 150 milliliters 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.310
 yogurt gang in the case namely the app 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.350
 taken from now I take what 100 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.910
 gram apple, for example, would be a ford 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.690
 which the circle really has 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.760
 works there I find the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.220
 actually exactly right and here must 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.890
 we just so good with that 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:24.260
 From then on, the magic of ice comes to it now 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:31.220
 It will last for about three minutes 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:34.430
 then you either need one 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:39.650
 bowl or any closes bares 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.860
 Vessel and there you get your ice cream 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:48.680
 we'll see you there too 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.170
 Frozen in front very very creamy and that 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.030
 now comes at least six hours 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:03:01.940
 or just overnight in the 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:04.460
 freezer one man that was now too 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:11.270
 About half a day , let's see 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:13.720
 what it looks like from the color 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:18.110
 it is in any case again, great 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:21.220
 let's see the consistency is like 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.220
 she is wonderfully creamy 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.400
 and also it is not so tasty 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.500
 sweet and not too sour 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.620
 you can do it a bit at home 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.760
 We like to experiment and we can experiment 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.680
 write in the comments 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.709
 what you have tried which 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.890
 used ratio and with 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.410
 the whole thing has become in the sense 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.069
 Have fun experimenting 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.069
 the next time
