00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:09.570
 good evening to the day today 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.790
 to make a sweet cheesecake 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.450
 Nutella 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:18.300
 we have pan-star cookies 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:21.600
 dry mascarpone biscuits from 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.090
 sugar hazelnuts butter la 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.490
 philadelphia and the model 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.470
 this is the sweet process 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:42.809
 now we believe cookies 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:45.030
 I help myself this way by doing with 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.750
 a bottle to marry even the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.750
 rolling pin 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:57.300
 Now let's do the same procedure 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:01.430
 with these we start a little but these 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.430
 are the hazelnuts that now 3d 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:20.310
 these are the cookies already delayed 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:28.430
 now we put the chopped hazelnuts and 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:28.430
 melted butter and turn 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:44.650
 this is the 26cm pan that 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.400
 I put some baking paper open 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:59.140
 now we put the compound in a hinge 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:02:06.630
 inside we count so to adjust with i 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.630
 mali testing it so it is compact 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.330
 we put it in the fridge for half an hour 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.480
 this is the mascarpone we put ed 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.480
 let's adjust with the sugar 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.980
 now let's add the cheese 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.920
 fresh 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.920
 in this case I put the temple stack 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:57.019
 now let's put 300 g of nutella 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.459
 let's give the balance here 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.689
 now we clean the blackboard 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:40.260
 now let's put the cream we turn it 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:51.570
 in this way gently down towards 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:54.420
 up this is the base we already have 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.320
 prepared those cookies 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.320
 let's put the mixture together 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:17.820
 now we fix it now we put it 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.450
 in the fridge for 2 hours and is ready to 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.450
 to eat
