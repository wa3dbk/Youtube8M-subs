right

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.110 
right
there<00:03:51.170> you<00:03:51.680> want<00:03:51.890> to<00:03:51.980> come<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.490> the<00:03:52.610> front<00:03:52.910> here

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
there you want to come to the front here

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.900 
there you want to come to the front here
tank<00:03:53.860> and<00:03:54.860> you<00:03:54.980> want<00:03:55.130> to<00:03:55.220> get<00:03:55.340> your<00:03:55.490> green<00:03:55.670> wall

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
tank and you want to get your green wall

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.890 
tank and you want to get your green wall
at<00:03:56.210> already<00:03:57.580> and<00:03:58.580> then<00:03:58.940> from<00:03:59.270> here<00:03:59.300> you<00:03:59.720> want

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
at already and then from here you want

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.220 
at already and then from here you want
to<00:04:00.020> go<00:04:00.140> to<00:04:00.860> green<00:04:01.220> there<00:04:01.490> and<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:02.480> green<00:04:03.790> there

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
to go to green there and to green there

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.620 
to go to green there and to green there
there<00:04:06.230> even<00:04:06.710> and<00:04:06.920> then<00:04:07.760> fill<00:04:08.030> in<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.210> bottom

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
there even and then fill in the bottom

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.620 
there even and then fill in the bottom
so<00:04:09.620> you<00:04:09.680> should<00:04:09.920> have<00:04:10.100> a<00:04:10.390> something<00:04:11.390> that

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
so you should have a something that

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.160 
so you should have a something that
looks<00:04:11.870> similar<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.320> that<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:14.720> want<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:14.990> come

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
looks similar to that you want to come

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.490 
looks similar to that you want to come
back<00:04:15.380> all<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:16.070> way<00:04:16.220> until<00:04:16.720> this<00:04:17.720> block<00:04:18.050> here

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
back all the way until this block here

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.400 
back all the way until this block here
note<00:04:19.190> this<00:04:19.489> block<00:04:19.730> here<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.020> same<00:04:21.230> with

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
note this block here and the same with

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:31.360 
note this block here and the same with
the<00:04:21.470> other<00:04:21.620> side<00:04:25.960> so<00:04:26.960> that's<00:04:27.200> that<00:04:29.650> right<00:04:30.650> so

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
the other side so that's that right so

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.910 
the other side so that's that right so
these<00:04:32.120> will<00:04:32.360> be<00:04:32.390> your<00:04:32.690> light<00:04:32.960> so<00:04:33.350> if<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:33.650> get

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
these will be your light so if you get

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.060 
these will be your light so if you get
some<00:04:35.110> levers<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.440> place<00:04:36.920> them<00:04:37.220> there<00:04:39.070> making

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
some levers and place them there making

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.660 
some levers and place them there making
sure<00:04:40.280> they're<00:04:40.490> on<00:04:40.670> and<00:04:40.940> placing<00:04:41.480> them<00:04:42.670> you

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
sure they're on and placing them you

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.570 
sure they're on and placing them you
place<00:04:43.940> a<00:04:43.970> block<00:04:44.350> lamp<00:04:45.350> on<00:04:45.620> top<00:04:45.890> this<00:04:46.190> is<00:04:46.370> for

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
place a block lamp on top this is for

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.720 
place a block lamp on top this is for
the<00:04:46.700> lights<00:04:46.940> of<00:04:47.270> your<00:04:47.680> tank<00:04:48.680> and<00:04:48.950> then<00:04:49.040> filters

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
the lights of your tank and then filters

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.460 
the lights of your tank and then filters
send<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.120> bits<00:04:50.330> in<00:04:50.570> so<00:04:50.900> it<00:04:50.990> should<00:04:51.230> look<00:04:51.260> like

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
send a bits in so it should look like

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.860 
send a bits in so it should look like
that<00:04:51.860> at<00:04:52.010> the<00:04:52.160> front<00:04:52.310> so<00:04:52.730> far<00:04:53.000> I<00:04:55.660> Linda's<00:04:56.660> to

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
that at the front so far I Linda's to

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.150 
that at the front so far I Linda's to
fill<00:04:57.320> in<00:04:57.470> the<00:04:57.620> bottom<00:04:59.140> because<00:05:00.140> this<00:05:00.380> sir<00:05:00.620> all

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
fill in the bottom because this sir all

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:08.920 
fill in the bottom because this sir all
needs<00:05:01.430> to<00:05:01.490> be<00:05:01.550> filled<00:05:01.910> in<00:05:02.560> like<00:05:03.560> so<00:05:07.630> right<00:05:08.630> and

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
needs to be filled in like so right and

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.220 
needs to be filled in like so right and
the<00:05:09.410> next<00:05:09.620> row<00:05:10.180> start<00:05:11.180> from<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.510> back<00:05:11.810> you

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
the next row start from the back you

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.550 
the next row start from the back you
want<00:05:12.410> to<00:05:12.530> go<00:05:12.650> all<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.430> way<00:05:13.460> across<00:05:13.760> but<00:05:14.290> on<00:05:15.290> the

second block in you want to come out one

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:24.700 
second block in you want to come out one
oversight<00:05:19.420> like<00:05:20.420> that<00:05:21.040> then<00:05:22.040> on<00:05:22.430> this<00:05:23.710> fill

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
oversight like that then on this fill

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.640 
oversight like that then on this fill
this<00:05:24.890> bit<00:05:25.130> in<00:05:25.250> as<00:05:25.400> well

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650

I cry that's
in<00:05:35.960> brilliant<00:05:38.260> OOP

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
in brilliant OOP

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.070 
in brilliant OOP
all<00:05:40.550> right<00:05:40.670> so<00:05:40.970> you<00:05:41.060> want<00:05:41.210> to<00:05:41.300> count<00:05:41.510> one<00:05:41.780> block

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
all right so you want to count one block

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.340 
all right so you want to count one block
away<00:05:42.110> from<00:05:42.410> here<00:05:42.650> and<00:05:43.300> then<00:05:44.300> put<00:05:44.600> a<00:05:44.630> row<00:05:45.020> of

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
away from here and then put a row of

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.490 
away from here and then put a row of
four<00:05:46.040> blocks<00:05:46.370> here<00:05:46.730> so<00:05:46.760> it<00:05:47.240> ties<00:05:47.510> him<00:05:47.780> with<00:05:48.170> the

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
four blocks here so it ties him with the

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.040 
four blocks here so it ties him with the
bit<00:05:48.680> sticking<00:05:49.070> out<00:05:49.370> is<00:05:50.060> where<00:05:50.420> you<00:05:50.570> want<00:05:50.750> it<00:05:50.870> to

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
bit sticking out is where you want it to

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.250 
bit sticking out is where you want it to
end<00:05:51.700> all<00:05:52.700> right<00:05:52.910> from<00:05:53.270> there<00:05:53.630> you<00:05:53.990> want<00:05:54.170> to

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
end all right from there you want to

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.550 
end all right from there you want to
count<00:05:54.530> free<00:05:54.890> blocks<00:05:55.190> forward<00:05:55.670> one<00:05:56.360> two<00:05:56.720> three

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
count free blocks forward one two three

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.640 
count free blocks forward one two three
and<00:05:58.190> same<00:05:59.120> on<00:05:59.240> the<00:05:59.330> other<00:05:59.360> side<00:05:59.780> so<00:06:00.170> less<00:06:00.320> free

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
and same on the other side so less free

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.970 
and same on the other side so less free
blocks<00:06:00.980> there<00:06:01.400> and<00:06:02.260> then<00:06:03.260> two<00:06:03.500> blocks<00:06:03.770> at<00:06:03.950> the

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
blocks there and then two blocks at the

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:04.840 
blocks there and then two blocks at the
front<00:06:04.280> like<00:06:04.520> that

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
front like that

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
then put a two blocks diagonal so that

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.670 
then put a two blocks diagonal so that
would<00:06:34.550> be<00:06:34.700> like<00:06:34.970> the<00:06:35.150> start<00:06:35.480> of<00:06:35.720> your<00:06:36.260> actual

would be like the start of your actual
gun<00:06:37.930> so<00:06:38.930> from<00:06:39.200> here<00:06:39.440> take<00:06:39.950> out<00:06:40.160> that<00:06:40.370> block<00:06:40.730> two

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.760 
gun so from here take out that block two

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.410 
gun so from here take out that block two
three<00:06:44.290> four<00:06:45.290> and<00:06:45.620> then<00:06:46.370> under<00:06:46.730> he'd<00:06:46.970> want<00:06:47.390> to

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
three four and then under he'd want to

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.210 
three four and then under he'd want to
fill<00:06:47.630> in<00:06:47.780> the<00:06:47.900> remainder<00:06:48.230> two<00:06:48.530> blocks<00:06:48.860> so<00:06:49.190> that

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:49.220 
fill in the remainder two blocks so that

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.880 
fill in the remainder two blocks so that
is<00:06:49.610> basically<00:06:49.940> the<00:06:50.630> back<00:06:51.350> of<00:06:51.530> your<00:06:51.620> tank
