and they have survived until now and I

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.330 
and they have survived until now and I
think<00:03:42.090> find<00:03:42.630> it<00:03:42.780> tragic<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.710> they<00:03:43.920> could<00:03:44.160> be

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
think find it tragic that they could be

00:03:44.340 --> 00:04:28.150 
think find it tragic that they could be
endangered<00:03:45.120> by<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.840> indifference<00:03:46.530> for<00:03:46.770> shoes

obviously if you take so many eggs and
the<00:04:33.330> chances<00:04:33.840> of<00:04:33.870> legs<00:04:34.200> surviving<00:04:35.040> to<00:04:35.250> become
