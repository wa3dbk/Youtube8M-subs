00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 What is missing in this city that is missing 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.400
 to this department there are 5 mega works that 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.240
 They are planned by the government 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.760
 they want to know 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.410
 peace was the epicenter for many 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.539
 years of activities not only 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.669
 also economic policies and 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.230
 development however with the passing of 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:23.300
 time the population left this 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.730
 department in search of better days and 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.439
 of ventures and that is to host the 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.400
 government what initially helped 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.960
 great way 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.870
 it would also happen later on 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.370
 invoice strikes strikes complications 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.710
 daily sometimes for various sectors 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.059
 productive the results of the census of 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.949
 population and housing cringe to 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.800
 different regional authorities and it's 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.330
 that peace was not the first with this 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.640
 panorama is time to consider 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.320
 clear and concrete measures megaprojects 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.269
 so that development does not stop at 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.940
 peace and the department have a greater 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.350
 growth the government makes a new 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.589
 challenge and one of the first proposals 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.180
 it has to do with a bullet train not for 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.610
 the big cities but for the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.080
 department what does this mean this 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.610
 high speed train that we are 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.409
 proposing has the objective of 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.650
 integrate the department from the 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.840
 southern end of peace that is charaÃ±a 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.380
 going through patacamaya the high 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.439
 and now it's reaching polo and up 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.799
 ixiamas the goal is to get up 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.490
 port hit and connect us at the end 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.229
 north with the interoceanic highway 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.209
 this project wants to unite the altiplano 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.909
 south of peace with ixe plus the region 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:33.679
 north the 'bullet train' we remember is a 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.450
 Massive means of transport that allows 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.189
 reach speeds higher than 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.509
 200 kilometers per hour 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.000
 competing in some way with the 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.899
 planes but the project will be a dream or 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.750
 can come true is not very cheap 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.819
 it costs many millions of millions of 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.819
 dollars and construction time 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:55.280
 It must not be too fast, either. 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.500
 I'm sure it's that we have the 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.929
 conditions to do it I think of 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.629
 the whole society has to unite 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.399
 so that this can work and in some 

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:06.879
 given moment in the shortest possible time 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.810
 I mean in less than a decade 

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:13.210
 we should have a 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.730
 the realization of a project like this 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.670
 plus 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.360
 it's very expensive no no I would not dare to 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.980
 say we have an idea very roughly 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.200
 but it would be irresponsible on my part in 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.730
 this moment to say it when the 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.500
 studies we are going to have a 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.040
 much more accurate knowledge when 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.470
 start do not look today we have just 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.080
 started with this not today practically 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.730
 from the launch but it 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.760
 warns of four other megaprojects 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.739
 more for peace let's know a little about 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.659
 growth will lead us to boost the 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.239
 strengthening of the so-called cities 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.190
 intermediate and more even if it seems 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.110
 far will be the city of the future will 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.819
 ensures and expects the construction of 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.190
 a university citadel and the 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.900
 migration of entrepreneurs on the other hand 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.420
 the construction of a plant is expected 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.510
 foundry since peace is the third 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.129
 department in mineral production 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.980
 it is also anticipated that there is utaka a 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.950
 flagstone near altiplÃ¡nica region a 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.489
 industrialization center first for 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.810
 assemble tractors in three stages 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.370
 it is also expected that the four 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.560
 state enterprises that are in 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.569
 peace be moved to this region 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.140
 who is here with an investment of one hundred 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:29.820
 5 million dollars equipment that the 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.260
 computer assembler one 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:37.360
 fiber producers and processors 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.880
 of camelids and productive centers and 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.030
 of support to producers in 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.480
 metalworking mother and leathers 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.300
 there are more than 5 projects apparently 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.920
 We remove for 5 yes but but as not for 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.260
 course but there are different 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.020
 clear span the 'bullet train' can 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.780
 be a great project because you can 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.790
 integrate the southern highlands with ixiamas 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.150
 where is the future that can integrate 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.220
 what is northern La Paz where there is a 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.460
 great agricultural vocation and there are great 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.590
 possibilities besides livestock her 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.170
 mother kelly ki-moon and can you give us the 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.750
 heavy oil and there would be a refinery 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.060
 to treat this oil with that the 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.470
 Peace department easily 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.030
 would become number one in the 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.030
 economy is in san buenaventura
