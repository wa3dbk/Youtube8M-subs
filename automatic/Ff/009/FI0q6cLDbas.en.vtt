placing<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.540> distributor<00:00:13.050> cap<00:00:14.719> and<00:00:15.719> as<00:00:15.990> you

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
placing the distributor cap and as you

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.420 
placing the distributor cap and as you
can<00:00:16.170> see<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.350> have<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.560> old<00:00:16.740> one<00:00:16.920> off<00:00:17.130> there's

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
can see I have the old one off there's

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.490 
can see I have the old one off there's
the<00:00:17.490> old<00:00:17.730> one<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.450> cap<00:00:18.720> just<00:00:18.990> comes<00:00:19.170> off<00:00:19.320> of

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
the old one that cap just comes off of

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.520 
the old one that cap just comes off of
there

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.530 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.430 

there's<00:00:23.070> three<00:00:23.370> screws<00:00:23.640> there's<00:00:23.820> one<00:00:24.030> there

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
there's three screws there's one there

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.710 
there's three screws there's one there
there's<00:00:25.440> one<00:00:25.650> there<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.540> there's<00:00:27.540> one<00:00:27.600> there

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
there's one there and there's one there

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.450 
there's one there and there's one there
so<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.230> take<00:00:28.410> those<00:00:28.529> three<00:00:28.800> off<00:00:28.950> and<00:00:29.310> this

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
so you take those three off and this

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.990 
so you take those three off and this
just<00:00:29.790> slides<00:00:30.090> off<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:31.369> then<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
just slides off and then this is the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.920 
just slides off and then this is the
coil<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.430> used<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> sit<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.090> there

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
coil that used to sit in there

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.750 
coil that used to sit in there
and<00:00:38.210> this<00:00:39.210> comes<00:00:39.840> out<00:00:40.050> there<00:00:40.410> are<00:00:40.590> one<00:00:41.430> two

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and this comes out there are one two

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.000 
and this comes out there are one two
three<00:00:42.030> four<00:00:43.850> corresponding<00:00:45.470> one<00:00:46.580> two<00:00:47.580> three

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
three four corresponding one two three

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.549 
three four corresponding one two three
four<00:00:50.269> and<00:00:51.269> these<00:00:51.629> two<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:52.080> grounds

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
four and these two have grounds

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.010 
four and these two have grounds
connected<00:00:52.980> tool<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:54.059> just<00:00:54.300> make<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.540> note<00:00:54.809> of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
connected tool so just make a note of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.490 
connected tool so just make a note of
which<00:00:55.829> one<00:00:56.010> goes<00:00:56.280> where<00:00:56.340> there's<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.500> black

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
which one goes where there's a black

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.880 
which one goes where there's a black
wire<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.800> comes<00:00:59.219> down<00:00:59.460> into<00:00:59.610> the<00:00:59.820> middle<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
wire that comes down into the middle and

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.709 
wire that comes down into the middle and
there's<00:01:01.890> another<00:01:02.129> black<00:01:02.510> ground<00:01:03.510> I'm

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
there's another black ground I'm

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.960 
there's another black ground I'm
assuming<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.259> goes<00:01:04.410> into<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.979> actual<00:01:05.250> coil

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
assuming that goes into the actual coil

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.639 
assuming that goes into the actual coil
itself<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:07.590> then<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.979> red<00:01:08.280> one<00:01:09.590> there's<00:01:10.590> a

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
itself and then this red one there's a

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.540 
itself and then this red one there's a
red<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.360> yellow<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.899> these<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:14.070> push<00:01:14.340> out

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
red a yellow and these just push out

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.120 
red a yellow and these just push out
from<00:01:14.850> underneath<00:01:15.600> here<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.320> take<00:01:16.619> your

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
from underneath here you just take your

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.400 
from underneath here you just take your
finger<00:01:17.399> and<00:01:17.430> they<00:01:17.970> come<00:01:18.780> up<00:01:18.899> out<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.110> there

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
finger and they come up out of there

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.830 
finger and they come up out of there
while<00:01:19.649> they<00:01:19.800> were<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.280> there<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.940> just<00:01:21.539> pull<00:01:21.780> it

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
while they were in there I just pull it

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.770 
while they were in there I just pull it
up<00:01:21.869> out<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.170> there<00:01:23.060> just<00:01:24.060> push<00:01:24.360> them<00:01:24.450> back<00:01:24.600> down

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
up out of there just push them back down

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.560 
up out of there just push them back down
in<00:01:24.930> there<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.649> makes<00:01:25.830> any<00:01:26.009> sense<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.570> numbered

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
in there that makes any sense I numbered

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.370 
in there that makes any sense I numbered
as<00:01:28.470> best<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.430> could

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
as best I could

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.770 
as best I could
the<00:01:31.820> plug<00:01:32.820> wires<00:01:33.030> before<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.570> took<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.930> out<00:01:35.780> see

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the plug wires before I took it out see

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.810 
the plug wires before I took it out see
if<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.930> can<00:01:37.140> show<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.400> barely<00:01:38.580> see

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
if I can show you so you can barely see

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.310 
if I can show you so you can barely see
the<00:01:39.000> pen<00:01:39.180> doesn't<00:01:39.360> throw<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.020> number<00:01:40.290> them

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the pen doesn't throw but I number them

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.310 
the pen doesn't throw but I number them
not<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.580> firing<00:01:42.150> order<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:42.869> anything<00:01:43.049> like

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
not in firing order or anything like

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.289 
not in firing order or anything like
that<00:01:43.610> just<00:01:45.259> corresponding<00:01:47.030> where<00:01:48.030> they<00:01:48.240> were

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
that just corresponding where they were

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.660 
that just corresponding where they were
on<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> old<00:01:48.930> one<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:50.009> know<00:01:50.159> where<00:01:50.400> they<00:01:50.580> have

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
on the old one to know where they have

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.100 
on the old one to know where they have
to<00:01:50.790> go<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.659> new<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.670> you<00:01:53.670> know

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
to go on the new one so I just you know

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.410 
to go on the new one so I just you know
one<00:01:55.110> two<00:01:55.350> three<00:01:55.710> four<00:01:55.950> five<00:01:56.220> six<00:01:56.490> seven<00:01:56.790> eight

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
one two three four five six seven eight

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.840 
one two three four five six seven eight
and<00:01:57.509> then<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.350> labeled<00:01:58.740> before<00:01:59.400> I<00:01:59.430> took<00:01:59.729> them

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
and then I labeled before I took them

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.740 
and then I labeled before I took them
off<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.150> old<00:02:00.270> one<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:01.430> labeled<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:03.329> spark<00:02:03.600> plug

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
off the old one I labeled the spark plug

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.319 
off the old one I labeled the spark plug
wires<00:02:03.960> themselves<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.759> just<00:02:05.759> use<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> stock

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
wires themselves I just use the stock

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.350 
wires themselves I just use the stock
rotor<00:02:06.659> bushing<00:02:07.110> which<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.409> black<00:02:08.269> because<00:02:09.269> I

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
rotor bushing which is black because I

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.089 
rotor bushing which is black because I
do<00:02:09.420> not<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.929> high-performance

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.089 

see<00:02:15.730> as<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:15.909> can<00:02:16.060> see<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.390> stock<00:02:16.689> one<00:02:17.099> is

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
see as you can see the stock one is

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.259 
see as you can see the stock one is
black<00:02:19.469> they<00:02:20.469> MSD<00:02:21.219> supplies<00:02:21.549> a<00:02:21.579> new<00:02:21.790> one<00:02:21.969> so<00:02:22.180> I

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
black they MSD supplies a new one so I

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.259 
black they MSD supplies a new one so I
choose<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.719> stock<00:02:24.299> as<00:02:25.439> they<00:02:26.439> say<00:02:26.680> in<00:02:26.890> here

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
choose the stock as they say in here

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:38.210 
choose the stock as they say in here
roller<00:02:28.269> bushing<00:02:31.349> see<00:02:32.349> how<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.890> goes

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.150 

stocke<00:02:39.220> one<00:02:39.490> has<00:02:40.150> high<00:02:40.450> resistance<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:42.130> you

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
stocke one has high resistance so you

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.480 
stocke one has high resistance so you
don't<00:02:42.550> get<00:02:42.730> radio<00:02:43.060> interference<00:02:44.340> all<00:02:45.340> right

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
don't get radio interference all right

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.090 
don't get radio interference all right
so<00:02:45.670> now<00:02:45.790> I'm<00:02:45.880> just<00:02:45.970> going<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.180> put<00:02:46.360> that<00:02:47.100> back

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
so now I'm just going to put that back

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:58.309 
so now I'm just going to put that back
