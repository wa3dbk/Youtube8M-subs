00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
a lithium battery and some wire cutters

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.360 
a lithium battery and some wire cutters
pliers<00:00:32.509> and<00:00:32.930> I<00:00:33.290> have<00:00:33.379> a<00:00:33.440> film<00:00:33.710> canister<00:00:33.950> for

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
pliers and I have a film canister for

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.639 
pliers and I have a film canister for
short<00:00:34.760> storage<00:00:36.489> of<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:37.670> lithium<00:00:37.999> corrodes

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
short storage of the lithium corrodes

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.939 
short storage of the lithium corrodes
pretty<00:00:39.649> fast<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.339> air<00:00:40.719> so<00:00:41.719> you<00:00:42.649> want<00:00:42.800> to<00:00:42.859> get

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
pretty fast and air so you want to get

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.040 
pretty fast and air so you want to get
it<00:00:43.070> sealed<00:00:43.309> up<00:00:43.519> nice<00:00:43.789> but<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.629> film<00:00:44.870> canister

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
it sealed up nice but the film canister

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.649 
it sealed up nice but the film canister
I<00:00:45.289> mean<00:00:45.620> it<00:00:45.890> kind<00:00:46.280> of<00:00:46.339> works<00:00:46.519> but<00:00:46.789> it's<00:00:47.359> not

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
I mean it kind of works but it's not

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:49.840 
I mean it kind of works but it's not
going<00:00:47.749> to<00:00:47.839> last<00:00:47.929> long<00:00:48.079> in<00:00:48.289> there<00:00:48.640> we<00:00:49.640> want<00:00:49.730> to

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
going to last long in there we want to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.329 
going to last long in there we want to
start<00:00:50.059> off<00:00:50.179> by<00:00:50.210> taking<00:00:50.510> this<00:00:50.809> top<00:00:51.350> end<00:00:51.710> cap<00:00:52.129> off

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
start off by taking this top end cap off

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.630 
start off by taking this top end cap off
the<00:00:52.789> positive<00:00:53.239> side<00:00:54.010> so<00:00:55.010> I<00:00:55.039> just<00:00:55.249> kind<00:00:55.429> of<00:00:55.460> get

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
the positive side so I just kind of get

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.430 
the positive side so I just kind of get
it<00:00:55.730> with<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:55.969> wire<00:00:56.089> cutters<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:56.659> kind<00:00:56.870> of

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
it with the wire cutters and kind of

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.660 
it with the wire cutters and kind of
pull<00:00:57.739> on<00:00:57.769> it<00:00:58.129> and<00:01:00.159> didn't<00:01:01.159> work<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.460> first

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
pull on it and didn't work the first

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.500 
pull on it and didn't work the first
time<00:01:01.929> so<00:01:02.929> you<00:01:03.139> go<00:01:03.469> back<00:01:03.620> and<00:01:03.829> try<00:01:03.979> again<00:01:04.330> at<00:01:05.330> the

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
time so you go back and try again at the

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.290 
time so you go back and try again at the
other<00:01:05.630> side<00:01:05.900> and<00:01:06.880> there<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:07.940> go

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
other side and there you go

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.590 
other side and there you go
came<00:01:08.750> off<00:01:08.870> nice<00:01:09.049> and<00:01:09.079> easy<00:01:13.270> you<00:01:14.270> can<00:01:14.299> just

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
came off nice and easy you can just

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.380 
came off nice and easy you can just
discard<00:01:14.990> that<00:01:15.259> because<00:01:15.850> serves<00:01:16.850> no<00:01:17.119> purpose

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
discard that because serves no purpose

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.139 
discard that because serves no purpose
so<00:01:18.229> now<00:01:18.710> you<00:01:18.770> want<00:01:19.159> to<00:01:19.219> remove<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.969> outside

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
so now you want to remove the outside

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.980 
so now you want to remove the outside
plastic<00:01:21.880> or<00:01:22.880> if<00:01:23.149> you<00:01:23.360> don't<00:01:23.509> really<00:01:23.630> have<00:01:23.780> to

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
plastic or if you don't really have to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.510 
plastic or if you don't really have to
but<00:01:24.140> I<00:01:24.170> mean<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:24.380> can<00:01:24.500> remove<00:01:24.680> all<00:01:24.890> of<00:01:25.039> it<00:01:25.130> but

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
but I mean you can remove all of it but

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.490 
but I mean you can remove all of it but
you<00:01:26.509> mentally<00:01:26.899> want<00:01:27.079> to<00:01:27.140> take<00:01:27.289> off<00:01:27.469> the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
you mentally want to take off the

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.219 
you mentally want to take off the
outside<00:01:27.770> steel<00:01:28.700> casing<00:01:29.329> it's<00:01:29.899> going<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.170> be

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
outside steel casing it's going to be

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.959 
outside steel casing it's going to be
kind<00:01:30.409> of<00:01:30.469> tough<00:01:30.619> because<00:01:30.860> like<00:01:31.250> I<00:01:31.369> said<00:01:31.430> steel

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
kind of tough because like I said steel

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:34.209 
kind of tough because like I said steel
you<00:01:32.810> just<00:01:33.049> kind<00:01:33.229> of<00:01:33.289> peel<00:01:33.530> back<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.890> metal<00:01:34.070> a

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
you just kind of peel back the metal a

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.399 
you just kind of peel back the metal a
little<00:01:34.460> bit<00:01:34.670> time<00:01:35.030> but<00:01:35.869> one<00:01:35.990> thing<00:01:36.140> you<00:01:36.289> want

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
little bit time but one thing you want

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:37.899 
little bit time but one thing you want
to<00:01:36.500> make<00:01:36.590> sure<00:01:36.619> is<00:01:36.950> not<00:01:37.250> to<00:01:37.490> let<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.789> outside

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
to make sure is not to let the outside

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.480 
to make sure is not to let the outside
touch<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.810> middle<00:01:39.380> kind<00:01:40.009> of<00:01:40.100> looks<00:01:40.219> like<00:01:40.340> I'm

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
touch the middle kind of looks like I'm

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.190 
touch the middle kind of looks like I'm
doing<00:01:40.609> that<00:01:40.759> there<00:01:40.969> but<00:01:41.390> it<00:01:41.750> doesn't<00:01:42.109> because

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
doing that there but it doesn't because

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.450 
doing that there but it doesn't because
you'll<00:01:42.439> definitely<00:01:42.859> know<00:01:42.950> about<00:01:42.979> it<00:01:43.310> because

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
you'll definitely know about it because

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.120 
you'll definitely know about it because
it's<00:01:43.549> better<00:01:43.670> start<00:01:44.060> getting<00:01:44.119> real<00:01:44.390> hot<00:01:44.539> and

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
it's better start getting real hot and

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.190 
it's better start getting real hot and
you<00:01:46.130> either<00:01:46.219> have<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.549> try<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:46.909> you<00:01:47.240> know<00:01:47.840> kind

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
you either have to try to you know kind

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.419 
you either have to try to you know kind
of<00:01:48.229> peel<00:01:48.409> it<00:01:48.500> back<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.649> little<00:01:48.740> bit<00:01:48.890> more<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:49.280> it

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
of peel it back a little bit more so it

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.580 
of peel it back a little bit more so it
doesn't<00:01:49.759> explode<00:01:50.020> because<00:01:51.020> of<00:01:51.109> course<00:01:51.320> I'd<00:01:51.469> be

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
doesn't explode because of course I'd be

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.039 
doesn't explode because of course I'd be
a<00:01:51.619> bad<00:01:51.829> thing<00:01:51.859> or<00:01:52.310> just<00:01:52.909> get<00:01:53.810> rid<00:01:53.899> of<00:01:53.960> the

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
a bad thing or just get rid of the

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:55.719 
a bad thing or just get rid of the
battery<00:01:54.380> altogether<00:01:54.829> throw<00:01:55.399> it<00:01:55.490> out<00:01:55.549> in<00:01:55.640> your

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
battery altogether throw it out in your

clean
your<00:02:19.140> plastic<00:02:19.560> ring<00:02:19.860> they're<00:02:20.160> kind<00:02:20.520> of

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
your plastic ring they're kind of

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.690 
your plastic ring they're kind of
insulating<00:02:21.150> them<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:22.250> yeah<00:02:23.250> just<00:02:23.490> don't<00:02:23.610> let

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.320 
insulating them so yeah just don't let
them<00:02:23.850> touch<00:02:25.310> all<00:02:26.310> right<00:02:26.370> now<00:02:26.610> let's<00:02:26.820> go<00:02:26.970> on<00:02:27.150> to

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
them touch all right now let's go on to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.580 
them touch all right now let's go on to
giving<00:02:28.020> back<00:02:28.140> even<00:02:28.530> more<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:30.350> all<00:02:31.350> right

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
there we go and you can see the white

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.370 
there we go and you can see the white
plastic<00:02:35.610> they're<00:02:35.820> insulating<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
plastic they're insulating it the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.410 
plastic they're insulating it the
lithium<00:02:37.770> from<00:02:37.890> outside<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.640> keeping

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
lithium from outside and keeping

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.930 
lithium from outside and keeping
everything<00:02:39.660> wrapped<00:02:39.930> up<00:02:40.110> nice<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:40.350> tight

everything wrapped up nice and tight
I've<00:02:41.940> got<00:02:42.120> one<00:02:42.390> glove<00:02:42.690> one<00:02:42.930> now<00:02:43.080> because<00:02:43.410> I

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
I've got one glove one now because I

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.440 
I've got one glove one now because I
didn't<00:02:44.370> have<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:45.170> ran<00:02:46.170> out<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:47.280> yep<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.330> way

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
didn't have to I ran out so yep the way

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.150 
didn't have to I ran out so yep the way
you<00:02:48.510> remove<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.380> just<00:02:49.410> get<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.010> good

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
you remove it is you just get a good

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.740 
you remove it is you just get a good
hold<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:50.550> outside<00:02:50.610> case<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.390> just<00:02:51.540> pull

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
hold of the outside case and just pull

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.350 
hold of the outside case and just pull
it<00:02:51.780> out<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.670> know<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:56.910> want<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.210> just

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
it out and I you know you want to just

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.220 
it out and I you know you want to just
go<00:02:57.450> down<00:02:57.630> there<00:02:57.720> right<00:02:57.870> now<00:02:57.930> rate<00:02:58.650> 5<00:02:58.890> stars<00:03:00.230> and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
go down there right now rate 5 stars and

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
go down there right now rate 5 stars and
you<00:03:02.010> know<00:03:02.100> all<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.370> good<00:03:02.520> stuff<00:03:02.690> subscribe

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
you know all that good stuff subscribe

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.470 
you know all that good stuff subscribe
if<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.340> like<00:03:05.460> modern<00:03:05.730> warfare<00:03:05.760> 2<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.270> Xbox

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
if you like modern warfare 2 and Xbox

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.480 
if you like modern warfare 2 and Xbox
and<00:03:06.840> all<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.320> can<00:03:07.440> just<00:03:07.560> throw<00:03:07.740> that<00:03:07.860> rest<00:03:08.340> of

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
and all you can just throw that rest of

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.790 
and all you can just throw that rest of
the<00:03:08.580> outside<00:03:08.910> casing<00:03:09.120> away<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.780> now<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.620> can

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
the outside casing away and now you can

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.290 
the outside casing away and now you can
see<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.070> little<00:03:11.280> metal<00:03:11.580> contact<00:03:11.940> there<00:03:12.120> that

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
see the little metal contact there that

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.670 
see the little metal contact there that
touches<00:03:12.600> outside<00:03:12.960> of<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.140> case<00:03:13.290> for<00:03:13.590> the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
touches outside of the case for the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.720 
touches outside of the case for the
negative<00:03:14.040> side<00:03:14.330> I'm<00:03:15.330> guessing<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.730> just

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
negative side I'm guessing and just

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.820 
negative side I'm guessing and just
start<00:03:18.120> unrolling<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.720> if<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.870> want<00:03:19.020> to<00:03:19.080> or<00:03:19.500> if

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
start unrolling it if you want to or if

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.950 
start unrolling it if you want to or if
you<00:03:19.950> want<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.190> store<00:03:20.400> even<00:03:20.580> longer<00:03:20.790> it's<00:03:21.660> still

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
you want it store even longer it's still

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.930 
you want it store even longer it's still
not<00:03:22.110> going<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.320> be<00:03:22.410> incredibly<00:03:22.860> long<00:03:23.040> but<00:03:23.310> you

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
not going to be incredibly long but you

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.090 
not going to be incredibly long but you
can<00:03:23.970> store<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.510> all<00:03:24.900> rolled<00:03:25.350> up<00:03:25.500> like<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.830> so

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
can store it all rolled up like that so

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.770 
can store it all rolled up like that so
the<00:03:26.190> air<00:03:26.310> can't<00:03:26.580> come<00:03:26.820> into<00:03:27.030> contact<00:03:27.239> with<00:03:27.510> it

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
the air can't come into contact with it

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.000 
the air can't come into contact with it
because<00:03:28.880> it's<00:03:29.880> very<00:03:30.030> reactive<00:03:30.560> as<00:03:31.560> you'll<00:03:31.860> see

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
because it's very reactive as you'll see

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.630 
because it's very reactive as you'll see
in<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.160> minute<00:03:33.709> but<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:34.739> here<00:03:34.980> we<00:03:35.040> go<00:03:35.070> just<00:03:35.370> start

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
in a minute but I here we go just start

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.250 
in a minute but I here we go just start
on<00:03:35.730> rolling<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.150> can<00:03:36.270> see<00:03:36.450> even<00:03:36.570> more<00:03:36.900> black

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
on rolling you can see even more black

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.930 
on rolling you can see even more black
insulation<00:03:37.890> their<00:03:38.040> solution<00:03:38.910> material<00:03:40.940> I'm

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
insulation their solution material I'm

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.710 
insulation their solution material I'm
guessing<00:03:42.420> that's<00:03:42.510> what<00:03:42.780> it<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:44.060> but<00:03:45.060> uh<00:03:45.120> yep

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
guessing that's what it is but uh yep

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.750 
guessing that's what it is but uh yep
just<00:03:46.050> take<00:03:46.230> apart<00:03:46.470> make<00:03:47.100> sure<00:03:47.280> not<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.489> touch

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
just take apart make sure not to touch

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.699 
just take apart make sure not to touch
it<00:03:47.790> with<00:03:48.030> my<00:03:48.060> bare<00:03:48.600> hand<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:49.260> can<00:03:49.410> see<00:03:49.560> the

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
it with my bare hand you can see the

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.320 
it with my bare hand you can see the
metal<00:03:49.860> there<00:03:50.100> is<00:03:50.250> kind<00:03:50.550> of<00:03:50.670> shiny<00:03:50.970> it's

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
metal there is kind of shiny it's

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.580 
metal there is kind of shiny it's
starting<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.810> turn<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:51.959> little<00:03:52.110> bit<00:03:52.260> Brown

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
starting to turn a little bit Brown

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.560 
starting to turn a little bit Brown
I<00:03:52.770> mean<00:03:53.310> it's<00:03:53.459> shiny<00:03:53.760> for<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.030> most<00:03:54.209> part<00:03:54.420> on

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
I mean it's shiny for the most part on

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.820 
I mean it's shiny for the most part on
the<00:03:54.660> left<00:03:54.900> side<00:03:55.020> screen<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.470> can<00:03:55.590> see<00:03:55.709> it's

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
the left side screen you can see it's

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.010 
the left side screen you can see it's
really<00:03:56.070> shiny<00:03:56.340> there<00:03:56.640> but<00:03:57.510> yeah<00:03:57.840> it's

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
really shiny there but yeah it's

really shiny there but yeah it's
starting<00:03:58.290> turned<00:03:58.440> brown<00:03:58.739> really<00:03:59.040> quick<00:03:59.400> quick

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
starting turned brown really quick quick

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.220 
starting turned brown really quick quick
and<00:04:00.030> black<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.989> it's<00:04:01.320> nasty<00:04:01.830> and<00:04:02.420> I<00:04:03.420> try<00:04:04.200> to

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
and black and it's nasty and I try to

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.660 
and black and it's nasty and I try to
get<00:04:04.380> it<00:04:04.500> folded<00:04:04.800> up<00:04:04.890> quick<00:04:05.160> before<00:04:05.190> it<00:04:05.580> all

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
get it folded up quick before it all

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.010 
get it folded up quick before it all
turns<00:04:05.880> black<00:04:08.390> grab<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:09.570> hold<00:04:09.600> it<00:04:09.810> with<00:04:09.900> the

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
turns black grab and hold it with the

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.530 
turns black grab and hold it with the
pliers<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.440> then<00:04:10.709> my<00:04:10.860> glove<00:04:11.100> try<00:04:12.060> remove<00:04:12.330> that

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
pliers and then my glove try remove that

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.600 
pliers and then my glove try remove that
metal<00:04:12.900> contact<00:04:13.380> on<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.650> other<00:04:13.770> side<00:04:14.010> because

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
metal contact on the other side because

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.420 
metal contact on the other side because
looking<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:15.269> very<00:04:15.450> soft<00:04:15.750> so<00:04:16.200> you<00:04:16.260> can<00:04:16.470> just<00:04:16.620> you

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
looking is very soft so you can just you

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.900 
looking is very soft so you can just you
know<00:04:17.459> bend<00:04:17.850> it<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.180> fold<00:04:18.660> it<00:04:18.750> up<00:04:18.870> real<00:04:19.049> nice

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
know bend it and fold it up real nice

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.320 
know bend it and fold it up real nice
and<00:04:20.910> though<00:04:21.090> go<00:04:21.419> on<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.790> reaction<00:04:23.790> part

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
and though go on to the reaction part

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.230 
and though go on to the reaction part
where<00:04:24.660> I<00:04:24.690> show<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:25.050> in<00:04:25.440> some<00:04:26.040> hot<00:04:26.220> water<00:04:26.430> in<00:04:27.030> a

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
where I show you in some hot water in a

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.909 
where I show you in some hot water in a
little<00:04:27.419> cocaine<00:04:28.669> um<00:04:29.900> but<00:04:30.900> yep<00:04:31.380> hotter<00:04:31.710> water

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
little cocaine um but yep hotter water

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:32.900 
little cocaine um but yep hotter water
the<00:04:32.430> more

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
the more

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.480 
the more
X's<00:04:33.300> hot<00:04:33.900> water<00:04:34.110> is<00:04:34.230> better<00:04:34.440> that's<00:04:35.220> why<00:04:35.400> I<00:04:35.430> do

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
X's hot water is better that's why I do

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.240 
X's hot water is better that's why I do
these<00:04:36.420> reactions<00:04:36.710> aren't<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.800> biggest<00:04:38.010> I've

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
these reactions aren't the biggest I've

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.920 
these reactions aren't the biggest I've
gotten<00:04:38.520> because<00:04:38.700> either<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:38.940> half<00:04:39.480> a<00:04:39.570> battery

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
gotten because either a half a battery

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.710 
gotten because either a half a battery
of<00:04:40.080> peace<00:04:40.680> so<00:04:41.070> a<00:04:41.340> whole<00:04:41.850> battery<00:04:42.000> I<00:04:42.300> can<00:04:42.510> get

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
of peace so a whole battery I can get

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.210 
of peace so a whole battery I can get
them<00:04:42.840> shooting<00:04:43.290> up<00:04:43.440> in<00:04:43.560> there<00:04:43.680> like<00:04:43.860> five<00:04:44.040> feet

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
them shooting up in there like five feet

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.040 
them shooting up in there like five feet
high<00:04:44.430> yeah<00:04:45.300> I've<00:04:45.570> got<00:04:45.720> my<00:04:45.810> blow<00:04:45.990> torch

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
high yeah I've got my blow torch

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.690 
high yeah I've got my blow torch
lighting<00:04:46.440> on<00:04:46.560> fire<00:04:46.740> right<00:04:46.860> now<00:04:46.920> nice<00:04:47.310> red

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
lighting on fire right now nice red

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.090 
lighting on fire right now nice red
color<00:04:47.940> from<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.300> lithium<00:04:48.660> but<00:04:49.530> yep<00:04:49.890> see

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
color from the lithium but yep see

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.470 
color from the lithium but yep see
there's<00:04:50.280> a<00:04:50.370> little<00:04:50.580> explosion<00:04:50.880> there<00:04:51.210> from

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
there's a little explosion there from

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.630 
there's a little explosion there from
the<00:04:51.570> lithium<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.590> do<00:04:52.920> it<00:04:53.010> one<00:04:53.130> more<00:04:53.190> time

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
the lithium and do it one more time

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.480 
the lithium and do it one more time
I<00:04:56.180> mean<00:04:57.180> it<00:04:57.450> usually<00:04:57.750> just<00:04:58.220> reduces<00:04:59.220> some

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
I mean it usually just reduces some

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.250 
I mean it usually just reduces some
hydrogen<00:04:59.850> but<00:05:00.180> I<00:05:00.360> light<00:05:00.540> it<00:05:00.570> on<00:05:00.690> fire<00:05:00.750> so<00:05:00.960> it's

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
hydrogen but I light it on fire so it's

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.580 
hydrogen but I light it on fire so it's
better<00:05:01.440> use<00:05:02.220> hot<00:05:02.400> water<00:05:03.320> alright<00:05:04.320> well<00:05:04.410> thanks

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
better use hot water alright well thanks

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.630 
better use hot water alright well thanks
