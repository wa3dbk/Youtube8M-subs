00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.879
 hi how are you I hope you are very 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.460
 well the truth of today is express 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.400
 our video did not want to miss this 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.650
 so special date that is here in mexico 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.259
 which is mothers day and good 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.820
 we made a little detail although also this 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.009
 detail will serve us for the day of the 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.840
 teacher that is the next week and 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.149
 Well, I hope you like it a lot 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.399
 idea and good that they can do it and that 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.829
 they can share it too, you know 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.809
 subscribe to the channel share the channel 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.440
 share the videos and good I leave them 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.410
 with the video 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.450
 we're going to need are going to be apples of 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.000
 which you like, whether they are yellow 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.570
 or red or as you want 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.550
 let's also use chopped fruit either 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.649
 that you cut it or you can buy 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.420
 this kind of cans that brings a cocktail of 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.750
 fruits in syrup 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.950
 we are going to need knives and 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.570
 possibly a good pen the first thing 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.869
 what are we going to do with our apple is 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.729
 to split it, we are not going to totally cut 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.860
 half if we're not going to make it a 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.390
 little above half and let's 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.390
 do it in a medium way 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.160
 this part is what is going to be our 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.470
 base like the little basket and then what 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.620
 we are going to have this and what we are going to do 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.330
 with this part of the base will be to take 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.330
 everything that is the inside 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.030
 9 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.070
 being so 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.200
 good clever I already have my channel removed 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.210
 all scraped and well we're going to 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.000
 book a moment we will leave it for 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.180
 a moment and now what we are going to do 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.360
 is to cut this part this part is going to be 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.700
 what is the flower what we are going to do 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.590
 is to make some petals if you want 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.190
 you can mark it to make it easier 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.430
 the idea is to have six petals and or more 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.099
 or less mark what the petal is not 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.980
 it is totally marked but then more or 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.160
 least is to guide what we are going to do 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.519
 is to cut these these triangles that we 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.660
 they are between petals and petals and we're going 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.660
 to do this way 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.440
 this is how we should stay 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.840
 between petal and petals and this is what 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.080
 let's do with everyone with all the 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.080
 shores 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.920
 ah 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.790
 or 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.630
 what we are going to do is detail well 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.110
 our petals for example in this 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.450
 case if they are fixed it was not completely 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:32.000
 like a petal then what are we going to 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.000
 to do is to reduce that part 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.810
 and detail the good we're going to do that 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.370
 our cut between a little more 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.370
 towards what is the center 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.520
 that's how we're going to start detailing 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.770
 everything is our apple 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.870
 good since we have detailed our 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.970
 What we are going to do is make you 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:06.420
 some details in the middle part of 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.420
 each one of the petals we are going to cut 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.340
 on one side and the other 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.840
 again that we stay like this 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.510
 and that's how you're going to see our 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.300
 little flower now what we are going to do 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.120
 is to mount our flower to that I 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.030
 I recommend that you use one of these 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:44.290
 selling liquids that prevents it from 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:47.020
 oxidize our of our fruits or 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.910
 avocados for example all that then 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.550
 helps us to prevent it from oxidizing by the 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.520
 heat then well I'm going to spray a 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.950
 little of this liquid in the apple to 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.100
 that does not oxidize precisely and does not 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.980
 start this little thing like coffee 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.440
 good since we have put some liquid 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.780
 to help that our apple does not 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.110
 oxide or anything what we are going to do now 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.090
 is to mount the let's put our flower 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.210
 in this way 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.520
 and with a stick of these skewers 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:23.790
 let's calculate more or less the size 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.790
 what we want and we are going to string 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.979
 thus 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.600
 and we are going to string our flower in 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.160
 our basket 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.310
 now let's put what is the fruit 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.310
 chopped 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:49.710
 they can put pieces of grape mango 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:51.780
 even after again apple 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.320
 and well then we have here our 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.480
 finished apple already this we have put 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.030
 our basket we have put the fruit 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.550
 in as I said to you can you 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:06.630
 put grapes can put cherries 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.150
 mango pineapple bits and our 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.600
 flower is the one that will adorn our 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.600
 detail 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.850
 or not
