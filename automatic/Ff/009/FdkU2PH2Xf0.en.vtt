we've<00:00:06.000> been<00:00:06.180> practicing<00:00:06.420> for<00:00:06.960> about<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.140> week

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
we've been practicing for about a week

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.759 
we've been practicing for about a week
and<00:00:07.679> a<00:00:07.800> half<00:00:08.150> at<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.210> IBC<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.110> into<00:00:10.410> Barris

workshop
here<00:00:13.220> we<00:00:13.340> go<00:00:13.490> the<00:00:13.940> first<00:00:14.240> time<00:00:14.540> we<00:00:15.080> use<00:00:15.320> it<00:00:15.500> for

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
here we go the first time we use it for

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:28.130 
here we go the first time we use it for
real

if<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:29.320> Steadicam<00:00:29.770> shows<00:00:30.010> up<00:00:30.310> in<00:00:30.460> the

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
if the Steadicam shows up in the

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.910 
if the Steadicam shows up in the
marching<00:00:30.820> parades<00:00:31.300> it<00:00:31.570> upsets<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.410> symmetry

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
marching parades it upsets the symmetry

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.310 
marching parades it upsets the symmetry
of<00:00:32.950> the<00:00:33.100> other<00:00:33.340> shots<00:00:33.690> using<00:00:34.690> the<00:00:34.960> hands-free

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
of the other shots using the hands-free

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.580 
of the other shots using the hands-free
I<00:00:35.470> could<00:00:35.830> move<00:00:36.070> in<00:00:36.280> and<00:00:36.460> out<00:00:36.520> very<00:00:36.850> quickly

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
I could move in and out very quickly

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.110 
I could move in and out very quickly
when<00:00:38.590> you<00:00:38.680> look<00:00:38.860> at<00:00:38.980> this<00:00:39.100> shot<00:00:39.400> and<00:00:39.640> it<00:00:39.760> was

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
when you look at this shot and it was

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.140 
when you look at this shot and it was
one<00:00:40.330> of<00:00:40.360> the<00:00:40.540> first<00:00:40.810> shots<00:00:41.880> immediately<00:00:42.880> the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
one of the first shots immediately the

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.990 
one of the first shots immediately the
feeling<00:00:44.110> of<00:00:44.200> the<00:00:44.350> music<00:00:44.830> and<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.040> speed<00:00:45.640> at

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
feeling of the music and the speed at

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.400 
feeling of the music and the speed at
which<00:00:46.030> I<00:00:46.390> could<00:00:46.750> stop<00:00:47.230> him<00:00:47.500> I<00:00:52.260> really<00:00:53.260> have<00:00:53.380> to

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
which I could stop him I really have to

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.010 
which I could stop him I really have to
accelerate<00:00:53.800> to<00:00:54.130> get<00:00:54.250> out<00:00:54.430> there<00:00:54.700> which

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
accelerate to get out there which

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.590 
accelerate to get out there which
happens<00:00:56.020> occasionally<00:00:57.120> especially<00:00:58.120> on<00:00:58.480> an

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
happens occasionally especially on an

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.689 
happens occasionally especially on an
unreal<00:00:58.960> show<00:00:59.380> like<00:00:59.590> this<00:00:59.770> and<00:01:00.040> I<00:01:00.160> remember

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
unreal show like this and I remember

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.799 
unreal show like this and I remember
from<00:01:00.820> Lazar<00:01:01.059> doing<00:01:01.510> it<00:01:01.600> by<00:01:02.050> foot<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:04.360> hand<00:01:04.600> for

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
from Lazar doing it by foot the hand for

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.230 
from Lazar doing it by foot the hand for
you<00:01:04.900> works<00:01:05.140> with<00:01:05.410> gyroscopes<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.580> stabilize

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
you works with gyroscopes that stabilize

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.870 
you works with gyroscopes that stabilize
the<00:01:07.480> machine<00:01:07.840> once<00:01:08.320> you<00:01:08.470> upset<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.130> jar<00:01:09.370> is<00:01:09.400> by

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
the machine once you upset the jar is by

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.540 
the machine once you upset the jar is by
leaning<00:01:10.270> forward<00:01:10.720> it<00:01:11.530> will<00:01:11.680> compensate<00:01:12.130> for

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
leaning forward it will compensate for

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.040 
leaning forward it will compensate for
it<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:12.850> move<00:01:13.090> forward<00:01:13.420> by<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.750> natural

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
it and move forward by the natural

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.310 
it and move forward by the natural
tendency<00:01:14.470> of<00:01:14.800> keeping<00:01:15.250> up<00:01:15.340> right<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
tendency of keeping up right the

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.560 
tendency of keeping up right the
hands-free<00:01:17.710> can<00:01:18.220> be<00:01:18.370> used<00:01:18.580> at<00:01:18.760> several<00:01:19.180> speeds

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
hands-free can be used at several speeds

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.920 
hands-free can be used at several speeds
just<00:01:20.140> like<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.530> original<00:01:20.680> sack<00:01:21.430> way<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:22.659> tend

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
just like the original sack way we tend

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.460 
just like the original sack way we tend
to<00:01:22.960> go<00:01:23.140> for<00:01:23.170> safety<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.130> use<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.730> black<00:01:24.940> key

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
to go for safety and use the black key

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.680 
to go for safety and use the black key
but<00:01:26.470> June<00:01:26.800> rehearsal<00:01:27.460> turn<00:01:27.760> out<00:01:27.909> to<00:01:28.090> be<00:01:28.180> easier

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
but June rehearsal turn out to be easier

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.040 
but June rehearsal turn out to be easier
and<00:01:28.870> safer<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.740> use<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:30.070> red<00:01:30.250> keep<00:01:30.780> using<00:01:31.780> the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
and safer to use the red keep using the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.050 
and safer to use the red keep using the
red<00:01:32.200> key<00:01:32.410> makes<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:33.070> drive<00:01:33.310> faster<00:01:33.910> and

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
red key makes it drive faster and

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.410 
red key makes it drive faster and
especially<00:01:34.450> steer<00:01:35.020> faster<00:01:35.620> but<00:01:35.920> it<00:01:36.420> also

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
especially steer faster but it also

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.320 
especially steer faster but it also
breaks<00:01:38.410> faster<00:01:39.040> which<00:01:39.550> was<00:01:39.730> a<00:01:39.760> very<00:01:40.090> big

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
breaks faster which was a very big

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.410 
breaks faster which was a very big
advantage<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:42.010> biggest<00:01:42.250> advantage<00:01:43.000> was<00:01:43.240> its

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
advantage the biggest advantage was its

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.110 
advantage the biggest advantage was its
speed<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:44.830> Steadicam<00:01:45.310> operator<00:01:45.400> can<00:01:46.000> now

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
speed the Steadicam operator can now

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.030 
speed the Steadicam operator can now
accelerate<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:47.110> running<00:01:47.590> speed<00:01:47.860> without

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
accelerate to running speed without

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.210 
accelerate to running speed without
actually<00:01:48.820> any<00:01:49.030> effort<00:01:49.660> this<00:01:50.590> means<00:01:50.860> less

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
actually any effort this means less

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.310 
actually any effort this means less
fatigue<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:51.940> more<00:01:52.120> energy<00:01:52.600> for<00:01:52.810> operating

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
fatigue and more energy for operating

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.250 
fatigue and more energy for operating
the<00:01:53.470> actual<00:01:53.920> shot

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
the actual shot

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.440 

look<00:01:57.220> at<00:01:57.370> this<00:01:57.610> I'm<00:01:57.880> enjoying<00:01:58.240> myself<00:02:00.450> backing

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
look at this I'm enjoying myself backing

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.690 
look at this I'm enjoying myself backing
up<00:02:01.570> is<00:02:01.810> so<00:02:02.080> easy<00:02:02.350> because<00:02:02.800> your<00:02:03.130> peripheral

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
up is so easy because your peripheral

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.630 
up is so easy because your peripheral
vision<00:02:03.730> is<00:02:04.240> quite<00:02:05.050> good<00:02:05.320> here<00:02:05.710> you<00:02:06.340> look

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
vision is quite good here you look

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.960 
vision is quite good here you look
backwards<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.540> still<00:02:08.290> operate<00:02:08.770> a<00:02:08.800> shot<00:02:09.160> the

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
backwards and still operate a shot the

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.430 
backwards and still operate a shot the
other<00:02:10.119> thing<00:02:10.390> is<00:02:10.420> you're<00:02:10.690> just<00:02:11.020> a<00:02:11.110> little<00:02:11.230> bit

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
other thing is you're just a little bit

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.990 
other thing is you're just a little bit
higher<00:02:11.710> than<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:12.070> rest<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.490> people<00:02:12.670> so

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
higher than the rest of the people so

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.050 
higher than the rest of the people so
you<00:02:13.060> really<00:02:14.050> have<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.290> good<00:02:14.530> view<00:02:14.880> one<00:02:15.880> of<00:02:15.970> the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
you really have a good view one of the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.840 
you really have a good view one of the
best<00:02:16.210> views<00:02:16.390> in<00:02:16.860> being<00:02:17.860> afraid<00:02:18.190> of<00:02:18.310> building

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
best views in being afraid of building

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.440 
best views in being afraid of building
up<00:02:18.940> assets<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:19.630> stationery<00:02:20.290> lack<00:02:20.680> muscles<00:02:21.160> I

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
up assets and stationery lack muscles I

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.760 
up assets and stationery lack muscles I
suggested<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.480> do<00:02:22.690> some<00:02:23.050> of<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.290> performances

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
suggested to do some of the performances

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.390 
suggested to do some of the performances
regular<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:26.080> worked<00:02:26.290> out<00:02:26.440> fine<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:27.070> turn

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
regular this worked out fine and I turn

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.430
