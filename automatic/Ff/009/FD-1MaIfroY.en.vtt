here's<00:01:03.899> your<00:01:04.049> 120<00:01:05.010> millimeter<00:01:05.489> fan<00:01:05.790> with<00:01:06.720> its

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
here's your 120 millimeter fan with its

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.350 
here's your 120 millimeter fan with its
four<00:01:07.350> pin<00:01:07.560> connector<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.119> your

universal<00:01:10.140> backplate<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:11.070> both<00:01:11.220> your<00:01:11.369> AMD

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
universal backplate for both your AMD

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.359 
universal backplate for both your AMD
and<00:01:12.060> Intel<00:01:12.540> setup<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.590> side<00:01:13.830> goes<00:01:14.010> against

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and Intel setup this side goes against

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.640 
and Intel setup this side goes against
the<00:01:14.490> motherboard<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.330> Intel<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.380> side

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the motherboard for Intel and this side

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.359 
the motherboard for Intel and this side
for<00:01:17.040> AMD<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.320> some<00:01:19.500> side<00:01:19.770> caps<00:01:20.100> and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
for AMD and here are some side caps and

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.520 
for AMD and here are some side caps and
nuts<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.090> will<00:01:21.270> show<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.479> how<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> install

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
nuts and I will show you how to install

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.030 
nuts and I will show you how to install
them

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
them

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.630 
them
so<00:01:23.729> first<00:01:24.090> we'll<00:01:24.570> use<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.080> AMD<00:01:25.500> setup<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:25.979> push

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
so first we'll use the AMD setup so push

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.480 
so first we'll use the AMD setup so push
this<00:01:27.030> nut<00:01:27.360> through<00:01:27.689> here<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:30.500> next<00:01:31.500> use<00:01:32.280> this

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
this nut through here and next use this

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.069 
this nut through here and next use this
cap<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:34.790> push<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:36.030> there<00:01:36.240> until<00:01:36.750> you

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
cap and just push it on there until you

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.539 
cap and just push it on there until you
hear<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.740> click<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.890> now<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.950> gold

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
hear a click just like that now the gold

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.469 
hear a click just like that now the gold

here<00:02:48.819> so<00:02:49.629> you<00:02:49.720> can<00:02:50.200> insert<00:02:50.829> your<00:02:51.000> brackets

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
here so you can insert your brackets

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.759 
here so you can insert your brackets
right<00:02:52.840> in<00:02:53.169> the<00:02:53.319> space<00:02:53.680> there<00:02:54.340> just<00:02:54.760> like<00:02:54.939> this

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
right in the space there just like this

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.690 
right in the space there just like this
and<00:02:57.930> here's<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:59.019> look<00:02:59.319> at<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.859> top<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.639> your

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
and here's a look at the top of your

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.360 
and here's a look at the top of your
heatsink<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.719> as<00:03:02.469> well<00:03:02.739> as<00:03:02.919> where<00:03:03.189> your

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
heatsink and as well as where your

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.490 
heatsink and as well as where your
copper<00:03:03.849> heat<00:03:04.180> pipes<00:03:04.419> thread<00:03:04.900> through<00:03:05.079> here's

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
copper heat pipes thread through here's

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.740 
copper heat pipes thread through here's
a<00:03:05.560> look<00:03:05.739> at<00:03:05.919> the<00:03:06.159> fan<00:03:06.579> attached<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.540> your

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
a look at the fan attached to your

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.869 
a look at the fan attached to your
heatsink<00:03:08.290> using<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.739> fan<00:03:08.950> clip<00:03:09.219> I'm<00:03:09.669> going<00:03:09.730> to

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
heatsink using the fan clip I'm going to

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.800 
heatsink using the fan clip I'm going to
go<00:03:10.030> ahead<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.829> attach<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:12.370> secondary<00:03:13.239> clip

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
go ahead and attach the secondary clip

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:22.409 
go ahead and attach the secondary clip
so<00:03:14.909> here<00:03:15.909> we<00:03:16.000> go<00:03:18.629> and<00:03:20.579> put<00:03:21.579> that<00:03:21.760> into<00:03:21.970> place

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
so here we go and put that into place

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.969 
so here we go and put that into place
just<00:03:22.959> like<00:03:23.109> this<00:03:23.379> and<00:03:24.120> there<00:03:25.120> is<00:03:25.379> your<00:03:26.379> setup

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:26.979 
just like this and there is your setup

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.550 
just like this and there is your setup
however<00:03:27.879> if<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.269> wish<00:03:28.449> for<00:03:28.870> a<00:03:28.930> push-pull

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
however if you wish for a push-pull

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.679 
however if you wish for a push-pull
configuration<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:30.489> can<00:03:30.639> place<00:03:30.849> a<00:03:31.060> second<00:03:31.479> fan

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:31.689 
configuration you can place a second fan

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:33.390 
configuration you can place a second fan
on<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.079> side<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.799> wraps<00:03:33.010> up<00:03:33.159> our<00:03:33.280> overview
