00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 the month of October is the least 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.839
 the uprooting of root vegetables but 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.639
 especially a priority this month this is the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.639
 great cleaning before winter 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.730
 as much as possible we take advantage of a 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.010
 sunny day to perform all 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.960
 these works in the garden then we will 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.270
 start with the beginning of the grubbing 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.770
 roots of witloof chicory which 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.050
 will serve us to make endive more 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.740
 later we can also tear 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.390
 Red beets 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.919
 we do not have to tear everything off 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.279
 can tear up as and when 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.500
 needs 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.989
 if you need to release the parcel 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.900
 you put them in silo so it is 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.270
 even with all your carrots celery 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.770
 raves must also arrive at the cellar 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.620
 or why not in a drum of 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.480
 washing machine to protect them 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.740
 if small zucchini can not be preserved 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.400
 not since have not arrived at 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.560
 maturity 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.960
 on the other hand, layers like 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.080
 pumpkins are kept very long at 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.270
 the heat between 15 and 20 degrees it is 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.040
 urgent now also to tear your 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.480
 last late potatoes in 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.260
 earth because if you leave them still 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.330
 Several weeks 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.189
 they may rot and catch the 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.350
 mildew in october in the kitchen garden 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.840
 is always good to air his land then 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.250
 after weeding it especially remove 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.980
 all weeds now 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.780
 because of risk of grenay in the garden by 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.909
 following even before winter so for 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.890
 it was going to put them in compost and 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.630
 they will immediately break down and 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.060
 we will make a good compost 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.890
 do not hesitate to weed also your 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.050
 Matches that can be invaded 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.270
 by the grass now and the little one 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.890
 chick for that you use a knife 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.290
 and that will allow you to have matches 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.090
 clean before winter and then especially 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.979
 do not hesitate to tear all these 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.229
 vegetables that will not evolve anyway 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.180
 more in the garden like beans 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.979
 in october we are not immune 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.390
 a little morning jelly some 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.700
 vegetables and in particular chicory 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.380
 Scaroles are susceptible to this jelly 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.229
 then we can put a veil 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.750
 wintering or plastic tunnel 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.460
 from above but be careful with the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.440
 heat with the sun in the day 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.390
 we may have a rot 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.590
 inside so you have to plan 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.750
 aeration 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.149
 under these tunnels and then we'll finish 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.269
 our month of october I advise you 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.989
 to plant the white garlic laviolette and 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.989
 gray shallots
