00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.310
 we knew everyone is Benji 13 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.310
 I hope you're fine, I'm fine 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.760
 we meet on Gta 5 at the park 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.689
 national for a little secret that gets 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.960
 find rather finally in the desert at 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.550
 national park i'm showing you right now 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:38.190
 where it is so here it is for 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.980
 the discovery of a rhyme that would 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.910
 written by a serial killer 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:47.879
 shit shit shit talk so he's 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.460
 nicknamed the killer of infinity I have you 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.469
 put a little biography as well as this 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:59.460
 which was marked in the description 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:01.140
 then you can see why the killer 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.140
 of infinity because was obsessed with the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.570
 figure 8 and 8 in reverse das did the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.920
 sign of the infinite so after I do not know 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.540
 not why ended why they have 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.970
 chosen infinite and not 8 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.340
 so you can see that there is 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.960
 some 8 on rocks and canteen 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.710
 is right there I'm not going to read 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.100
 because my English is rather pitiful 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.979
 but I 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.659
 in the description she will be there so 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:34.000
 it's a nice little secret all 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.580
 the biography as I say in the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.189
 description because if I start to 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.119
 al ahly hours and all that will take that 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.479
 will take leaden 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.440
 here is a little a little secret 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.250
 of gta 5 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.159
 we end up in a few seconds 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:56.740
 because there is another place where there are 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:58.319
 scriptures like that so go on here's me 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.179
 here you go 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.039
 so we're in the house 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.970
 so I do not really know if this is the 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.940
 house of merle abrams in any case it is 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.080
 it's a house where he's registered to 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.970
 new d 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.110
 meanings with respect to 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.530
 number 8 or infinity that is at 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.330
 110 shore right here so 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.940
 so here apparently it would be a 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.420
 where Mr Brown would have taken refuge 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.750
 after his neighbors and set fire to his 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.570
 House 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:39.230
 so you can see register 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:42.890
 writes in relation to figure 8 8 is 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.940
 just infinity this all I do not know this 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.530
 that it is surely turning upside down 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.180
 you can see him from the eight of 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.060
 eight of 8 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.840
 there are jars I do not know too much 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.430
 what it is I did not do 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:06.380
 the analysis again again and 8 right there 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:10.730
 do not even have so so here's really 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.709
 it proves that blackbird abrams existed 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.630
 he has always claimed his nest in his 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.880
 innocence 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.730
 and here we are and the sea the bounce we speak 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.680
 still from him I will put myself all the 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:29.510
 translations in the description because 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:32.450
 I do not have them here yet 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.620
 apparently and he would never have it 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.840
 would have died in his cell 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.790
 we would never have found his body so 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.330
 after is he really dead 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.920
 is that what I do not know this 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.160
 that he could have 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.890
 and he always claimed his innocence on 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.150
 never found the bodies of two 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.760
 his so-called victims 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.870
 so all that remains pretty vague 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:01.459
 on on this killer genres in quotation marks 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.110
 because if he claims his innocence 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.060
 it may not be so voila 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.030
 it was a little secret of gta 5 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.390
 I hope you enjoyed it do not hesitate to 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.420
 liker commented to share if you have

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.979

 world
