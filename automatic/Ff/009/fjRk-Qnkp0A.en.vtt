00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.240
 hello guys how are you welcome to the 

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.549
 episode 11 of the labeling and the third of 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.710
 this week thank you very much everyone for 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.599
 the support in yesterday's chapter I told you 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.690
 that if we reach the 300 likes I went up to 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.830
 a new today so here you have it 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.199
 well here in the first seconds of 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.449
 video you see me buying form for 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.029
 template trying to find the most 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.890
 cheap possible is difficult but good the 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.570
 it's really a pain to be like that because 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.340
 when you're playing all the time with the 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.490
 same time logically you get tired and 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.920
 you have to recover them so that's what 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.980
 there's nothing and we're entering a tournament like 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.620
 you see the silver supercopa we are going to 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.719
 try this template as it should and 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.940
 It's our turn against a divided team 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:47.379
 quite powerful it has aulica above 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.239
 melikson mc or makallé on the left and 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.789
 a md on the right that he saw it on 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.010
 fut that has five leg stars 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.050
 bad and four dribble and good the 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.770
 true that a quite powerful team 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.180
 see what shit Juan Pablo has done there 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.219
 he pulls with his feet in front and leaves 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.220
 the dead ball in the area so that 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.680
 well he just take it the push of all 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.450
 Anyway here I just throwing it in there 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.880
 He makes me that kind of shot with him and here 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.260
 he is practically alone and he 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.070
 the match ends there is not much more me 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.060
 I had six shots on goal and the fourth one did not 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.250
 I knew how to take advantage of it 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.799
 I ended up winning it seems like it's usual 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.200
 start the tournaments bad always perfect 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.869
 the first game and well here you see me 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.939
 that he re-entered a new tournament 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.570
 and nothing I had to find a team of 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.950
 mexicans good mexican league rather 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.070
 pretty fast i'm put forward the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.530
 9 minute with snow and look makes the goal 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.079
 Chapter certainly do not know if the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.450
 face or what of the videos that 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.070
 we are carrying it because it is a great goal with gene 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.350
 I knew that at some point you had to 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.299
 show this player and there you have it 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.610
 you are going to see the repetition makes a skin and 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.869
 then a long enough so pasting 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.959
 powerful to goalkeeper's stick besides very 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:08.369
 good the truth that a goal 20 to the 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:11.880
 rest the party was going well here receipt 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.310
 a ball on the edge of the area with a zapater 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.080
 a roll bowl I turn around and hit 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.650
 with the left set to suit 30 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.590
 the match ends 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.349
 we finally started the tournament with a good start 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.030
 let's see if this goes on like this and well what 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.640
 what we are going to do now is enter a 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.079
 match with the bronze template by 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.640
 what we talked about before avoiding having to 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.459
 be buying all the time those letters 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.930
 of recovery of form thus having 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.700
 there the whole bronze team 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.129
 it seems silly not to use it method to 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.480
 the silvers as substitutes and well then 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.189
 When the match ends I have them 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.470
 perfectly recovered we play 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.090
 against a prize team in 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.239
 second division but look like 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.849
 Akinsola in the 15th minute ahead in 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.909
 the score with that strip co from outside 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.680
 of the area and the second part starts from 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.900
 this way with the lynch itself or the 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.700
 pulling skills this time towards and 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.459
 finally a draft shot and plant 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.959
 in front of heart bursting with the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.579
 right in the minute 47 we put 20 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.530
 logically his players had a lot 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.090
 more quality than mine and in some 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.580
 moment I was going to fall some goal as is 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.380
 at minute 61 with hazard 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.830
 but he was not going to be able to do either 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.590
 much more and in the 73 the lake juniors 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.400
 the match ends with that Vaseline 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.470
 goalkeeper so nothing 13 an easy match 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.600
 and I the truth that the rival did not have 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.710
 a lot of level despite having a team 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:39.220
 very very good and we return to the tournament 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:43.300
 silver to the quarterfinals with the 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:46.840
 template already perfectly in shape we 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.970
 touches against this hybrid team has to 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.190
 quintero and arizala up then it was 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.130
 easy is in position of mese or good a 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.670
 pretty competitive team other shit 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:01.540
 from Juan Pabló this time, maybe it was 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.890
 also partly my fault but good there 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.500
 he got ahead the marker 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.010
 but I later tied the game with a 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.770
 good goal from iago falqué a lot of agility 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.500
 there is inside the area and well here I 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.590
 they make a penalty they almost destroy me like this 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.900
 vítolo they threw the two down very hard 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.639
 logically they called a penalty and hit it 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.129
 with zapater that has enough 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.939
 shooting power as I said there is almost no 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:31.539
 three bars and he guessed the 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:35.050
 address but good luckily I did not 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:40.030
 I stop so nothing like that 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.710
 we come to the end of the first part and 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.860
 well the truth is that the party was 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.659
 quite difficult 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.270
 the guy played a lot and did not biden and 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:50.759
 I had a good team but look is skill 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.090
 from iago falqué to go through the middle of 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:59.310
 the two defenses and get that pretty 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:03.270
 shortens me with that 32 the 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:06.330
 90 minute I'm going to have another chance and 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:10.590
 Well there I saw the plug so ends the 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:14.070
 42 very complicated match tense and the 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.380
 true that quite level in this tournament 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.290
 of silver but good we are already in the 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.770
 semifinal and we're going to leave it here for 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.360
 following chapters of the link label 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.360
 before leaving I want to leave you one 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.700
 survey in comments in the style of 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.700
 what I did last week the question 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.560
 is the next you want that after 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:38.010
 to finish with these silvers of the league 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.260
 forward mixed with Spaniards make a 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.470
 silver team of the league see me or me 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:46.020
 go directly to the gold team as well 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.090
 that nothing I leave to you in the 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.419
 comments vote the option that more you 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.400
 like it and so we will proceed so nothing 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.110
 guys up here the episode and we 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.110
