00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.680 

this<00:00:13.530> next<00:00:13.830> move<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.370> called<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.790> matrix<00:00:15.000> very

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
this next move I called the matrix very

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:51.529 
this next move I called the matrix very
sexy<00:00:16.170> move<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.010> looks<00:00:17.160> like<00:00:17.340> this

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.899 

so<00:00:52.539> the<00:00:52.600> matrix<00:00:52.809> is<00:00:53.230> comprised<00:00:54.159> of<00:00:54.550> a<00:00:54.670> whole

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
so the matrix is comprised of a whole

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:56.969 
so the matrix is comprised of a whole
bunch<00:00:55.149> of<00:00:55.300> different<00:00:55.420> moves<00:00:55.839> there's<00:00:56.769> a<00:00:56.800> lot

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
bunch of different moves there's a lot

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.889 
bunch of different moves there's a lot
of<00:00:57.070> moves<00:00:57.250> you<00:00:57.339> just<00:00:57.579> start<00:00:57.820> very<00:00:58.359> small<00:00:59.280> say

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
of moves you just start very small say

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.630 
of moves you just start very small say
with<00:01:01.899> just<00:01:02.019> some<00:01:02.199> body<00:01:02.350> ways<00:01:02.649> similar<00:01:03.280> to<00:01:03.460> the

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
with just some body ways similar to the

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.710 
with just some body ways similar to the
plants<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.030> lean<00:01:04.149> back<00:01:04.180> with<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.540> body

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
plants and lean back with the body

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.240 
plants and lean back with the body
weight<00:01:04.899> but<00:01:05.320> notice<00:01:05.649> that<00:01:05.710> this<00:01:05.860> time<00:01:06.070> I'm

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
weight but notice that this time I'm

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.830 
weight but notice that this time I'm
standing<00:01:06.670> more<00:01:07.180> upright<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.450> you<00:01:10.600> start

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
standing more upright and you start

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.469 
standing more upright and you start
doing<00:01:11.049> some<00:01:11.200> small<00:01:11.470> body<00:01:11.680> waves<00:01:11.890> to<00:01:12.039> start

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
doing some small body waves to start

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.590 
doing some small body waves to start
just<00:01:13.479> to<00:01:13.659> get<00:01:14.070> into<00:01:15.070> into<00:01:15.399> the<00:01:15.520> groove<00:01:15.759> rhythm

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
just to get into into the groove rhythm

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.429 
just to get into into the groove rhythm
is<00:01:16.720> not<00:01:16.750> important<00:01:17.380> at<00:01:17.439> all<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:19.899> do<00:01:20.140> have

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
is not important at all but you do have

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.399 
is not important at all but you do have
to<00:01:20.770> keep<00:01:21.009> moving<00:01:21.280> fluidly<00:01:21.940> guys<00:01:22.869> since<00:01:23.289> you're

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
to keep moving fluidly guys since you're

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.990 
to keep moving fluidly guys since you're
kind<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:23.799> leading<00:01:23.979> this<00:01:24.220> you<00:01:24.610> just<00:01:24.789> do

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
kind of leading this you just do

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.389 
kind of leading this you just do
whatever<00:01:25.179> move<00:01:25.569> comes<00:01:25.899> to<00:01:26.110> mind<00:01:26.350> and<00:01:26.679> the<00:01:27.220> girl

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
whatever move comes to mind and the girl

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.050 
whatever move comes to mind and the girl
will<00:01:27.610> naturally<00:01:27.789> marry<00:01:28.360> you<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.729> first<00:01:30.970> I

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
will naturally marry you so first I

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.490 
will naturally marry you so first I
start<00:01:31.270> with<00:01:31.390> body<00:01:31.569> ways<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:34.080> then<00:01:35.080> you<00:01:35.380> can

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
start with body ways and then you can

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.499 
start with body ways and then you can
move<00:01:35.679> into<00:01:36.209> doing<00:01:37.209> the<00:01:37.450> move<00:01:37.630> that<00:01:38.490> coined

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
move into doing the move that coined

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.770 
move into doing the move that coined
this<00:01:40.509> name<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.950> matrix<00:01:42.399> by<00:01:43.060> simply<00:01:43.420> leaning

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
this name the matrix by simply leaning

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.449 
this name the matrix by simply leaning
back<00:01:43.959> and<00:01:44.229> doing<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.560> circular<00:01:44.979> motion

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459 
back and doing a circular motion

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:53.969 
back and doing a circular motion
I<00:01:48.869> got<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.950> notice<00:01:51.189> that<00:01:51.280> my<00:01:51.429> hand<00:01:51.789> is<00:01:52.019> on<00:01:53.019> on

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
I got you notice that my hand is on on

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.430 
I got you notice that my hand is on on
her<00:01:54.310> waist<00:01:54.519> the<00:01:54.700> whole<00:01:54.910> time<00:01:55.119> like<00:01:55.390> this<00:01:55.599> this

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
her waist the whole time like this this

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.490 
her waist the whole time like this this
gives<00:01:56.619> me<00:01:56.769> some<00:01:56.979> stability<00:01:57.250> and<00:01:58.319> later<00:01:59.319> on

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
gives me some stability and later on

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.400 
gives me some stability and later on
it'll<00:01:59.649> also<00:01:59.769> allow<00:02:00.099> me<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.369> like<00:02:00.519> push<00:02:01.149> down<00:02:01.479> so

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
it'll also allow me to like push down so

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.100 
it'll also allow me to like push down so
we<00:02:02.619> can<00:02:02.800> do<00:02:03.700> more<00:02:04.030> of<00:02:04.060> this<00:02:04.179> front<00:02:04.690> grinding

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
we can do more of this front grinding

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.250 
we can do more of this front grinding
move<00:02:05.289> even<00:02:05.890> more<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.500> from<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.739> matrix<00:02:09.220> I

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
move even more so from the matrix I

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.290 
move even more so from the matrix I
might<00:02:11.260> do<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.920> circular<00:02:12.250> move<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:12.849> come<00:02:13.120> into

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
might do the circular move and come into

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.800 
might do the circular move and come into
a<00:02:13.420> body<00:02:13.660> wave<00:02:13.930> again<00:02:15.120> I'll<00:02:16.120> do<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.300> body<00:02:16.510> wave

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
a body wave again I'll do a body wave

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.080 
a body wave again I'll do a body wave
and<00:02:17.650> maybe<00:02:17.860> we<00:02:18.010> go<00:02:18.129> into<00:02:18.159> the<00:02:18.489> circular<00:02:18.909> move

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
and maybe we go into the circular move

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.940 
and maybe we go into the circular move
again

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
again

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:27.059 
again
or<00:02:20.950> reverse<00:02:21.519> it<00:02:25.470> alternatively<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.800> can<00:02:26.860> also

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
or reverse it alternatively I can also

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.309 
or reverse it alternatively I can also
start<00:02:27.400> doing<00:02:27.819> shoulder<00:02:28.750> rolls<00:02:28.930> just<00:02:31.319> really

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
start doing shoulder rolls just really

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:39.460 
start doing shoulder rolls just really
slow

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.140 

now<00:02:40.470> as<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.830> do<00:02:40.980> your<00:02:41.130> shoulder<00:02:41.520> rolls<00:02:41.730> you

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
now as you do your shoulder rolls you

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.320 
now as you do your shoulder rolls you
want<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.420> try<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.630> get<00:02:42.900> your<00:02:43.080> hips<00:02:43.260> moving<00:02:44.330> like
