00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280
 so ford focus 2 creak when turning 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.280
 steering in extreme positions 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:39.200
 Now let's try to listen on the go what 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.200
 this time creeps 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.440
 it was heard before 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.670
 now try again 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.670
 experiment 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.960
 audible here in extreme positions it doesn't matter 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:35.110
 which way to the left to the left extreme 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:35.110
 positions such a sound 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.860
 look again 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.570
 these are the scripts in general who knows 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.570
 write 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.930
 comments that it may be possible 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:09.420
 this 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.420
 rake though hardly because i 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:20.689
 On the spot twisted the same thing most likely 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:22.720
 hydra pump is not so everything seems to everyone 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.720
 thank
