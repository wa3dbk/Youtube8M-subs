to do some some more short wigs and I
don't<00:05:22.629> even<00:05:22.810> think<00:05:22.960> I've<00:05:23.259> done<00:05:23.770> anything

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
don't even think I've done anything

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.899 
don't even think I've done anything
shorter<00:05:24.669> than<00:05:24.819> a<00:05:25.620> rally<00:05:26.620> girl<00:05:26.919> I<00:05:27.250> think<00:05:27.789> was

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:27.909 
shorter than a rally girl I think was

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.279 
shorter than a rally girl I think was
the<00:05:28.060> shortest<00:05:28.360> we<00:05:28.509> got<00:05:28.689> done<00:05:28.870> it's<00:05:29.020> just<00:05:29.139> like

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
the shortest we got done it's just like

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:29.820 
the shortest we got done it's just like
right<00:05:29.439> here

right here
so<00:05:30.159> I<00:05:30.189> think<00:05:30.400> I<00:05:30.460> want<00:05:30.580> to<00:05:30.610> get<00:05:30.729> some<00:05:30.909> shorter

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270
