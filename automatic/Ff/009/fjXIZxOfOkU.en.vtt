00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.670
 staff will all right but it was there that I 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.279
 I'll show you today in 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.230
 smartphones say different from the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.660
 common and we see around 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.519
 this is the one that is lg optimus 3d next 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.970
 because he is different with himself 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.180
 name suggests it has 3d technology 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.420
 that does not require glasses or 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.600
 whether you can watch 3D movies without 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.270
 have a glasses but it goes beyond that to 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.550
 is to transform this 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.520
 small apparatus and a kind of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.100
 entertainment center in 3d because 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.590
 because in addition to viewing videos in 3d 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.210
 you can also shoot 3d through 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.699
 Your camera takes pictures in 3d play in 3d 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.910
 some applications are also 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.100
 compatible with 3d and the main of everything 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.100
 that lg can put any 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.979
 technology that can convert all 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.890
 your content from your libraries 2 gave 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.520
 normal black face in 3d content you 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.150
 can transform normal videos 2 of 3 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.780
 d 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.330
 you can only view 2d and 3d photos 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:29.540
 up to the same with games 2 developed 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:33.390
 with pgbl technology can also be 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.970
 converted into 3d games for you is usa 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.670
 them with your smartphone 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.450
 it has two cameras each with 5 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.460
 megapixels and the distance between them 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:48.450
 2.4 centimeters according to the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.390
 lg the ideal distance to take pictures and 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.810
 high-performance 3d video and even 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.799
 or between 30 centimeters up to five meters 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.810
 distance even in this device already 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.909
 saved some videos shot 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.200
 originally in 3d professionally 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.270
 giving to you get a sense when 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.830
 are being played on their screen 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.830
 Can you see what's happening now? 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.590
 as it records videos in 3D according to 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.280
 I have already mentioned here a video that 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.800
 I already did in 3d 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.140
 The interesting thing is that after the video 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.020
 it's ready you can type it if 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.240
 you can even edit the 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.130
 depth of 3d you want it 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.340
 stay in something similar happens with 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:54.470
 they for example the nintendo 3ds also 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.510
 has this functionality as already mentioned 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.270
 he can convert all his 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.860
 3d content 2d here in this example 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.740
 I got a photo 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.530
 the photo was taken with 12 files 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.050
 may just press the serve button on the 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.970
 3d corner that already converts is that getting 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.390
 in depth 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.910
 you can adjust your 3d unit 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.980
 this same procedure is the same 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.400
 mode is also made a video that you 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.400
 want to convert videos in 3d just 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.520
 another touch the photo to the back 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.060
 2d original format here are just the options 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.490
 have the 3d menu of it with the intuitive 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.700
 3d content you know to only access by 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:43.740
 here October the gallery use the camera 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:46.020
 here is the six- game he already has 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.710
 3d up tight buttons on that 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.500
 key 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.330
 you already automatically convert to 3d 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.480
 or do not choose 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.650
 and just like in the photo as the nintendo 3ds 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.870
 but because here you can configure the 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.560
 depth of all 3d to repair 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.810
 15 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.840
 you adjust is what you think 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.270
 practical for your eyes and there is also 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:14.220
 possibility of converting both 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:16.890
 applications like regular games and games 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.549
 here's a dinner in the game and in the 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.919
 cradle says it's actively in 2d here 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.970
 You registered the depth of it. 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.810
 can convert 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.420
 3d ready automatically it converts 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:35.460
 You can run the 3d game as you 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:38.100
 can repair here exactly the same 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.410
 this same conversion can already be done 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.020
 with applications in case here I did with 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.840
 11 goals metz 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.480
 it has already been converted to 3d so that's it 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.220
 personal and your optimus 3d max one 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.160
 fairly thin device 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.160
 You can repair here is just one detail. 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.050
 also that it has a mhl output that 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.900
 you with converter you connect in 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.440
 any 3d tv other equipment then it 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.440
 that's right
