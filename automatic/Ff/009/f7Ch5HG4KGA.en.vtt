00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.040
 hello to all lovers saintpaulia is not called 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.980
 I am the words if you like me he 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.320
 such situations happen that you need 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.710
 somehow fix in pots or 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.290
 cups ground little babe without 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.630
 roots either 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.970
 the top of a violet which will 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.000
 unstable stand can roll up on 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.850
 some one god then i will show you how 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.460
 way it can be done and so on me 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.949
 today as experimental two such 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.560
 frogs or to fialochka say you 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:42.860
 head of violets 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:47.210
 these are such miniatures here it turns out 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.060
 here's a very small stem acted 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.490
 a little more here 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:57.700
 I have already prepared cups with 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.700
 ground now a little bit you are an artist and 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:12.740
 Immediately stick the stickers with the names 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:15.580
 so you do not turn the plants I 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.580
 secured with tape 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:31.900
 way and the second glass then just 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:35.619
 with the Christmas tree is already inconvenient to do it 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.619
 she will be considered 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.640
 stuck 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.350
 so to secure the herringbone 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:52.369
 breast and we need toothpicks 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.440
 ordinary standard toothpicks and second 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.450
 option such here is half 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.740
 how would a broken tooth teacher well not up 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.410
 the end, that is, such that two pieces are not 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.929
 decayed 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:09.020
 such long toothpicks we need 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.000
 if we plant a flat one 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.250
 the outlet to which he is just a wife 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.840
 horizontally i.e. it is not vertically 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.970
 collapses so that she does not fidgeted to the left 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.210
 right there 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.610
 sat on the spot or help us keep 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:33.090
 This and you Glinka and toothpicks simply 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:37.290
 take the plants and arrange in the center 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:41.320
 otherwise, is the kaldan chosen slightly 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.520
 here and holding the second hand I just 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:48.280
 I take this toothpick and insert it between 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.640
 leaves so that it touches 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.520
 some leaf before 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.480
 second toothpick I expose in 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.490
 the opposite side too so she 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.570
 holding on to some leaf and you can still 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.920
 some kind of even a third insert so that 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.800
 filler on was fixing usually 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.959
 two toothpicks is enough so 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.670
 what we have is a plant a little bit 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:18.940
 walks yes but not as if she 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.860
 staggering you without toothpicks all such 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.330
 design is enough for us 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.890
 in two weeks 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.209
 the plants are rooted and then you already 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.959
 can take out the toothpicks 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:35.890
 it will already be well fixed 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:38.769
 The second case I have is the tip poke 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.459
 you can imagine what it say caustically 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.680
 without roots 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.320
 very often it happens that you land 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.390
 babies yes and some come off with 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.850
 prickles and there are some 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:53.980
 well formed large canines and 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:56.200
 kids but why do they have you enough for them there 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.600
 distribution of roots therefore got 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.230
 no problem 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.040
 they too can be planted like this right away we 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:10.330
 the check number is also impressed 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:13.680
 vanka a little bit and use 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:17.590
 such broken toothpicks 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:25.639
 to secure from like 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:29.889
 we pin the ground on this door handle 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:35.300
 and the opposite side too 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:38.120
 as the pin so hard not to press down 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.129
 not necessary because not to hurt 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:48.849
 the leaves gave Vanechka literally 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:51.669
 a little bit to keep it here 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:56.020
 way auxiliary such 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:05:00.099
 we have a design ready and if this 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.080
 baby without root or a top of the 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:05.110
 this plant is the same easy for two weeks 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.240
 take root and you are brave these are all things 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.849
 by getting 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.919
 it is possible to use open curved 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.439
 staples after giving such plastic 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.999
 the shells of the inner not to 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:18.339
 iron don't give us no harm 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:21.339
 plant and such here are some kind of soft 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:23.319
 materials or something else 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:24.999
 I used to use toothpicks 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:26.769
 so suddenly I show someone 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:28.979
 useful or someone may not know how 

00:05:26.769 --> 00:05:31.569
 fasten up so that this plant is not 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:35.740
 collapsed during transplantation because 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:37.059
 if you plant a plant and it will 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.999
 reckon from this she can just 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:42.519
 cool roots and grow 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:45.309
 somehow form one way then 

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:47.709
 there is a masculine then she will be comfortable and 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:49.779
 maybe it will not be too 

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:52.829
 unaesthetic to beautiful 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:54.519
 plants look centered 

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:56.680
 placed in a pot 

00:05:54.519 --> 00:06:01.899
 we can use these 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:05.559
 simple fixtures and so I lakes 

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:08.110
 do not postpone and placed for two weeks 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:09.550
 in the greenhouse they take root there then I them 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.379
 you nickname when the roots already 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.139
 will be viewed through the cup 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.430
 that's 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.999
 highlight points sound neatly just by 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:21.069
 take out vyproshuyu Odessa I wanted you 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:23.229
 show the already finished plant which 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:26.889
 I, too, like that perry rooted a 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:28.839
 a month ago here and asocial 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:33.219
 So I pulled out the toothpicks just 

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:35.559
 two toothpicks she fixed 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:37.779
 well kept here and now how are you 

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:40.089
 see here the plant is absolutely 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:42.360
 Normally there it is fixed that is, it is not 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:44.669
 in cups 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.319
 content exactly in general she is not 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:49.199
 thinks there too 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:50.819
 there the roots are well fixed here 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:53.460
 so I can safely 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:58.319
 neatly pull these 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:07:01.800
 we throw out toothpicks 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:04.759
 now finished beautiful rooted 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:08.810
 tip miniature violets 

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:11.849
 so we learned how to 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:15.689
 fix plants without roots 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:16.860
 pots with toothpicks if you 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:18.330
 haven't tried that yet 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.909
 try this news 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.830
 all this is just as easy to get and 

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:26.159
 your plant will be wonderful 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:28.710
 take root and will look beautiful in 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:31.439
 pots and cups wish you all 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:35.509
 have a good day successful beautiful transplants 

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:35.509
 leeches until next time bye
