00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.709
 5 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.730
 when friends came in and I set out 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.300
 Well I just came out what is a 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.220
 texture for minecraft 0.8 and good one 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.510
 of the first textures and before that 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.920
 nothing good before they start playing 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.080
 me the mother with you do not pronounce well 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.400
 that good word is that I have a 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.070
 problem when pronouncing the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.539
 X, that's good if they care 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.640
 Worry about it but the truth to me 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.840
 I do not give a damn and I just wanted 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.879
 tell them in fact before they start 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.400
 to make his scandal down there not and 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.920
 well this package I have it thanks to 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.460
 that they open good he says that I pass 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.630
 to minecraft steel and in the 0.8 me 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.610
 it seems that if you did the 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.739
 good modification your name is there 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.079
 below and the download link also what 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.880
 I leave everything down there in 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.050
 thanks to him because he owns the happened 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.520
 and this one I think she gave him 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.930
 thanks earlier for something he did in 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.399
 my channel nothing but I can not remember for 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.920
 what but his name makes me known 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.090
 so there's forgiveness for tightening that up like that 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.040
 that nothing will start with the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.450
 review of this texture package that 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.100
 has some small problems so 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.050
 carnalito if there are times this video 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.820
 correct it and your texture will be 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.380
 super super cool, well, that's what 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.880
 we install with the blog not interposed 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.649
 for android I wait for the blog 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.630
 teachers for android in them I do not know 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.950
 how are the textures we come back to and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.750
 the little key give you options 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.670
 launcher bay, we only select what 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.280
 of package texture idea and then we give it 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.009
 not that we do not give it packs 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.539
 texture that way and we only look for the 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.860
 where we have the texture package 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.750
 What is this that is here? I leave it to you 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.810
 the description of the video and once the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.819
 so let's have good we give you options 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.350
 sorry is that they were enabled because 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.479
 of another option as they see nothing we give 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.670
 here download we select the package 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.039
 texture and ready we have it installed 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.110
 nothing and good a little problem I think 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.990
 what is this this I do not know why it looks like this 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.909
 I do not know if that's how they are good for me is a 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.580
 texture error but good she 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.799
 You will know yes because you can see that for 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.590
 start let's see all that are the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.259
 Most paintings are not transformed 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.110
 but good, almost everyone is already with a 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.989
 new look so to speak the bed in the 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.190
 table is what is the stone breaker 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.260
 the breaker retire they have not 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.760
 modified neither and the chest I do not know by 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.430
 which thus it gives good if you change the texture 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.950
 but I do not know if that left you 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.530
 but with what's here on this map 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.629
 the spiders that are here ones that 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.790
 have problems in the texture are the 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:32.030
 zombies that look all weird media 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.019
 black and green as without faces I do not know by 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.640
 how good is that the face is upside down 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.859
 they need me to realize the face is up 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.299
 there you are watching me look at the face is 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:41.120
 up when the face of the idea of 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.400
 down is the texture is wrong is not a 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.739
 little nipple out there the clippers 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.939
 they look good they look good they are liked 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:52.760
 They seem cactus-like cactus and here 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.359
 there are those who are the ones where they are 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.739
 bastards 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.629
 here are the skeletons are there 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.129
 down they look very good the truth so 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.739
 they will not have a problem with it either 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.359
 and finally the pigment that yes 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.769
 I think they look almost normal no no you 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.810
 it changes a lot but the texture is a 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.210
 little clear I do not know if they reach it to 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.310
 see down there and more greenish 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.720
 the black then do not change anything of it 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.990
 Well, here we are going to find what they are 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.950
 all all materials regarding 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:22.070
 to the frogs the sheep this is the 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:26.069
 mats the sponge glass the black that 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:29.450
 it does not change in anything the globe is he 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.580
 as a wench stones 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.420
 the one that is extracted makes moved from the name 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:39.319
 of list that is good let's see here the network 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.780
 they are sorry and for her then others 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.560
 things that I told you about wool 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.980
 colors and beach mats 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.260
 These are the last cobwebs this what 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.090
 which are the minerals that are taken out of the 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.459
 land the extractables and with their 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.349
 respective block from there we find 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.780
 everything that comes in terms of rustling 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.390
 stone the wood all types of 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.180
 wood and in the end then those that remain 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.560
 a side that as to why not anymore 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.480
 they have good I did not have is passion of 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:14.260
 put them and then here goes what is the 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.530
 obsidian and gravel seems to me with 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.030
 the bricks and sand and nothing else is a 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.680
 man and for her I think it's the block 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.139
 of coal not the coal block is 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.510
 Beyond project and let's see what they are 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.300
 the leaves these are two different types 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.630
 of leaves fall against his tree behind 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.370
 the mushrooms and the grass that you see looks 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.750
 normal grass does not change the 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.520
 pigs and fire have movement 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.590
 just like water is our motto the 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.000
 cactus and well here are all the 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.870
 seeds or plantings that 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.669
 they can do 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.919
 the sheep does not walk from the texture but 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.090
 from there to there everything is very well like this 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.729
 that not in the description such a virus 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.340

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.820
 progress has been liked as they are written 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.800
 in the video you can download the blog 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.630

 a lot and I hope that you too 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.669
 Like it, it's not one of the first 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.110
 that deal with the small problems that 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.090
 but if you can correct us 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.490
 tell me and so I wash more 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.949
 a revision to the new package texture a 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.449
 little more thoroughly and not like this so 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.120
 nothing is me and I am prosperous 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.040
 liked 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.139
 it's a very good texture package changes you 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.639
 everything everything everything everything and for that reason to me yes me 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.560
 I liked it and that's why I wanted to make it 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.590
 review the sky does not change anything or the 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.270
 night and everything looks the same but what is 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.550
 the texture down here if it changes 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.320
 not quite as you see changes everything nothing 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.610
 I am first I hope you liked it here 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.160
 he also has a small book as you see 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.580
 everything is deformed but the texture is 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.500
 passable in 100 all its aspects 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.060
 Now, yes, I say goodbye, sorry for saying 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.039
 many money but I I'm used to it 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.689
