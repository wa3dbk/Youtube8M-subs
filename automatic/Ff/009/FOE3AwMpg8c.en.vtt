heading it fat is normally hitting it
steep<00:00:52.890> okay<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:53.699> if<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.629> set<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> ball

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.900

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
and I got the ball in the middle of my

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.930 
and I got the ball in the middle of my
stance<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:58.020> an<00:00:58.109> iron<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.940> I'm

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
stance for for an iron and I'm

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.630 
stance for for an iron and I'm
constantly<00:01:00.870> hitting<00:01:01.500> either<00:01:02.070> behind<00:01:02.250> it

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
constantly hitting either behind it

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.340 
constantly hitting either behind it
there's<00:01:02.820> two<00:01:03.030> ways<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.719> do<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.019> one

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
there's two ways that we can do this one

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.429 
there's two ways that we can do this one
is<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> tendency<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.210> reverse<00:01:07.170> our

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
is we have a tendency to reverse our

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.649 
is we have a tendency to reverse our
weight<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.159> go<00:01:08.430> into<00:01:08.670> our<00:01:08.790> front<00:01:09.030> foot<00:01:09.420> and

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
weight and go into our front foot and

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.500 
weight and go into our front foot and
then<00:01:10.560> come<00:01:10.830> down<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.220> hit<00:01:11.340> behind<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.909> that's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
then come down and hit behind it that's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.960 
then come down and hit behind it that's
probably<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.619> easiest<00:01:14.100> way<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.850> now

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
probably the easiest way to do it now

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.450 
probably the easiest way to do it now
sometimes<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.659> also<00:01:15.869> see<00:01:16.259> people<00:01:16.290> who<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
sometimes I also see people who have a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.170 
sometimes I also see people who have a
tendency<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.900> move<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.350> their<00:01:19.470> right<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
tendency to move to their right and

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.270 
tendency to move to their right and
never<00:01:21.180> get<00:01:21.450> back<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.720> their<00:01:22.049> left<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.619> see<00:01:23.040> that

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
never get back to their left I see that

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.200 
never get back to their left I see that
a<00:01:23.310> lot<00:01:23.610> too<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.860> key<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.670> how<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.850> can

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
a lot too so the key here and how we can

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.649 
a lot too so the key here and how we can
get<00:01:27.450> into<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> better<00:01:28.790> impact<00:01:29.790> position<00:01:30.150> is

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
get into a better impact position is

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.440 
get into a better impact position is
practicing<00:01:31.380> our<00:01:31.530> finished<00:01:31.950> position<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
practicing our finished position so the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.840 
practicing our finished position so the
thing<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.960> know<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.979> swing<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.490> as<00:01:35.670> easy

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
thing is you know this swing is as easy

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.700 
thing is you know this swing is as easy
as<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:36.360> two<00:01:36.390> three<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.229> got<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.680> a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
as one two three but we got it to a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.429 
as one two three but we got it to a
couple<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.850> things<00:01:39.119> correctly<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:40.200> to

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
couple of the things correctly to get to

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.679 
couple of the things correctly to get to
three<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.670> other<00:01:41.700> part<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.540> we

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
three and the other part of this is we

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.050 
three and the other part of this is we
have<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.020> really<00:01:43.320> train<00:01:43.560> our<00:01:43.770> body<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.579> get<00:01:44.820> to

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
have to really train our body to get to

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.080 
have to really train our body to get to
three<00:01:45.390> if<00:01:45.930> you're<00:01:46.200> not<00:01:46.409> used<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.950> getting<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.549> a

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
three if you're not used to getting in a

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.690 
three if you're not used to getting in a

ad what I would say is don't move that
ball<00:02:37.020> back<00:02:37.290> too<00:02:37.560> much<00:02:37.770> because<00:02:38.010> here's<00:02:38.430> what

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
ball back too much because here's what

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.610 
ball back too much because here's what
happens<00:02:38.670> if<00:02:39.180> we<00:02:39.330> move<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.720> ball<00:02:39.960> back<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:40.500> our

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
happens if we move that ball back in our

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.580 
happens if we move that ball back in our
stance<00:02:40.890> too<00:02:41.340> much<00:02:41.960> what<00:02:42.960> you're<00:02:43.140> doing<00:02:43.470> is

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
stance too much what you're doing is

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.230 
stance too much what you're doing is
you're<00:02:43.800> making<00:02:44.130> up<00:02:44.280> for<00:02:44.490> something<00:02:45.090> that

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
you're making up for something that

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.430 
you're making up for something that
you're<00:02:45.330> doing<00:02:45.390> either<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.200> setup<00:02:46.820> or<00:02:47.820> in

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
you're doing either in the setup or in

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.370 
you're doing either in the setup or in
the<00:02:49.440> sequence<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.360> our<00:02:51.360> finish<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:52.170> what<00:02:52.350> I

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
the sequence to our finish and what I

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.290 
the sequence to our finish and what I
mean<00:02:52.620> by<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.400> have<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.670> probably<00:02:54.209> a

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
mean by that is you have a probably a

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.770 
mean by that is you have a probably a
tendency<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:55.110> most<00:02:56.070> people<00:02:56.459> do<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:57.209> get<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
tendency like most people do is get the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.020 
tendency like most people do is get the
golf<00:02:57.990> too<00:02:58.410> much<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.890> inside<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.790> then

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
golf too much to the inside and then

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.090 
golf too much to the inside and then
have<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.270> reroute<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:01.020> now<00:03:01.140> if<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.380> reroute<00:03:01.860> it

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
have to reroute it now if I reroute it

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.650 
have to reroute it now if I reroute it
I'm<00:03:02.400> doing<00:03:02.820> that<00:03:03.030> with<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.330> upper<00:03:03.630> body

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
I'm doing that with the upper body

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.890 
I'm doing that with the upper body
that's<00:03:04.320> no<00:03:04.560> good<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:05.730> proper<00:03:06.209> sequence<00:03:06.390> on

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
that's no good the proper sequence on

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.260 
that's no good the proper sequence on
the<00:03:07.020> downswing<00:03:07.470> starts<00:03:08.400> from<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.730> ground<00:03:08.760> and

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
the downswing starts from the ground and

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.320 
the downswing starts from the ground and
works<00:03:09.480> up<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.500> have<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:11.010> make<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:11.880> lateral

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
works up so I have to make a lateral

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.230 
works up so I have to make a lateral
shift<00:03:12.660> my<00:03:13.560> arms<00:03:13.920> start<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.340> drop<00:03:14.580> because<00:03:15.060> of

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
shift my arms start to drop because of

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.449 
shift my arms start to drop because of
that<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:15.660> then<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.200> turn<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.770> face<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.220> target

that and then I turn and face the target

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.990
