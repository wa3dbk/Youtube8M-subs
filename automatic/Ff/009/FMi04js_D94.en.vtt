00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
produce with the PLU sticker that begins

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.650 
produce with the PLU sticker that begins
with<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.009> number<00:02:08.280> nine<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.450> way<00:02:09.599> you

with the number nine and that way you

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.270 
with the number nine and that way you
know<00:02:09.899> your<00:02:10.080> food<00:02:10.289> will<00:02:10.470> be<00:02:10.500> organic<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.129> not

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
know your food will be organic and not

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.960 
know your food will be organic and not
genetically<00:02:11.700> modified

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
genetically modified

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.920 
genetically modified
and<00:02:13.970> another<00:02:14.870> really<00:02:16.030> disturbing<00:02:17.030> point<00:02:17.750> in

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
and another really disturbing point in

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.170 
and another really disturbing point in
this<00:02:18.020> article<00:02:18.350> that<00:02:19.340> caught<00:02:19.490> my<00:02:19.670> attention

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
this article that caught my attention

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.860 
this article that caught my attention
was<00:02:20.210> talking<00:02:20.660> about<00:02:21.850> genetic<00:02:22.870> modification

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
was talking about genetic modification

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.480 
was talking about genetic modification
of<00:02:24.020> foods<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:25.990> basically<00:02:27.490> genetic

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
of foods and basically genetic

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:35.890 
of foods and basically genetic
modification<00:02:29.270> of<00:02:29.390> foods<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:31.030> when<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:35.660> DNA

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
modification of foods is when the DNA

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.400 
modification of foods is when the DNA
has<00:02:36.320> been<00:02:36.350> spliced<00:02:36.830> from<00:02:37.700> plant<00:02:38.060> even<00:02:38.810> animal

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
has been spliced from plant even animal

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
has been spliced from plant even animal

or microorganism into another plan for
example<00:02:43.970> fish<00:02:44.360> genes<00:02:44.720> have<00:02:44.960> been<00:02:44.990> spliced

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
example fish genes have been spliced

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.060
