00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
but I think particularly with this World

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.180 
but I think particularly with this World
Cup<00:00:41.250> just<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.180> fact<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:43.020> were<00:00:43.649> given<00:00:43.980> two

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
Cup just the fact that we were given two

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.369 
Cup just the fact that we were given two
million<00:00:44.550> as<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> as<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.300> bonus<00:00:45.719> for<00:00:45.899> winning<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
million as a as a bonus for winning and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.639 
million as a as a bonus for winning and
that<00:00:47.070> Germany<00:00:47.460> was<00:00:47.579> given<00:00:47.879> 35<00:00:48.360> million<00:00:48.660> that

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
that Germany was given 35 million that

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.110 
that Germany was given 35 million that
is<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.070> huge<00:00:50.870> huge<00:00:51.870> gap<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.800> know<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
is a huge huge gap and I know that the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.819 
is a huge huge gap and I know that the
marked<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.629> amount<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.079> marketing<00:00:55.410> dollars

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.719 
World Cup and I don't know how many
times<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.580> feel<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:06.030> FIFA<00:01:06.860> FIFA<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:08.220> do<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
times but I feel like FIFA FIFA can do a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.520 
times but I feel like FIFA FIFA can do a
better<00:01:08.909> job<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> future<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.960> closing<00:01:10.380> that

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
better job in the future of closing that

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.649 
better job in the future of closing that
gap<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.340> really<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:11.939> them<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> hope

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
gap and it really is on them so I hope

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.940 
gap and it really is on them so I hope
they<00:01:12.810> do<00:01:12.869> take<00:01:13.170> advantage<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.890> great

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
the men's side if you were to see if he

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.920 
the men's side if you were to see if he

were to see any player any of the top
hundred<00:01:55.200> players<00:01:55.590> he<00:01:56.219> would<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.460> recognized

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
hundred players he would have recognized

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.819 
hundred players he would have recognized
them<00:01:56.969> immediately<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:58.049> was<00:01:58.229> surprising<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
them immediately so it was surprising to

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.039 
them immediately so it was surprising to
me<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.610> said<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> little<00:02:00.360> something<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:00.960> an

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
me and I said a little something in an

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.840 
me and I said a little something in an
interview<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.680> couple<00:02:01.920> months<00:02:02.399> ago<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.790> I

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
interview a couple months ago and I

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.749 
interview a couple months ago and I
think<00:02:02.909> people<00:02:03.509> are<00:02:03.719> shocked<00:02:04.020> by<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.259> but<00:02:04.759> you

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
think people are shocked by that but you

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.429 
think people are shocked by that but you
know<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:06.210> FIFA's<00:02:06.719> me<00:02:06.930> moving<00:02:07.409> forward

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.729 
know I think FIFA's me moving forward
and<00:02:08.280> moving<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.239> from<00:02:09.539> from<00:02:09.929> Sepp<00:02:10.229> Blatter<00:02:10.470> and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
and moving on from from Sepp Blatter and

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.430 
and moving on from from Sepp Blatter and
I<00:02:10.979> think<00:02:11.250> he<00:02:11.459> he<00:02:12.030> made<00:02:12.209> his<00:02:12.360> mark<00:02:12.569> on<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.140> sport

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
I think he he made his mark on the sport

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.940 
I think he he made his mark on the sport
in<00:02:13.650> the

you for and on the Executive Committee I
just<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.160> think<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.269> women's<00:02:42.600> game<00:02:42.810> is

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
just I think that the women's game is

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.229 
just I think that the women's game is
growing<00:02:43.410> popularity<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> little<00:02:44.970> too

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
growing popularity and is a little too

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.000 
growing popularity and is a little too
fast<00:02:45.540> for<00:02:45.690> what<00:02:45.959> fee<00:02:46.110> for<00:02:46.530> what<00:02:46.650> FIFA<00:02:46.950> is

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
fast for what fee for what FIFA is

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.830 
fast for what fee for what FIFA is
thinking<00:02:47.340> right<00:02:47.370> now<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:48.060> hope<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.720> they

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
thinking right now so I hope that they

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.479 
thinking right now so I hope that they
noticed<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.590> next<00:02:49.830> president<00:02:49.980> sees

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
noticed that and the next president sees

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.680 
noticed that and the next president sees

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.410 
and have big moments and I think that's
important<00:05:25.260> to<00:05:25.550> bring<00:05:26.550> in<00:05:26.700> the<00:05:26.880> entire<00:05:27.120> team

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
important to bring in the entire team

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.090 
important to bring in the entire team
and<00:05:27.660> make<00:05:27.840> sure<00:05:28.020> that<00:05:28.200> they<00:05:28.410> know<00:05:28.620> that<00:05:28.800> every

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
and make sure that they know that every

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.350 
and make sure that they know that every
single<00:05:29.370> player<00:05:29.520> is<00:05:29.640> important<00:05:30.090> and<00:05:30.240> I<00:05:30.330> think

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
single player is important and I think

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.880 
single player is important and I think
that<00:05:30.630> this<00:05:31.230> tournament

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
that this tournament

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.860 
that this tournament
jörgen<00:05:32.850> is<00:05:32.970> able<00:05:33.180> to<00:05:33.270> show<00:05:33.420> those<00:05:33.630> players

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
jörgen is able to show those players

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.930 
jörgen is able to show those players
that<00:05:34.170> so<00:05:34.380> I<00:05:34.560> think<00:05:35.010> the<00:05:35.100> US<00:05:35.310> has<00:05:35.340> a<00:05:35.520> really<00:05:35.820> good

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
that so I think the US has a really good

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.530 
that so I think the US has a really good
chance<00:05:36.650> Mexico<00:05:37.650> obviously<00:05:37.940> just<00:05:38.940> one<00:05:39.030> off<00:05:39.360> of

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
chance Mexico obviously just one off of

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.920 
chance Mexico obviously just one off of
that<00:05:39.720> controversial<00:05:40.320> penalty<00:05:41.120> so<00:05:42.120> you<00:05:42.780> never

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
that controversial penalty so you never

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.230 
that controversial penalty so you never
know<00:05:43.170> they<00:05:43.380> could<00:05:43.410> regroup<00:05:44.280> and<00:05:44.580> and<00:05:44.880> really

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
know they could regroup and and really

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.840 
know they could regroup and and really
make<00:05:45.570> a<00:05:45.600> run<00:05:45.870> for<00:05:45.900> it<00:05:46.170> after<00:05:46.530> that<00:05:46.740> bsk<00:05:47.430> flippin
