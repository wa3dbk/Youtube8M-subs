00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.154
 Hello, everyone, I am Amin. Welcome to Amin's open box time 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.315
 Last night, my younger brother was on top of PChome. 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.500
 This is the P~C~home 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.800
 PChome bought this ChromeCast made by Google. 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.559
 This thing~ is something like a kind of streaming 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.360
 Its function is to connect this ChromeCast to the TV. 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.100
 Can be seen through the phone like APP 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.480
 For example, it may be an app like Youtube, KKBOX. 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.120
 Can stream it to the TV 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.400
 And what? 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.040
 After it's streamed up, it's not syncing the screen from the phone. 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.380
 It is directly from their Chromecast 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.720
 Connect directly to our sharer on this device 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.980
 So when I watch the movie, it won’t be Lag. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.700
 it is good 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.520
 Then we will come out of the box now~ 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.660
 Inside, it’s a whole little fun thing. 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.640
 Pick up a little weight 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.220
 Come, let's take a look, Chromecast 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.120
 It's something like USB that's a bit like USB 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.860
 Ok, then, our carton. This ~ first put one side 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.760
 Put it here, then what's lost in the carton! 

00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:20.615
 What kind of carton is lost? 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.860
 Ok, OK 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.240
 Let us continue eight~ 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.760
 We move the screen down 

00:01:26.697 --> 00:01:28.697
 Ok, here is my Acer laptop 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.640
 Ok, now, it's here. Chromecast 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.940
 Let's just open the box. 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.700
 Let's see how to open it up. 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.880
 Hey~ this one~ tear it up~ 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.340
 Oh~ a little tight~ a little tight~ a little tight 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.520
 Lala Lala ~ La ~ 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.100
 Ok, (I don't know the sound), tear it off! 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.880
 Next to it~ It seems that there is nothing. 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.960
 Sticker, I stick~ throw one side... 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.260
 Ok, next, I am going to debut. 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.800
 appear 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.480
 Chromecast 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.340
 good stuff. Come, let's take a look, write here. 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.020
 Oh, it seems that I can’t shoot too much. 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.900
 First 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.420
 TV, plug in the TV 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.680
 Second, connect 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.060
 Third, enjoy 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.780
 It’s said that Chromecast is a small media streaming device. 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.260
 Can be plugged directly into the HDMI slot of the TV 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.420
 After finding your favorite entertainment on your smartphone, tablet or laptop 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.340
 You can zoom in directly to the TV screen. 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.400
 That is, it is a bit like this kind of thing~ 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.400
 Below is our mobile phone 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.020
 Part of this phone 

00:02:39.434 --> 00:02:41.434
 Then above it is our big screen 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.960
 He will let him share this directly through this device. 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.960
 Very fun~ 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.480
 Said above, he can be used 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.120
 Android phones, tablets, IPhone, IPad, Mac, Windows and Chromebooks can be used 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.180
 So that means, there is something on our App Store and on our Google Play. 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.780
 As for the following sections, I can’t disclose them. 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.880
 That would be funny (warranty problem~) 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.440
 Ok, put the box aside 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.280
 Next is our subject 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.400
 Let's take a look 喔~ 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.620
 Divine opening 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.380
噔噔 (sound) 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.660
 The main character appears 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.640
 Come, please see 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.080
 I picked it up 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.080
 Here 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.320
 Push hard 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.160
 The main character appears (Again) 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.020
噔噔噔噔 (sound) 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.120
 This one is our Chromecast 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.300
 Its head here is the HDMI connector we use. 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.400
 As for it~ because it is similar to our general computer device 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.980
 So he has a Micro USB slot behind his back. 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.780
 It must be connected to the USB to be charged (spoken) 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.120
 That is, you can start 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.160
 and then 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.780
 It seems to say that if your TV has a USB connector and can supply power, 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.680
 Then it can also be connected directly to the TV, no need to find a plug 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.880
 Then, our protagonist, let’s put aside 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.000
 Don't put this side first 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.140
 Come again, let's look at the accessories inside. 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.220
 The inside accessories have a USB cable 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:07.539
 Then, the charging connector 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.060
 Look at the charging connector 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.800
 Come, let's separate it 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.780
 Come, charging connector, USB cable 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.900
 Hello, USB cable, say hello to everyone~ 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.360
 Hello, everyone. 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.220
 Ok, next, the following optional accessories 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.400
 This is an extension of HDMI
