call interest to it it's not definition
but<00:01:41.369> it's<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.549> little<00:01:41.729> bit<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.909> interest<00:01:42.150> it's

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
but it's a little bit of interest it's

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.830 
but it's a little bit of interest it's
not<00:01:42.450> just<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:43.549> solid<00:01:44.549> fro<00:01:44.880> if<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.540> makes<00:01:45.750> any

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
not just a solid fro if that makes any

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.260 
not just a solid fro if that makes any
sense<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.439> will<00:01:47.100> be<00:01:47.369> doing<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.909> twist<00:01:48.149> out

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
sense I will be doing a twist out

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.609 
sense I will be doing a twist out
tonight<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.960> now<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.229> my<00:01:49.320> hair<00:01:49.530> is

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
tonight and now that my hair is

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.289 
tonight and now that my hair is
