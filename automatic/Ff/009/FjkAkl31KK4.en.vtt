00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:05.609
 sailor here dread and today we 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.680
 ends up for the third episode 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.960
 of a series of tutorials on aircraft 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.290
 helix helix who is a builder 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.199
 of planes and boats from beyond 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.490
 the chip team that you will find his link 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.289
 of two full minecraft in the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.520
 description of the video to be able to 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.289
 download all his planes 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.630
 just as it is necessary and here I am going 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.880
 show a third pythia before 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.560
 start the planes a little bigger a 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.020
 little more civil hop so here is the blow 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.670
 you will need only two three blocks 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.660
 different in fact 1,4 if we want to be 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.250
 a little more open for this plane beyond 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.129
 blocks of gray wool blocks of 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.530
 windows of the half of the two blocks of 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.649
 is the lily stone and 90.8 of 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.949
 tingwick and that's stone staircase 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.210
 bricks also of es9 carpet and 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.520
 gray wool and that's it so I'll go 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.960
 go around it's up to you 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.769
 show this again a very simple plane 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:09.450
 so here's hop we'll just leave 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.430
 behind and we'll do that 30 kg a block 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:17.970
 which we will take a bar 13 block 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:20.860
 from the east 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 11 12 13 years 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.110
 placed two blocks 2 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.280
 blacks in the dark not at all 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.860
 two windows a black at the level of here 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.050
 to be able to m 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.600
 the cockpit release and pulmo after one 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.790
 still takes the half blocks of stone 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.490
 lily and we put them six blocks back so 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.670
 one two three four five six sailboats 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.380
 in nasa and at the back we go 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.270
 to put 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.860
 there was something raised on it I 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.020
 did not know if you're something like that 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.890
 done for the tail and we will use the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.640
 stairs 2 ton of bricks 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.680
 this way pouf and popov so there we have 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.630
 really the middle of the plane the rest 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.440
 will be done then we have not yet 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.740
 thousand the how are called the stuff 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.410
 like that 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.930
 couples mold to do the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.010
 the skids the landing gear 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:20.150
 of the plane we will say and so suddenly we 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.200
 will make one below here boukoubi 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.920
 tractos 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.140
 and we're going to make wings in 2000 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.819
 block of stone bricks then we're going 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.030
 shift two in the back we will extend 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:38.760
 all this here sailing so if I plant myself 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:42.780
 to have that look true in these 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.080
 four wide so that's it and 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.880
 we will use the moors like this here 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.450
 all the way 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.390
 up to a point then I 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.450
 look a little but m my model so there 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.170
 is more than 2 a block on the front and not 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.870
 at all on the back 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.730
 so that's cool beyond a block to 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.090
 before we add a 2000 block to 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.099
 back here to add something like 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.780
 this pouf pouf pouf pouf pouf 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.120
 so here we have other forms of 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:18.569
 the ale we'll add something like that 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:22.010
 hop sailboats and we will use the carpets 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:28.349
 of gray wool to make the line up 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:31.349
 bof pouf pouf not looking to click 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:36.170
 Here properly limit my well meaning 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:38.370
 here or me not so much to do 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.329
 So that's the same thing 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.359
 the other side we put 4 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:49.499
 we put full blocks after aisne 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:51.150
 if you 're fine because what I want, we want them 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:56.069
 makes it pass one block east 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.019
 impeccable that's poor poor we add 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.340
 the semies the lily stone block on the 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.129
 above the trick because anyway 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.889
 not mess around we add the carpets on 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:08.159
 the wings here is once again a 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.269
 very simple tutorial and that's it 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.689
 would miss more than and flap their wings and 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:15.799
 we believe it even if the planes finally 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:17.729
 if your plane flaps its wings 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.829
 how are your links a little bit in 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.800
 the money 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.750
 so suddenly here on the sides of the 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.099
 tail we're going to make big talk 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.409
 like that I do not know how much is called 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:30.479
 this plane but he is funny 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:34.400
 see some big pale we'll put some 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:36.540
 carpet again on top ue 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.790
 for the poor 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.260
 I want to put even not too much 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.310
 it's above what it's not good 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.750
 that does not make good yes no maybe 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.170
 I improvise I do not have that on my model 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.390
 so I will avoid 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.820
 my faith we will put the trains 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.430
 landing at a block behind there the 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.630
 last block of the barca nation side 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.330
 you see one at the middle bar and 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:05.160
 departure for the front wings so the 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:07.910
 we are an interesting here and 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.910
 then here 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.400
 and we wait we finish handlebar lyon yes 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.930
 so suddenly they were braking me for 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.500
 the sides for the weapons of the coup 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:23.610
 I imagine they are here but otherwise he 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.650
 seems to me that pretty much everything yeah 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.259
 decidedly frame here so suddenly the 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.819
 armaments and back for the exit 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:35.969
 the rector imagines 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:38.789
 and then here is a small military plane 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:41.069
 an original hair compared to others 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:43.409
 you will tell me and then here is voila 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:45.030
 it was our was the three little 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.689
 we had the military coup that you 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.449
 I will have to offer you 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:52.800
 created by helix thank you very much helix 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.750
 do not hesitate to lecce kaesong and 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.099
 neck minecraft or all the others 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.020
 links that I would have put to go see 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:01.050
 these constructions his planes in the 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.000
 description of the video on this I you 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.560
 wish everyone a very good game good wind
