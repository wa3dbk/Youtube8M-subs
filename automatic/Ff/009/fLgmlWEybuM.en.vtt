quirky<00:02:20.050> this<00:02:20.440> is<00:02:20.590> just<00:02:20.740> how<00:02:20.860> CS<00:02:21.450> css3<00:02:22.860> can<00:02:23.860> be

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
quirky this is just how CS css3 can be

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.670 
quirky this is just how CS css3 can be
animated<00:02:25.150> or<00:02:25.510> transitional<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:26.380> what<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.530> want

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
animated or transitional so what I want

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.020 
animated or transitional so what I want
to<00:02:26.709> do<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:27.040> want<00:02:27.069> to<00:02:27.220> go<00:02:27.310> ahead<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.550> type<00:02:27.700> in

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
to do is I want to go ahead and type in

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.890 
to do is I want to go ahead and type in
I<00:02:28.890> can't<00:02:29.890> just<00:02:30.100> type<00:02:30.340> in<00:02:30.550> transition<00:02:31.450> that's<00:02:31.810> a

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
I can't just type in transition that's a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.650 
I can't just type in transition that's a
new<00:02:32.020> css3<00:02:32.500> property<00:02:33.100> I<00:02:33.250> need<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:33.970> inform<00:02:34.450> our

new css3 property I need to inform our

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.130 
new css3 property I need to inform our

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
to happen that's going to take one

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.500 
to happen that's going to take one
second<00:03:39.610> what<00:03:39.820> do<00:03:39.880> we<00:03:40.000> want<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.209> have<00:03:40.329> happen

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
second what do we want to have happen

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.990 
second what do we want to have happen
let's<00:03:41.410> go<00:03:41.530> ahead<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.769> rotate<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.609> so<00:03:42.790> we'll<00:03:42.910> do

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
let's go ahead and rotate it so we'll do

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.229 
let's go ahead and rotate it so we'll do
WebKit<00:03:45.120> WebKit<00:03:47.190> trance<00:03:49.170> formation<00:03:51.239> rotate

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
WebKit WebKit trance formation rotate

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:58.620 
WebKit WebKit trance formation rotate
and<00:03:52.570> we'll<00:03:53.079> do<00:03:53.320> a<00:03:54.180> complete<00:03:55.799> 360<00:03:57.120> degree<00:03:58.120> let's

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
and we'll do a complete 360 degree let's

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.490 
and we'll do a complete 360 degree let's
save<00:03:58.959> this<00:03:59.579> let's<00:04:00.579> reload<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.209> and<00:04:01.720> now<00:04:02.109> let's

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
save this let's reload it and now let's

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.780 
save this let's reload it and now let's
hover<00:04:03.459> over<00:04:03.850> it<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.829> didn't<00:04:05.829> work<00:04:05.950> let's<00:04:06.700> go

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
hover over it it didn't work let's go

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.860 
hover over it it didn't work let's go
back<00:04:06.940> to<00:04:06.970> did<00:04:07.600> it<00:04:07.660> work<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:09.310> didn't<00:04:09.579> work<00:04:09.870> okay

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
back to did it work it didn't work okay

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.420 
back to did it work it didn't work okay
so<00:04:10.930> what<00:04:11.320> are<00:04:11.530> we<00:04:11.709> doing<00:04:12.010> wrong<00:04:12.040> I<00:04:14.310> think<00:04:15.310> I

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
so what are we doing wrong I think I

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.670 
so what are we doing wrong I think I
know<00:04:15.489> what<00:04:15.730> I<00:04:15.760> messed<00:04:16.090> up<00:04:16.329> on<00:04:16.600> i<00:04:16.870> typed<00:04:17.560> in

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
know what I messed up on i typed in

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.259 
know what I messed up on i typed in
transformation<00:04:18.519> right<00:04:18.669> here<00:04:18.850> supposed<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.180> be

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
transformation right here supposed to be

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.449 
transformation right here supposed to be
just<00:04:19.450> transform

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
just transform

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:29.270 
just transform
trance<00:04:21.970> or<00:04:24.419> second<00:04:25.419> work<00:04:25.600> save<00:04:26.080> its<00:04:26.259> reload<00:04:26.620> it

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.610 

there<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.460> is<00:04:30.550> check<00:04:31.030> it<00:04:31.150> out<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:32.500> you<00:04:32.590> can

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
there it is check it out and you can

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.309 
there it is check it out and you can
change<00:04:32.949> up<00:04:33.099> the<00:04:33.190> timing<00:04:33.580> on<00:04:33.699> this<00:04:33.819> as<00:04:34.000> well<00:04:34.319> do

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:35.319 
change up the timing on this as well do

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.320 
change up the timing on this as well do
like<00:04:35.470> three<00:04:35.800> seconds<00:04:36.250> will<00:04:36.400> slow<00:04:36.610> it<00:04:36.639> down<00:04:36.759> for

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
like three seconds will slow it down for

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.939 
like three seconds will slow it down for
three<00:04:37.569> thousand<00:04:37.990> milliseconds<00:04:38.259> which<00:04:38.680> ever

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
three thousand milliseconds which ever

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.210 
three thousand milliseconds which ever
way<00:04:39.099> you<00:04:39.130> guys<00:04:39.250> want<00:04:39.430> to<00:04:39.490> look<00:04:39.610> at<00:04:39.699> it<00:04:41.220> it's

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
way you guys want to look at it it's

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.800 
way you guys want to look at it it's
going<00:04:42.340> to<00:04:42.430> go<00:04:42.520> all<00:04:42.669> slow<00:04:43.060> like<00:04:43.300> that's<00:04:43.599> kind<00:04:43.720> of

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
going to go all slow like that's kind of

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.150 
going to go all slow like that's kind of
