00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.410

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.979
 time spending so much time 21st century 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.010

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.700
 once I wanted to come in my 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.590

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.880
 searching for one oil and a drop in general 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.770

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.810
 my mom in contour she is a pharmacist 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.360
 I sought to slowly drank the funds 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.659
 because it contains very harmful 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.930
 hormonal substances are bimatoprost 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.909
 and you can call it differently 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.880
 prostaglandin I decided to look for some 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.000
 another drug that was contained 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.850

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:05.409
 general magic glance line 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:07.570
 There are three types of drugs but I 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:11.130
 chose the most effective and most 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.230

 comfortable brush forces. for mascara 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.110

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.390
 envelops everything and the ladder feels them 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:34.019

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:46.690
 I used magic glance and intense 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:51.100
 probably 9 places 4 1 in the text I noticed 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:54.750
 dinner 2 weeks after using the pier 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:59.170
 the effect lasted for three months 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:02.680
 magic glance is applied very intensively 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:06.600
 just like mascara on balakin all my 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.880
 cilia and protects them all night 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.519
 several advantages that I noticed when 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.739
 using magic glance intense 1 my 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:21.040
 eyelashes grew they became thicker became 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.880
 grow but began to grow new eyelashes 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.000
 eyelashes began to curl themselves I wrote 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:32.070
 generally use flooded to for eyelashes 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.690
 and the white tips darkened 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.930
 also magic glance is applied very 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.120
 quickly takes about 5 seconds and 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.920
 no side effects like 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.420
 for example from the oil I have no 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.930
 edema once I even drove 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.010
 rest and match eyes cheap dream you 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.260
 perfectly 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.599
 from UV rays they are not 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.090
 stolen as not damaged as it was 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.079
 earlier 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.900
 the only plus that I noticed 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:04.810
 magic glance is his price but one 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.890
 tube it contains 8 and 3 millimeters 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.769
 millimeter milliliter I have enough for 4 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.239
 months so i think it is quite 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.419
 acceptable price 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.789
 so I advise everyone to magic glance very 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.280
 good tool helped me a lot 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:25.110
 I hope my advice will help you too 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.110
 thanks to all the people
