the<00:00:05.549> line<00:00:06.919> now<00:00:07.919> this<00:00:08.069> has<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.309> true<00:00:08.730> single<00:00:09.210> coil

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
the line now this has a true single coil

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.480 
the line now this has a true single coil
tone<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:09.900> it<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.590> when<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:11.040> pop<00:00:11.280> these

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
tone in it that when you pop these

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.610 
tone in it that when you pop these
switches<00:00:11.820> up<00:00:12.120> its<00:00:12.360> dead<00:00:12.660> single<00:00:13.139> coil<00:00:13.380> and

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
switches up its dead single coil and

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.820 
switches up its dead single coil and
what<00:00:14.340> happens<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.570> disconnects<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.410> screw

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
what happens is it disconnects the screw

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.250 
what happens is it disconnects the screw
side<00:00:17.070> coils<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.699> adds<00:00:17.880> 1,500<00:00:18.630> turns<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:19.109> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
side coils and adds 1,500 turns to the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.439 
side coils and adds 1,500 turns to the
to<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.650> other<00:00:20.039> other<00:00:20.550> coil<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.060> it's<00:00:21.210> not<00:00:21.330> an

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
to the other other coil so it's not an

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.660 
to the other other coil so it's not an
anemic<00:00:21.869> single<00:00:22.170> coil<00:00:22.320> it's<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.529> real<00:00:22.740> simple<00:00:22.949> so

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
anemic single coil it's a real simple so

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.340 
anemic single coil it's a real simple so
