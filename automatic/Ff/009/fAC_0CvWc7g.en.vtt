Jo just toss it in and then so we want
this<00:04:32.760> to<00:04:32.910> be<00:04:32.940> mixed<00:04:33.360> through<00:04:33.570> but<00:04:33.810> we<00:04:33.930> don't

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
this to be mixed through but we don't

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.540 
this to be mixed through but we don't
want<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.410> be<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.560> bunch<00:04:34.830> of<00:04:34.950> mush

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
want it to be a bunch of mush

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.700 
want it to be a bunch of mush
that's<00:04:36.060> what<00:04:36.270> we<00:04:36.360> put<00:04:36.510> it<00:04:36.630> at<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.900> end<00:04:36.930> because

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
that's what we put it at the end because

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.620 
that's what we put it at the end because
the<00:04:37.950> Vitamix<00:04:38.370> is<00:04:38.490> not<00:04:38.760> only<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.030> fastest

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
the Vitamix is not only the fastest

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.570 
the Vitamix is not only the fastest
pleasure<00:04:39.870> of<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.110> market<00:04:40.440> than<00:04:40.560> 37<00:04:41.100> thousand

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
pleasure of the market than 37 thousand

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.610 
pleasure of the market than 37 thousand
rpm<00:04:41.910> but<00:04:42.510> it<00:04:42.630> doesn't<00:04:42.840> have<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:42.990> motor<00:04:43.140> like<00:04:43.500> it

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
rpm but it doesn't have a motor like it

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.440 
rpm but it doesn't have a motor like it
it<00:04:43.740> doesn't<00:04:43.860> have<00:04:43.950> a<00:04:44.070> load<00:04:44.250> on<00:04:44.460> it<00:04:44.670> and<00:04:45.330> it's

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
it doesn't have a load on it and it's

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.500 
it doesn't have a load on it and it's
also<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.840> slowest<00:04:46.320> it<00:04:46.860> goes<00:04:47.010> about<00:04:47.340> yeah<00:04:47.970> it's

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
also the slowest it goes about yeah it's

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.600 
also the slowest it goes about yeah it's
so<00:04:48.690> slowly<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.380> disturb<00:04:49.830> thousand<00:04:50.340> of<00:04:50.430> this

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
so slowly you disturb thousand of this

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.400 
so slowly you disturb thousand of this
and<00:04:51.000> you<00:04:51.120> can<00:04:51.270> do<00:04:51.360> most<00:04:51.570> it<00:04:51.780> while<00:04:51.990> you're<00:04:52.200> wet

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
and you can do most it while you're wet

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.560 
and you can do most it while you're wet
in<00:04:52.530> it<00:04:52.620> as<00:04:52.890> well<00:04:53.070> sort<00:04:53.640> of<00:04:53.850> if<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.120> tomatoes

that<00:05:30.830> those<00:05:31.340> pieces<00:05:31.759> are<00:05:32.150> not<00:05:32.300> all<00:05:32.479> chopped<00:05:32.840> up

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
that those pieces are not all chopped up

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.900

are very soft pieces they could easily

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.650 
are very soft pieces they could easily
be<00:05:36.620> annihilated<00:05:36.979> if<00:05:37.490> you<00:05:37.669> went<00:05:38.210> too<00:05:38.389> fast

government's this is the wonderful soup
but<00:05:50.960> remember<00:05:51.380> the<00:05:51.620> whole<00:05:51.860> thing<00:05:52.190> about<00:05:52.430> that

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
but remember the whole thing about that

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.330 
but remember the whole thing about that
the<00:05:52.759> beginning<00:05:53.180> this<00:05:53.300> we<00:05:53.509> were<00:05:53.949> boiling<00:05:54.949> the

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
the beginning this we were boiling the

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.999 
the beginning this we were boiling the
rice<00:05:55.370> and<00:05:55.819> oil<00:05:56.030> into<00:05:56.360> coconut<00:05:56.599> initially<00:05:57.560> that

rice and oil into coconut initially that

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.200 
rice and oil into coconut initially that
makes<00:05:58.310> it<00:05:58.460> completely<00:05:58.789> different

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
makes it completely different

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.600 
makes it completely different
consistency<00:05:59.930> that<00:06:00.440> makes<00:06:00.650> an<00:06:00.770> amazing<00:06:01.340> face

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
consistency that makes an amazing face

consistency that makes an amazing face
you<00:06:02.389> don't<00:06:02.509> have<00:06:02.780> to<00:06:03.020> boil<00:06:03.229> them<00:06:03.440> but<00:06:03.590> I<00:06:03.680> notice

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.009 
you don't have to boil them but I notice

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:06.100 
you don't have to boil them but I notice
it<00:06:04.159> does<00:06:04.340> change<00:06:04.639> though<00:06:05.000> I<00:06:05.330> didn't<00:06:05.870> want<00:06:06.020> to

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
it does change though I didn't want to

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.749 
it does change though I didn't want to
boil<00:06:06.259> the<00:06:06.500> other<00:06:06.650> advance<00:06:07.220> we<00:06:07.370> want<00:06:07.550> those<00:06:07.729> to

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 
boil the other advance we want those to

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.240 
boil the other advance we want those to
be<00:06:07.940> in<00:06:08.090> their<00:06:08.240> natural<00:06:08.389> state<00:06:08.860> so<00:06:09.860> there's<00:06:10.130> a

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
be in their natural state so there's a

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:21.760 
be in their natural state so there's a
five-time<00:06:11.150> soup

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.830
