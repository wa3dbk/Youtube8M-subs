hi and welcome to your sixth iOS

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.600 
hi and welcome to your sixth iOS
programming<00:00:06.410> tutorial<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.589> today<00:00:07.980> we<00:00:08.490> are

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
programming tutorial and today we are

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.400 
programming tutorial and today we are
going<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.910> be<00:00:09.030> looking<00:00:09.330> at<00:00:09.389> developing<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.200> very

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
going to be looking at developing a very

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.370 
going to be looking at developing a very
basic<00:00:10.710> web<00:00:11.190> browser<00:00:11.630> will<00:00:12.630> look<00:00:12.780> at<00:00:12.900> loading<00:00:13.290> a

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
basic web browser will look at loading a

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.950 
basic web browser will look at loading a
web<00:00:13.410> page<00:00:13.769> into<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.190> UI<00:00:14.400> web<00:00:14.700> view<00:00:14.730> as<00:00:15.330> shown<00:00:15.929> in

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
web page into a UI web view as shown in

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.140 
web page into a UI web view as shown in
the<00:00:16.170> simulator<00:00:16.619> here<00:00:16.890> will<00:00:17.400> just<00:00:17.550> load<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:17.940> a

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
the simulator here will just load in a

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.269 
the simulator here will just load in a
URL<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.779> we've<00:00:18.900> set<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.560> case<00:00:19.770> Google

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
URL that we've set in this case Google

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.279 
URL that we've set in this case Google
but<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.850> part<00:00:21.060> two<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.390> tutorial<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:22.260> will

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
but in part two of this tutorial we will

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.490 
but in part two of this tutorial we will
add<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> navigation<00:00:23.060> URL<00:00:24.060> search<00:00:24.449> text<00:00:25.170> field

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
add a navigation URL search text field

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.040 
add a navigation URL search text field
so<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.099> user<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.550> enter<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> URL<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.900> you

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
so the user can enter a URL like you

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.349 
so the user can enter a URL like you
might<00:00:28.230> find<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.650> Safari<00:00:29.039> application<00:00:29.789> by

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
might find in the Safari application by

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.640 
might find in the Safari application by
the<00:00:30.390> end<00:00:30.630> we'll<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.929> looking<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.320> bit<00:00:31.500> like

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the end we'll have a looking a bit like

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.290 
the end we'll have a looking a bit like
this<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:32.070> back<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.460> forward<00:00:32.759> buttons<00:00:33.090> and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
this with back and forward buttons and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.700 
this with back and forward buttons and
an<00:00:33.660> address<00:00:33.930> bar<00:00:34.399> so<00:00:35.399> let's<00:00:35.880> get<00:00:36.120> started<00:00:36.710> open

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
an address bar so let's get started open

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.930 
an address bar so let's get started open
up<00:00:37.980> Xcode<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.610> creating<00:00:39.030> new<00:00:39.059> application

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
up Xcode and creating new application

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.280 
up Xcode and creating new application
we're<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.270> create<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.570> single<00:00:42.960> View

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
we're just going to create a single View

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.299 
we're just going to create a single View
application<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:44.600> click<00:00:45.600> Next<00:00:46.050> I'm<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.250> to

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
application and click Next I'm going to

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.670 
application and click Next I'm going to
call<00:00:47.489> mine<00:00:47.700> webview<00:00:48.510> project<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.469> can

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
call mine webview project but you can

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.830 
call mine webview project but you can
call<00:00:49.770> yours<00:00:50.039> whatever<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.550> want<00:00:50.789> I'm<00:00:51.420> using

project and then go into your main
storyboard<00:00:59.399> storyboard<00:01:00.329> file<00:01:01.190> here<00:01:02.190> we're

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
storyboard storyboard file here we're

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.000 
storyboard storyboard file here we're
going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.789> drag<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> UI<00:01:03.449> webview<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:04.769> today

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
going to drag in a UI webview for today

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.560 
going to drag in a UI webview for today
we're<00:01:05.189> going<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.460> make<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> UI<00:01:05.880> webview<00:01:06.210> take

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
we're going to make the UI webview take

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.600 
we're going to make the UI webview take
up<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> whole<00:01:06.990> screen<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.100> part<00:01:08.400> 2<00:01:08.580> of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
up the whole screen but in part 2 of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.190 
up the whole screen but in part 2 of
this<00:01:08.820> tutorial<00:01:08.880> we'll<00:01:09.540> make<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.720> slightly

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
this tutorial we'll make it slightly

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.990 
this tutorial we'll make it slightly
smaller<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.890> fit<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.220> navigation<00:01:11.790> bar

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
smaller so we can fit the navigation bar

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.260 
smaller so we can fit the navigation bar
on<00:01:12.210> top<00:01:13.340> scroll<00:01:14.340> down<00:01:14.520> through<00:01:14.729> your<00:01:14.880> objects

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
on top scroll down through your objects

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.359 
on top scroll down through your objects
panel<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> right<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.229> your<00:01:16.380> screen<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.040> if

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.399 
panel on the right of your screen and if
you<00:01:17.460> don't<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.630> look<00:01:18.869> at<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.229> top

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
you don't see it have a look at the top

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.990 
you don't see it have a look at the top
right<00:01:19.619> corner<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:20.159> make<00:01:20.340> sure<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000

objects<00:01:21.360> panel<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.869> selected<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:23.220> isn't<00:01:23.700> it

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
objects panel is selected if it isn't it

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.980 
objects panel is selected if it isn't it
will<00:01:23.909> look<00:01:24.060> something<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.840> you'll

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
will look something like this and you'll

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.590 
will look something like this and you'll
just<00:01:25.110> need<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> click<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.860> show<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
just need to click on it to show the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.179 
just need to click on it to show the
webview<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.869> between<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.500> text<00:01:28.829> field<00:01:29.009> and

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
webview is in between the text field and

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.460 
webview is in between the text field and
the<00:01:29.310> map<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:30.420> looks<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.079> bit<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the map for you it looks a bit like the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.740 
the map for you it looks a bit like the
Safari<00:01:31.829> icon<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.729> click<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.270> drag<00:01:33.509> it

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
Safari icon so click on it and drag it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.929 
Safari icon so click on it and drag it
into<00:01:33.900> your<00:01:33.990> screen<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.560> soon<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.549> enters

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
into your screen as soon as it enters

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.039 
into your screen as soon as it enters
your<00:01:35.970> screen<00:01:36.390> region<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.869> should

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
your screen region it should

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.450 
your screen region it should
automatically<00:01:37.530> set<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.009> be<00:01:38.100> full<00:01:38.310> screen

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
automatically set it to be full screen

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.280 
automatically set it to be full screen
so<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.450> then<00:01:39.600> move<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.930> around<00:01:40.020> until

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
so you just then move it around until

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.830 
so you just then move it around until
it's<00:01:40.619> right<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.460> corners<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.689> that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
it's right in the corners of it so that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.359 
it's right in the corners of it so that
the<00:01:42.930> corners<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> webview<00:01:43.740> match<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.220> with

the first thing that'll come to mind is

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.339 
the first thing that'll come to mind is
how<00:05:53.550> can<00:05:53.760> you<00:05:53.849> finish<00:05:54.030> the<00:05:54.240> zoom<00:05:54.449> when<00:05:55.080> your

if you then click you can zoom in and up

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.270 
if you then click you can zoom in and up
by<00:06:03.330> dragging<00:06:03.840> on<00:06:03.960> the<00:06:04.020> one<00:06:04.680> circle<00:06:05.099> that<00:06:05.220> the

cursor appears in and the other cursor
will<00:06:07.650> pretty<00:06:07.860> much<00:06:08.039> act<00:06:08.310> like<00:06:08.669> the<00:06:09.080> absolute

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
will pretty much act like the absolute

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.500 
will pretty much act like the absolute
symmetrical<00:06:10.770> value<00:06:11.159> of<00:06:11.400> the<00:06:11.610> first<00:06:11.820> cursor<00:06:12.120> in

symmetrical value of the first cursor in

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.850 
symmetrical value of the first cursor in
that<00:06:12.930> way<00:06:13.020> you<00:06:13.110> can<00:06:13.229> zoom<00:06:13.440> in<00:06:13.590> and<00:06:13.710> out<00:06:13.800> like

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
that way you can zoom in and out like

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.339 
that way you can zoom in and out like
you<00:06:14.190> would<00:06:14.370> on<00:06:14.400> a<00:06:14.550> real<00:06:14.849> device<00:06:15.090> of<00:06:15.840> course<00:06:15.990> if
