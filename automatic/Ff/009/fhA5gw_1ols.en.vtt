00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
50 or so dollars just to get him in a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.699 
50 or so dollars just to get him in a
shinier<00:02:18.860> version<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:20.230> honestly<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.320> polished

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
shinier version and honestly I polished

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.350 
shinier version and honestly I polished
which<00:02:22.220> I've<00:02:22.340> gotten<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.760> regular<00:02:23.180> version

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
which I've gotten the regular version

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.720 
which I've gotten the regular version
because<00:02:24.370> he<00:02:25.370> has<00:02:25.519> a<00:02:25.549> major<00:02:25.760> flaw<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:27.730> see

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
because he has a major flaw and see

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
because he has a major flaw and see
right<00:02:28.880> here<00:02:29.060> uh<00:02:29.329> the<00:02:30.290> paint<00:02:30.590> easily<00:02:31.100> cuts<00:02:31.310> off

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
right here uh the paint easily cuts off

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.690 
right here uh the paint easily cuts off
so<00:02:32.750> it's<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.530> really<00:02:33.950> big<00:02:34.130> problem<00:02:34.370> if<00:02:34.579> you<00:02:34.670> make

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
so it's a really big problem if you make

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.069 
so it's a really big problem if you make
mistakes<00:02:35.000> or<00:02:35.600> you're<00:02:35.720> not<00:02:35.810> really

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
mistakes or you're not really

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.680 
mistakes or you're not really
experienced<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.130> I'm<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:38.090> don't<00:02:38.299> even<00:02:38.510> know

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
experienced and I'm I don't even know

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.810 
experienced and I'm I don't even know
how<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.840> get<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.110> paint<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:39.739> I'm<00:02:40.400> not<00:02:40.579> pro

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
how to get the paint so I'm not pro

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.650 
how to get the paint so I'm not pro
enough<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.209> do<00:02:41.329> that<00:02:41.510> yet<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:43.540> that's<00:02:44.540> the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
enough to do that yet and that's the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.030 
enough to do that yet and that's the
only<00:02:44.840> real<00:02:44.989> problem<00:02:45.290> is<00:02:45.380> all<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:45.590> them

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
only real problem is all of them

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.100 
only real problem is all of them
that's<00:02:47.000> only<00:02:47.120> because<00:02:47.239> it<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.690> special

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
that's only because it is a special

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.630 
that's only because it is a special
edition<00:02:48.170> too<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:51.350> unicorn

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
edition too and the unicorn

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.160 
edition too and the unicorn
did<00:02:53.480> indeed<00:02:53.900> come<00:02:54.350> with<00:02:55.420> decals<00:02:56.420> for<00:02:56.990> this

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
did indeed come with decals for this

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.390 
did indeed come with decals for this

mark<00:03:05.180> suburb<00:03:05.510> at<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:05.900> point<00:03:06.140> so<00:03:06.290> I<00:03:06.320> decided

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
mark suburb at that point so I decided

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.770 
mark suburb at that point so I decided
stickers<00:03:07.100> instead<00:03:07.460> still<00:03:08.390> really<00:03:08.930> nice<00:03:09.400> and

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
stickers instead still really nice and

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
he doesn't need articulation once again

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.760 
he doesn't need articulation once again
and<00:03:18.490> like<00:03:19.490> he<00:03:20.300> just<00:03:20.510> does<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.320> really<00:03:21.530> good<00:03:21.710> job

really the unicorn Gundam in unicorn

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.140 
really the unicorn Gundam in unicorn
mode<00:03:52.430> I<00:03:53.150> know<00:03:54.050> this<00:03:54.260> is<00:03:54.350> really<00:03:54.500> random<00:03:54.740> but

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
mode I know this is really random but

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.830 
mode I know this is really random but
the<00:03:56.290> articulation<00:03:57.290> is<00:03:57.350> pretty<00:03:57.530> much<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.800> same

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
the articulation is pretty much the same

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.770 
the articulation is pretty much the same
teachers<00:03:59.840> can't<00:04:00.019> use<00:04:00.140> his<00:04:00.260> beam<00:04:00.440> sabers<00:04:01.510> but<00:04:02.510> I

teachers can't use his beam sabers but I

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.870 
teachers can't use his beam sabers but I
really<00:04:03.620> like<00:04:03.739> this<00:04:03.890> guy<00:04:04.040> I<00:04:04.250> can't<00:04:04.580> say<00:04:04.790> it

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
really like this guy I can't say it

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.800 
really like this guy I can't say it
enough<00:04:06.100> and<00:04:07.100> just<00:04:07.850> for<00:04:08.030> size<00:04:08.269> comparing<00:04:08.690> a

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
enough and just for size comparing a

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.500 
enough and just for size comparing a
size<00:04:09.290> comparison<00:04:09.440> actually<00:04:10.330> finishing<00:04:11.330> it<00:04:11.450> up

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
size comparison actually finishing it up

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.479 
size comparison actually finishing it up
the<00:04:11.660> review<00:04:11.980> here's<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.100> Gundam<00:04:15.489> displayed

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
the review here's the Gundam displayed

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.530 
the review here's the Gundam displayed
and<00:04:16.760> see<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.090> size<00:04:17.510> difference<00:04:17.540> and<00:04:19.239> then<00:04:20.239> in

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
and see the size difference and then in

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.960 
and see the size difference and then in
compared<00:04:21.109> to<00:04:21.380> a<00:04:23.080> 1/100<00:04:24.080> no<00:04:24.680> grade<00:04:24.950> which<00:04:25.760> is

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
compared to a 1/100 no grade which is

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.230 
compared to a 1/100 no grade which is
actually<00:04:26.630> considerably<00:04:27.169> shorter<00:04:27.560> than<00:04:28.240> most

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
actually considerably shorter than most

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.950 
actually considerably shorter than most
taller<00:04:29.690> Gundams<00:04:30.230> and<00:04:31.070> he's<00:04:31.880> just<00:04:32.510> towers<00:04:32.840> over

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
taller Gundams and he's just towers over

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.560 
taller Gundams and he's just towers over
them<00:04:33.200> and<00:04:33.410> I<00:04:34.040> did<00:04:34.250> compare<00:04:34.640> if<00:04:34.850> you<00:04:35.210> did<00:04:35.360> see

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
them and I did compare if you did see

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.450 
them and I did compare if you did see
the<00:04:35.750> unboxing<00:04:36.260> video<00:04:36.590> you<00:04:37.190> saw<00:04:37.400> the

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
the unboxing video you saw the

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.310 
the unboxing video you saw the
comparisons<00:04:38.210> between<00:04:38.270> all<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.720> sizes<00:04:39.110> so<00:04:39.290> I

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
comparisons between all the sizes so I

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.430 
comparisons between all the sizes so I
already<00:04:39.919> basically<00:04:40.100> did<00:04:40.490> that<00:04:40.960> and<00:04:43.030> yeah<00:04:44.440> that

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
already basically did that and yeah that

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.240 
already basically did that and yeah that
just<00:04:45.740> about<00:04:45.950> wraps<00:04:46.010> up<00:04:46.400> my<00:04:46.520> review<00:04:46.550> and<00:04:48.250> just
