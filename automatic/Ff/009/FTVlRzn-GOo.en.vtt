an immediately after they broke the
frames<00:01:04.189> off<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:06.460> quite<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.490> lot<00:01:07.790> of<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.119> damage

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
frames off so quite a lot of the damage

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.600 
frames off so quite a lot of the damage
is<00:01:08.899> due<00:01:09.290> to<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:10.700> breaking<00:01:11.000> of<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.720> frame<00:01:12.610> this

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
is due to the breaking of the frame this

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.749 
is due to the breaking of the frame this
is<00:01:13.759> most<00:01:14.000> likely<00:01:14.420> water<00:01:14.979> that<00:01:15.979> has<00:01:16.250> made<00:01:16.729> this

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
is most likely water that has made this

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.690 
is most likely water that has made this
damage<00:01:17.690> on<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.200> low<00:01:18.409> side<00:01:18.770> of<00:01:19.039> the<00:01:19.190> screen<00:01:19.460> but

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
damage on the low side of the screen but

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.160 
damage on the low side of the screen but
we<00:01:19.880> didn't<00:01:20.180> know<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.690> could<00:01:20.869> have<00:01:21.020> been

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
we didn't know it could have been

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.420 
we didn't know it could have been
something<00:01:21.500> else

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.630 

well<00:01:28.430> first<00:01:28.700> of<00:01:28.790> all<00:01:28.910> was<00:01:29.210> very<00:01:29.450> very<00:01:29.870> happy<00:01:30.140> to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
well first of all was very very happy to

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.850 
well first of all was very very happy to
receive<00:01:31.640> a<00:01:31.880> painting<00:01:32.240> back<00:01:32.500> after<00:01:33.500> two<00:01:33.620> years

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
and then naturally there was there was

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.590 
and then naturally there was there was
obvious<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:38.510> we<00:01:38.660> have<00:01:38.870> work<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.500> do<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:41.390> can

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
obvious that we have work to do you can

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.290 
obvious that we have work to do you can
see<00:01:41.780> for<00:01:41.900> example<00:01:41.990> those<00:01:42.770> very<00:01:43.300> sharp

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
see for example those very sharp

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.230 
see for example those very sharp
scratches<00:01:45.260> into<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.920> paint<00:01:46.400> layer<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:47.000> a

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
scratches into the paint layer and a

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.960 
scratches into the paint layer and a

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.219 

all<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.330> paintings<00:01:53.869> we've<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.680> motif<00:01:55.070> are<00:01:55.369> on

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
all the paintings we've is motif are on

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
cardboard and the pastels as well so we

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.760 
cardboard and the pastels as well so we
we<00:02:00.920> have<00:02:01.130> quite<00:02:01.490> a<00:02:01.930> clear<00:02:02.930> intention<00:02:03.170> here<00:02:04.690> and

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
we have quite a clear intention here and

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.550 
we have quite a clear intention here and
paintings<00:02:06.770> are<00:02:06.950> not<00:02:07.159> bad<00:02:07.810> objects<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:09.140> mean

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
paintings are not bad objects I mean

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.110 
paintings are not bad objects I mean
they<00:02:09.860> do<00:02:10.280> change<00:02:10.610> with<00:02:11.150> time<00:02:12.940> normally<00:02:13.940> on<00:02:14.090> a

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
they do change with time normally on a

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.860 
they do change with time normally on a
micro<00:02:14.540> level<00:02:14.569> in<00:02:15.470> afterwards<00:02:16.180> those<00:02:17.180> changes

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
micro level in afterwards those changes

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.770 
micro level in afterwards those changes
became<00:02:18.560> visible<00:02:19.250> but<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.300> is<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.480> painting

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
became visible but this is a painting

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.290 
became visible but this is a painting
that<00:02:21.019> is<00:02:21.319> 100<00:02:21.950> years<00:02:21.980> old<00:02:22.459> so<00:02:22.819> it<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.150> actually

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
that is 100 years old so it is actually

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.980 
that is 100 years old so it is actually
an<00:02:23.630> old<00:02:24.050> piece
