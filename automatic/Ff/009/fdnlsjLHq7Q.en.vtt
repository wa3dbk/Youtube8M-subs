chokes<00:02:44.880> on<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.390> just<00:02:45.540> have<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.840> manually

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
chokes on this you just have to manually

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.280 
chokes on this you just have to manually
prime<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:47.329> when<00:02:48.329> I<00:02:48.360> picked<00:02:48.630> up<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.930> sled<00:02:49.140> it

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
prime it when I picked up the sled it

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.620 
prime it when I picked up the sled it
was<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.459> halfway<00:02:50.459> sunk<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.150> ground<00:02:51.209> and

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
was a halfway sunk in the ground and

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.220 
was a halfway sunk in the ground and
frozen<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:53.099> engine<00:02:53.430> was<00:02:53.579> seized<00:02:53.819> up

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
frozen and the engine was seized up

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.259 
frozen and the engine was seized up
after<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.260> got<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.620> home<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:55.980> had<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.000> lunch

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
after I got it home and had a lunch

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.180 
after I got it home and had a lunch
spell<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:57.840> found<00:02:58.829> out<00:02:59.010> the<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:01.019> motor<00:03:01.200> was<00:03:01.560> just

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
spell I found out the the motor was just

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.559 
spell I found out the the motor was just
filled<00:03:02.400> with<00:03:02.459> water<00:03:02.819> it<00:03:03.120> wasn't<00:03:03.450> actually

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
filled with water it wasn't actually

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.400 
filled with water it wasn't actually
seized<00:03:03.989> so<00:03:04.829> I<00:03:04.860> drained<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.280> out<00:03:05.430> last<00:03:05.670> year<00:03:06.090> and

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
seized so I drained it out last year and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.319 
seized so I drained it out last year and
surprisingly<00:03:07.410> enough<00:03:07.879> seem<00:03:08.879> to<00:03:09.030> turn<00:03:09.150> over

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
surprisingly enough seem to turn over

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.300 
surprisingly enough seem to turn over
smooth<00:03:09.720> fired<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.769> thing<00:03:10.980> up

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
smooth fired the thing up

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.860 
smooth fired the thing up
after<00:03:11.910> cleaning<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.239> carbs<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:12.630> all<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
after cleaning the carbs and all the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.449 
after cleaning the carbs and all the
maintenance<00:03:13.049> stuff<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.859> ran<00:03:14.760> pretty<00:03:14.970> good<00:03:16.459> so

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
maintenance stuff and ran pretty good so

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.069 
maintenance stuff and ran pretty good so
after<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:17.940> I<00:03:18.209> put<00:03:18.389> it<00:03:18.510> in<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.690> shed<00:03:18.870> for

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
after that I put it in the shed for

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.979 
after that I put it in the shed for
stored<00:03:19.590> over<00:03:19.829> summer<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:20.519> just<00:03:21.150> my<00:03:21.480> luck<00:03:21.750> a

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
stored over summer and I just my luck a

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.199 
stored over summer and I just my luck a
leak<00:03:22.470> in<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.709> lean-to<00:03:22.950> roof<00:03:23.459> happened<00:03:24.060> right

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
leak in the lean-to roof happened right

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.020 
leak in the lean-to roof happened right
above<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.829> center<00:03:25.829> of<00:03:25.889> the<00:03:26.010> hood<00:03:26.100> there<00:03:26.400> and

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
above the center of the hood there and

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.539 
above the center of the hood there and
it<00:03:27.150> filled<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.420> motor<00:03:27.660> up<00:03:27.840> with<00:03:27.959> water<00:03:28.230> again

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
it filled the motor up with water again

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.770 
it filled the motor up with water again
so<00:03:29.549> this<00:03:29.730> year<00:03:29.910> when<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.060> tried<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.389> fire<00:03:30.569> it<00:03:30.690> up

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
so this year when I tried to fire it up

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.890 
so this year when I tried to fire it up
the<00:03:30.900> motor<00:03:31.079> wasn't<00:03:31.440> frozen<00:03:31.650> again<00:03:32.660> so<00:03:33.660> we

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
the motor wasn't frozen again so we

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.430 
the motor wasn't frozen again so we
drained<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.380> out<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:35.959> it's<00:03:36.959> still<00:03:37.290> running

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
drained it out and it's still running

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.470 
drained it out and it's still running
somehow<00:03:37.980> waiting<00:03:38.730> for<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:38.910> rod<00:03:39.209> or<00:03:39.359> something

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
somehow waiting for a rod or something

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.849 
somehow waiting for a rod or something
to<00:03:39.840> come<00:03:39.959> through<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.230> side<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.620> block

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
to come through the side of the block

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.900 
to come through the side of the block
but<00:03:41.160> we'll<00:03:41.489> see<00:03:41.670> how<00:03:41.700> long<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.150> lasts

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
but we'll see how long it lasts

00:03:43.910 --> 00:04:14.160 
but we'll see how long it lasts
Killswitch<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.269> little<00:03:45.420> bit<00:03:45.510> broken

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:37.459 

they'll<00:04:14.770> I'm<00:04:14.980> in<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.340> deck

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:37.469 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:39.329 

hmmm<00:04:38.469> this<00:04:38.619> one<00:04:38.830> must<00:04:38.979> have<00:04:39.009> been<00:04:39.159> from

00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:39.339 
hmmm this one must have been from

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:41.639 
hmmm this one must have been from
south-central
