 No, the Belgian accompanied what happened exactly in the middle of midfield 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.520
 the United Emirates 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.390
 you do not believe 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.390
 perhaps explain the peak of the ehec wave 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.730
 they have no bells at 5 Elbe dapd it too early 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.330
 4 an upcoming would expect then mixed struck wrinkles and it will 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.480
 with each step you have to like 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.220
 Details can give 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.220

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.979
 Dr in the world 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:13.159
 This is 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.659
 it is 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:26.979
 SID 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.979
 after that yourself 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.569
 Naturally 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.309
 but he has 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.459
 because he 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.399
 OK 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:52.079
 he is 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.079

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:22.119
 Dr 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:32.089

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:36.919
 just older suitable is not will burden also there on the one hand 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.629
 As a team of coaches and president of Sony, I also wanted for 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.629
 stand at the top 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:46.299
 m 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.349
 We have a long breath in the neck two years but a different way 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.699
 go 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:51.779

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:53.839
 "He was in the race 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.839

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.199
 No no no no 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.889
 as a bit different but it was not as dangerous 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.570
 I'm interested in the sample it was fun but got now 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.020
 of course, enjoy 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.249
