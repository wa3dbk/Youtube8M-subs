00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.869 
out and I guess if you really needed to
store<00:02:28.349> more<00:02:28.650> stuff<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.189> could<00:02:29.430> ask<00:02:29.519> them<00:02:29.700> to

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
sail through the Caribbean one of the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.789 
sail through the Caribbean one of the
benefits<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.329> having<00:02:57.389> about<00:02:58.379> coming<00:02:58.650> back

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
benefits of having about coming back

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.789 
benefits of having about coming back
here<00:02:59.189> is<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.389> side<00:03:00.659> supports<00:03:01.319> are<00:03:01.500> at<00:03:01.650> an

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
here is that the side supports are at an

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.459 
here is that the side supports are at an
angle<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.579> that<00:03:02.700> gives<00:03:02.909> you<00:03:03.090> more<00:03:03.389> view<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:03.989> the

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:04.469 
angle so that gives you more view of the

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.330 
angle so that gives you more view of the
sky<00:03:04.769> both<00:03:05.700> during<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.299> day<00:03:06.419> and<00:03:06.799> at<00:03:07.799> night<00:03:07.829> I

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
sky both during the day and at night I

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.300 
sky both during the day and at night I
can<00:03:08.939> attest<00:03:09.299> that<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.989> perhaps<00:03:10.650> one<00:03:11.189> of

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
can attest that this is perhaps one of

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.909 
can attest that this is perhaps one of
the<00:03:11.400> best<00:03:11.760> places<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.659> ship<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.530> take<00:03:13.739> in

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
the best places on the ship to take in

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.000 
the best places on the ship to take in
the<00:03:14.069> stars<00:03:14.370> at<00:03:14.790> night<00:03:15.169> it's<00:03:16.169> also<00:03:16.319> not<00:03:16.560> so<00:03:16.769> bad

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
the stars at night it's also not so bad

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.030 
the stars at night it's also not so bad
during<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.849> day
