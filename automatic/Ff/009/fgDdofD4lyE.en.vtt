00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.310
 in the next reading what we are going to study is the following 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.860
 on the cross 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.999
 adocco has happened 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:10.999
 that many do not understand 

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:17.460
 what to do with this here I was in obvious Romanian Romania as well as 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.630
 four years and was preaching at the Taliban seminary 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.779
 and after preparing I went to the library of 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.320
 I've been looking at trying to find a book that I could read and I found 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.070
 a book 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.790
 that was called the crystal cross was not the book of yon stochino of another 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.820
 so that the book I started reading here is what I found in the book 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.390
 the author said 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.910
 god the father emiro from heaven 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:47.970
 and the 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.600
 I observe 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.600
 Dora the suffering of Christ on the cross 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.580
 spokespersons for 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.960
 both 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.450
 the Romans and the Jews and atheists looked at paco anxiety after the sky looked 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.590
 for Jesus on the cross and gave all the punishment he has suffered at the hands of 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.170
 the Romans 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.170
 and I still have what happened there 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.950
 by our market 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.630
 the conservative what he saw 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.630
 with payment to satisfy his justice 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.160
 it's a lie 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.800
 pfizer and king 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.280
 dsde 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.170
 mm 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.500
 when christ died on the cross 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.350
 good bush flight sisters 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.350
 they went on to finish brothers 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.480
 let's go first advance 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.000
 muñoz 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.420
 Christ up to the cross and that is the chrism 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.490
 and on the island the bush rafael 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.560
 my god my god bush who expresses 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.960
 ii now notice 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.260
 this edition those present 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
 and in helplessness to Jesus on the cross 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.779
 the father 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:17.499
 the father in helplessness the word also means amparano not rejection 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.979
 yes a very strong word 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:22.689
 the preachers says 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:27.669
 my god from the sky and looked at his son and still could not stand but 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:32.029
 suffering of his son and that's why no no I just could not believe that they are 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.029
 lies showed us that the iris writer is a lie 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.079
 the bible says that god 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:39.969
 do not 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:45.569
 they could watch more their son interest standing their son 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.949
 god saves maldonado 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:52.949
 In his opinion, the question is why 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.129
 let's go to salmons 22 I would know why 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.169

 they followed my god my god why do you make me covered 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.580
 because you are so far from my salvation and from the words of my cry 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:14.619
 that weighs 

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:19.129
 God because you have me samba rado of the messiah on the cross is crying out to God 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.630

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.969
 lagoon argued 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:32.769
 there it all began 4 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.879
 in you wait for our parents waited on their two pounds of shrimp 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.870
 there they were delivered they relied on Chinese out they were embarrassing you Christ is 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.510
 saying in the whole history of israel when a righteous man clamoring art 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:49.809
 they are two souls 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:53.019
 but the other said 'everything is silence' I love her 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.590
 from the cause but I in turn have stopped borja m 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.979
 the Persian response and again but this Holy Thursday 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.979

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:12.629
 and forests have stopped their son or daughter is not because he wanted to cause it 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.389
 Most Holy arrived ascer 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:21.189
 carola as sergeant and two both countries 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:24.020
 and as before ghana 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.810
 we have projects that we have says that god is here and man is 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.379
 finished god can not pass to man and there is a great separation between the two 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.189
 to close the separation in April 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:40.779
 outside the favorable presidency 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.759
 do not 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.759
 filled with god that is the beginning of creation 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.669
 before creation 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.300
 the father god 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.960
 and continues célestin 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.389
 there was minimal 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:56.520
 fellowship 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.520
 companionship absolutely part 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:08.059
 but it's the first time he does 

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:11.439
 unions them 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:13.180
 by hand before God 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.180
 time our roof 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.110

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.719
 the hypo jazeera 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:26.719
 a curse 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.569
 a bad combination 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.059
 you are you 

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:34.569

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:37.990
 before the conversion fact you are a population before God 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.899
 to save you someone had to die and instead as an abomination 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.759
 a curse country which took our sin 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.139
 your communion with god can 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.200
 among the providers because
