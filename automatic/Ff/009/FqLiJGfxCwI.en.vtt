00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.289 

you<00:02:45.920> can<00:02:46.069> see<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.310> spool<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.670> difference<00:02:47.209> you

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
you can see a spool of difference you

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.759 
you can see a spool of difference you
have<00:02:47.329> about<00:02:47.599> a<00:02:47.629> five-second<00:02:48.319> delay<00:02:48.409> between

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
have about a five-second delay between

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.470 
have about a five-second delay between
the<00:02:48.980> time<00:02:49.099> you<00:02:49.310> add<00:02:49.579> throttle<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.180> when<00:02:50.359> the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
the time you add throttle and when the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.569 
the time you add throttle and when the
engine<00:02:50.750> picks<00:02:50.989> up<00:02:51.200> its<00:02:51.349> power<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:52.250> if<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:52.489> have

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
engine picks up its power so if you have

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.250 
engine picks up its power so if you have
to<00:02:52.700> do<00:02:52.819> a<00:02:52.849> grout<00:02:53.150> go<00:02:53.390> around<00:02:53.689> you<00:02:53.989> got<00:02:54.170> to

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
to do a grout go around you got to

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:23.900 
to do a grout go around you got to
anticipate<00:02:54.530> some<00:02:55.069> drop

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.610
