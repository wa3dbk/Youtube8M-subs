00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.110
 earl 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:13.120
 I actually had the idea ten years ago 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.360
 the high-quality response to the American fast-food niche too 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.700
 but sometime three years ago I had found 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.560
 cooked for friends at home 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.180
 and then I was tired of wanting to actually pop up now ideal 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.730
 if all the food is automatic 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.659
 comes to the table 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:30.069
 our 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:33.279
 Overall concept actually consists of four pillars 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.620
 So the second pillar 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.690
 In addition to the transport system is then in principle uncertainty of their one can at 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.770
 Offer us ABS braking pulls you here 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.690
 different ends 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.930
 Drinking menus as well as submenus next to meat 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.060
 Fish dishes vegetarian salads and soups 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.750
 and then if at some point you just put that total order together in this one 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.900
 Form should wait to order now 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.290
 and then they are asked their tables or respectively 5 main point 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.770
 lying in front of him at the table is to give one that is to say they see 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.880
 Ultimately, the quarrel with the food supply electricity already from a distance 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.640
 Main color belongs to me 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.039
 the tabs - of course then use for other things 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.580
 and there are a lot of the innovations that have come to mind in us 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.580
 Restaurants have not been found worldwide 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.190
 like for example they have the possibility in our restaurant 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.490
 Friends card 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.729
 to get this is a kind of loyalty card 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.500
 where they ultimately 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.110
 for us to be torn out of anonymity and that is natural 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.110
 also transferred to large chains 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.360
 in Essen in our restaurant you can 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.290
 the restaurant the service the food and drinks the cleanliness and 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.110
 returned 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.110
 she lived card then she can for example also for it 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.230
 use in our restaurants they stand with us the place 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.230
 via SMS or e-mail over the recommendation 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.149
 We also have the opportunity to advertise with target group accuracy 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:15.040
 The data in it is going to exploit us for quality fluctuations immediately 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:19.749
 Hamas react for the first time in the gastronomy period based on data 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:24.299
 about customers and not only expensive he asked date data 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.180
 many friends have just then we have the opportunity on 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.400
 Months have been killed 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.970
 or as a thousand people 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.970
 had to watch and pay immediately 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:37.829
 It is all of our students 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.400
 in spite of rain at the table we also inform about the suppliers 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.400
 have as a concept also very high quality food 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.549
 What ultimately the third pillar actually is so understand 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.609
 fell back on organic products 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.429
 the slaughterhouses sent 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:56.659
 and percent cook everything themselves so everything is freshly prepared 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.809
 fourth pillar which is the whole rounded in principle we come from Franconia yes 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:07.819
 and percent of our goal is called the backes so that's one thing 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.119
 real potato pancakes he gives the whole name and this 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.899
 Franconian in the kilt courts, we then finally attract 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.049
 So food offer Israel 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.999
 British cuisine which is also funny that the menu is mandatory 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.359
 opened up for answers from this year 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.359
 behind the gate cyclist one hundred places 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.559
 at least 300 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:36.559
 and maximum round 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:40.559
 in total 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:43.999
 when millions of profit spend cards 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.269
 at the moment 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.170
 suddenly a garden wanted to be built on the outside 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.919
 and percent here 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.949
 have in front of this garden 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.339
 Eventually with an apple knew how to cover
