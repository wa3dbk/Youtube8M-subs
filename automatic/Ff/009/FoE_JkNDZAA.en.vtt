00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
start off with the gloom shrooms so you

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.050 
start off with the gloom shrooms so you
guys<00:01:04.619> may<00:01:04.860> know<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.189> glimpse<00:01:05.489> room<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.820> guys

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
guys may know the glimpse room you guys

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.429 
guys may know the glimpse room you guys
may<00:01:06.299> not<00:01:06.479> know<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.840> games<00:01:07.080> room<00:01:07.260> but

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
may not know the games room but

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.710 
may not know the games room but
basically<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.950> releases<00:01:08.880> heavy<00:01:09.090> fumes<00:01:09.450> into

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
basically it releases heavy fumes into

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.600 
basically it releases heavy fumes into
the<00:01:09.900> area<00:01:10.380> around<00:01:10.530> them<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> way<00:01:11.460> i'm

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the area around them so the way i'm

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.520 
the area around them so the way i'm
thinking<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.420> glimpse<00:01:12.780> room<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.290> obviously

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
thinking this glimpse room can obviously

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.039 
thinking this glimpse room can obviously
be<00:01:13.680> added<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:15.180> will<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.509> multiple

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
be added in and it will have multiple

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.570 
be added in and it will have multiple
targets<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.830> hit<00:01:16.950> multiple<00:01:17.400> targets

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
targets so it can hit multiple targets

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.730 
targets so it can hit multiple targets
that<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.689> plan<00:01:18.840> behind<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.350> there's

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
that is the plan behind that there's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.260 
that is the plan behind that there's
going<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.920> be<00:01:19.950> very<00:01:20.070> very<00:01:20.280> short<00:01:20.640> descriptions

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270

the<00:01:27.360> game<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.810> yep<00:01:28.040> first<00:01:29.040> one<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> list<00:01:29.579> was

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the game so yep first one the list was

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.760 
the game so yep first one the list was
the<00:01:29.820> glooms<00:01:30.030> room<00:01:30.270> now<00:01:30.930> moving<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the glooms room now moving on to the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.200 
the glooms room now moving on to the
second<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.310> called<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> hypno<00:01:32.909> shroom

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
second one is called the hypno shroom

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.359 
second one is called the hypno shroom
there's<00:01:33.689> gonna<00:01:33.869> be<00:01:33.960> an<00:01:34.020> interesting<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.680> it's

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
there's gonna be an interesting one it's

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.770 
there's gonna be an interesting one it's
gonna<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.640> very<00:01:35.670> risky<00:01:36.270> plant<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.689> plant

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
gonna be a very risky plant to plant

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.359 
gonna be a very risky plant to plant
down<00:01:37.079> but<00:01:37.530> i<00:01:37.560> think<00:01:37.770> could<00:01:37.890> be<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> really<00:01:38.159> cool

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
down but i think could be a really cool

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.850 
down but i think could be a really cool
one<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.150> says<00:01:39.450> when<00:01:39.630> eaten<00:01:39.990> hypno<00:01:40.560> shrooms

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
one so it says when eaten hypno shrooms

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.800 
one so it says when eaten hypno shrooms
will<00:01:41.250> make<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.610> zombie<00:01:41.790> turn<00:01:42.180> around<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.630> fight

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
will make a zombie turn around and fight

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
to see but then again you could be

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.270 
to see but then again you could be
unlucky<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.110> might<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.380> be<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> typical<00:02:01.829> spawn

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
that would be really cool to see in the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.749 
that would be really cool to see in the
game<00:02:07.530> it's<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.829> very<00:02:08.009> risky<00:02:08.129> plant<00:02:08.610> but

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
game it's a very risky plant but

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.130 
game it's a very risky plant but
nevertheless<00:02:08.940> that'd<00:02:09.300> be<00:02:09.420> really<00:02:09.629> called<00:02:09.899> sea

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
nevertheless that'd be really called sea

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.780 
nevertheless that'd be really called sea
Yeti<00:02:10.410> fighting<00:02:11.280> for<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.489> here<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:11.910> there

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
now the next one the list is another

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.459 
now the next one the list is another
weird<00:02:15.370> one<00:02:15.459> but<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.840> really<00:02:17.140> cool<00:02:17.290> idea

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
weird one but it is a really cool idea

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.550 
weird one but it is a really cool idea
now<00:02:18.159> this<00:02:18.489> plant<00:02:18.849> is<00:02:19.030> called<00:02:19.629> the<00:02:19.840> imitator

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
now this plant is called the imitator

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.949 
now this plant is called the imitator
and<00:02:20.950> basically<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.939> imitator<00:02:22.299> will<00:02:22.750> let<00:02:22.870> you

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
and basically the imitator will let you

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.750 
and basically the imitator will let you
use<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.409> the<00:02:23.620> same<00:02:23.799> plant<00:02:24.099> during<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.459> level

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
use to the same plant during the level

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.399 
use to the same plant during the level
that<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.239> where<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.599> eating<00:02:25.870> plants<00:02:26.170> this<00:02:26.260> is

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
that is where is eating plants this is

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.190 
that is where is eating plants this is
on<00:02:26.530> me<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:26.829> I'm<00:02:26.950> thinking<00:02:27.459> in<00:02:27.750> ously<00:02:28.750> instead

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
on me so I'm thinking in ously instead

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.470 
on me so I'm thinking in ously instead
of<00:02:29.319> just<00:02:29.470> one<00:02:29.620> potted<00:02:29.890> plant<00:02:30.250> it<00:02:30.849> makes<00:02:31.150> two

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
of just one potted plant it makes two

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.899 
of just one potted plant it makes two
just<00:02:31.959> for<00:02:32.079> that<00:02:32.109> so<00:02:32.709> yet<00:02:32.920> for<00:02:33.430> obviously<00:02:33.670> one

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
just for that so yet for obviously one

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.000 
just for that so yet for obviously one
round<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.359> will<00:02:34.540> give<00:02:34.659> you<00:02:34.780> two<00:02:34.989> plants<00:02:35.500> for

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
round it will give you two plants for

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.800 
round it will give you two plants for
the<00:02:36.069> price<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.310> one<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.849> say<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.060> select<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.629> nice

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
the price of one to say I select a nice

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.470 
the price of one to say I select a nice
room<00:02:38.250> they<00:02:39.250> will<00:02:39.430> then<00:02:39.549> place<00:02:39.819> down<00:02:40.090> in<00:02:40.120> that

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
room they will then place down in that

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.869 
room they will then place down in that
position<00:02:40.629> to<00:02:41.560> ice<00:02:41.859> shrooms<00:02:42.219> rather<00:02:42.519> than<00:02:42.700> one

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
position to ice shrooms rather than one

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.490 
position to ice shrooms rather than one
ice<00:02:43.090> cream<00:02:43.299> meaning<00:02:43.750> you've<00:02:44.109> pretty<00:02:44.319> much<00:02:44.409> got

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
ice cream meaning you've pretty much got

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.710 
ice cream meaning you've pretty much got
two<00:02:44.920> plants<00:02:45.310> protecting<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:45.790> side<00:02:46.150> that

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
two plants protecting that side that

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.059 
two plants protecting that side that
would<00:02:46.840> be<00:02:46.959> another<00:02:47.170> really<00:02:47.349> cool<00:02:47.560> idea<00:02:47.709> so

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
would be another really cool idea so

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.160 
would be another really cool idea so
yeah<00:02:48.220> guys<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.639> was<00:02:49.060> one<00:02:49.209> of<00:02:49.239> them<00:02:49.450> now<00:02:49.989> when

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170

we move on to the next one and that is
the<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.269> don't<00:02:52.780> know<00:02:52.840> how<00:02:52.989> people<00:02:53.409> say<00:02:53.439> this<00:02:53.769> so

zombies<00:03:04.060> garden<00:03:04.180> warfare<00:03:04.359> jalapeno<00:03:05.319> can<00:03:05.650> have

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
zombies garden warfare jalapeno can have

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.830 
zombies garden warfare jalapeno can have
a<00:03:05.799> massive<00:03:06.069> damage<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:06.819> it's<00:03:07.150> ranges<00:03:07.510> every

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
a massive damage and it's ranges every

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.990 
a massive damage and it's ranges every
zombie<00:03:07.989> around<00:03:08.439> at<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.829> time<00:03:08.889> once<00:03:09.579> again<00:03:09.700> a

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
zombie around at that time once again a

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.080 
zombie around at that time once again a
single-use<00:03:10.629> plant<00:03:11.019> so<00:03:11.609> after<00:03:12.609> the<00:03:12.700> one<00:03:12.849> round

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
single-use plant so after the one round

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.210 
single-use plant so after the one round
it<00:03:13.329> probably<00:03:13.629> go<00:03:13.840> or<00:03:14.109> obviously<00:03:14.739> if<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.040> gets

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
it probably go or obviously if it gets

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.949 
it probably go or obviously if it gets
close<00:03:15.459> enough<00:03:15.489> it<00:03:15.879> can<00:03:15.970> have<00:03:16.090> really<00:03:16.389> weak

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
close enough it can have really weak

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.509 
close enough it can have really weak
health<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:17.440> obviously<00:03:17.680> it's<00:03:17.829> easy<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.310> pick

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
health so obviously it's easy to pick

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.399 
health so obviously it's easy to pick
off<00:03:18.699> and<00:03:18.940> destroy<00:03:19.239> once<00:03:19.750> people<00:03:19.989> can<00:03:20.290> actually

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
off and destroy once people can actually

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.469 
off and destroy once people can actually
get<00:03:20.829> close<00:03:21.099> to<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:22.060> yeah<00:03:22.120> that's<00:03:22.239> another

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:22.479 
get close to it so yeah that's another

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.270 
get close to it so yeah that's another
one<00:03:22.720> now<00:03:23.440> going<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.650> be<00:03:23.709> moving<00:03:23.829> on<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.250> the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
one now going to be moving on to the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.819 
one now going to be moving on to the
next<00:03:24.579> one<00:03:24.639> which<00:03:24.970> is<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.389> colonel<00:03:25.900> poll<00:03:26.650> I

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
next one which is the colonel poll I

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.710 
next one which is the colonel poll I
believe<00:03:27.099> it's<00:03:27.250> lame<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.549> and<00:03:27.940> basically<00:03:28.299> the

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
believe it's lame it and basically the

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.659 
believe it's lame it and basically the
idea<00:03:28.750> behind<00:03:29.199> this<00:03:29.470> once<00:03:29.769> again<00:03:29.919> is<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.400> flings

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
idea behind this once again is it flings

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.939 
idea behind this once again is it flings
corn<00:03:31.030> kernels<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.690> butter<00:03:32.260> at<00:03:32.409> zombie<00:03:32.799> so

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:32.949 
corn kernels and butter at zombie so

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:36.210 
corn kernels and butter at zombie so
yeah<00:03:33.099> butter<00:03:33.370> they<00:03:34.090> see<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.359> new<00:03:34.629> goop<00:03:35.220> living

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
yeah butter they see a new goop living

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.319 
yeah butter they see a new goop living
about<00:03:36.459> that<00:03:36.609> there<00:03:36.790> could<00:03:36.940> be<00:03:36.970> a<00:03:37.060> butter

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
about that there could be a butter

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.240 
about that there could be a butter
Chomper<00:03:37.840> coming<00:03:38.109> out<00:03:38.229> you<00:03:38.500> know<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:39.099> could

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
Chomper coming out you know that could

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.349 
Chomper coming out you know that could
be<00:03:39.310> in<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.430> variety<00:03:39.609> I<00:03:39.760> can<00:03:39.970> do<00:03:40.060> in<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.150> future

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
be in a variety I can do in the future

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.199 
be in a variety I can do in the future
be<00:03:40.659> able<00:03:41.069> so<00:03:42.069> basically<00:03:42.340> my<00:03:42.489> idea<00:03:42.819> behind<00:03:42.970> this

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
be able so basically my idea behind this

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.849 
be able so basically my idea behind this
is<00:03:43.389> the<00:03:43.780> colonel<00:03:44.109> poll<00:03:44.290> obviously<00:03:44.650> files

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
is the colonel poll obviously files

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.770 
is the colonel poll obviously files
kernels<00:03:45.459> and<00:03:45.639> we're<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.449> it<00:03:46.510> will<00:03:46.629> have<00:03:46.750> a

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
kernels and we're and it will have a

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.569 
kernels and we're and it will have a
light<00:03:47.049> damage<00:03:47.319> in<00:03:47.620> butter<00:03:47.859> coop<00:03:48.159> so<00:03:48.400> we'll

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
light damage in butter coop so we'll

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.699 
light damage in butter coop so we'll
gupta<00:03:48.909> zombies<00:03:49.269> with<00:03:49.750> butters<00:03:50.199> slowing<00:03:50.590> them

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
gupta zombies with butters slowing them

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:51.930 
gupta zombies with butters slowing them
down<00:03:50.739> and<00:03:51.099> obviously<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.519> will<00:03:51.579> keep<00:03:51.760> on

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
down and obviously it will keep on

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.479 
down and obviously it will keep on
hitting<00:03:52.180> them<00:03:52.269> with<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:53.260> low<00:03:53.560> amount<00:03:53.979> of<00:03:54.099> damage

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
hitting them with a low amount of damage

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.069 
hitting them with a low amount of damage
but<00:03:55.090> yeah<00:03:55.209> that'd<00:03:55.449> be<00:03:55.479> a<00:03:55.569> really<00:03:55.750> cool<00:03:55.959> idea

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
but yeah that'd be a really cool idea

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.539 
but yeah that'd be a really cool idea
because<00:03:56.439> obviously<00:03:56.530> you've<00:03:56.829> got<00:03:57.040> two<00:03:57.310> for<00:03:57.459> the

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
because obviously you've got two for the

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.580 
because obviously you've got two for the
price<00:03:57.669> of<00:03:57.760> one<00:03:58.090> there<00:03:58.329> now<00:03:58.959> moving<00:03:59.229> on<00:03:59.379> to<00:03:59.409> the

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.740 
there's another good idea they're
obviously<00:04:27.970> at<00:04:28.120> last<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.360> little<00:04:28.450> bit<00:04:28.540> longer

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
obviously at last a little bit longer

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.210 
obviously at last a little bit longer
because<00:04:28.870> it's<00:04:29.080> got<00:04:29.170> the<00:04:29.320> nut<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:29.500> as<00:04:29.889> you<00:04:30.040> know

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
because it's got the nut and as you know

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.100 
because it's got the nut and as you know
the<00:04:30.639> walnuts<00:04:31.000> tour<00:04:31.360> nuts<00:04:31.570> are<00:04:31.840> obviously

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
the walnuts tour nuts are obviously

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.420 
the walnuts tour nuts are obviously
quite<00:04:32.290> hard<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.590> destroy<00:04:32.950> so<00:04:33.190> yep<00:04:33.400> that's

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
quite hard to destroy so yep that's

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.180 
quite hard to destroy so yep that's
another<00:04:34.180> core<00:04:34.360> idea<00:04:34.660> now<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.560> next<00:04:35.770> one<00:04:35.919> is

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
another core idea now the next one is

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.159 
another core idea now the next one is
the<00:04:36.250> sea<00:04:36.760> shroom<00:04:37.120> now<00:04:37.540> this<00:04:37.690> one's<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:37.960> weird

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
the sea shroom now this one's a weird

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.720 
the sea shroom now this one's a weird
one<00:04:38.350> because<00:04:38.500> obviously<00:04:38.770> it<00:04:39.070> depends<00:04:39.430> on<00:04:39.639> what

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
one because obviously it depends on what

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.159 
one because obviously it depends on what
you're<00:04:39.850> doing<00:04:40.090> but<00:04:40.240> seamless<00:04:40.750> I've<00:04:40.900> got

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
you're doing but seamless I've got

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.200 
you're doing but seamless I've got
something<00:04:41.680> relating<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.400> Walter<00:04:42.850> come<00:04:43.000> in<00:04:43.090> the

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
something relating to Walter come in the

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.940 
something relating to Walter come in the
future<00:04:43.360> maybe<00:04:43.630> a<00:04:43.780> water<00:04:44.020> map<00:04:44.290> i'm<00:04:44.500> thinking<00:04:44.860> of

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
future maybe a water map i'm thinking of

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.990 
future maybe a water map i'm thinking of
to<00:04:45.430> do<00:04:45.550> with<00:04:45.760> a<00:04:45.850> special<00:04:46.270> dlc<00:04:47.910> obviously<00:04:48.910> this

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
to do with a special dlc obviously this

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.430 
to do with a special dlc obviously this
one<00:04:49.210> could<00:04:49.419> be<00:04:49.450> a<00:04:49.540> good<00:04:49.780> way<00:04:49.990> to<00:04:50.020> incorporate

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
one could be a good way to incorporate

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.770 
one could be a good way to incorporate
it<00:04:50.830> but<00:04:50.919> basically<00:04:51.040> it<00:04:51.790> says<00:04:52.000> see<00:04:52.270> shrooms<00:04:52.600> are

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
it but basically it says see shrooms are

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.110 
it but basically it says see shrooms are
aquatic<00:04:53.110> plants<00:04:53.710> I<00:04:53.860> might<00:04:54.730> have<00:04:54.820> said<00:04:54.970> that

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
aquatic plants I might have said that

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.210 
aquatic plants I might have said that
correctly<00:04:55.450> or<00:04:55.870> not<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.380> that<00:04:56.919> shoots

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
correctly or not and that shoots

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.430 
correctly or not and that shoots
short-range<00:04:57.760> spores<00:04:58.330> but<00:04:58.840> yeah<00:04:59.020> as<00:04:59.230> I<00:04:59.290> said

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
short-range spores but yeah as I said

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.860 
short-range spores but yeah as I said
maybe<00:05:00.070> it<00:05:00.430> could<00:05:00.610> fire<00:05:00.820> bubbles<00:05:01.390> instead<00:05:01.780> of

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
maybe it could fire bubbles instead of

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.659 
maybe it could fire bubbles instead of
spores<00:05:02.140> which<00:05:02.710> is<00:05:02.890> why<00:05:03.040> I<00:05:03.070> will<00:05:03.460> be<00:05:03.550> getting

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
spores which is why I will be getting

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.270 
spores which is why I will be getting
into<00:05:04.090> my<00:05:04.330> deal<00:05:04.540> see<00:05:04.810> probably<00:05:05.560> in<00:05:05.800> the<00:05:06.010> next

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
and will do because it is a very good

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.440 
and will do because it is a very good
cause<00:05:13.900> so<00:05:14.500> yeah<00:05:14.860> now<00:05:15.760> we're<00:05:16.000> moving<00:05:16.120> on<00:05:16.240> to<00:05:16.300> the

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
cause so yeah now we're moving on to the

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.270 
cause so yeah now we're moving on to the
next<00:05:16.630> one<00:05:16.720> and<00:05:16.990> this<00:05:17.110> is<00:05:17.260> the<00:05:17.380> squash<00:05:17.710> now<00:05:18.250> a

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
next one and this is the squash now a

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.560 
next one and this is the squash now a
lot<00:05:18.430> of<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:18.640> should<00:05:18.910> know<00:05:19.090> what<00:05:19.270> the<00:05:19.330> squash

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
lot of you should know what the squash

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.180 
lot of you should know what the squash
is<00:05:19.600> I<00:05:19.750> thinking<00:05:20.080> by<00:05:20.229> a<00:05:20.260> cuddly<00:05:20.560> toy<00:05:20.620> version<00:05:21.100> of

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
is I thinking by a cuddly toy version of

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.750 
is I thinking by a cuddly toy version of
it<00:05:21.280> now<00:05:21.430> so<00:05:22.270> yeah<00:05:22.600> now<00:05:23.560> basically<00:05:23.800> and<00:05:24.220> the

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
it now so yeah now basically and the

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.700 
it now so yeah now basically and the
squashes<00:05:25.240> will<00:05:25.510> squash<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:26.139> first<00:05:26.350> on<00:05:26.590> me

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
squashes will squash the first on me

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.070 
squashes will squash the first on me
that<00:05:26.830> it<00:05:26.889> gets<00:05:27.070> close<00:05:27.370> to<00:05:27.400> so<00:05:28.270> when<00:05:28.750> I<00:05:28.780> looked

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
that it gets close to so when I looked

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.780 
that it gets close to so when I looked
on<00:05:29.290> there<00:05:29.470> I<00:05:29.500> thought<00:05:29.800> to<00:05:29.979> myself<00:05:30.010> why<00:05:30.520> dump

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
on there I thought to myself why dump

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.090 
on there I thought to myself why dump
the<00:05:30.940> squash<00:05:31.240> hit<00:05:31.780> all<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:32.050> zombies<00:05:32.229> around<00:05:32.680> it

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
the squash hit all the zombies around it

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.790 
the squash hit all the zombies around it
and<00:05:33.280> then<00:05:33.729> obviously<00:05:33.910> it<00:05:34.210> lands<00:05:34.660> there<00:05:34.870> and<00:05:35.080> it

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
and then obviously it lands there and it

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.440 
and then obviously it lands there and it
does<00:05:35.979> massive<00:05:36.430> damage<00:05:36.669> but<00:05:37.030> obviously<00:05:37.240> it's<00:05:37.390> a

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
does massive damage but obviously it's a

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.630 
does massive damage but obviously it's a
very<00:05:37.630> close<00:05:37.900> range<00:05:38.229> plant<00:05:38.620> it's<00:05:39.340> also<00:05:39.490> a

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
very close range plant it's also a

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.370 
very close range plant it's also a
single<00:05:39.970> use<00:05:40.120> plants<00:05:40.419> so<00:05:40.479> no<00:05:40.630> risk<00:05:40.930> plant<00:05:41.260> I

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
single use plants so no risk plant I

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.050 
single use plants so no risk plant I
think<00:05:41.680> I<00:05:41.770> be<00:05:42.070> really<00:05:42.370> cool<00:05:42.520> to<00:05:42.580> bring<00:05:42.820> to<00:05:42.970> the

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
think I be really cool to bring to the

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.300 
think I be really cool to bring to the
game<00:05:43.090> plan<00:05:43.750> so<00:05:43.810> it's<00:05:44.080> only<00:05:44.229> last<00:05:44.620> so<00:05:44.890> long<00:05:44.919> and

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
game plan so it's only last so long and

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.490 
game plan so it's only last so long and
all<00:05:45.340> how<00:05:45.520> or<00:05:45.760> have<00:05:45.940> a<00:05:45.970> single<00:05:46.330> use<00:05:46.539> their<00:05:47.020> risky

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
all how or have a single use their risky

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.000 
all how or have a single use their risky
but<00:05:47.890> obviously<00:05:48.160> they<00:05:48.280> will<00:05:48.430> pay<00:05:48.610> off<00:05:48.789> so<00:05:49.720> yeah

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
but obviously they will pay off so yeah

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.500 
but obviously they will pay off so yeah
now<00:05:51.010> the<00:05:51.070> next<00:05:51.160> one<00:05:51.370> on<00:05:51.490> my<00:05:51.640> list<00:05:51.789> I've<00:05:52.120> only

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
now the next one on my list I've only

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.090 
now the next one on my list I've only
got<00:05:52.780> free<00:05:53.169> left<00:05:53.380> and<00:05:53.560> obviously<00:05:53.770> this<00:05:53.919> is<00:05:54.070> the

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
got free left and obviously this is the

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.730 
got free left and obviously this is the
third<00:05:54.340> one<00:05:54.580> and<00:05:54.789> the<00:05:55.660> staff<00:05:55.990> room<00:05:56.289> now<00:05:56.710> I

third one and the staff room now I

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.020 
third one and the staff room now I
didn't<00:05:56.950> even<00:05:57.010> know<00:05:57.190> this<00:05:57.340> was<00:05:57.400> an<00:05:57.760> actual

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
didn't even know this was an actual

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.140 
didn't even know this was an actual
thing<00:05:58.870> but<00:05:59.169> yet<00:05:59.350> it<00:05:59.530> is<00:05:59.650> and<00:05:59.919> star<00:06:00.729> fruit<00:06:00.910> shoot

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
thing but yet it is and star fruit shoot

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.240 
thing but yet it is and star fruit shoot
stars<00:06:01.479> in<00:06:01.660> five<00:06:01.840> directions<00:06:02.289> so<00:06:02.800> as<00:06:02.830> I<00:06:03.070> said

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
stars in five directions so as I said

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.670 
stars in five directions so as I said
it's<00:06:03.700> a<00:06:03.789> multi-target<00:06:04.450> once<00:06:05.380> again

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
it's a multi-target once again

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.219 
it's a multi-target once again
multi-target<00:06:06.580> and<00:06:07.270> shewed<00:06:07.539> stars<00:06:07.900> I've<00:06:08.080> see

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
multi-target and shewed stars I've see

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:10.140 
multi-target and shewed stars I've see
these<00:06:08.380> styles<00:06:08.710> won't<00:06:08.860> be<00:06:09.010> some<00:06:09.460> effective<00:06:09.970> I

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
these styles won't be some effective I

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.640 
these styles won't be some effective I
don't<00:06:10.360> think<00:06:10.539> they<00:06:10.660> were<00:06:10.720> very<00:06:11.169> effective<00:06:11.380> in

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
don't think they were very effective in

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.070 
don't think they were very effective in
the<00:06:11.770> actual<00:06:12.220> game<00:06:12.250> it<00:06:12.640> was<00:06:12.789> from<00:06:13.030> but<00:06:13.870> it

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
the actual game it was from but it

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.080 
the actual game it was from but it
shoots<00:06:14.530> stars<00:06:14.890> in<00:06:15.160> five<00:06:15.370> directions<00:06:15.760> so<00:06:16.030> it

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
shoots stars in five directions so it

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.360 
shoots stars in five directions so it
can<00:06:16.240> pick<00:06:16.360> up<00:06:16.479> five<00:06:16.750> zombies<00:06:17.020> at<00:06:17.350> a<00:06:17.410> time<00:06:17.830> which

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
can pick up five zombies at a time which

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.540 
can pick up five zombies at a time which
is<00:06:18.550> obviously<00:06:19.060> really<00:06:19.300> cool<00:06:19.919> now<00:06:20.919> is<00:06:21.070> a<00:06:21.100> no<00:06:21.310> one

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
is obviously really cool now is a no one

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.190 
is obviously really cool now is a no one
which<00:06:21.789> obviously<00:06:22.090> a<00:06:22.390> lot<00:06:22.690> of<00:06:22.810> people<00:06:22.960> would

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
which obviously a lot of people would

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.100 
which obviously a lot of people would
say<00:06:23.350> it<00:06:23.590> will<00:06:23.890> be<00:06:24.039> the<00:06:24.190> most<00:06:24.990> guaranteed<00:06:25.990> to

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
say it will be the most guaranteed to

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
say it will be the most guaranteed to
come<00:06:26.229> into<00:06:26.350> the<00:06:26.500> game<00:06:26.590> I'm<00:06:26.710> not<00:06:26.830> going<00:06:26.979> to<00:06:27.039> lie

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 
come into the game I'm not going to lie

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.159 
come into the game I'm not going to lie
but<00:06:27.310> yeah<00:06:27.400> it's<00:06:27.610> called<00:06:27.820> the<00:06:27.940> free<00:06:28.180> Peter's<00:06:28.600> it

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169 
but yeah it's called the free Peter's it

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.170 
but yeah it's called the free Peter's it
shoots<00:06:29.470> peas<00:06:29.710> in<00:06:29.950> free<00:06:30.190> lanes<00:06:30.430> so<00:06:30.760> obviously

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
shoots peas in free lanes so obviously

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.900 
shoots peas in free lanes so obviously
we<00:06:31.840> obviously<00:06:32.020> have<00:06:32.320> the<00:06:32.350> P<00:06:32.590> repeater<00:06:33.100> the<00:06:33.220> P

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 
we obviously have the P repeater the P

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.839 
we obviously have the P repeater the P
the<00:06:34.720> Gatling<00:06:35.080> p<00:06:35.289> etc<00:06:35.560> this<00:06:36.430> one<00:06:36.640> will<00:06:36.789> have

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
the Gatling p etc this one will have

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:39.450 
the Gatling p etc this one will have
free<00:06:37.300> peas<00:06:37.720> on<00:06:38.020> the<00:06:38.320> off<00:06:38.409> seat<00:06:38.650> on<00:06:38.830> the<00:06:39.070> part

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
free peas on the off seat on the part

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.960 
free peas on the off seat on the part
and<00:06:39.759> obviously<00:06:40.090> it's<00:06:40.389> a<00:06:40.539> free<00:06:40.930> piece<00:06:41.759> shoot<00:06:42.759> us

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
and obviously it's a free piece shoot us

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.570 
and obviously it's a free piece shoot us
obviously<00:06:43.210> it<00:06:43.900> will<00:06:44.080> fire<00:06:44.319> at<00:06:44.800> least<00:06:44.919> it<00:06:45.430> will

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
obviously it will fire at least it will

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.820 
obviously it will fire at least it will
attack<00:06:45.880> free<00:06:46.210> zombies<00:06:46.630> at<00:06:46.750> once<00:06:46.960> once<00:06:47.650> again

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
attack free zombies at once once again

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.010 
attack free zombies at once once again
so<00:06:48.430> like<00:06:48.610> the<00:06:48.729> star<00:06:48.940> fruit<00:06:49.210> obviously<00:06:49.900> this

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
so like the star fruit obviously this

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.930 
so like the star fruit obviously this
one<00:06:50.229> be<00:06:50.410> a<00:06:50.440> lot<00:06:50.620> more<00:06:50.650> common<00:06:51.099> to<00:06:51.250> get<00:06:51.400> then<00:06:51.819> the

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 
one be a lot more common to get then the

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.189 
one be a lot more common to get then the
style<00:06:52.180> through<00:06:52.389> and<00:06:52.569> other<00:06:52.660> ones<00:06:52.900> but

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 
style through and other ones but

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.200 
style through and other ones but
nevertheless<00:06:53.949> it'll<00:06:54.370> be<00:06:54.460> really<00:06:54.639> cool<00:06:54.849> to<00:06:54.910> do

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210
