 It has timelapse function and many 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.149
 other functions then let's see 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.329
 how timelapse is made and configured 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.730
 we move through the menu we look for the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.070
 menu option with the key here that is 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.740
 the so that we go down one day they go off 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.570
 the cameras 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.120
 and then here is the option to 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.140
 configuration we go down here we are in 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.989
 one of six we go to two of six 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.840
 here we are in two of six and here where 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.940
 there is a movie like the camera that says 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.729
 in recording mode we enter it 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.710
 if we are with the Spanish language is going to 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.140
 without recording mode and we are in 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.450
 English is going to say something else 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.000
 we enter it but before we start 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.909
 I want to show them something this 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.700
 Video recording 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.909
 and this is taking pictures as you can see 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.119
 right where it says 2 megapixels 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.270
 there's nothing when we put it in 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.609
 timelapse function will leave a little watch 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.460
 according to the time that we configure 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:35.700
 then let's go back to the menu 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.460
 and let's go down again to recording mode 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.290
 we enter recording mode here is the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.600
 unique knot is to say every time 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.840
 we press the spiral trigger takes 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.780
 a single photo and three seconds there are five 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.840
 seconds and ten seconds as options 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.830
 of configuration and 20 seconds the best 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.690
 I think it 's 5 seconds since it brings 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.420
 seconds too fast let's put it 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.280
 here in three seconds to try 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.799
 we make sure it's in three seconds 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:11.230
 we left the option of 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:12.880
 configuration this video is photography and 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.680
 as I said earlier soon 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.989
 of 12 megapixels has already appeared a 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.300
 3 with the action watch the 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.130
 trigger with here 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.320
 and in this case I did it please 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.690
 introduce a card and that's why I do not 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.310
 will work , however, if you 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.530
 they do the test he's going to start doing 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.840
 shots 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.430
 I'm going to turn off the camera and I'm going to put the 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.430
 card for you to see how it is 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.560
 times 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.620
 well he put a microsd in this 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:57.260
 case between bigger is better and better 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.450
 that is of higher class in this case 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.060
 it's a class 10 which allows you to record 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.700
 full hd videos at great speed and take 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.680
 all the photos that I want since of 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.030
 32 gigabytes then let's go back the 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.310
 photography to do the test 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.430
 again remember that here it says 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.109
 three seconds I give you shoot here and 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.849
 every time I take a picture the 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:23.409
 shutter ready there took a picture and every 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.409
 three seconds is taking pictures 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.960
 and so basically timelapse of 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.810
 the camera completely still or also 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.330
 leave it on a device that rotates and 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.020
 turn slowly and go taking a 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.020
 Photo sequence 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.910
 and then in the end we have to go down all 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.760
 the photos and with a video editor 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.230
 perform our good especially for 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.300

 with the trigger 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.610
 we press once and it has already stopped 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.860
 taking pictures in every three seconds 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.080
 how do we configure that we can move 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.080

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.690
