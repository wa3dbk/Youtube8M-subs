00:00:05.327 --> 00:00:06.874
 Hello, I am Francis. 

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:09.787
 It is the host of this program "Cooking with Dog" 

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:23.951
 Rinse the rice first and put it in the rice cooker 

00:00:25.932 --> 00:00:28.942
 Join the kelp squid stock 

00:00:28.942 --> 00:00:34.328
 But the amount of water is a little less than usual. 

00:00:34.624 --> 00:00:37.703
 Average distribution of rice 

00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:46.833
 Then, diced chicken breast 

00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:55.349
 Put chicken breast in a bowl 

00:00:55.983 --> 00:00:57.555
 Add sake 

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.163
 salt 

00:01:01.147 --> 00:01:02.729
 Japanese soy sauce 

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:05.528
 Miso 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.003
 Stir gently 

00:01:10.843 --> 00:01:13.969
 Now you can start cutting vegetables 

00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:20.104
 Cut the carrot into 3cm wide slabs 

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:25.414
 Cut into 5mm wide slices 

00:01:25.414 --> 00:01:28.338
 And cut into strips 

00:01:29.078 --> 00:01:32.357
 Then, put the carrots in the bowl 

00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:35.153
 Put a few shallow knife marks on the burdock 

00:01:35.153 --> 00:01:38.811
 Put a few shallow knife marks on the burdock 

00:01:39.372 --> 00:01:44.670
 Then, while rotating the burdock, use a knife to quickly cut the burdock 

00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:47.730
 This cut is called "Sasagaki" 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.165
 Oblique cutting into bamboo-like slices can make burdock easier to eat. 

00:01:52.752 --> 00:01:56.966
 Soak the cut burdock in clean water to avoid oxidation 

00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:58.859
 Extrusion of water 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:01.165
 And add to the bowl 

00:02:02.582 --> 00:02:05.499
 Cut the roots of the mushrooms 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:07.956
 Cut a little tail 

00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:14.040
 Shredded mushrooms 

00:02:14.894 --> 00:02:18.871
 Mushroom mitre slice 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.309
 The mushroom is torn into small pieces 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:29.071
 Cut into a bite with a knife 

00:02:30.975 --> 00:02:32.834
 Kitchen paper 

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:38.350
 Print dry oil on the surface of excess oil 

00:02:38.417 --> 00:02:44.802
 Cut the oil in half and cut into strips 

00:02:46.105 --> 00:02:49.951
 Add ginger to the bowl 

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:55.036
 Mix all the ingredients with the seasoning and mix well 

00:02:55.036 --> 00:02:58.829
 Then, marinate for ten minutes 

00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:03.190
 Now, you can start making Japanese risotto! 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.049
 Put all the ingredients in the rice cooker 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.925
 Gently spread the material evenly over the rice 

00:03:12.912 --> 00:03:16.229
 Close the lid and start cooking 

00:03:16.398 --> 00:03:20.227
 Do not mix the material with the rice at this time. 

00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:23.619
 Otherwise it may affect the cooking effect 

00:03:25.392 --> 00:03:29.003
 Now, Japanese chicken risotto has been completed! 

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:33.777
 Use a rice spoon to loosen the rice and mix well 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.570
 Put the Japanese risotto into the bowl 

00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:49.377
 Finally, add chopped mountain celery to serve 

00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:54.149
 Thoroughly marinate all materials before cooking 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:56.674
 This will make the risotto more delicious. 

00:03:57.202 --> 00:04:01.456
 Burdock is one of the vegetables that I often eat in Japan. 

00:04:01.456 --> 00:04:05.380
 If you can't find the calf, you can omit this material 

00:04:12.732 --> 00:04:17.596
 Adding sake can add flavor to vegetables 

00:04:17.596 --> 00:04:21.401
 Can also remove the smell of chicken 

00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:22.992
 Good luck in the kitchen!
