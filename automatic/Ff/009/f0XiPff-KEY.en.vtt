00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 and hello to all friends with you simple and 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.770
 today i will show my mechanical home in 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.040
 minecraft game Pocket edishn built it 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.580
 probably 4 days well, I hope you enjoy 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.730
 but also let's start from the very entrance 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:23.960
 so here we have an entrance we should all 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:28.170
 throw receipts 2 quietly 2 sand 3 sand and 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.849
 here are 4 and here is our door we are opening 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.219
 go here we have another door 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.420
 here somehow the topic let's turn on 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:40.230
 light turn on break this unit and let us go 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.360
 let's break this block a little bit wait 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.180
 and as we see here we begin to flow 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.250
 words the same making our light 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:53.699
 the room I am here of course very much 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.399
 built everything so that the house does not catch fire 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.870
 and the house is completely wooden 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.800
 so our light turned on let 's 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.390
 go through the next room breaking the block and 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.540
 here here here i have some kind of bug i don't 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.549
 I know so we pass on and here here 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.159
 we have a small room too 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.530
 how could I not know what to call this room 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.150
 Well, let's go straight to the kitchen 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.470
 go here we open the doors and here we have 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.909
 have a dining room here with us 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.119
 the resident was supposed to be somewhere ran away well 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.090
 and let's give some chicken 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.329
 wait and here is our chicken here too 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.200
 we can here pork and a little bit 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.200
 veal 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.810
 here 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:47.509
 so this I probably will not go so 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.360
 then go so carefully go here 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.789
 here here we have small vaults 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.090
 if we break this block and break 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.460
 one more this block then we will drop the floor and 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.340
 we go down our vault where our 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.530
 chests and in general everything is 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.380
 next let 's go to the bathroom 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.130
 bathroom account here too 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:13.400
 mechanical we go here we break this one 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.330
 block and now we can go to our you 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:23.750
 here is water and all that so let's 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:25.760
 climb up here elevator on top and 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.160
 there is almost no mechanisms can be 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.680
 to say them in general is not here then just 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:35.120
 how would such a small room so 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:39.940
 here is another bug going here 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:43.730
 to be a little prettier I set 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:49.489
 here we have the type of workers live two though 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:52.670
 go ahead well and the third floor is exactly 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.970
 my room let us show and so 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.890
 let's get up here first 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:05.150
 We ascend go here here here at 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.880
 us type of enchantment needed to be well 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.579
 since the enchantment isnt here these mine 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.329
 the room right there everything is overgrown whether I am not 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:16.670
 really wanted it okay well 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:20.390
 let's go to the backyard there too 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.200
 there are mechanisms so how to get out there and not 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.780
 remember how fat and go out and that's all 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.769
 get down so watering then I wasn't 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.859
 go down right away and pass well 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.519
 our backyard is here with us 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:40.750
 automatic cacti farm here's my 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.489
 blog and go collect our cacti 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.359
 farther here we have an automatic farm 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.359
 wheat 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:04:00.349
 break these blocks here too 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.349
 we go down we go to harvest our crops 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.650
 so this is something I don't know why but already 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.030
 probably another tank we harvest 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.870
 go ahead let's show one more 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:16.549
 mechanism this mechanism was also on 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.780
 channel this spring paradise mechanism called 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.740
 so there is nobody there 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.350
 we stand here we break this and this block 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:30.930
 we take wheat in our hands cows look at 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:38.190
 me and so on the side come here and so 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:43.229
 we go go here we collect our and fried 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:46.169
 meat well and the last mechanism is ren 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.000
 mechanism is one hundred percent mechanism this 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.760
 the smallest room you can 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.100
 it was only to make it small 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.020
 so short for me on ours 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.520
