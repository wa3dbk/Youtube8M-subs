00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
actually added hardcore kill confirm

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.700 
actually added hardcore kill confirm
which<00:00:33.600> should<00:00:33.750> be<00:00:33.840> pretty<00:00:34.050> funny<00:00:34.290> out<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.590> that

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
which should be pretty funny out of that

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.799 
which should be pretty funny out of that
to<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.950> hardcore<00:00:35.309> playlist<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.000> as<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.750> guys

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
to the hardcore playlist and as you guys

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.660 
to the hardcore playlist and as you guys
know<00:00:36.899> there<00:00:37.290> was<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.559> killstreak<00:00:38.010> glitch<00:00:38.399> where

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
know there was a killstreak glitch where

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.790 
know there was a killstreak glitch where
basically<00:00:39.059> if<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.450> reroll<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.260> try<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.649> get

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
basically if you reroll to try to get

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.290 
basically if you reroll to try to get
another<00:00:40.890> kill<00:00:41.280> streak<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> engineer

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
another kill streak with the engineer

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.000 
another kill streak with the engineer
perk<00:00:42.540> your<00:00:42.960> teammates<00:00:43.379> could<00:00:43.530> steal<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.980> so

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
perk your teammates could steal it so

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.400 
perk your teammates could steal it so
they<00:00:44.670> actually<00:00:44.850> patch<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.260> no<00:00:46.379> longer

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
they actually patch that so it no longer

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.650 
they actually patch that so it no longer
lets<00:00:46.890> your<00:00:47.039> teammates<00:00:47.430> able<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.820> steal<00:00:48.480> your

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
lets your teammates able to steal your

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.180 
lets your teammates able to steal your
care<00:00:48.870> package<00:00:49.079> which<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.590> really<00:00:49.770> nice<00:00:49.980> I

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
care package which is really nice I

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.410 
care package which is really nice I
don't<00:00:50.370> know<00:00:50.430> if<00:00:50.550> many<00:00:50.700> people<00:00:50.820> use<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> care

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
don't know if many people use the care

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.720 
don't know if many people use the care
package<00:00:51.809> but<00:00:52.050> they<00:00:52.590> did<00:00:52.800> update<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.370> then

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
package but they did update that then

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.200 
package but they did update that then
they<00:00:54.329> also<00:00:54.570> added<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.350> fail-safe<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.820> prevent

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
they also added a fail-safe to prevent

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.389 
they also added a fail-safe to prevent
spawn<00:00:57.539> trapping<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.199> capture<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.800> flag<00:00:59.039> and

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
spawn trapping in capture the flag and

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.010 
spawn trapping in capture the flag and
there's<00:00:59.579> actually<00:00:59.969> some<00:01:00.270> really<00:01:00.300> intense

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
there's actually some really intense

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.779 
there's actually some really intense
spawn<00:01:01.350> trapping<00:01:01.649> going<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.129> capture<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.579> flag

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
spawn trapping going on capture the flag

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.460 
spawn trapping going on capture the flag
which<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.480> kind<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.719> weird<00:01:03.870> they<00:01:04.049> never<00:01:04.229> really

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
which is kind of weird they never really

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.289 
which is kind of weird they never really
had<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.710> as<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.129> spawn<00:01:05.460> trapping<00:01:05.729> game<00:01:06.030> type

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
had that as a spawn trapping game type

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.330 
had that as a spawn trapping game type
it<00:01:06.510> was<00:01:06.659> usually<00:01:07.290> demolition<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.100> that's

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
it was usually demolition so that's

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.590 
it was usually demolition so that's
definitely<00:01:08.520> nice<00:01:08.820> if<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.210> want<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.450> play

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
definitely nice if you want to play

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.850 
definitely nice if you want to play
capture<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> flag<00:01:10.080> I'm<00:01:10.500> not<00:01:10.619> really<00:01:10.740> sure

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
capture the flag I'm not really sure

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.289 
capture the flag I'm not really sure
that<00:01:11.130> many<00:01:11.280> people<00:01:11.520> play<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.909> game<00:01:12.060> tight

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
that many people play that game tight

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.969 
that many people play that game tight
but<00:01:12.540> either<00:01:12.659> way<00:01:12.900> still<00:01:13.500> nice<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.830> they're

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
but either way still nice that they're

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.890 
but either way still nice that they're
doing<00:01:14.220> these<00:01:14.310> sort<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.610> things<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.450> next

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
doing these sort of things the next

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.749 
doing these sort of things the next
thing<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.229> they<00:01:16.439> actually<00:01:16.560> improve<00:01:17.310> theater

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
thing is they actually improve theater

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.969 
thing is they actually improve theater
mode<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.299> live<00:01:18.630> streaming<00:01:18.990> capabilities<00:01:19.710> so

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
mode and live streaming capabilities so

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.800 
mode and live streaming capabilities so
a<00:01:20.189> lot<00:01:20.700> more<00:01:20.820> games<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.210> been<00:01:21.299> saving<00:01:21.600> in

nice and you can actually access them in

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.830 
nice and you can actually access them in
case<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.799> guys<00:01:25.890> didn't<00:01:26.189> know<00:01:26.220> they<00:01:26.549> actually

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
case you guys didn't know they actually

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.030 
case you guys didn't know they actually
disabled<00:01:27.840> theater<00:01:28.080> mode<00:01:28.229> because<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
disabled theater mode because of the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.160 
disabled theater mode because of the
fact<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.460> people<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:30.299> using<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.810> one

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
fact that people are using this one

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.679 
fact that people are using this one
six-second<00:01:32.040> video<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.369> get<00:01:32.640> 10th<00:01:32.970> prestige<00:01:33.060> or

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
six-second video to get 10th prestige or

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.840 
six-second video to get 10th prestige or
whatever<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.350> they<00:01:34.860> had<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.159> shut<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.640> down

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
whatever so they had to shut that down

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.280 
whatever so they had to shut that down
but<00:01:36.090> they<00:01:36.150> pretty<00:01:36.360> much<00:01:36.450> got<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.810> working<00:01:37.140> now

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
but they pretty much got it working now

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.840 
but they pretty much got it working now
and<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.650> seems<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.100> lot<00:01:38.340> better<00:01:38.400> which

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
and it seems to be a lot better which

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.160 
and it seems to be a lot better which
I'm<00:01:39.000> definitely<00:01:39.240> really<00:01:39.509> glad<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.079> they

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
I'm definitely really glad that they

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.109 
I'm definitely really glad that they
addressed<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.619> issue<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.850> next<00:01:42.000> thing

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
addressed that issue so the next thing

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.990 
addressed that issue so the next thing
is<00:01:42.270> they<00:01:42.659> actually<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.130> EMP<00:01:44.610> grenades

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
is they actually for the EMP grenades

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.719 
is they actually for the EMP grenades
they're<00:01:45.240> no<00:01:45.479> longer<00:01:45.689> affect<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.729> podcaster

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
they're no longer affect the podcaster

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.370 
they're no longer affect the podcaster
heads-up<00:01:48.390> display<00:01:48.810> which<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.079> like<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
heads-up display which is like the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.289 
heads-up display which is like the
mini-map<00:01:49.890> or<00:01:50.100> whatever<00:01:50.369> which<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.119> pretty

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
mini-map or whatever which is pretty

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.120 
mini-map or whatever which is pretty
nice<00:01:51.540> actually<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:52.290> really<00:01:52.770> annoying<00:01:53.040> when

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
nice actually it's really annoying when

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.609 
nice actually it's really annoying when
that<00:01:53.310> happens<00:01:53.670> then<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.570> uid<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.229> actually

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
that happens then the uid it actually

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.760 
that happens then the uid it actually
got<00:01:55.799> buffed<00:01:56.280> up<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:57.020> 425<00:01:58.020> scorestreak

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
got buffed up to a 425 scorestreak

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.149 
got buffed up to a 425 scorestreak
instead<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.430> regular<00:01:59.869> 350<00:02:00.869> because<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.530> lot

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
instead of the regular 350 because a lot

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.679 
instead of the regular 350 because a lot
of<00:02:02.189> people<00:02:02.340> were<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:03.090> spamming<00:02:03.420> and

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
of people were you a be spamming and

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.819 
of people were you a be spamming and
they<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:03.960> made<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.140> little<00:02:04.229> bit<00:02:04.469> harder<00:02:04.740> to

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
they just made a little bit harder to

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.139 
they just made a little bit harder to
get<00:02:04.979> which<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.340> can<00:02:05.460> at<00:02:05.549> least<00:02:05.670> should<00:02:05.850> agree

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
get which I can at least should agree

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.730 
get which I can at least should agree
with<00:02:06.360> because<00:02:06.509> that's<00:02:07.229> just<00:02:07.320> really<00:02:07.500> nice

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
with because that's just really nice

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.279 
with because that's just really nice
then<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.910> lightning<00:02:09.239> strike<00:02:09.569> they<00:02:09.810> added<00:02:10.200> a

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
then the lightning strike they added a

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.770 
then the lightning strike they added a
750<00:02:11.250> millisecond<00:02:11.849> delay<00:02:11.910> with<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.390> lightning

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
750 millisecond delay with a lightning

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.430 
750 millisecond delay with a lightning
strike<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.230> game

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
strike in this game

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.170 
strike in this game
play<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.710> was<00:02:13.860> actually<00:02:14.070> pre<00:02:14.460> patched<00:02:14.700> it

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
play this was actually pre patched it

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.240 
play this was actually pre patched it
pretty<00:02:15.450> much<00:02:15.600> goes<00:02:15.630> down<00:02:16.110> right<00:02:16.440> away<00:02:16.560> but<00:02:16.950> now

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
pretty much goes down right away but now

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.340 
pretty much goes down right away but now
it's<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.490> little<00:02:17.520> bit<00:02:17.820> delayed<00:02:18.150> but<00:02:18.480> one<00:02:19.080> thing

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
it's a little bit delayed but one thing

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.660 
it's a little bit delayed but one thing
that's<00:02:19.650> really<00:02:19.740> nice<00:02:20.010> about<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.370> lightning

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
that's really nice about the lightning

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.390 
that's really nice about the lightning
strike<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.720> actually<00:02:22.560> shows<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.220> guys

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
strike is it actually shows you guys

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.340 
strike is it actually shows you guys
where<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.000> whole<00:02:24.330> entire<00:02:24.600> enemy<00:02:24.870> team<00:02:25.020> is

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
where the whole entire enemy team is

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.720 
where the whole entire enemy team is
right<00:02:25.560> when<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:25.800> call<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.070> in<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:26.430> it's<00:02:26.580> kind

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
right when you call it in so it's kind

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.190 
right when you call it in so it's kind
of<00:02:26.760> nice<00:02:26.910> but<00:02:27.270> it<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.570> little<00:02:27.780> bit<00:02:27.930> delayed

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
of nice but it is a little bit delayed

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.200 
of nice but it is a little bit delayed
so<00:02:28.500> make<00:02:28.680> sure<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:29.070> put<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.670> little<00:02:29.940> bit<00:02:30.090> up

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
so make sure you put it a little bit up

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.760 
so make sure you put it a little bit up
front<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.780> enemies<00:02:31.080> when<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.350> call<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.650> in

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
front of the enemies when you call it in

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.990 
front of the enemies when you call it in
that's<00:02:32.100> just<00:02:32.190> one<00:02:32.430> thing<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.640> would<00:02:32.700> recommend

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
that's just one thing I would recommend

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.940 
that's just one thing I would recommend
and<00:02:33.780> then<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.380> one<00:02:34.530> thing<00:02:34.710> that<00:02:34.740> I'm

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
and then this is one thing that I'm

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.470 
and then this is one thing that I'm
really<00:02:35.340> glad<00:02:35.460> that<00:02:35.580> they<00:02:35.850> patched<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
really glad that they patched the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.140 
really glad that they patched the
bouncing<00:02:37.260> betty<00:02:37.500> its<00:02:37.830> increased<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.820> grace

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
bouncing betty its increased the grace

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.150 
bouncing betty its increased the grace
period<00:02:39.180> between<00:02:39.690> trigger<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.500> activation<00:02:41.040> by

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
period between trigger and activation by

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.340 
period between trigger and activation by
200<00:02:41.640> milliseconds<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.210> you<00:02:42.780> basically<00:02:42.900> have<00:02:43.320> a

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
200 milliseconds so you basically have a

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.050 
200 milliseconds so you basically have a
little<00:02:43.770> bit<00:02:43.860> more<00:02:44.010> time<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.310> react<00:02:44.610> which<00:02:44.880> is

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
little bit more time to react which is

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.400 
little bit more time to react which is
really<00:02:45.360> nice<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.810> thing<00:02:46.020> was<00:02:46.170> getting

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
really nice that thing was getting

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.500 
really nice that thing was getting
really<00:02:46.620> annoying<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.400> definitely<00:02:48.090> glad<00:02:48.240> they

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
really annoying so definitely glad they

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.510 
really annoying so definitely glad they
did<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.750> then<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.260> sense<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.680> grenades<00:02:50.040> they

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
did that then the sense of grenades they

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.030 
did that then the sense of grenades they
increase<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.240> range<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:52.020> frequency<00:02:52.740> in<00:02:53.010> the

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
increase the range the frequency in the

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.130 
increase the range the frequency in the
amount<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.460> time<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.880> players<00:02:54.150> up<00:02:54.600> here<00:02:54.900> after

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
amount of time the players up here after

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.220 
amount of time the players up here after
the<00:02:55.410> explosion<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.250> then<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.970> SMGs<00:02:57.630> all<00:02:57.870> of

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
the explosion and then the SMGs all of

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.860 
the explosion and then the SMGs all of
them<00:02:58.410> have<00:02:58.710> their<00:02:58.980> increased<00:02:59.880> hipfire<00:03:00.330> recoil

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
them have their increased hipfire recoil

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.440 
them have their increased hipfire recoil
and<00:03:01.110> also<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.130> hipfire<00:03:02.370> spread<00:03:02.580> has<00:03:03.210> been

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
and also the hipfire spread has been

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.970 
and also the hipfire spread has been
increased<00:03:04.200> from<00:03:04.440> 4.75<00:03:05.400> 25<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.930> SMGs<00:03:07.710> they

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
increased from 4.75 25 so the SMGs they

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.890 
increased from 4.75 25 so the SMGs they
definitely<00:03:08.310> were<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.730> little<00:03:09.240> bit<00:03:09.390> Opie<00:03:09.690> when

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
definitely were a little bit Opie when

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.850 
definitely were a little bit Opie when
you<00:03:09.960> would<00:03:10.080> hit<00:03:10.170> fire<00:03:10.410> with<00:03:10.620> them<00:03:10.740> especially

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
you would hit fire with them especially

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.220 
you would hit fire with them especially
with<00:03:11.220> uncle<00:03:11.520> laser<00:03:11.700> sights<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.270> they<00:03:12.780> tone

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
with uncle laser sights so they tone

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.840 
with uncle laser sights so they tone
that<00:03:13.410> down<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.650> little<00:03:13.800> bit<00:03:14.160> they<00:03:14.460> did<00:03:14.670> actually

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
that down a little bit they did actually

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.449 
that down a little bit they did actually
add<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.150> few<00:03:15.420> buffs<00:03:15.690> but<00:03:16.020> majority<00:03:16.770> of<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.950> SMGs

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
add a few buffs but majority of the SMGs

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.660 
add a few buffs but majority of the SMGs
like<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.910> MSMC<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.989> PDW<00:03:19.770> they<00:03:20.310> got<00:03:20.550> the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
like the MSMC and the PDW they got the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.070 
like the MSMC and the PDW they got the
recoil<00:03:21.120> nerfed<00:03:21.510> which<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:21.900> really

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
recoil nerfed which is really

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.540 
recoil nerfed which is really
unfortunate<00:03:22.380> those<00:03:22.800> were<00:03:22.920> my<00:03:23.040> favorite<00:03:23.370> guns

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
unfortunate those were my favorite guns

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.270 
unfortunate those were my favorite guns
so<00:03:23.850> it's<00:03:24.330> not<00:03:24.540> too<00:03:24.780> bad<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.350> they<00:03:25.860> did<00:03:26.130> get

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
so it's not too bad but they did get

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.729 
so it's not too bad but they did get
nerfed<00:03:26.550> a<00:03:26.700> little<00:03:26.970> bit<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.330> then<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.260> assault

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
nerfed a little bit and then the assault

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.340 
nerfed a little bit and then the assault
rifles<00:03:29.100> they<00:03:29.370> reduce<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:30.060> idle<00:03:30.600> sway<00:03:30.930> for<00:03:31.320> a

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
rifles they reduce the idle sway for a

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.020 
rifles they reduce the idle sway for a
more<00:03:31.530> reliable<00:03:31.800> long-range<00:03:32.430> aiming<00:03:32.820> for

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
more reliable long-range aiming for

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.270 
more reliable long-range aiming for
every<00:03:33.209> single<00:03:33.510> one<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.630> them<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.080> xm8<00:03:35.010> they

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
every single one of them the xm8 they

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.130 
every single one of them the xm8 they
actually<00:03:35.610> reduced<00:03:36.030> lethal<00:03:36.510> range<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.930> three

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
actually reduced lethal range of three

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.160 
actually reduced lethal range of three
hit<00:03:37.290> kills<00:03:37.530> from<00:03:37.830> 250<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.489> 50<00:03:38.910> inches<00:03:39.270> then<00:03:39.900> the

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
hit kills from 250 to 50 inches then the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.860 
hit kills from 250 to 50 inches then the
FAL<00:03:40.830> they<00:03:41.040> actually<00:03:41.520> for<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.120> select<00:03:42.660> fire

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
FAL they actually for the select fire

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.660 
FAL they actually for the select fire
they<00:03:43.110> increase<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.739> recoil<00:03:44.130> which<00:03:44.310> is<00:03:44.430> really

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
they increase the recoil which is really

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.400 
they increase the recoil which is really
nice<00:03:44.880> people<00:03:45.120> were<00:03:45.360> spray<00:03:45.720> people<00:03:45.900> down<00:03:46.230> with

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
nice people were spray people down with

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.250 
nice people were spray people down with
almost<00:03:46.620> no<00:03:46.860> recoil<00:03:47.190> whatsoever<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:48.660> XP<00:03:49.110> are

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
almost no recoil whatsoever the XP are

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.410 
almost no recoil whatsoever the XP are
50<00:03:49.680> sniper<00:03:49.980> rifle<00:03:50.400> date<00:03:50.519> coil<00:03:50.910> was<00:03:51.030> increased

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
50 sniper rifle date coil was increased

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.710 
50 sniper rifle date coil was increased
slightly<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:52.470> r<00:03:52.830> 870<00:03:53.310> shotgun<00:03:53.370> its<00:03:54.060> reduced

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
slightly the r 870 shotgun its reduced

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.350 
slightly the r 870 shotgun its reduced
one-hit<00:03:55.260> kill<00:03:55.470> range<00:03:55.739> by<00:03:56.040> 45<00:03:56.550> inches<00:03:56.970> which

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
one-hit kill range by 45 inches which

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.180 
one-hit kill range by 45 inches which
pretty<00:03:58.019> much<00:03:58.110> just<00:03:58.290> brings<00:03:58.590> down<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.800> range<00:03:59.100> a

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
pretty much just brings down the range a

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.229 
pretty much just brings down the range a
little<00:03:59.280> bit<00:03:59.550> that's<00:03:59.670> kind<00:03:59.910> of<00:03:59.940> unfortunate

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
little bit that's kind of unfortunate

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.090 
little bit that's kind of unfortunate
because<00:04:00.600> i<00:04:00.720> like<00:04:01.019> using<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.320> shotguns<00:04:01.860> but

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
because i like using the shotguns but

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.470
