is is that you have to wait 28 days in
real<00:03:50.109> life<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.560> don't<00:03:51.190> think<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:51.459> have<00:03:51.639> to<00:03:51.670> be

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
real life I don't think you have to be

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.869 
real life I don't think you have to be
in<00:03:52.060> your<00:03:52.209> world<00:03:52.620> but<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.069> way<00:03:54.159> 28<00:03:54.609> days<00:03:54.849> and

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
in your world but it the way 28 days and

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.360 
in your world but it the way 28 days and
