it's been two hours since I fed them I

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.190 
it's been two hours since I fed them I
didn't<00:00:16.400> check<00:00:16.880> them<00:00:17.060> out<00:00:17.150> I<00:00:17.390> did<00:00:17.630> check<00:00:17.960> it<00:00:18.110> at

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
didn't check them out I did check it at

didn't check them out I did check it at
the<00:00:18.260> hour<00:00:18.470> but<00:00:18.950> and<00:00:19.160> I<00:00:19.490> didn't<00:00:19.790> mark<00:00:20.060> them

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
the hour but and I didn't mark them

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.330 
the hour but and I didn't mark them
because<00:00:20.630> there<00:00:20.960> wasn't<00:00:21.290> a<00:00:21.320> lot<00:00:21.560> of<00:00:21.590> growth<00:00:21.980> yet

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
because there wasn't a lot of growth yet

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.210 
because there wasn't a lot of growth yet
but<00:00:23.210> they're<00:00:23.330> doing<00:00:23.450> really<00:00:23.750> well<00:00:23.990> now<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:24.770> at

starter I fed all of them and they're
all<00:01:15.690> pretty<00:01:15.869> much<00:01:16.140> doubled<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:18.600> center

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
all pretty much doubled the center

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.980 
all pretty much doubled the center
starter<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> hybrid<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:21.300> mixture<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
starter the hybrid the mixture of the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.410 
starter the hybrid the mixture of the
white<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.590> wheat<00:01:22.800> is<00:01:23.009> more<00:01:23.759> than<00:01:23.970> doubled

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
white and the wheat is more than doubled

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.090 
white and the wheat is more than doubled
and<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:26.610> whole<00:01:26.789> wheats<00:01:27.000> about<00:01:27.300> doubled<00:01:28.100> so

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
and the whole wheats about doubled so

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.770 
and the whole wheats about doubled so
you<00:01:29.190> can<00:01:29.460> see<00:01:29.640> they're<00:01:29.789> all<00:01:29.940> doing<00:01:30.270> really

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
you can see they're all doing really

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.200 
you can see they're all doing really
well<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.649> only<00:01:31.830> four<00:01:32.220> hours<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.670> average

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
well and it's only four hours on average

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.090 
well and it's only four hours on average
starter<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.170> about<00:01:34.470> six<00:01:34.920> hours<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:36.060> yes<00:01:36.390> these

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
starter is about six hours so yes these

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.620 
starter is about six hours so yes these
starters<00:01:38.100> most<00:01:38.429> likely<00:01:38.970> would<00:01:39.149> make<00:01:39.390> some

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630

that's a nice strong starter it's been
six<00:02:11.280> hours<00:02:11.670> now<00:02:11.700> since<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.810> fed<00:02:13.170> these<00:02:13.410> starters

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
six hours now since I fed these starters

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:22.130 
six hours now since I fed these starters
and<00:02:16.069> they<00:02:17.069> have<00:02:17.459> more<00:02:18.030> than<00:02:18.269> doubled<00:02:19.940> they<00:02:21.140> the

so not sure if that happened at five or
six<00:02:31.239> hours<00:02:31.900> but<00:02:33.870> starting<00:02:34.870> here<00:02:36.450> all<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.629> way

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
up to here before it fell so that's

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.930

definitely<00:02:40.930> telling<00:02:41.590> me<00:02:41.860> this<00:02:42.370> starter<00:02:42.879> is

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
definitely telling me this starter is

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.759 
definitely telling me this starter is
ready<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.360> mix<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:46.209> this<00:02:46.450> one<00:02:46.690> is<00:02:47.049> still<00:02:47.379> going

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
ready to mix and this one is still going

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.850 
ready to mix and this one is still going
it<00:02:48.310> looks<00:02:48.519> like<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:50.290> looks<00:02:50.470> like<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:51.040> uh<00:02:52.860> it

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
it looks like it looks like it uh it

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.470 
it looks like it looks like it uh it
looks<00:02:54.159> like<00:02:54.370> it<00:02:54.670> might<00:02:55.239> go<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:57.209> here's<00:02:58.209> the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
looks like it might go and here's the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.750 
looks like it might go and here's the
white<00:02:58.810> starter<00:02:59.379> it<00:02:59.590> I<00:03:00.160> can't<00:03:00.790> tell<00:03:01.090> if<00:03:01.720> it's<00:03:02.049> a

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
white starter it I can't tell if it's a

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.360 
white starter it I can't tell if it's a
peaked<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.079> falling<00:03:05.079> or<00:03:05.230> not<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.739> just<00:03:05.890> can't

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
peaked and falling or not I just can't

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.809 
peaked and falling or not I just can't
tell<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:07.120> I<00:03:07.420> think<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.739> I<00:03:08.769> will<00:03:09.099> come<00:03:09.340> back<00:03:09.519> in

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
tell so I think that I will come back in

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.509 
tell so I think that I will come back in
one<00:03:10.090> more<00:03:10.329> hour<00:03:10.569> and<00:03:11.079> and<00:03:11.799> just<00:03:12.040> check<00:03:12.310> on

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
one more hour and and just check on

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.020 
one more hour and and just check on
these<00:03:12.670> other<00:03:13.470> starters<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.799> see<00:03:15.069> how<00:03:15.819> they're

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
these other starters to see how they're

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.490 
these other starters to see how they're
doing<00:03:16.180> like<00:03:16.540> I<00:03:16.659> marked<00:03:16.959> this<00:03:17.079> one<00:03:17.290> down<00:03:17.440> here

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
doing like I marked this one down here

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.949 
doing like I marked this one down here
but<00:03:18.010> really<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:18.459> can<00:03:18.670> see<00:03:18.970> that<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.329> top<00:03:19.599> part

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
but really you can see that the top part

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.990 
but really you can see that the top part
of<00:03:20.079> it<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:20.379> like<00:03:20.530> way<00:03:20.799> up<00:03:20.980> here<00:03:21.220> somewhere<00:03:21.540> um

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
of it is like way up here somewhere um

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.720 
of it is like way up here somewhere um
it's<00:03:25.000> kind<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.209> hard<00:03:25.390> to<00:03:25.450> measure<00:03:25.720> on<00:03:26.049> that<00:03:26.290> one

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
it's kind of hard to measure on that one

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.430 
it's kind of hard to measure on that one
but<00:03:27.730> definitely<00:03:27.879> you<00:03:28.390> can<00:03:28.569> see<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:28.989> it's<00:03:29.140> way

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
but definitely you can see that it's way

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.339 
but definitely you can see that it's way
more<00:03:29.470> than<00:03:29.920> doubled<00:03:30.569> all<00:03:31.569> of<00:03:31.780> them<00:03:31.930> all<00:03:32.290> of

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
more than doubled all of them all of

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.220 
more than doubled all of them all of
them<00:03:32.799> have<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:34.030> I'll<00:03:34.180> come<00:03:34.389> back<00:03:34.419> in<00:03:34.780> an<00:03:34.900> hour

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
them have so I'll come back in an hour

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.250 
them have so I'll come back in an hour
and<00:03:35.470> we'll<00:03:35.829> check<00:03:36.099> on<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.370> progress<00:03:36.609> of<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
and we'll check on the progress of the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.170 
and we'll check on the progress of the
starter<00:03:39.130> on<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.340> left<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.819> starter<00:03:40.150> on

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
starter on the left and the starter on

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.940 
starter on the left and the starter on
the<00:03:40.389> right<00:03:40.599> to<00:03:40.870> see<00:03:41.079> if<00:03:41.230> they've<00:03:41.440> actually

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
the right to see if they've actually

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.400 
the right to see if they've actually
peaked<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.430> started<00:03:42.940> falling<00:03:43.180> in<00:03:43.510> yet<00:03:43.750> the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
peaked and started falling in yet the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.490 
peaked and started falling in yet the
middle<00:03:44.859> one<00:03:45.069> has<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:46.540> has<00:03:46.780> peaked<00:03:47.139> and<00:03:47.349> is

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
middle one has it has peaked and is

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.099 
middle one has it has peaked and is
starting<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:47.980> fall<00:03:48.250> in<00:03:48.519> so<00:03:48.790> it's<00:03:49.480> possibly<00:03:50.019> a

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
starting to fall in so it's possibly a

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.589 
starting to fall in so it's possibly a
5-hour<00:03:50.739> starter<00:03:51.430> it's<00:03:51.819> hard<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.209> tell<00:03:52.419> when

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
5-hour starter it's hard to tell when

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.360 
5-hour starter it's hard to tell when
they're<00:03:52.750> so<00:03:52.959> young<00:03:53.230> they're<00:03:53.470> just<00:03:53.680> not<00:03:53.799> stable

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
they're so young they're just not stable

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.659 
they're so young they're just not stable
yet<00:03:54.549> okay<00:03:55.359> it's<00:03:55.540> been<00:03:55.780> seven<00:03:56.230> hours<00:03:56.379> now

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
yet okay it's been seven hours now

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.659 
yet okay it's been seven hours now
decided<00:03:57.669> to<00:03:57.760> go<00:03:57.910> one<00:03:58.120> extra<00:03:58.480> hour<00:03:58.629> because<00:03:59.230> our

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
decided to go one extra hour because our

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.939 
decided to go one extra hour because our
Center<00:04:00.669> one<00:04:00.940> fell<00:04:01.449> or<00:04:01.900> started<00:04:02.319> to<00:04:02.470> fall<00:04:02.709> and

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:02.949 
Center one fell or started to fall and

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:06.470 
Center one fell or started to fall and
as<00:04:03.099> you<00:04:03.250> can<00:04:03.430> see<00:04:03.489> it<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.359> actually<00:04:05.160> falling

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
as you can see it is actually falling

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.740 
as you can see it is actually falling
now<00:04:07.480> this<00:04:08.260> particular<00:04:08.500> one<00:04:09.359> remember<00:04:10.359> I<00:04:10.389> mark

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
now this particular one remember I mark

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.330 
now this particular one remember I mark
it<00:04:10.930> here<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.440> then<00:04:11.620> said<00:04:11.889> well<00:04:12.040> it<00:04:12.129> looked

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
it here and then said well it looked

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.490 
it here and then said well it looked
like<00:04:12.519> it<00:04:12.699> was<00:04:12.819> there<00:04:13.090> it's<00:04:13.389> actually<00:04:13.660> still

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
like it was there it's actually still

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.279 
like it was there it's actually still
growing<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.780> that's<00:04:16.780> our<00:04:16.959> whole-wheat

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
growing and that's our whole-wheat

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.060 
growing and that's our whole-wheat
starter<00:04:17.829> our<00:04:18.400> hybrid<00:04:19.359> starter<00:04:19.900> this<00:04:20.709> is<00:04:20.919> our

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
starter our hybrid starter this is our

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.430 
starter our hybrid starter this is our
white<00:04:21.310> starter<00:04:21.940> and<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.300> looks<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:22.810> me<00:04:22.840> like<00:04:23.020> it

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
white starter and it looks to me like it

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.089 
white starter and it looks to me like it
is<00:04:23.590> starting<00:04:23.889> to<00:04:24.130> fall<00:04:24.520> in<00:04:24.760> now<00:04:25.590> but<00:04:26.590> it's<00:04:26.770> it's

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
is starting to fall in now but it's it's

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.900 
is starting to fall in now but it's it's
kind<00:04:27.340> of<00:04:27.430> hard<00:04:27.639> to<00:04:27.699> tell<00:04:29.460> so<00:04:30.460> I<00:04:30.490> actually

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
kind of hard to tell so I actually

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.879 
kind of hard to tell so I actually
thought<00:04:31.389> that<00:04:31.449> I<00:04:31.690> might<00:04:32.080> go<00:04:32.260> ahead<00:04:32.349> and<00:04:32.650> do<00:04:32.770> it

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
thought that I might go ahead and do it

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.310 
thought that I might go ahead and do it
one<00:04:32.919> more<00:04:33.340> hour<00:04:33.810> we'll<00:04:34.810> go<00:04:34.930> ahead<00:04:35.080> and<00:04:35.229> go

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
one more hour we'll go ahead and go

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.610 
one more hour we'll go ahead and go
eight<00:04:35.680> hours<00:04:36.219> on<00:04:36.490> our<00:04:36.880> test<00:04:37.210> it's<00:04:38.140> been<00:04:38.380> eight

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
eight hours on our test it's been eight

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.590 
eight hours on our test it's been eight
hours<00:04:39.099> now

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
hours now

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.530 
hours now
now<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.970> white<00:04:43.150> starter<00:04:43.660> fell<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:46.120> hybrid

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
now the white starter fell the hybrid

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.980 
now the white starter fell the hybrid
starter<00:04:47.020> fell<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:49.030> whole-wheat<00:04:49.420> starter

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
starter fell and the whole-wheat starter

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.550 
starter fell and the whole-wheat starter
is<00:04:50.170> still<00:04:50.530> seeming<00:04:51.160> to<00:04:51.900> you<00:04:52.900> see<00:04:53.080> it's<00:04:53.230> gone<00:04:53.380> up

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
is still seeming to you see it's gone up

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.380 
is still seeming to you see it's gone up
just<00:04:53.830> a<00:04:53.950> little<00:04:53.980> bit<00:04:54.250> from<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:54.580> last<00:04:54.820> mark<00:04:55.210> at

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
just a little bit from the last mark at
