wouldn't be one full rotation but it
basically<00:03:47.720> goes<00:03:47.930> across<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.220> one<00:03:49.400> screen<00:03:49.760> and

basically goes across the one screen and

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.840 
basically goes across the one screen and
quite<00:03:50.150> a<00:03:50.180> bit<00:03:50.480> into<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:50.780> other<00:03:51.110> screen<00:03:51.590> but<00:03:52.550> if

quite a bit into the other screen but if

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.920 
quite a bit into the other screen but if
I<00:03:52.940> actually<00:03:53.120> put<00:03:53.420> it<00:03:53.450> at<00:03:53.900> slow<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.750> should

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
I actually put it at slow and it should

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.960 
I actually put it at slow and it should
actually<00:03:57.080> be<00:03:57.290> called<00:03:57.320> sensitivity<00:03:57.920> not<00:03:58.489> speed

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
actually be called sensitivity not speed

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.440 
actually be called sensitivity not speed
relative<00:03:59.330> cuz<00:03:59.780> I<00:04:00.050> mean<00:04:00.890> I<00:04:00.980> have<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.310> do<00:04:01.489> it<00:04:01.670> do

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
relative cuz I mean I have to do it do

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.660 
relative cuz I mean I have to do it do
several<00:04:02.810> rotations<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.830> get<00:04:03.980> it<00:04:04.070> go<00:04:04.250> from<00:04:04.430> one

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
several rotations to get it go from one

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.790 
several rotations to get it go from one
just<00:04:05.660> to<00:04:05.750> get<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:05.989> to<00:04:06.050> go<00:04:06.170> from<00:04:06.290> actually<00:04:06.650> one

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
just to get it to go from actually one

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.520 
just to get it to go from actually one
corner<00:04:07.190> of<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.340> screen<00:04:07.550> seeing<00:04:08.390> to<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.380> other

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.080 
corner of the screen seeing to the other
corners<00:04:09.950> mean<00:04:10.220> it<00:04:10.340> it's<00:04:10.550> really<00:04:10.730> several

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
corners mean it it's really several

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.600 
corners mean it it's really several
rotations<00:04:11.300> so<00:04:12.080> I<00:04:12.350> think<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.459> bit<00:04:13.580> more

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
rotations so I think a bit more

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.880 
rotations so I think a bit more
sensitivity<00:04:14.600> and<00:04:15.170> with<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.530> trackball

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
sensitivity and with the trackball

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.650 
sensitivity and with the trackball
usually<00:04:16.250> keep<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.549> a<00:04:16.580> little<00:04:17.000> bit<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.510> the

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
usually keep it a little bit to the

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.259 
usually keep it a little bit to the
right<00:04:17.690> of<00:04:17.900> Center<00:04:18.260> I'm<00:04:19.100> right<00:04:19.609> around<00:04:19.820> here<00:04:20.120> is

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
right of Center I'm right around here is

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.900 
right of Center I'm right around here is
good<00:04:20.570> but<00:04:21.380> when<00:04:21.590> I'm<00:04:21.680> using<00:04:21.919> the<00:04:22.250> this<00:04:22.640> mouse

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
good but when I'm using the this mouse

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.030 
good but when I'm using the this mouse
pad<00:04:23.150> is<00:04:23.450> something<00:04:23.750> else<00:04:23.840> I<00:04:24.020> use<00:04:24.229> too<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.800> then

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
pad is something else I use too and then

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.380 
pad is something else I use too and then
that<00:04:25.130> case<00:04:25.340> I<00:04:25.490> usually<00:04:25.790> keep<00:04:25.940> it<00:04:26.060> a<00:04:26.120> little<00:04:26.180> bit

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
that case I usually keep it a little bit

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.080 
that case I usually keep it a little bit
to<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:26.630> left<00:04:26.870> of<00:04:27.110> center<00:04:27.670> see<00:04:28.670> like<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:28.850> said<00:04:29.030> I

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
to the left of center see like I said I

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.930 
to the left of center see like I said I
could<00:04:29.240> still<00:04:29.360> use<00:04:29.480> trackball<00:04:30.290> if<00:04:31.220> I<00:04:31.460> want<00:04:31.700> go

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
could still use trackball if I want go

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.270 
could still use trackball if I want go
from<00:04:32.120> side<00:04:32.390> to<00:04:32.420> side<00:04:32.630> really<00:04:33.200> quick<00:04:33.680> I<00:04:33.920> can<00:04:33.980> use

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
from side to side really quick I can use

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.410 
from side to side really quick I can use
this<00:04:34.520> to<00:04:34.790> go<00:04:35.060> pretty<00:04:35.300> quick<00:04:35.660> too<00:04:37.150> I<00:04:38.150> think<00:04:38.210> it's

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
this to go pretty quick too I think it's

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.230 
this to go pretty quick too I think it's
better<00:04:38.600> than<00:04:38.780> having<00:04:38.930> a<00:04:39.080> mouse<00:04:39.290> but

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
better than having a mouse but

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.650 
better than having a mouse but
everything<00:04:41.240> they<00:04:41.330> have<00:04:41.420> their<00:04:41.570> own

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
everything they have their own

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:53.920 
everything they have their own
preference<00:04:51.790> as<00:04:52.790> I<00:04:52.940> stated<00:04:53.240> earlier<00:04:53.780> I'd

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
preference as I stated earlier I'd

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.930 
preference as I stated earlier I'd
prefer<00:04:54.350> to<00:04:54.560> use<00:04:54.770> a<00:04:54.800> slow<00:04:55.220> setting<00:04:55.520> if<00:04:55.760> I'm

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
prefer to use a slow setting if I'm

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.970 
prefer to use a slow setting if I'm
doing<00:04:56.240> any<00:04:56.360> type<00:04:56.630> of<00:04:56.660> rotoscoping<00:04:57.650> or<00:04:57.800> any

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
doing any type of rotoscoping or any

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.920 
doing any type of rotoscoping or any
type<00:04:58.250> of<00:04:58.280> graphic<00:04:58.820> design<00:04:59.180> where<00:04:59.420> I'm<00:04:59.540> drawing

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
type of graphic design where I'm drawing

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.540 
type of graphic design where I'm drawing
towards<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.890> end<00:05:01.010> you<00:05:01.070> see<00:05:01.280> me<00:05:01.400> do

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
towards the end you see me do

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.580 
towards the end you see me do
rotoscoping<00:05:02.480> where<00:05:02.630> I<00:05:02.660> have<00:05:02.870> it<00:05:02.990> it's<00:05:03.260> very

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
rotoscoping where I have it it's very

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.110 
rotoscoping where I have it it's very
slow<00:05:03.980> a<00:05:04.010> setting<00:05:04.580> and<00:05:04.730> you'll<00:05:04.820> see<00:05:05.000> my

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
slow a setting and you'll see my

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.790 
slow a setting and you'll see my
rotoscoping<00:05:05.810> skills<00:05:06.140> get<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.350> little<00:05:06.650> bit

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
rotoscoping skills get a little bit

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.880 
rotoscoping skills get a little bit
better<00:05:07.450> I'm<00:05:08.450> not<00:05:08.630> the<00:05:08.780> best<00:05:09.020> at<00:05:09.170> racing<00:05:09.710> but

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
better I'm not the best at racing but

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.880 
better I'm not the best at racing but
it's<00:05:10.760> a<00:05:10.820> lot<00:05:11.000> easier<00:05:11.030> for<00:05:11.480> me<00:05:11.540> to<00:05:11.660> trace<00:05:12.200> with

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
it's a lot easier for me to trace with

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.290 
it's a lot easier for me to trace with
this<00:05:13.070> mouse<00:05:13.370> pin<00:05:15.310> with<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.340> options<00:05:16.940> set<00:05:17.180> up

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
this mouse pin with the options set up

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.380 
this mouse pin with the options set up
here<00:05:18.070> have<00:05:19.070> a<00:05:19.100> little<00:05:19.400> bit<00:05:19.490> on<00:05:19.580> the<00:05:19.730> slow<00:05:20.000> side

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
here have a little bit on the slow side

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.740 
here have a little bit on the slow side
if<00:05:20.600> I<00:05:20.720> try<00:05:21.020> it<00:05:21.080> on<00:05:21.170> a<00:05:21.230> faster<00:05:22.010> side<00:05:22.450> it<00:05:23.450> kind<00:05:23.630> of

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
if I try it on a faster side it kind of

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.630 
if I try it on a faster side it kind of
gets<00:05:23.900> away<00:05:24.140> from<00:05:24.170> me<00:05:24.410> a<00:05:24.710> little<00:05:24.890> bit<00:05:25.100> too<00:05:25.280> quick

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
gets away from me a little bit too quick

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.210 
gets away from me a little bit too quick
I'm<00:05:26.570> not<00:05:26.780> trying<00:05:27.110> to<00:05:27.230> suggest<00:05:27.380> everybody<00:05:27.950> has

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
I'm not trying to suggest everybody has

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.160 
I'm not trying to suggest everybody has
to<00:05:28.370> get<00:05:28.460> a<00:05:28.520> track<00:05:28.850> ball<00:05:29.090> or<00:05:29.270> a<00:05:29.300> mouse<00:05:29.570> and<00:05:30.020> they

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
to get a track ball or a mouse and they

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.690 
to get a track ball or a mouse and they
work<00:05:30.320> better<00:05:30.590> for<00:05:30.920> my<00:05:31.130> needs

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
work better for my needs

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.400 
work better for my needs
I'm<00:05:32.030> just<00:05:32.270> trying<00:05:32.570> to<00:05:32.660> demonstrate<00:05:32.900> it<00:05:33.350> I

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
I'm just trying to demonstrate it I

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.350 
I'm just trying to demonstrate it I
don't<00:05:33.620> think<00:05:33.740> the<00:05:34.100> speed<00:05:34.430> of<00:05:34.580> the<00:05:34.730> mouse<00:05:34.970> is

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
don't think the speed of the mouse is

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.120 
don't think the speed of the mouse is
what<00:05:35.720> should<00:05:35.960> be<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.260> most<00:05:36.560> important

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
what should be the most important

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.470 
what should be the most important
criteria<00:05:37.280> when<00:05:37.880> getting<00:05:38.090> a<00:05:38.240> mouse<00:05:38.450> a

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
criteria when getting a mouse a

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.290 
criteria when getting a mouse a
trackball<00:05:39.080> or<00:05:39.440> a<00:05:39.470> mouse<00:05:39.710> pen<00:05:40.190> and<00:05:40.580> as<00:05:40.970> you<00:05:41.150> can

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
trackball or a mouse pen and as you can

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.540 
trackball or a mouse pen and as you can
see<00:05:41.540> on<00:05:41.750> the<00:05:42.020> faster<00:05:42.530> setting<00:05:42.980> I<00:05:43.190> not

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
see on the faster setting I not

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.940 
see on the faster setting I not
rotoscoping<00:05:44.300> half<00:05:44.570> as<00:05:44.750> good<00:05:44.930> as<00:05:44.960> I<00:05:45.260> did<00:05:45.470> on<00:05:45.500> the

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
rotoscoping half as good as I did on the

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.890 
rotoscoping half as good as I did on the
other<00:05:46.100> side<00:05:46.430> when<00:05:46.670> I<00:05:46.700> said<00:05:46.970> it<00:05:47.090> even<00:05:47.210> slower<00:05:47.750> I

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
other side when I said it even slower I

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.000 
other side when I said it even slower I
can<00:05:48.140> actually<00:05:48.320> rotoscope

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
can actually rotoscope

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:57.320 
can actually rotoscope
really<00:05:49.430> well

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:04.279 

I<00:05:57.360> can<00:05:57.990> stop<00:06:00.590> flex<00:06:01.590> my<00:06:01.770> fingers<00:06:02.220> if<00:06:02.370> I<00:06:02.520> want<00:06:03.289> I'm

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
I can stop flex my fingers if I want I'm

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:15.690 
I can stop flex my fingers if I want I'm
right<00:06:04.500> back<00:06:04.740> where<00:06:04.800> I<00:06:05.099> left<00:06:05.400> off<00:06:08.930> right<00:06:09.930> here

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.350 

finish<00:06:16.420> tracing<00:06:17.170> it

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:31.080 

tracing<00:06:21.360> it

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.170 

I'm<00:06:31.630> not<00:06:31.810> that<00:06:31.960> great<00:06:32.169> at<00:06:32.380> racing<00:06:32.919> but<00:06:33.180> he's

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
I'm not that great at racing but he's

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.990 
I'm not that great at racing but he's
just<00:06:34.300> for<00:06:34.570> me<00:06:35.040> having<00:06:36.040> it<00:06:36.160> said<00:06:36.400> if<00:06:36.520> it<00:06:36.639> slows<00:06:36.940> a

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 
just for me having it said if it slows a

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000 
just for me having it said if it slows a
lot<00:06:37.510> better<00:06:37.870> than<00:06:38.050> have<00:06:38.230> it<00:06:38.350> move<00:06:38.620> way<00:06:38.949> too

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
lot better than have it move way too

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.850 
lot better than have it move way too
quick

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.350 

just<00:06:44.860> like<00:06:45.040> traits<00:06:45.520> a<00:06:45.610> lot<00:06:45.790> better<00:06:46.120> than<00:06:46.300> I

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
just like traits a lot better than I

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.070 
just like traits a lot better than I
could<00:06:46.600> with<00:06:46.750> the<00:06:48.750> well<00:06:49.750> that's<00:06:49.930> just

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
could with the well that's just

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.610 
could with the well that's just
basically<00:06:50.620> me<00:06:50.889> tracing<00:06:50.919> it<00:06:51.760> I<00:06:52.350> can<00:06:53.350> actually

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
basically me tracing it I can actually

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.860 
basically me tracing it I can actually
just<00:06:53.860> take<00:06:54.340> this<00:06:54.520> track<00:06:54.910> ball<00:06:55.180> like<00:06:55.419> I<00:06:55.449> said

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
just take this track ball like I said

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.840 
just take this track ball like I said
I'd<00:06:56.020> come<00:06:56.260> over<00:06:56.290> here<00:06:56.710> and<00:06:56.860> try<00:06:57.460> and<00:06:57.490> use<00:06:57.760> the

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850 
I'd come over here and try and use the

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.110 
I'd come over here and try and use the
trackball<00:06:58.210> and<00:06:58.690> trace<00:06:58.960> it<00:06:59.260> but<00:06:59.729> it<00:07:00.729> just<00:07:00.790> the

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
trackball and trace it but it just the

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.090 
trackball and trace it but it just the
track<00:07:01.360> balls<00:07:01.630> never<00:07:01.930> as<00:07:02.199> good<00:07:02.470> as<00:07:02.590> I<00:07:02.710> want<00:07:02.949> it

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.100 
track balls never as good as I want it

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.520 
track balls never as good as I want it
to<00:07:03.250> be<00:07:03.490> tell<00:07:03.880> you<00:07:04.060> the<00:07:04.150> truth<00:07:04.510> but<00:07:05.050> yeah<00:07:05.200> I<00:07:05.229> can

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 
to be tell you the truth but yeah I can

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.020 
to be tell you the truth but yeah I can
do<00:07:05.620> a<00:07:05.650> big<00:07:05.860> job<00:07:06.070> what<00:07:06.400> did<00:07:06.520> I'd<00:07:06.639> rather<00:07:06.820> use

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.030 
do a big job what did I'd rather use

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:13.230 
do a big job what did I'd rather use
trackball<00:07:07.570> the<00:07:07.780> mouse<00:07:08.790> but<00:07:09.790> the<00:07:11.760> mouse<00:07:12.760> pen

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 
trackball the mouse but the mouse pen

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.530 
trackball the mouse but the mouse pen
works<00:07:13.479> pretty<00:07:13.720> good<00:07:14.050> for<00:07:14.290> this<00:07:14.380> type<00:07:14.620> of<00:07:14.650> stuff

you're doing rotoscoping you might find
out<00:07:40.810> that<00:07:40.840> the<00:07:41.229> slower<00:07:41.470> setting<00:07:41.770> might<00:07:42.100> work

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:42.310 
out that the slower setting might work

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.820 
out that the slower setting might work
out<00:07:42.550> a<00:07:42.580> little<00:07:42.789> bit<00:07:43.090> better<00:07:43.300> and<00:07:43.830> hopefully

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:44.830 
out a little bit better and hopefully

out a little bit better and hopefully
somebody<00:07:45.100> learned<00:07:45.400> something<00:07:45.789> from<00:07:45.850> this

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:46.180 
somebody learned something from this

somebody learned something from this
I've<00:07:46.419> had<00:07:46.450> this<00:07:46.780> you<00:07:47.470> know<00:07:47.590> on<00:07:47.740> my<00:07:47.860> hard<00:07:48.160> drive

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:48.220 
I've had this you know on my hard drive

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.890 
I've had this you know on my hard drive
for<00:07:48.400> probably<00:07:48.760> about<00:07:48.880> eight<00:07:49.090> or<00:07:49.270> nine<00:07:49.330> months

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:49.900 
for probably about eight or nine months

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:54.000 
for probably about eight or nine months
I<00:07:49.960> just<00:07:49.990> now<00:07:50.260> had<00:07:50.470> time<00:07:50.680> to<00:07:50.830> actually<00:07:50.979> edit<00:07:51.880> it
