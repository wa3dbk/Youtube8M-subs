have<00:02:12.800> really<00:02:13.100> turned<00:02:13.310> this<00:02:13.460> game<00:02:13.900> they<00:02:14.900> could

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.480 
have really turned this game they could
actually<00:02:15.290> be<00:02:15.590> important<00:02:15.980> but<00:02:16.070> I<00:02:16.370> actually

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
actually be important but I actually

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.610
