video<00:00:31.230> before<00:00:32.090> I'm<00:00:33.090> not<00:00:33.329> quite<00:00:33.540> sure<00:00:33.570> but<00:00:34.079> I

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
video before I'm not quite sure but I

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.709 
video before I'm not quite sure but I
can<00:00:34.680> rhyme<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.250> everything's<00:00:35.700> okay<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.210> think

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719

breaking due to bleaching and dyeing and
stuff<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.770> yes<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.189> your<00:01:47.820> hair<00:01:48.030> with<00:01:48.329> like

think it probably did aid on the
breaking<00:01:53.460> more<00:01:53.640> I'm<00:01:54.270> gonna<00:01:54.420> go<00:01:54.509> into<00:01:54.659> too<00:01:54.810> much
