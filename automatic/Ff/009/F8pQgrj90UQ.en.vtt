00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.320
 And there, guys, I'm cipher. 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.540
 I will teach you and today I will 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.520
 simplified version of the song Rain 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.260
 double joão bosco and vinícius 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.090
 in the original version this song played in 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.130
 the guitar is a stump in 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.689
 research like this new 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.610
 simplified I'm going to teach half tone 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.560
 below it will become smaller and will 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.480
 ease the chords a bit 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.610
 So let's go and play the whole song. 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:49.710
 people will use a rhythm in only 5 chords 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:49.710
 if smaller only greater is bigger 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.010
 Greater there 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.220
 and f 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.290
 the first part stays so the sky is 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.080
 closed 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:14.760
 It looks like a male Venetian garden after 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:18.530
 the mb show never more money 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:22.050
 how to forget all the mothers that we 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.930
 and loved without losing 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:29.780
 did not have 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.780
 and the streets choose the most 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.910
 I'll play the rhythm once I wander and 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.910
 then immediately shows how does 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.579
 to make this rhythm we will go 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:49.460
 starting with the agreement of this minor 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:55.180
 will play two down back and forth 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.180
 low and 1-1 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.460
 soon this pace will be used in the 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.680
 whole song in the first part and 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.690
 be played twice in each chord with 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.520
 except for the last two chords where 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.259
 it will be played once in each 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.580
 I'm going to play the first part sequence. 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.940
 complete for you to see how 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.940
 stay 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.980
 chorus the same pace it will be 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.629
 touched once each cut after the 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.250
 song will repeat itself with the 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.620
 same chords same pace as us 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.610
 I'm not going to play the full song now. 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.610
 guys, train together with me. 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.359
 the celso is closed 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.359

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.970

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.200

 it looks more like poison 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.980

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.490
