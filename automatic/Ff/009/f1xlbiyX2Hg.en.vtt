00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.870
 hello everyone I'm informant welcome to 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.949
 a new video tutorial by Felix this 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.370
 com 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:46.100
 we continue with blender and we will see a 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.940
 second approach a second method of 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.640
 texturing of our objects that 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.790
 would consist in the deployment of 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.360
 faces of that object to have a greater 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.870
 control over the placement of that 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.190
 texture on geometry is what it 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.440
 known as the name of a watt vw 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.950
 referring to the coordinates of a 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:17.750
 texture on the surface of an object 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.979
 starting from the previous project you can 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:25.780
 see how we got here 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:29.020
 let's see this example let's 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:33.619
 proceed to unfold these faces 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.610
 to place the texture where to us 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.510
 we like it more 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.430
 so we go to the panel of you know 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:46.850
 like to the editing panel 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.820
 and here we had the internal texture a 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.600
 internal texture that has its own 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.100
 blender software 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.490
 with which we are going to do the practice 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.380
 let's go on you'll see that it does not appear 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.689
 the textured object because apart from 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.920
 everything is not in the texture view but 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.759
 now we are going to 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.030
 when pressing on the key 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.560
 but before pressing the key 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.170
 we will have to enter edit mode 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.810
 tap key 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.599
 and we have the vertices or the faces 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.849
 well we'll see how our principle 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.160
 we have the whole object all the geometry 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.260
 selected now if we click on the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.510
 key 1 and you see that they appear different 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.160
 different types of options 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.830
 projections you already know that it is a 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.650
 case projection we had used the 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.930
 cube position in the previous 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.709
 for the previous tutorial so that the 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:49.960
 the texture is framed in quotes 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:53.410
 on the faces of the cube- shaped object 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.410
 but we are going to use here 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.330
 directly appear appear different 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.530
 types of options we will use the 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.440
 smart 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.440
 project press you see that a 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.590
 New window here in someone limit 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:15.280
 let's write 89 that would be the value 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:17.730
 maximum and click on ok and you see that in 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.100
 this part of here has been removed the 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.550
 texture we can make it appear in 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.830
 this option here we press and we get 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.450
 the texture that we have used pictures or 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.450
 you can load exterior texture 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.430
 and here we are going to control tap and 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.310
 let's select face you see there 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.300
 a face already selected you see as here 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:47.880
 all the faces have been displayed 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:50.740
 six faces of the cube and here the 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:55.460
 those faces we're not going to make dinner 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:57.770
 and you see how the face appears shaded 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.170
 the face that we have selected here in 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.250
 the part of the right we're going to do that 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.890
 here 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.520
 the object is textured to be able 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:11.270
 see how we go as we have the texture and 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:16.640
 in principle we start from the one of this 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:19.370
 projection let's go to the panel 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.989
 default and we're going to make the 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.230
 projection no longer do 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.990
 forgiveness coordinates or be generated but 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.970
 that are of type v that is what we are 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.130
 using now we go back again to 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:37.160
 panel v editing and you see how here already 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:40.430
 appears we are going to do 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:45.500
 let's see how we can now control 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:49.880
 the texture situation about 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:54.590
 any face of the object let's go 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:58.370
 for example let's go tap control and we're going to 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.950
 select vertices and for example let's 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.310
 to make this face here 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:07.490
 framing in b 7 then we click on the 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:11.300
 vertices right button g key to 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.009
 take the vertex and let's place it there 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.550
 in the 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:20.880
 in the area of 7 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:27.800
 and beige as it appears on the right 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.800
 the updated texture we are placing 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:35.640
 and I repeat you see how it appears 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:39.870
 the texture as we have total control is 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:44.160
 a process a little more complex but the 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:48.020
 control is total about the situation of 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:53.250
 the texture on that face you see here as 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:55.140
 appears is zone 7 and the same 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.590
 we could obviously do for the 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.420
 rest of the faces okay this is all a 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.600
 greeting and until the next video 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.600
 tutorial
