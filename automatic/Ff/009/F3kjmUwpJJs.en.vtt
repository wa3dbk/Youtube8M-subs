 passing of this company to me 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.719
 I liked the principle that took time 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.270
 these computers on 8 you can even nine of 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.070
 ten can be appreciated that time which 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.739

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.149
 hours passed from this company yes yes yes 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.010

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.630
 thanks to microsoft windows xp flyball with 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.579

 In general, guys are a good company to play 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.730
 probably worth it so much 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.790
 Old school standard I generally think that 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.630
 You can basically fight something modern 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.580
 the standards for this wanted company naturally 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.599
 already need to be diluted long time ago with something 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.420
 I will have a non-standard skill 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:32.530

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:40.310
 then it was only born 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:44.720
 quality on the turn will have to pull out 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:48.079

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.790
