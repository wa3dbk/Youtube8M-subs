really getting delayed because it never

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.700 
really getting delayed because it never

had an actual release date but it's

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.560 
had an actual release date but it's
taking<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.160> long<00:00:35.370> time<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.149> know<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.329> lot<00:00:36.510> of

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
taking a long time and I know a lot of

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.889 
taking a long time and I know a lot of
people<00:00:36.660> are<00:00:36.899> frustrated<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:38.180> we<00:00:39.180> feel<00:00:39.450> we

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
people are frustrated and we feel we

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.450 
people are frustrated and we feel we
feel<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.260> same<00:00:40.290> thing<00:00:40.680> we<00:00:40.890> really<00:00:41.070> wanted<00:00:41.340> to

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
feel the same thing we really wanted to

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.720 
feel the same thing we really wanted to
come<00:00:41.550> out<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:42.870> all<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.040> really<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.489> do

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
come out and all you really have to do

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.410 
come out and all you really have to do
is<00:00:44.879> wait<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.390> hope<00:00:45.450> for<00:00:45.960> someone<00:00:47.030> someone<00:00:48.030> can

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
is wait and hope for someone someone can

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.799 
is wait and hope for someone someone can
do<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.140> if<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.100> upgrade<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.579> five<00:00:51.090> or<00:00:51.480> six

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
do this so if you upgrade to five or six

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.470 
do this so if you upgrade to five or six
point<00:00:52.110> Oh<00:00:52.260> point2<00:00:52.860> he<00:00:53.520> says<00:00:53.789> they'll<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.239> less

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
point Oh point2 he says they'll be less

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.569 
point Oh point2 he says they'll be less
likely<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:55.079> jailbreak<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.770> support<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.160> now

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
likely a jailbreak to support that now

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.459 
likely a jailbreak to support that now
comics<00:00:57.120> folded<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.629> telling<00:00:58.109> him<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
comics folded up telling him the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.189 
comics folded up telling him the
basically<00:00:59.120> if<00:01:00.120> someone<00:01:00.480> released<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.870> new<00:01:00.989> jail

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
basically if someone released a new jail

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.810 
basically if someone released a new jail
where<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.410> could<00:01:01.590> obviously<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.430> work<00:01:02.579> for

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
where I could obviously have to work for

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.700 
where I could obviously have to work for
the<00:01:02.910> new<00:01:03.059> version<00:01:03.270> now<00:01:04.019> since<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> new

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
the new version now since the new

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.679 
the new version now since the new
version<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.220> only<00:01:05.369> bug<00:01:05.610> fixes<00:01:06.060> i<00:01:06.270> recommend

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
version is only bug fixes i recommend

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.660 
version is only bug fixes i recommend
you<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:07.020> stay<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> current<00:01:08.280> version<00:01:08.400> you

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
you just stay on the current version you

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.990 
you just stay on the current version you
have<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.270> save<00:01:09.479> your<00:01:09.630> SHSH<00:01:10.170> blobs<00:01:10.820> if<00:01:11.820> you

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
have you can save your SHSH blobs if you

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.250 
have you can save your SHSH blobs if you
want<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.420> there's<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:12.930> too<00:01:12.990> much

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
want but there's really not too much

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.070 
want but there's really not too much
point<00:01:13.590> into<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.130> because<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:15.840> can't

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
point into that because you can't

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.350 
point into that because you can't
downgrade<00:01:16.320> until<00:01:16.920> there's<00:01:17.100> an<00:01:17.250> exploit<00:01:17.700> on

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
downgrade until there's an exploit on

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.469 
downgrade until there's an exploit on
the<00:01:18.720> current<00:01:19.020> version<00:01:19.250> so<00:01:20.250> not<00:01:20.939> too<00:01:21.119> much<00:01:21.240> luck

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
the current version so not too much luck

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.270 
the current version so not too much luck
there<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:22.409> wanted<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> bring<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:22.950> video

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
there just wanted to bring this video

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.039 
there just wanted to bring this video
telling<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:23.970> about<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> new<00:01:24.330> firmware<00:01:24.570> what

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
telling you about the new firmware what

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.960 
telling you about the new firmware what
it<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:25.680> only<00:01:25.890> bug<00:01:26.189> fixes<00:01:26.700> if

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
it is it's really only bug fixes if

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.300 
it is it's really only bug fixes if
you're<00:01:27.509> having<00:01:27.750> problems<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.560> your<00:01:28.619> iPad<00:01:29.070> or

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
you're having problems with your iPad or

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.569 
you're having problems with your iPad or
iPhone<00:01:29.850> 5<00:01:30.210> then<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.840> guess<00:01:31.350> updating<00:01:32.310> would<00:01:32.430> be

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
iPhone 5 then I guess updating would be

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.590 
iPhone 5 then I guess updating would be
fine<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:33.180> you're<00:01:33.299> really<00:01:33.390> not

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
fine but if you're really not

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.840 
fine but if you're really not
experiencing<00:01:34.200> anything<00:01:34.860> wrong<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.460> then

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
experiencing anything wrong with it then

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.999 
experiencing anything wrong with it then
I<00:01:36.000> still<00:01:36.299> keep<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.780> six<00:01:37.229> point<00:01:37.470> zero<00:01:37.530> point

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
I still keep it on six point zero point

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.670 
I still keep it on six point zero point
one<00:01:38.189> or<00:01:38.369> 610<00:01:38.880> whichever<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.380> you're<00:01:40.500> on

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
one or 610 whichever one that you're on

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.859 
one or 610 whichever one that you're on
right<00:01:40.920> now<00:01:40.979> anyways<00:01:41.909> that's<00:01:42.119> pretty<00:01:42.390> much<00:01:42.509> all

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
right now anyways that's pretty much all

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.679 
right now anyways that's pretty much all
