on<00:01:20.140> purpose<00:01:20.710> shrub<00:01:21.370> but<00:01:22.240> by<00:01:22.780> using<00:01:22.810> this

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
on purpose shrub but by using this

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.980 
on purpose shrub but by using this
technique<00:01:24.010> you<00:01:24.160> going<00:01:24.430> fast<00:01:24.760> H<00:01:25.570> strong<00:01:25.930> is

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
technique you going fast H strong is

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.109 
technique you going fast H strong is
going<00:01:26.380> to<00:01:26.500> add<00:01:26.680> action<00:01:27.100> so<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:27.640> will<00:01:27.850> have<00:01:28.060> a

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
going to add action so it will have a

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.590 
going to add action so it will have a
good<00:01:28.450> going<00:01:29.350> over<00:01:29.470> exaggerate<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.430> shrub<00:01:30.729> so
