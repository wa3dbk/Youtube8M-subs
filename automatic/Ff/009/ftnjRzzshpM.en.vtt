00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.839
 yeah 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.839
 a It is as with 4 pieces 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.260
 Well dumping of the Aerial 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.780
 It is Nadai, but, for the time being, we will be ours 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.020
 I want to do it 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.830
 is 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:25.500
 Well I often say that I want to start aerial photography from now on 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.870
 In person 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.940
 is there 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.680
 I want to start aerial photography from now 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.829
 What kind of machine is good? 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.700
 I often ask what you need 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:45.500
 After all the best 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:48.560
 I have to tell you exactly what you want to do 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.850
 That there is no choice for advice 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.600
 Become 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.260
 For example 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.570
 I really want to wear 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:03.930
 It looks like a toy like this 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.880
 Now is also expected, as also with that camera intended about this Well a little bit 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.210
 It is larger'm much one size 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.140
 So-called this go pro from here 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.200
 It is what Kaga 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.330
 Like riding 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.380
 This size 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.909
 Things later, such as another put a handy feeling Toka such things 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.350
 About this size 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.940
 And to 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.370
 The size of the size we tried to receive 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.060
 truly 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.030
 There are many 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.880
 Well, let's say this 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.100
 Remnant 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.100
 It is ancient multi-I this neighborhood 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:49.280
 It is in that 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.390
 Well this is the person who is burnt 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.540
 By my preference 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:00.300
 What so went because this error Toka form of expectations 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.430
 It will do cormorant Well say I Maruchikoputa is clearly to say none roughly terms of performance is 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.120
 I do n't think he's such 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.179
 For example, I live here if it is this 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.950
 Naza 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.260
 5 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.370
 Version 2 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.760
 Ne 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.510
 This is it 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.850
 Unko's flight control is good 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.080
 I guess Board of array you see over there is the such the primary 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.120
 It is still in stock 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.980
 I think this is probably another day, Mr. Sakurai's divination 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.890
 I think I'll put it in memory 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.890
 After that, it is attached to such a big airframe 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.880
 Moth 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.069
 Yes yes 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.490
 Well there's a box here 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.640
 Well why it is a price you can buy four or five 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.580
 It is good because it is high 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.180
 Not bad because it is cheap 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.770
 I wonder if I say 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.730
 The best for my purpose 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:05.260
 I think it would be best if you change something cheap and good 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.680
 Well this kind of a 2 and that is why it is set to connect to a computer like this 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.920
 But 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.040
 Well this was next to a 3 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.330
 Ne 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.420
 Well then 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.420
 It will nourish and will be various 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.420
 Oh dear 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.670
 It is such a feeling after that 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.319
 It is fpv that'll keep's school now 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.500
 Hey 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.150
 I want to do it 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:40.590
 Well 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:43.170
 Image transfer device There are various things of this too, but all this according to my purpose already 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.990
 I think we should 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:54.420
 I do zoom 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:04:01.400
 And if you move it a little more this way, it will be a big mistake, so in real time the object 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:08.900
 Because if there is a delay in the image when you want to 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:12.190
 There is only this to say at work that there is almost no support 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.220
 Because say this so-called with this mind of pairs in this saying 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.489
 I use this because I have nothing 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:23.630
 It is is it so that this kind of Fu after 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:26.900
 It is that monitor, and set it like this 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.870
 I use it, but I like this monitor 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:35.010
 Try really to try various things 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.770
 Since we're doing with what arrived'll keep going to the final 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.230
 Even when I said a wolf during that time 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.200
 truly 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:45.070
 In the p mother 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:51.480
 This shade is also a little high without using anything 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.480
 This I will not come in handy because at all can also be used outside the spring Defeat 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:59.040
 Well there are so many things here 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.860
 Anyway 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.040
 What do you want to do what do you want 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:12.560
 Well thinking about this 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:15.220
 I think that it is easy to give advice if you can clearly ask questions 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.220
 It is Toritani
