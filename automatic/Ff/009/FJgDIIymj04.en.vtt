training

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.390 
training
I<00:00:09.150> knew<00:00:09.719> magic<00:00:09.929> was<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.380> best<00:00:10.679> combat<00:00:11.190> skill

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
I knew magic was the best combat skill

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.700 
I knew magic was the best combat skill
overall<00:00:11.849> because<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.690> abilities<00:00:13.139> did<00:00:13.469> more

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
overall because the abilities did more

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.740 
overall because the abilities did more
damage<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.309> they<00:00:14.700> are<00:00:14.849> generally<00:00:15.480> better

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
damage and they are generally better

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.140

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
mobbing moves and I can attack from far

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.019 
mobbing moves and I can attack from far

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
away so loveling up magic became my

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.689

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
detour of training and

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.259 
detour of training and
I<00:02:13.450> actually<00:02:13.810> went<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.650> fight<00:02:14.890> lark<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:16.090> was<00:02:16.239> a

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
I actually went to fight lark it was a

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.119 
I actually went to fight lark it was a
pretty<00:02:16.510> decent<00:02:16.690> fight<00:02:17.049> I<00:02:17.260> had<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.620> eat<00:02:17.799> a<00:02:17.830> lot

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
pretty decent fight I had to eat a lot

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.789 
pretty decent fight I had to eat a lot
so<00:02:18.430> this<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.120> probably<00:02:19.629> the<00:02:19.810> only<00:02:19.930> quest<00:02:20.349> so

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
so this is probably the only quest so

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.339 
so this is probably the only quest so
far<00:02:21.099> where<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.940> was<00:02:22.120> challenging<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:23.200> will

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
far where it was challenging you will

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.070 
far where it was challenging you will
see<00:02:23.560> why<00:02:23.709> in<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.099> future<00:02:24.340> videos<00:02:24.940> why<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.209> said

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
see why in the future videos why I said

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.070 
see why in the future videos why I said
it's<00:02:26.409> one<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:26.860> hardest<00:02:27.209> so<00:02:28.209> after<00:02:28.840> that

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
it's one of the hardest so after that

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.319 
it's one of the hardest so after that
ordeal<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.860> wanted<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.430> drink<00:02:30.610> some<00:02:30.730> prayer<00:02:31.120> I
