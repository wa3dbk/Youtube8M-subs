00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.870
 the people i would like the three 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.910
 Points 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.840
 from these of the lead this away 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.820
 demonstrate 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.380
 I have not done that myself so long 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.790
 i hope i can not i can 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.160
 they help me to play 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.140
 I start the three handles are whole 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.800
 easy are the g by the d and e 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.529
 minor 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.720
 I'll show you I have one 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:31.380
 with the g dur thus occupy the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.040
 middle finger to the e string in the third 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.160
 and the index finger comes second bunch 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.600
 on the a side and the little finger 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.559
 comes on the side on the high 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.100
 e string in the third point but games 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.100
 I'll do that 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:57.840
 so the topic makes sounds then those 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.570
 further to the gate we take the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.400
 index finger and there comes in the second 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.520
 point of the g string on the middle finger 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.670
 comes in the second point of the page 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.400
 high and the ring finger comes in 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.560
 the third and the h page should then 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.560
 sound like that 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.010
 but continue to find a new one with e minor 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.860
 me this is the easiest one here 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.770
 because you place your index finger in the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.960
 second wonder page and the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:42.990
 middle finger on the on the side 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:45.890
 in the second bund so here are the two 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.890
 I play also times 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:55.550
 Now I prefer to show this 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.550
 It simply beats the g major 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:05.429
 put your fingers back down so they can 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.229
 fit again and we we play so 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:21.330
 a down then smoke then 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:24.269
 at the time stops that goes on so 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.579
 you then that you just always just 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:34.130
 then to run down and me 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:34.130
 games then we switch to stop 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.510
 be between 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.750
 repelled yes I hope I had 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.100
 could help you with that 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.120
 needs or something then write me 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.550
 just record or just facebook 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.700
 I was able to do business under and 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.700
 young
