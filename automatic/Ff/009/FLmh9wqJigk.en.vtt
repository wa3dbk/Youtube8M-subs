00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.320
 bad but sexual we are for the usual 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.550
 refrain that is heard by now 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.560
 story and we went to the final like 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.580
 stops as it stops as it stops and 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.550
 how it stops 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.840
 they are three extraordinary players 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.070
 we must be very serious but 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.980
 above all we must start from 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.509
 assumption that it will hardly be a 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.259
 game that will end generation and then 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.259
 you have to make goals 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.830
 I guess we will have the possession of 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.720
 ball and I think there will be a counter 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.470
 very strong attack by the 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.120
 juventus colmar a murata count have a 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:57.180
 midfield strong vidal marchisio spot 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.280
 they are very strong and can send from a 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.070
 side of the field without problems 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.890
 so counterattack is a pitfall 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.830
 we need to focus and focus on 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.000
 ball possession to create opportunities e 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.979
 to mark the truth barcelona is not 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.680
 only the attack took if not 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.680
 mistake 21 goals in the league so this 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.770
 shows that it is a team that also knows 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.900
 who also knows how to defend 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.450
 I believe the 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.860
 we should especially play the game 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.040
 win in midfield 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.410
 surely it is there where we can do the 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.790
 difference in quality and 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.790
 above all of physicality 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.000
 well of course the midfield usually 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.939
 is one of the field sector where 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.460
 the whole game is created both defensive and 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.530
 offensive 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:00.690
 I don't know if it's going to be all there 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.759
 also the offensive area should dominate 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.600
 that defensive if possible though 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:10.349
 surely we are interested in keeping the ball 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.599
 and create dangers to the defense of 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.140
 juventus and make the most of all the 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.140
 occasions we have 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.599
 but it was all the players will come mld 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.439
 self because the unique quantity we do not have 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.760
 possibility of a revenge and therefore 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:31.269
 you have to be all the best 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.890
 physical conditions and we are mental and 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.079
 we are and therefore there is only to play 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.230
 good against a team that has big 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:40.959
 great collective individuality though 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.200
 like all the teams in the first two points 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.200
 flights 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.340
 time to take care of where to play this 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.630
 final is a dream is a dream I had 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.230
 since I was a child 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.620
 since I was six seven I always have 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.890
 thought and now it's finally arrived 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.890
 the moment 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.280
 that's why I think of what 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.920
 I have to do tomorrow to come out the winner 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.950
 to win tomorrow with my team 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.660
 I live this dream that is precisely that 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.660
 to win the champions 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.210
 even history says that juve at least 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:40.520
 in the semifinals of the Champions League there 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:41.990
 it should almost always arrive and how 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.650
 second thing gives us a big one 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:49.190
 responsibility a great responsibility 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.410
 because we know that in case they should 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.800
 go well things have done something 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.280
 of unexpected great though a 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.570
 something I almost don't say normal 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.650
 in the history of juve, however, something 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:07.100
 that must make us happy but that is what it is 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.489
 let's play in the juve we represent the 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.940
 better in my opinion of the companies and 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.910
 Italian teams and for which it would be a 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.090
 great result but it is something that there 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.090
 It is
