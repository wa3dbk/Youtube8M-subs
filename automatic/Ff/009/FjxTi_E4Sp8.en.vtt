00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
not by much you know you just got

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.420 
not by much you know you just got
another<00:01:32.300> thirty<00:01:32.570> one<00:01:32.720> percent<00:01:32.890> Mumma<00:01:33.890> is<00:01:33.920> back

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
another thirty one percent Mumma is back

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.950 
another thirty one percent Mumma is back
so<00:01:34.670> he<00:01:34.790> can<00:01:34.910> maybe<00:01:35.270> start<00:01:35.510> working<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:35.900> little

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
so he can maybe start working a little

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.080 
so he can maybe start working a little
something<00:01:36.380> better<00:01:38.200> now<00:01:39.200> they<00:01:39.380> both<00:01:39.650> have<00:01:40.090> the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
something better now they both have the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.850 
something better now they both have the
tendency<00:01:41.330> of<00:01:41.510> killing<00:01:41.840> off<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.020> top<00:01:42.410> right

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
tendency of killing off the top right

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.480
