on<00:02:12.060> there<00:02:12.300> as<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.570> highlight<00:02:13.200> because

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
on there as a highlight because

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:22.280 
on there as a highlight because
everything<00:02:14.970> else<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.390> shimmer<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:20.600> also<00:02:21.600> to

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
everything else is shimmer and also to

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:31.370 
everything else is shimmer and also to
blend<00:02:22.560> away<00:02:22.680> any<00:02:22.950> harsh<00:02:23.250> lines<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:30.110> I<00:02:31.110> just

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
blend away any harsh lines and I just

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.870

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.990 

so<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.990> was<00:02:40.650> no<00:02:40.830> additional<00:02:41.400> product<00:02:41.790> there

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
so I was no additional product there

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.430 
so I was no additional product there
i'll<00:02:42.180> just<00:02:42.450> keep<00:02:42.690> on<00:02:45.110> blending<00:02:46.110> out

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
i'll just keep on blending out

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.570 
i'll just keep on blending out
everything<00:02:47.600> blending<00:02:48.600> on<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:50.130> lower<00:02:50.280> lash

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
everything blending on the lower lash

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.740 
everything blending on the lower lash
line<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:54.800> just<00:02:55.800> mixing<00:02:56.610> both<00:02:56.970> colors<00:02:57.420> very

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
line and just mixing both colors very

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.880 
line and just mixing both colors very
well<00:02:58.880> now<00:02:59.880> i'm<00:03:00.480> gonna<00:03:00.900> take<00:03:01.170> shell-shocked

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
well now i'm gonna take shell-shocked

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.420 
well now i'm gonna take shell-shocked
with<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:03.330> flat<00:03:03.720> shader<00:03:04.110> brush<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:07.200> i<00:03:08.070> find<00:03:08.340> that

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
with a flat shader brush and i find that

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.330 
with a flat shader brush and i find that
this<00:03:08.700> brush<00:03:09.350> helps<00:03:10.350> out<00:03:10.680> with<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.040> creaminess

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
this brush helps out with the creaminess

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.910 
this brush helps out with the creaminess
of<00:03:11.850> these<00:03:12.150> shadows<00:03:13.020> because<00:03:13.350> they<00:03:13.680> are<00:03:13.890> very

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
of these shadows because they are very

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.210 
of these shadows because they are very
creamy<00:03:14.550> especially<00:03:15.300> shell-shocked<00:03:16.220> so

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
creamy especially shell-shocked so

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.430 
creamy especially shell-shocked so
that's<00:03:17.640> what<00:03:17.850> it<00:03:17.940> looks<00:03:18.150> like<00:03:18.300> before<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.140> add

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
that's what it looks like before you add

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.980 
that's what it looks like before you add
it<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.860> i<00:03:20.370> like<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.820> tap<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.330> on<00:03:21.450> there<00:03:21.720> and

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
it and i like to tap it on there and

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.600 
it and i like to tap it on there and
