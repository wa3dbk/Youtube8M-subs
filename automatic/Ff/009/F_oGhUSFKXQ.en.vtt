00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 for many, mathematics is the cause of 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.109
 headaches and if it is one of those 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.059
 they say I'm still waiting for the day when 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.429
 use the perfect square trinomial in 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.110
 my daily life maybe it's because you're from 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.059
 those who prefer to be as far 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.880
 possible of the algebra classes or 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.470
 calculation but have you wondered why 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.130
 it costs us so much work to learn 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.130
 maths 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.130
 There is a great variety of factors that 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.470
 can affect the learning of 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.380
 math that can appear during 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.150
 development or even in adults like 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.150
 for example brain injuries that 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.440
 affect certain cognitive functions 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.750
 but in this video we will not talk about 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.180
 these situations but in the development 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.370
 normal unlike other subjects 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.739
 Mathematics goes from the concrete to 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.190
 the abstract and from the specific to the 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.420
 general in a hierarchical way so 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.690
 what if in the learning process 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.579
 some concept is not well understood this 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.910
 will create problems in more issues 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.379
 advanced then your problems for 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.690
 learn differential calculus 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.610
 maybe they come from when you were in the 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.170
 kindergarten or even before 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.120
 our ability to learn 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.800
 mathematics has a lot to do with the 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.410
 early stimulation that the 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.720
 children since the basic principles of 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.030
 this matter are based on understanding the 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.940
 concept of the number and principles of 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.150
 count as the correspondence the order 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.070
 the cardinal age the fraction and that before 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.890
 that the child goes to school and 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.470
 experience their development and that they can 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.690
 greatly facilitate the way 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.910
 understand abstract concepts 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.820
 another important point that affects 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.130
 directly the learning ability 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.710
 mathematical especially in children is 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.030
 an archaic teaching system where the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.880
 material is taught in a way 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.790
 revisited and in general converts 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.140
 students in simple spectators and 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.850
 taking into account that there are 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.070
 individual differences between 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.530
 students using only one model 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.540
 Teaching will cause not all 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.330
 students can be adapted from a 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.710
 appropriate to the study model and 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.060
 they begin to have problems of 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.920
 learning and finally bad teachers 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.800
 since knowing how to count does not mean that 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.470
 you know how to tell and this applies to 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.330
 all levels of mathematics and 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.830
 if we add to this the large amount 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.400
 of students in a classroom 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.950
 forget about personalized attention and 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.200
 so if you have one or all of them 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.410
 these problems how can they be for 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.480
 improve your math 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.220
 It is a fact that most of 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.650
 the problems that you have when you study 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.570
 mathematics is because they have not 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.060
 understood previous concepts of a 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.610
 adequately reminds you that the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.710
 Mathematics are built step by step 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.900
 so if you have not understood well 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.210
 some concept can go on 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.340
 but eventually this will take you to 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.580
 fail and not understand more questions 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.920
 advanced be patient and do not hurry 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.050
 when you study mathematics are 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.850
 abstract and your brain needs time 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.360
 to assimilate a concept that is not 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.320
 Specifically also always ask your 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.240
 teachers when something is not clear to you 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.250
 especially if the math is you 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.500
 make it difficult is not because you do not have 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.090
 the capacity most likely is that only 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.680
 you need to understand the concepts better 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.629
 basic 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.060
 you have an interesting question that you 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.719
 would like to see on this channel leave it at
