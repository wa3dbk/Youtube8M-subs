00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
the middle class as well so this is an

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.610 
the middle class as well so this is an
opposite<00:03:02.849> of<00:03:03.030> some<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.840> well<00:03:04.139> I<00:03:04.170> don't<00:03:04.470> know<00:03:04.560> if

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
opposite of some of well I don't know if

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.580 
opposite of some of well I don't know if
we've<00:03:04.739> looked<00:03:04.920> at<00:03:05.010> any<00:03:05.389> kind<00:03:06.389> of<00:03:06.959> archetypal

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
we've looked at any kind of archetypal

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.710 
we've looked at any kind of archetypal
what<00:03:08.189> are<00:03:08.280> called<00:03:08.459> morality<00:03:08.730> paintings<00:03:09.510> yet

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
what are called morality paintings yet

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.179 
what are called morality paintings yet
maybe<00:03:09.870> we<00:03:10.049> will<00:03:10.200> in<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.470> weeks<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.829> come<00:03:10.859> but

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
maybe we will in the weeks to come but

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.990 
maybe we will in the weeks to come but
this<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.879> opposite<00:03:12.239> of<00:03:12.359> that<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.829> Renoir

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
this is the opposite of that and Renoir

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.660 
this is the opposite of that and Renoir
complements<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.030> or<00:03:15.500> substantiates<00:03:16.500> that

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
complements that or substantiates that

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.330 
complements that or substantiates that
through<00:03:17.670> his<00:03:17.909> particular<00:03:18.620> brushwork<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:20.220> can

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
through his particular brushwork you can

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.360 
through his particular brushwork you can
see<00:03:20.489> it's<00:03:20.609> very<00:03:20.819> quick<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:22.500> brushes<00:03:22.949> the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
see it's very quick the brushes the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.740 
see it's very quick the brushes the
strokes<00:03:23.730> are<00:03:24.030> very<00:03:24.230> fast<00:03:25.230> there's<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.280> very

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
strokes are very fast there's a very

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.869 
strokes are very fast there's a very
flowing<00:03:27.750> kind<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.379> spinning<00:03:29.040> nature<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.669> a<00:03:29.699> lot

flowing kind of spinning nature to a lot

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.030 
flowing kind of spinning nature to a lot
of<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.060> figures<00:03:30.389> that<00:03:31.109> we<00:03:31.230> see<00:03:31.410> depicted<00:03:31.560> in

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
of the figures that we see depicted in

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.270 
of the figures that we see depicted in
this<00:03:32.160> painting<00:03:32.459> also<00:03:33.120> notice<00:03:34.079> how<00:03:34.290> Renoir

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
this painting also notice how Renoir

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.159 
this painting also notice how Renoir
captures<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:36.000> natural<00:03:36.449> and<00:03:36.659> the<00:03:36.780> artificial

captures the natural and the artificial

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.619 
captures the natural and the artificial
light<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.859> almost<00:03:38.340> appears<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:39.030> give<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.299> the

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
light and almost appears to give the the

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.930 
light and almost appears to give the the
painting<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:40.019> kind<00:03:40.199> of<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.319> flickering<00:03:40.940> and

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
painting that kind of a flickering and

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.300 
painting that kind of a flickering and
of<00:03:42.030> course<00:03:42.269> capturing<00:03:43.019> lighting<00:03:43.440> accurately

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
of course capturing lighting accurately

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.460 
of course capturing lighting accurately
and<00:03:44.519> depicting<00:03:45.329> that<00:03:45.480> in<00:03:45.659> new<00:03:45.810> ways<00:03:46.019> was<00:03:46.290> one

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
and depicting that in new ways was one

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.930 
and depicting that in new ways was one
of<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.680> hallmarks<00:03:47.159> of<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.370> impressionist

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
of the hallmarks of the impressionist

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.199 
of the hallmarks of the impressionist
movement<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:49.470> as<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:50.159> said<00:03:50.400> in<00:03:50.760> several<00:03:51.120> ways

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
movement so as I said in several ways

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.550 
movement so as I said in several ways
this<00:03:51.419> painting<00:03:51.750> is<00:03:51.900> really<00:03:52.379> pretty

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
this painting is really pretty

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.550 
this painting is really pretty
revolutionary<00:03:53.090> not<00:03:54.090> only<00:03:54.389> that<00:03:55.260> it's<00:03:55.409> an

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
revolutionary not only that it's an

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.869 
revolutionary not only that it's an
impressionist<00:03:56.040> piece<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.430> course<00:03:56.669> and

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
impressionist piece of course and

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.969 
impressionist piece of course and
Impressionism<00:03:57.359> in<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.229> of<00:03:58.319> itself<00:03:58.620> was<00:03:58.919> very

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
Impressionism in and of itself was very

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:03.140 
Impressionism in and of itself was very
revolutionary<00:04:00.620> but<00:04:01.620> typically<00:04:02.040> in<00:04:02.459> kind<00:04:03.090> of

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
revolutionary but typically in kind of

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.670 
revolutionary but typically in kind of
