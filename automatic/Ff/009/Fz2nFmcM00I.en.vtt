I<00:00:04.310> think<00:00:05.310> it<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.490> other<00:00:05.610> is<00:00:05.820> quite

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.090 
I think it the other is quite

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.740 
I think it the other is quite
interesting<00:00:06.390> motorcycle<00:00:07.230> because<00:00:08.240> as<00:00:09.240> some

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
interesting motorcycle because as some

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.790 
interesting motorcycle because as some
character<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.620> sport<00:00:11.490> cruiser<00:00:12.680> because<00:00:13.680> of

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:13.800 
character of sport cruiser because of

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.670 
character of sport cruiser because of
the<00:00:13.890> dimension<00:00:14.430> and<00:00:15.110> the<00:00:16.110> low<00:00:16.290> sitting

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
the dimension and the low sitting

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.409 
the dimension and the low sitting
position<00:00:18.170> the<00:00:19.520> comfortable<00:00:20.520> ergonomics<00:00:21.060> and

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:21.419 
position the comfortable ergonomics and

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:23.810 
position the comfortable ergonomics and
the<00:00:21.810> power<00:00:22.079> of<00:00:22.169> the<00:00:22.259> engine<00:00:22.410> being<00:00:23.099> 160

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
the power of the engine being 160

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.380 
the power of the engine being 160
horsepower<00:00:24.050> but<00:00:25.050> it's<00:00:25.290> much<00:00:25.439> lighter<00:00:25.680> than<00:00:26.390> we

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
horsepower but it's much lighter than we

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.909 
horsepower but it's much lighter than we
had<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.570> particular<00:00:28.110> market<00:00:28.500> there's<00:00:28.680> some

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
had this particular market there's some

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.339 
had this particular market there's some
character<00:00:29.669> of<00:00:29.790> a<00:00:29.849> naked<00:00:30.029> bike<00:00:30.329> because<00:00:31.110> it

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
character of a naked bike because it

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.450 
character of a naked bike because it
handles<00:00:31.739> very<00:00:31.829> well<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.460> light<00:00:32.780> but<00:00:34.399> is<00:00:35.399> a

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
handles very well it's light but is a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.869 
handles very well it's light but is a
more<00:00:35.970> comfortable<00:00:36.559> relaxed<00:00:37.559> ergonomics<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
more comfortable relaxed ergonomics and

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.790 
more comfortable relaxed ergonomics and
that's<00:00:39.600> some<00:00:39.809> character<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.289> sport<00:00:40.590> bike

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
that's some character of a sport bike

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.310 
that's some character of a sport bike
because<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.550> very<00:00:42.329> powerful<00:00:42.809> engine<00:00:43.079> very

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
because of the very powerful engine very

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.990 
because of the very powerful engine very
powerful<00:00:43.739> brakes<00:00:44.629> being<00:00:45.629> traction<00:00:46.170> control

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
powerful brakes being traction control

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.329 
powerful brakes being traction control
adding<00:00:48.000> very<00:00:48.329> good<00:00:48.510> grip<00:00:48.839> rear<00:00:49.079> tire<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:50.129> I

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
adding very good grip rear tire so I

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.790 
adding very good grip rear tire so I
think<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.760> kind<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.379> combination<00:00:52.379> of

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
think it's kind of combination of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.380 
think it's kind of combination of
different<00:00:52.949> character<00:00:53.609> and<00:00:53.789> segments<00:00:54.269> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
different character and segments and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.779 
different character and segments and
yeah<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.379> part<00:00:55.589> of<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.890> Ducati<00:00:56.280> philosophy

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
yeah it's part of the Ducati philosophy

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.939 
yeah it's part of the Ducati philosophy
known<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.089> develop<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.839> good<00:00:58.230> packaging<00:00:58.769> which

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
known to develop a good packaging which

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.509 
known to develop a good packaging which
wait<00:00:59.249> it's<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:01.320> most<00:01:01.530> relevant<00:01:02.010> point<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
wait it's the most relevant point and

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.369 
wait it's the most relevant point and
because<00:01:02.909> vehicle<00:01:03.269> dynamics<00:01:03.749> is<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.140> much

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
because vehicle dynamics is so much

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.950 
because vehicle dynamics is so much
influenced<00:01:04.860> about<00:01:05.010> weight<00:01:05.190> so<00:01:06.120> whenever<00:01:06.360> wet

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
influenced about weight so whenever wet

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.800 
influenced about weight so whenever wet
light<00:01:07.230> motorcycle<00:01:07.890> will<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.360> good<00:01:09.360> breaking

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
light motorcycle will be good breaking

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.590 
light motorcycle will be good breaking
good<00:01:10.290> angling<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.100> very<00:01:11.790> important<00:01:12.270> for<00:01:12.420> now

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
good angling and very important for now

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.200 
good angling and very important for now
also<00:01:12.870> reduce<00:01:13.590> fuel<00:01:13.860> consumption<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:14.820> much

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
also reduce fuel consumption we are much

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.210 
also reduce fuel consumption we are much
more<00:01:15.420> balanced<00:01:15.780> design<00:01:16.410> is<00:01:16.620> very<00:01:16.680> important

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
more balanced design is very important

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.580 
more balanced design is very important
for<00:01:17.310> us<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:18.240> also<00:01:18.330> performance<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.530> you

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
for us but also performance and so you

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.200 
for us but also performance and so you
cannot<00:01:19.950> get<00:01:20.430> performance<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.180> handling

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
cannot get performance and handling

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.170 
cannot get performance and handling
without<00:01:21.930> having<00:01:22.230> a<00:01:22.610> concrete<00:01:23.610> engineering

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
without having a concrete engineering

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.840 
without having a concrete engineering
and<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.890> course<00:01:26.070> depending<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.520> product

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
and so of course depending on product

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.330 
and so of course depending on product
you<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.360> maybe<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.620> superbike<00:01:29.040> in

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
you have maybe on the on a superbike in

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.860 
you have maybe on the on a superbike in
which<00:01:29.490> engineering<00:01:30.090> its<00:01:30.240> kind<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.540> sixty

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
which engineering its kind of sixty

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.800 
which engineering its kind of sixty
percent<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.500> design<00:01:31.800> is<00:01:31.980> 40<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.580> on<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.660> bike

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
percent and design is 40 and on a bike

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.570 
percent and design is 40 and on a bike
like<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:33.990> design<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.530> 60<00:01:35.010> and<00:01:35.040> engineering

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
like this design is 60 and engineering

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.550 
like this design is 60 and engineering
is<00:01:35.670> 40<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.510> it's<00:01:36.660> just<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.870> different<00:01:37.230> balance

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
is 40 so it's just the different balance

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.590 
is 40 so it's just the different balance
between<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:39.230> relevant<00:01:40.730> power<00:01:41.730> into<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
between the relevant power into the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.380 
between the relevant power into the
decision<00:01:43.560> taking<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.220> process<00:01:44.730> but<00:01:45.180> this

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
decision taking of the process but this

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.120 
decision taking of the process but this
is<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.750> back<00:01:45.930> with<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.200> best<00:01:46.500> acceleration

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
is the back with the best acceleration

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.460 
is the back with the best acceleration
we<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.370> and<00:01:47.610> also<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:48.870> best<00:01:48.960> breaking

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
we have and also the best breaking

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.970 
we have and also the best breaking
because<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.670> brakes<00:01:50.910> are<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:51.330> same<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:52.050> 1188

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
because the brakes are the same as 1188

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.240 
because the brakes are the same as 1188
at<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:53.760> end<00:01:53.910> but<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.720> longer<00:01:55.020> all<00:01:56.010> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
at the end but it's longer all the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.640 
at the end but it's longer all the
component<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.210> bike<00:01:57.390> has<00:01:57.660> a<00:01:58.200> double

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
component of the bike has a double

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.070 
component of the bike has a double
function<00:01:58.910> because<00:01:59.910> they<00:02:00.180> has<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.660> perform

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
function because they has to perform

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.290 
function because they has to perform
well<00:02:01.500> technically<00:02:02.010> speaking<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.120> see

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
well technically speaking but you see

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.360 
well technically speaking but you see
everything<00:02:03.600> right<00:02:04.260> it's<00:02:04.440> not<00:02:04.620> is<00:02:04.800> life<00:02:04.980> not<00:02:05.220> on

technical and aesthetic as to join

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.600 
technical and aesthetic as to join
together<00:02:12.590> you<00:02:13.590> have<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.800> work<00:02:13.980> together<00:02:14.160> but

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
together you have to work together but

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.040 
together you have to work together but
not<00:02:14.850> only<00:02:15.320> work<00:02:16.320> together<00:02:16.590> we<00:02:16.770> have<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:18.050> find

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
not only work together we have to find

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.150 
not only work together we have to find
the<00:02:19.140> solution<00:02:19.620> at<00:02:21.620> different<00:02:22.620> quest<00:02:22.920> to

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
the solution at different quest to

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.460 
the solution at different quest to
different<00:02:23.580> problems<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.870> go<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.260> different

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
different problems that go in different

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.140 
different problems that go in different
direction<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.750> not<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.110> easy
