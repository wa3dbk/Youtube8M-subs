00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
let's get started by first taking a look

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.369 
let's get started by first taking a look
at<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> stats<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:38.879> our<00:00:39.030> dinosaurs<00:00:39.780> now<00:00:40.350> I

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
at the stats for our dinosaurs now I

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.959 
at the stats for our dinosaurs now I
know<00:00:40.530> for<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.829> fact<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> nasty<00:00:41.610> source

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
know for a fact that the nasty source

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.119 
know for a fact that the nasty source
has<00:00:42.180> above<00:00:42.600> 200<00:00:43.140> health<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.829> can't

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
has above 200 health and I can't

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.950 
has above 200 health and I can't
actually<00:00:44.340> scan<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.090> stats<00:00:45.329> using<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> Dino

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
actually scan in stats using the Dino

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.020 
actually scan in stats using the Dino
pad<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.500> can<00:00:46.710> do<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.129> our<00:00:47.280> Triceratops

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
pad but I can do it for our Triceratops

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.150 
pad but I can do it for our Triceratops
let's<00:00:48.629> go<00:00:48.690> ahead<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.899> scan<00:00:49.170> our<00:00:49.469> Triceratops

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
let's go ahead and scan our Triceratops

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.610 
let's go ahead and scan our Triceratops
and<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.520> can<00:00:50.610> see<00:00:50.670> has<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> hundred<00:00:51.329> health

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620

38 point 25 attack and point 33 speed

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.860 
38 point 25 attack and point 33 speed
now<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.610> main<00:00:56.850> reason<00:00:57.180> I'm<00:00:57.329> fighting<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
because our nasty source does a lot of

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.520 
because our nasty source does a lot of
attack<00:01:03.059> damage<00:01:03.300> towards<00:01:03.809> our<00:01:03.930> t-rex<00:01:04.350> that

source as you can see they're kind of

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.080 
source as you can see they're kind of
teaming<00:02:25.920> up<00:02:26.070> on<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.310> guy<00:02:26.490> come<00:02:26.730> on<00:02:26.820> knock<00:02:27.060> it

back there we go one Goes Down and this

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.490 
back there we go one Goes Down and this
one<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.880> still<00:02:29.940> going<00:02:30.209> at<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.450> here<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.930> seems

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
one is still going at it here it seems

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.290 
one is still going at it here it seems
like<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.860> massive<00:02:32.070> source<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.610> not<00:02:32.820> going

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
like the massive source is not going

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.050 
like the massive source is not going
down<00:02:33.330> at<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.200> moment<00:02:34.380> we're<00:02:34.740> for<00:02:35.190> or<00:02:35.520> probably

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
down at the moment we're for or probably

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.449 
down at the moment we're for or probably
five<00:02:36.530> Triceratops<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.920> think<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:38.280> one

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
five Triceratops and I think this one

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.590 
five Triceratops and I think this one
will<00:02:38.640> take<00:02:38.760> him<00:02:38.940> down<00:02:39.090> let's<00:02:39.330> go<00:02:39.390> ahead<00:02:39.510> and

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
will take him down let's go ahead and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.750 
will take him down let's go ahead and
try<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:39.780> come<00:02:40.410> on<00:02:40.500> knock<00:02:40.740> him<00:02:40.920> back<00:02:40.950> come<00:02:41.700> on

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
try this come on knock him back come on

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.000 
try this come on knock him back come on
girl<00:02:42.030> we<00:02:42.150> got<00:02:42.330> this<00:02:42.540> no<00:02:43.140> he's<00:02:43.470> gonna<00:02:43.590> go<00:02:43.770> down<00:02:43.980> I

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
girl we got this no he's gonna go down I

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.440 
girl we got this no he's gonna go down I
think<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:44.580> female<00:02:44.880> is<00:02:44.940> gonna<00:02:45.120> go<00:02:45.270> down

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
think this female is gonna go down

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.300 
think this female is gonna go down
because<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.930> nasty<00:02:46.260> source<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.709> just<00:02:46.950> way<00:02:47.250> too

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
because the nasty source is just way too

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.110 
because the nasty source is just way too
powerful

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
powerful

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.120 
powerful
so<00:02:48.600> as<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.780> can<00:02:48.840> see<00:02:48.900> yes<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.440> little<00:02:49.860> bit<00:02:50.010> of

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
so as you can see yes a little bit of

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.479 
so as you can see yes a little bit of
health<00:02:50.340> left<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:50.820> let's<00:02:51.000> spawn<00:02:51.239> down<00:02:51.450> one<00:02:51.780> more

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
health left so let's spawn down one more

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.740 
health left so let's spawn down one more
Triceratops<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.640> see<00:02:53.880> if<00:02:54.090> we<00:02:54.300> can<00:02:54.450> take<00:02:54.570> that

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
Triceratops and see if we can take that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.680 
Triceratops and see if we can take that
nasty<00:02:55.110> sores<00:02:55.320> down<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.980> no<00:02:56.489> yes<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.480> seems

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
nasty sores down and no yes it seems

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.170 
nasty sores down and no yes it seems

flying<00:03:41.070> across<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.610> map<00:03:41.790> here<00:03:42.000> this<00:03:42.120> is

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
flying across the map here this is

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.970 
flying across the map here this is
absolutely<00:03:42.720> crazy<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.320> there<00:03:43.530> we<00:03:43.620> go<00:03:43.739> guys

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
absolutely crazy and there we go guys

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.940 
absolutely crazy and there we go guys
our<00:03:44.430> NASA<00:03:45.030> source<00:03:45.360> gets<00:03:45.570> taken<00:03:45.810> down<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.470> all

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
our NASA source gets taken down and all

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.920 
our NASA source gets taken down and all
well<00:03:47.400> actually<00:03:47.579> one<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.000> our<00:03:48.209> Triceratops

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
well actually one of our Triceratops

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.289 
well actually one of our Triceratops
died<00:03:49.140> so<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.440> guess<00:03:49.709> if<00:03:49.920> they<00:03:50.400> do<00:03:50.459> fight<00:03:50.910> impacts

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
died so I guess if they do fight impacts

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.120 
died so I guess if they do fight impacts
our<00:03:51.540> nasty<00:03:51.750> source<00:03:52.079> will<00:03:52.290> obviously<00:03:52.590> go<00:03:52.890> down

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
our nasty source will obviously go down

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.640 
our nasty source will obviously go down
because<00:03:53.489> this<00:03:53.670> is<00:03:53.790> just<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:54.060> Opie<00:03:54.630> group<00:03:55.079> all

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
because this is just a Opie group all

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.560 
because this is just a Opie group all
right<00:03:55.769> here<00:03:55.920> we<00:03:56.010> go<00:03:56.100> guys<00:03:56.130> three<00:03:56.820> Triceratops
