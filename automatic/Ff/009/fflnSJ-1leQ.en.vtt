hi<00:00:01.110> this<00:00:01.560> is<00:00:01.620> Justin<00:00:02.190> at<00:00:02.340> all-wheel<00:00:02.639> drive

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hi this is Justin at all-wheel drive

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.670 
hi this is Justin at all-wheel drive
Auto<00:00:03.060> and<00:00:03.330> today<00:00:03.990> what<00:00:04.170> I'm<00:00:04.259> actually<00:00:04.440> going

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
Auto and today what I'm actually going

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.869 
Auto and today what I'm actually going
to<00:00:04.740> be<00:00:04.830> showing<00:00:04.859> here<00:00:05.339> is<00:00:05.490> something<00:00:05.700> that's

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
to be showing here is something that's

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.120 
to be showing here is something that's
called<00:00:06.089> primary<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:07.049> secondary<00:00:07.470> air

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
called primary and secondary air

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.970 
called primary and secondary air
injection<00:00:08.210> valves<00:00:09.260> what<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> what<00:00:10.830> air

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
injection valves what a what air

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.129 
injection valves what a what air
injection<00:00:11.460> valves<00:00:11.790> do<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.179> they<00:00:12.660> essentially

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
injection valves do is they essentially

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.440 
injection valves do is they essentially
take<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.980> exhaust<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.790> they<00:00:14.880> dilute<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.420> with

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
take the exhaust and they dilute it with

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.260 
take the exhaust and they dilute it with
fresh<00:00:15.960> air<00:00:16.250> it's<00:00:17.250> kind<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.580> cheaters<00:00:17.940> way<00:00:18.119> of

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
fresh air it's kind of a cheaters way of

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.660 
fresh air it's kind of a cheaters way of
making<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.750> tailpipe<00:00:19.199> emissions<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:20.010> little

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
making the tailpipe emissions a little

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.200 
making the tailpipe emissions a little
cleaner

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
cleaner

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.120 
cleaner
so<00:00:21.570> essentially<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.439> does<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.650> you've

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
so essentially what it does is you've

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.700 
so essentially what it does is you've
got<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.850> exhaust<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:24.990> take<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
got the exhaust and we take and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.230 
got the exhaust and we take and
introduce<00:00:26.099> some<00:00:26.340> fresh<00:00:26.580> air<00:00:26.820> into<00:00:27.090> that

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
introduce some fresh air into that

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.500 
introduce some fresh air into that
exhaust<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.960> what<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.740> does<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.220> that

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
exhaust and what that does is that

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.269 
exhaust and what that does is that
dilutes<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.720> exhaust<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.380> makes<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.830> appear

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
dilutes the exhaust and makes it appear

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.770 
dilutes the exhaust and makes it appear
that<00:00:32.309> it's<00:00:32.640> actually<00:00:32.969> running<00:00:33.210> cleaner<00:00:33.540> than

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
that it's actually running cleaner than

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.940 
that it's actually running cleaner than
it<00:00:33.899> really<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.760> in<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.690> 80s<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.440> even<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
it really is in the 80s and even in the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.010 
it really is in the 80s and even in the
70s<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.520> 60s<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> state<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.450> California

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
70s and 60s in the state of California

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.690 
70s and 60s in the state of California
you<00:00:40.050> had<00:00:40.350> something<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.770> was<00:00:41.070> called<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.430> smog

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
you had something that was called a smog

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.150 
you had something that was called a smog
pump<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.270> that's<00:00:42.890> predominantly<00:00:43.890> what<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
pump and that's predominantly what the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.580 
pump and that's predominantly what the
smog<00:00:44.370> pump<00:00:44.610> did<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.300> essentially<00:00:46.020> diluted

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
smog pump did is it essentially diluted

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.010 
smog pump did is it essentially diluted
the<00:00:46.710> exhaust<00:00:47.100> system<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.640> air<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the exhaust system with air so that the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.580 
the exhaust system with air so that the
vehicle<00:00:49.440> actually<00:00:49.620> polluted<00:00:50.520> less<00:00:51.500> there's<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
vehicle actually polluted less there's a

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.200 
vehicle actually polluted less there's a
little<00:00:52.890> more<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.340> than<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:54.030> that's

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
little more to it than that but that's

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.420 
little more to it than that but that's
kind<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.629> layman's<00:00:54.870> terms<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:56.070> an<00:00:56.280> air

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
kind of layman's terms what an air

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.310 
kind of layman's terms what an air
injection<00:00:56.550> valve<00:00:57.149> does<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.570> takes<00:00:57.809> place<00:00:58.050> of

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
injection valve does it takes place of

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.860 
injection valve does it takes place of
what<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:59.039> used<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.399> have<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> vehicle<00:01:00.570> called

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
what we used to have on a vehicle called

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.609 
what we used to have on a vehicle called
an<00:01:00.989> air<00:01:01.109> pump<00:01:01.289> or<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> small<00:01:01.829> pump<00:01:03.019> as<00:01:04.019> vehicles

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
an air pump or a small pump as vehicles

an air pump or a small pump as vehicles
emissions<00:01:05.040> requirements<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.790> gotten

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
emissions requirements have gotten

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.160 
emissions requirements have gotten
stricter<00:01:06.630> since<00:01:07.470> 2005<00:01:08.630> this<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.810> something

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
stricter since 2005 this is something

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.100 
stricter since 2005 this is something
that's<00:01:10.290> very<00:01:10.409> commonplace<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:12.900> Subaru

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
that's very commonplace on the Subaru

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.160 
that's very commonplace on the Subaru
turbocharged<00:01:13.950> vehicles<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.240> what<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:15.990> have

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
turbocharged vehicles so what we have

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.350 
turbocharged vehicles so what we have
here<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.740> as<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.119> I've<00:01:18.240> actually

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
here is as as you can see I've actually

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.910 
here is as as you can see I've actually
got<00:01:18.689> four<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.990> them<00:01:19.110> sitting<00:01:19.409> here<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.799> these

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
got four of them sitting here and these

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.350 
got four of them sitting here and these
are<00:01:20.070> actually<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.729> number<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.060> ones

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
are actually just the number of ones

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.149 
are actually just the number of ones
that<00:01:21.540> we've<00:01:21.659> done<00:01:21.810> last<00:01:22.049> week<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.130> a

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
that we've done last week so this is a

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.700 
that we've done last week so this is a
very<00:01:24.030> common<00:01:24.509> thing<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:24.720> us<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.590> as

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
very common thing for us to do and as

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.320 
very common thing for us to do and as
such<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.159> thought<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.460> would<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.939> kind<00:01:27.240> of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
such I thought it would be kind of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.109 
such I thought it would be kind of
important<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.040> bring<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.220> some<00:01:29.520> ways<00:01:29.729> that

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
important to bring up some ways that

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.240 
important to bring up some ways that
maybe<00:01:30.360> some<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.750> our<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.500> know<00:01:31.530> Watchers

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
maybe some of our you know Watchers

customers kind of can try to avoid

customers kind of can try to avoid
having<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.689> replace<00:01:36.990> something<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> kind

on a Subaru can be you know right around
$1,000<00:01:45.090> they<00:01:45.329> are<00:01:45.509> very<00:01:45.810> expensive

$1,000 they are very expensive
components<00:01:46.979> there<00:01:47.130> are<00:01:47.159> three<00:01:47.430> hundred

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
components there are three hundred

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.999 
components there are three hundred
dollars<00:01:48.060> apiece<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.509> little<00:01:48.899> over<00:01:49.140> $300<00:01:49.740> apiece

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.639 
dollars apiece a little over $300 apiece
depending<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.640> where<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.030> live<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:52.380> then

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
depending on where you live and then

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.960 
depending on where you live and then
there's<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.920> labor<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.310> install<00:01:53.340> them<00:01:53.820> which

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
there's the labor to install them which

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.670 
there's the labor to install them which
actually<00:01:54.509> involves<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.079> turbo<00:01:55.380> model

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
actually involves on a turbo model

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.740 
actually involves on a turbo model
removing<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> intercooler<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.600> lot

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
removing the intercooler and it's a lot

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
removing the intercooler and it's a lot
of<00:01:57.780> work<00:01:57.990> as<00:01:59.119> such<00:02:00.119> they're<00:02:00.630> expensive<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.530> I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
of work as such they're expensive and I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.319 
of work as such they're expensive and I
just<00:02:02.009> feel<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.310> prudent<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.790> try<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.299> know

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
just feel it prudent to try to you know

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.420 
just feel it prudent to try to you know
help<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.750> avoid<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.380> what<00:02:05.130> I'm<00:02:05.219> going<00:02:05.399> to

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
help you avoid it and what I'm going to

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.100 
help you avoid it and what I'm going to
do<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.390> going<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.540> be<00:02:06.659> kind<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.840> hard<00:02:07.049> to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
do is it's going to be kind of hard to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.809 
do is it's going to be kind of hard to
catch<00:02:07.409> exactly<00:02:08.009> what<00:02:08.129> happens<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.670> these

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
catch exactly what happens to these

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.540 
catch exactly what happens to these
things<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.239> essentially<00:02:09.629> there's

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
things but essentially there's

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.150 
things but essentially there's
there's<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:11.060> valve<00:02:11.660> inside<00:02:12.050> of<00:02:12.230> here<00:02:12.440> that<00:02:12.650> will

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
there's a valve inside of here that will

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.910 
there's a valve inside of here that will
seize<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.300> one<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:14.960> reasons<00:02:15.320> it<00:02:15.470> seizes

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
seize and one of the reasons it seizes

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.680 
seize and one of the reasons it seizes
is<00:02:16.100> from<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.490> moisture<00:02:16.850> in<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.330> exhaust

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
is from the moisture in the exhaust

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.890 
is from the moisture in the exhaust
system<00:02:17.900> causing<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.700> rust<00:02:19.940> I'm

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
system causing it to to rust I'm

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.000 
system causing it to to rust I'm
actually<00:02:21.050> going<00:02:21.320> to<00:02:21.380> turn<00:02:21.560> this<00:02:21.770> one<00:02:21.980> around

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
actually going to turn this one around

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.650 
actually going to turn this one around
here<00:02:22.520> so<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:22.970> can<00:02:23.060> actually<00:02:23.240> see<00:02:23.510> an

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
here so that you can actually see an

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.540 
here so that you can actually see an
extreme<00:02:24.140> version<00:02:24.620> what<00:02:24.800> actually<00:02:25.160> happens<00:02:25.490> to

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
extreme version what actually happens to

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.340 
extreme version what actually happens to
these<00:02:25.790> things<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.690> rest<00:02:26.870> of<00:02:27.020> these<00:02:27.110> are<00:02:27.170> all

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
these things the rest of these are all

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.170 
these things the rest of these are all
going<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.680> have<00:02:27.830> something<00:02:28.310> similar<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.970> this

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
going to have something similar to this

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.750 
going to have something similar to this
going<00:02:29.540> on<00:02:29.660> inside<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.620> one<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.130> just<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.490> very

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
going on inside this one is just a very

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.140 
going on inside this one is just a very
extreme<00:02:32.570> example<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:34.400> what<00:02:34.580> does<00:02:34.760> happen<00:02:35.120> to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
extreme example of what does happen to

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.180 
extreme example of what does happen to
them<00:02:35.390> also<00:02:36.080> kind<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.560> like<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.770> point<00:02:36.950> out<00:02:37.130> that

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
them also kind of like to point out that

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.520 
them also kind of like to point out that
this<00:02:38.030> one<00:02:38.270> over<00:02:38.300> here<00:02:38.750> actually<00:02:38.930> has<00:02:39.320> the

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
this one over here actually has the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.080 
this one over here actually has the
fewest<00:02:39.830> miles<00:02:40.100> out<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.670> rest<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:40.970> these

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
fewest miles out of the rest of these

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.110 
fewest miles out of the rest of these
these<00:02:41.780> three<00:02:41.990> over<00:02:42.260> here<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:43.580> vehicle<00:02:44.000> had

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
these three over here the vehicle had

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.360 
these three over here the vehicle had
over<00:02:44.390> 60,000<00:02:45.110> miles<00:02:45.260> when<00:02:45.470> they<00:02:45.590> failed<00:02:45.830> this

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
over 60,000 miles when they failed this

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.610 
over 60,000 miles when they failed this
one<00:02:46.550> here<00:02:46.820> being<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.150> 2006<00:02:48.050> only<00:02:48.260> had<00:02:48.500> about

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
one here being a 2006 only had about

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.530 
one here being a 2006 only had about
30,000<00:02:49.430> miles<00:02:49.580> on<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:49.850> when<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.150> failed<00:02:50.360> and

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
30,000 miles on it when it failed and

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.240 
30,000 miles on it when it failed and
that<00:02:51.110> kind<00:02:51.320> of<00:02:51.380> brings<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.800> light<00:02:51.980> the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
that kind of brings to light the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.160 
that kind of brings to light the
differences<00:02:52.760> between<00:02:52.910> how<00:02:53.240> you<00:02:53.540> use<00:02:53.960> the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
differences between how you use the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.840 
differences between how you use the
vehicle<00:02:54.710> really<00:02:55.040> pertains<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.610> how<00:02:55.790> you

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
vehicle really pertains to how you

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.080 
vehicle really pertains to how you
should<00:02:56.090> maintain<00:02:56.240> the<00:02:56.660> vehicle<00:02:57.080> I<00:02:58.090> really

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
should maintain the vehicle I really

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.480 
should maintain the vehicle I really
believe<00:02:59.420> that<00:02:59.450> if<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.110> vehicle<00:03:00.590> would<00:03:01.370> have

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
believe that if the vehicle would have

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.430 
believe that if the vehicle would have
been<00:03:01.640> driven<00:03:02.030> in<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.240> different<00:03:02.570> way<00:03:02.750> been

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
been driven in a different way been

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.410 
been driven in a different way been
taken<00:03:03.890> out<00:03:03.980> on<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.190> freeway<00:03:04.460> had<00:03:04.970> its<00:03:05.090> legs

taken out on the freeway had its legs

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.590 
taken out on the freeway had its legs
stretched<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:07.430> know<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.790> exhaust<00:03:08.360> would

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
stretched you know the exhaust would

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.760 
stretched you know the exhaust would
have<00:03:08.750> actually<00:03:09.080> gotten<00:03:09.290> up<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.590> good

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
have actually gotten up to good

have actually gotten up to good
temperature<00:03:10.220> to<00:03:10.340> burn<00:03:10.640> all<00:03:10.880> of<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.060> moisture

condensation<00:03:22.160> that<00:03:23.000> is<00:03:23.180> essentially<00:03:23.870> on<00:03:24.080> the

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
condensation that is essentially on the

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.910 
condensation that is essentially on the
moisture<00:03:25.190> that's<00:03:25.400> in<00:03:25.550> the<00:03:25.610> exhaust<00:03:26.920> partially

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
moisture that's in the exhaust partially

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.710 
moisture that's in the exhaust partially
being<00:03:28.130> burned<00:03:28.340> away<00:03:28.610> as<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:29.030> vehicle<00:03:29.420> warms

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
being burned away as the vehicle warms

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.780 
being burned away as the vehicle warms
up<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:30.050> should<00:03:30.230> actually<00:03:30.410> see<00:03:30.739> less<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.489> less

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
up you should actually see less and less

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.460 
up you should actually see less and less
of<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.060> condensation<00:03:32.510> as<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.170> exhaust

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
of that condensation as the exhaust

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.190 
of that condensation as the exhaust
heats<00:03:33.800> up<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.520> evaporates<00:03:35.180> before<00:03:35.600> it<00:03:35.959> even

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
heats up it evaporates before it even

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.699 
heats up it evaporates before it even
comes<00:03:36.410> out<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.800> exhaust<00:03:36.830> pipe<00:03:38.320> so<00:03:39.320> again

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
comes out of the exhaust pipe so again

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.400 
comes out of the exhaust pipe so again
this<00:03:40.010> is<00:03:40.220> a<00:03:40.250> situation<00:03:41.030> where<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:42.140> know<00:03:42.230> this

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
this is a situation where you know this

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.320 
this is a situation where you know this
is<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.620> vehicle<00:03:42.920> that<00:03:43.070> was<00:03:43.280> predominantly<00:03:44.090> used

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
is a vehicle that was predominantly used

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.229 
is a vehicle that was predominantly used
just<00:03:44.660> around<00:03:44.959> town<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:46.310> never<00:03:46.640> really<00:03:47.030> had<00:03:47.209> a

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
just around town it never really had a

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.760 
just around town it never really had a
chance<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:47.870> get<00:03:48.260> up<00:03:48.290> to<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.620> right

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
chance to get up to the right

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.560 
chance to get up to the right
temperature<00:03:48.800> to<00:03:49.489> have<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:50.030> have<00:03:50.239> all<00:03:50.480> of

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
temperature to have it to have all of

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.380 
temperature to have it to have all of
that<00:03:50.780> moisture<00:03:51.080> burn<00:03:51.560> away<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:53.120> that's

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
that moisture burn away and that's

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.000 
that moisture burn away and that's
really<00:03:53.660> hard<00:03:53.870> on<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.050> car<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.470> this<00:03:54.560> is<00:03:54.620> just

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
really hard on the car and this is just

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.000 
really hard on the car and this is just
one<00:03:55.280> example<00:03:55.610> of<00:03:56.150> what<00:03:56.330> can<00:03:56.570> happen<00:03:56.709> so<00:03:57.709> if<00:03:57.890> you

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
one example of what can happen so if you

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.220 
one example of what can happen so if you
own<00:03:58.160> a<00:03:58.190> Subaru<00:03:58.640> turbocharged<00:03:59.239> model<00:03:59.690> and<00:03:59.840> you

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
own a Subaru turbocharged model and you

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.870 
own a Subaru turbocharged model and you
know<00:04:00.350> you<00:04:00.440> use<00:04:00.770> it<00:04:00.920> mostly<00:04:01.220> for<00:04:01.400> driving<00:04:01.790> it

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
know you use it mostly for driving it

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.090 
know you use it mostly for driving it
around<00:04:02.090> town<00:04:02.360> you<00:04:03.140> really<00:04:03.440> kind<00:04:03.650> of<00:04:03.709> owe<00:04:03.890> it<00:04:04.070> to

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
around town you really kind of owe it to

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.400 
around town you really kind of owe it to
the<00:04:04.310> car<00:04:04.550> and<00:04:04.910> owe<00:04:05.360> it<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.540> your<00:04:05.750> pocketbook<00:04:06.290> a

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
the car and owe it to your pocketbook a

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.590 
the car and owe it to your pocketbook a
little<00:04:06.680> bit<00:04:06.800> to<00:04:07.340> try<00:04:07.580> to<00:04:07.640> maybe<00:04:07.880> get<00:04:08.330> it<00:04:08.450> out

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
little bit to try to maybe get it out

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.840 
little bit to try to maybe get it out
and<00:04:08.840> get<00:04:09.260> get<00:04:09.620> it<00:04:09.739> up<00:04:09.860> to<00:04:10.010> temperature<00:04:10.040> cars

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
and get get it up to temperature cars

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.640 
and get get it up to temperature cars
like<00:04:11.239> to<00:04:11.510> get<00:04:11.660> up<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:11.900> temperature<00:04:12.050> pretty

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
like to get up to temperature pretty

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.140 
like to get up to temperature pretty
much<00:04:12.860> everything<00:04:13.340> that<00:04:13.370> happens<00:04:13.850> to<00:04:13.940> the

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
much everything that happens to the

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.750 
much everything that happens to the
vehicle<00:04:14.600> that<00:04:15.440> that's<00:04:15.769> beneficial<00:04:16.370> to<00:04:16.640> the

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
vehicle that that's beneficial to the

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.659 
vehicle that that's beneficial to the
engine<00:04:17.320> happens<00:04:18.320> at<00:04:18.500> higher<00:04:19.010> temperatures

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
engine happens at higher temperatures

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.190 
engine happens at higher temperatures
I'm<00:04:19.970> not<00:04:20.210> trying<00:04:20.479> to<00:04:20.539> say<00:04:20.720> that<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:20.989> need<00:04:21.140> to

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
I'm not trying to say that you need to

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.900 
I'm not trying to say that you need to
push<00:04:21.560> it<00:04:21.770> to<00:04:21.950> the<00:04:21.979> point<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:22.370> it's<00:04:22.640> going<00:04:22.850> to

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
push it to the point that it's going to

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:23.600 
push it to the point that it's going to
get

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
get

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.580 
get
superhot<00:04:24.120> there's<00:04:24.629> protection<00:04:24.780> devices

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
superhot there's protection devices

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.820 
superhot there's protection devices
those<00:04:26.460> things<00:04:26.669> don't<00:04:26.879> happen<00:04:27.030> anyways<00:04:27.539> but

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
those things don't happen anyways but

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.619 
those things don't happen anyways but
you<00:04:28.830> know<00:04:28.979> maybe<00:04:29.400> in<00:04:29.789> the<00:04:29.939> morning<00:04:30.120> you<00:04:30.539> know

00:04:30.619 --> 00:04:30.629 
you know maybe in the morning you know

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:32.300 
you know maybe in the morning you know
as<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.960> vehicles<00:04:31.349> warming<00:04:31.770> up<00:04:31.919> maybe<00:04:32.159> you

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
as the vehicles warming up maybe you

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.770 
as the vehicles warming up maybe you
drive<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:32.699> in<00:04:32.759> a<00:04:32.819> little<00:04:33.060> bit<00:04:33.150> of<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.330> lower<00:04:33.509> gear

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
drive it in a little bit of a lower gear

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.360 
drive it in a little bit of a lower gear
than<00:04:33.960> you<00:04:34.050> normally<00:04:34.199> would<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.770> increase<00:04:35.129> the

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
than you normally would to increase the

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.490 
than you normally would to increase the
RPMs<00:04:35.819> and<00:04:36.150> thus<00:04:36.300> increase<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.199> temperature

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
RPMs and thus increase the temperature

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.409 
RPMs and thus increase the temperature
just<00:04:37.889> a<00:04:37.979> little<00:04:38.189> quicker<00:04:38.430> especially<00:04:39.180> if<00:04:39.300> you

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
just a little quicker especially if you

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.179 
just a little quicker especially if you
know<00:04:39.509> you've<00:04:39.689> only<00:04:39.780> got<00:04:40.050> a<00:04:40.080> 10<00:04:40.349> or<00:04:40.379> a<00:04:40.530> 15<00:04:40.650> minute

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:41.189 
know you've only got a 10 or a 15 minute

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:42.920 
know you've only got a 10 or a 15 minute
commute<00:04:41.370> you<00:04:41.819> know<00:04:41.969> and<00:04:42.240> during<00:04:42.689> the<00:04:42.780> winter

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
commute you know and during the winter

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.230 
commute you know and during the winter
you<00:04:43.199> really<00:04:43.469> don't<00:04:43.680> have<00:04:44.189> a<00:04:44.250> situation<00:04:44.819> where

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
you really don't have a situation where

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.339 
you really don't have a situation where
the<00:04:45.360> engine<00:04:45.569> can<00:04:45.719> actually<00:04:46.020> get<00:04:46.139> up<00:04:46.169> to

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
the engine can actually get up to

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.550 
the engine can actually get up to
temperature<00:04:47.719> that<00:04:48.719> is<00:04:48.870> predominantly<00:04:49.169> the

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
temperature that is predominantly the

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.499 
temperature that is predominantly the
best<00:04:49.860> way<00:04:50.129> that<00:04:50.430> you<00:04:50.699> can<00:04:50.879> try<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.120> avoid

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
best way that you can try to avoid

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.450 
best way that you can try to avoid
something<00:04:52.319> like<00:04:52.469> this<00:04:52.620> happening<00:04:53.099> you<00:04:53.310> know

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
something like this happening you know

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.649 
something like this happening you know
there's<00:04:53.639> a<00:04:53.699> good<00:04:53.879> chance<00:04:54.120> that<00:04:54.240> if<00:04:54.419> you<00:04:54.509> own<00:04:54.629> a

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
there's a good chance that if you own a

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:56.779 
there's a good chance that if you own a
turbocharged<00:04:55.620> model<00:04:55.979> Subaru<00:04:56.310> that<00:04:56.490> this<00:04:56.639> is

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
turbocharged model Subaru that this is

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:57.950 
turbocharged model Subaru that this is
probably<00:04:56.969> something<00:04:57.479> that's<00:04:57.779> going<00:04:57.900> to

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
probably something that's going to

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.450 
probably something that's going to
happen<00:04:58.259> to<00:04:58.379> you<00:04:58.469> over<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:58.860> course<00:04:59.069> of<00:04:59.279> the

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
happen to you over the course of the

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.339 
happen to you over the course of the
vehicle<00:04:59.909> but<00:05:00.029> you<00:05:00.090> know<00:05:00.300> we've<00:05:00.810> got<00:05:00.990> lots<00:05:01.199> of

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
vehicle but you know we've got lots of

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.140 
vehicle but you know we've got lots of
customers<00:05:01.860> that<00:05:01.889> that<00:05:02.400> still<00:05:02.669> haven't<00:05:03.000> done

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
customers that that still haven't done

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.360 
customers that that still haven't done
it<00:05:03.330> and<00:05:03.479> I<00:05:03.569> really<00:05:03.930> have<00:05:04.529> been<00:05:04.560> able<00:05:04.860> to<00:05:04.979> put

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
it and I really have been able to put

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.659 
it and I really have been able to put
the<00:05:05.400> correlation<00:05:06.060> to<00:05:06.240> how<00:05:06.479> the<00:05:06.659> vehicles<00:05:06.840> used

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
the correlation to how the vehicles used

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.429 
the correlation to how the vehicles used
so<00:05:08.669> again<00:05:09.000> if<00:05:09.240> you<00:05:09.509> want<00:05:09.719> to<00:05:09.779> try<00:05:09.960> to<00:05:10.020> avoid

00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:10.439 
so again if you want to try to avoid

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:12.019 
so again if you want to try to avoid
having<00:05:10.500> to<00:05:10.979> replace<00:05:11.219> something<00:05:11.550> like<00:05:11.819> this

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:12.029 
having to replace something like this

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:14.089 
having to replace something like this
and<00:05:12.750> one<00:05:12.870> of<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.050> best<00:05:13.259> things<00:05:13.469> you<00:05:13.560> can<00:05:13.740> do<00:05:13.919> is

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
and one of the best things you can do is

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:15.589 
and one of the best things you can do is
get<00:05:14.279> that<00:05:14.430> engine<00:05:14.729> up<00:05:14.879> to<00:05:15.000> temperature<00:05:15.449> it's

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
get that engine up to temperature it's

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.600 
get that engine up to temperature it's
beneficial<00:05:16.199> for<00:05:16.379> many<00:05:16.860> more<00:05:17.129> reasons<00:05:17.310> than

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
beneficial for many more reasons than

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.909 
beneficial for many more reasons than
just<00:05:18.029> this<00:05:18.270> but<00:05:18.539> given<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:18.990> cost<00:05:19.229> of<00:05:19.469> this<00:05:19.650> and

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
just this but given the cost of this and

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.769 
just this but given the cost of this and
and<00:05:20.039> really<00:05:20.759> it's<00:05:21.000> not<00:05:21.120> going<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.330> affect<00:05:21.659> the

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:21.779 
and really it's not going to affect the

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.029 
and really it's not going to affect the
way<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:22.020> vehicle<00:05:22.349> runs<00:05:22.560> but<00:05:22.770> it<00:05:22.889> will

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
way the vehicle runs but it will

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.529 
way the vehicle runs but it will
illuminate<00:05:23.279> the<00:05:23.639> check<00:05:23.819> engine<00:05:24.000> light<00:05:24.270> and

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
illuminate the check engine light and

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.929 
illuminate the check engine light and
also<00:05:24.840> on<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.050> newer<00:05:25.259> vehicles<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:26.129> cruise

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:26.939 
also on the newer vehicles the cruise

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:28.640 
also on the newer vehicles the cruise
control<00:05:27.029> light<00:05:27.479> will<00:05:27.690> flash<00:05:27.839> and<00:05:28.289> the<00:05:28.409> cruise

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
control light will flash and the cruise

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.079 
control light will flash and the cruise
control<00:05:28.740> will<00:05:29.190> be<00:05:29.219> disabled<00:05:29.849> that<00:05:29.940> is

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:30.089 
control will be disabled that is

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:32.450 
control will be disabled that is
something<00:05:30.449> that's<00:05:30.599> prevalent<00:05:31.289> on<00:05:31.379> the<00:05:31.589> 2005

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
something that's prevalent on the 2005

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.399 
something that's prevalent on the 2005
and<00:05:32.699> newer<00:05:32.789> models<00:05:33.060> it's<00:05:33.839> a<00:05:33.900> way<00:05:34.020> of<00:05:34.050> getting

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
and newer models it's a way of getting

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:35.540 
and newer models it's a way of getting
your<00:05:34.500> attention<00:05:34.650> you<00:05:35.129> know<00:05:35.250> having<00:05:35.520> that

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
your attention you know having that

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.490 
your attention you know having that
cruise<00:05:35.879> control<00:05:36.270> light<00:05:36.479> flash<00:05:37.110> in

cruise control light flash in

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.230 
cruise control light flash in

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:43.379 
control system appears to be getting

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:45.619 
control system appears to be getting
driver's<00:05:44.370> attention<00:05:44.490> much<00:05:45.000> more<00:05:45.210> so<00:05:45.419> than

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:45.629 
driver's attention much more so than

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:47.450 
driver's attention much more so than
just<00:05:45.960> the<00:05:46.169> yellow<00:05:46.409> check<00:05:46.800> engine<00:05:46.979> light<00:05:47.250> would

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
just the yellow check engine light would

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.420 
just the yellow check engine light would
and<00:05:47.729> having<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.270> vehicle<00:05:48.659> perform<00:05:48.990> normally

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
and having the vehicle perform normally

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.829 
and having the vehicle perform normally
so<00:05:50.430> this<00:05:50.610> is<00:05:50.789> Justin<00:05:51.210> and<00:05:51.240> all-wheel<00:05:51.599> drive

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:51.839 
so this is Justin and all-wheel drive
