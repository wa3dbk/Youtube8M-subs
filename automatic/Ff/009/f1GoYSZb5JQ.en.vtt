how<00:01:52.400> I<00:01:52.430> used<00:01:52.850> it<00:01:53.030> on<00:01:53.090> one<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.300> my<00:01:53.479> songs<00:01:54.040> so<00:01:55.040> here

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
how I used it on one of my songs so here

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.010 
how I used it on one of my songs so here
on<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.670> song<00:01:55.910> in<00:01:56.210> society

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
on the song in society

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.810 
on the song in society
I<00:01:57.050> used<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.560> noise<00:01:57.770> channel<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.400> create<00:01:58.520> some

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
I used the noise channel to create some

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.180 
I used the noise channel to create some
rhythm<00:01:59.180> and<00:01:59.479> ocean<00:02:00.140> wave<00:02:00.380> effects<00:02:00.860> using

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
rhythm and ocean wave effects using

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.880 
rhythm and ocean wave effects using
multiple<00:02:01.700> notes<00:02:01.910> and<00:02:02.180> some<00:02:02.450> volume<00:02:02.690> swells<00:02:03.080> if

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
multiple notes and some volume swells if

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.859 
multiple notes and some volume swells if
I<00:02:04.040> solo<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.580> MIDI<00:02:04.940> nest<00:02:05.210> Channel<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:05.750> can

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
I solo the MIDI nest Channel you can

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.219 
I solo the MIDI nest Channel you can
kind<00:02:06.050> of<00:02:06.110> hear<00:02:06.350> what's<00:02:06.530> going<00:02:06.590> on<00:02:07.959> and<00:02:08.959> I<00:02:09.020> think

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
kind of hear what's going on and I think

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.960 
kind of hear what's going on and I think
I<00:02:09.320> originally<00:02:09.830> performed<00:02:10.280> this<00:02:10.640> on<00:02:10.850> the
