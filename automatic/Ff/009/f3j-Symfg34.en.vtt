00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.469 
street and they need somebody but we
still<00:01:27.160> have<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.340> create<00:01:27.670> all<00:01:27.880> of<00:01:27.910> the<00:01:28.119> streets

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
still have to create all of the streets

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.960 
still have to create all of the streets
all<00:01:28.840> of<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.110> environments<00:01:29.830> all<00:01:30.670> of<00:01:30.850> the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
all of the environments all of the

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.680 
all of the environments all of the
terrain<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.500> all<00:01:32.619> that<00:01:32.800> stuff<00:01:32.920> so<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:34.090> for

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
terrain and all that stuff so the for

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.900 
terrain and all that stuff so the for
example<00:01:35.080> Alex<00:01:35.770> let's<00:01:36.130> look<00:01:36.220> at<00:01:36.340> this<00:01:36.430> we've

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
example Alex let's look at this we've

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.279 
example Alex let's look at this we've
made<00:01:37.090> this<00:01:37.210> it<00:01:37.450> this<00:01:37.600> is<00:01:37.720> our<00:01:37.810> City<00:01:38.020> Hall<00:01:38.259> to

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
made this it this is our City Hall to

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.850 
made this it this is our City Hall to
start<00:01:38.649> our<00:01:38.890> town<00:01:39.610> center<00:01:40.289> the<00:01:41.289> Central<00:01:41.590> Park

the commercial activities and buildings
these<00:01:44.860> are<00:01:45.039> actually<00:01:45.459> this<00:01:45.640> is<00:01:45.759> sort<00:01:45.910> of<00:01:45.940> new

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
these are actually this is sort of new

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.460 
these are actually this is sort of new
for<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.479> sims<00:01:46.720> where<00:01:46.959> these<00:01:47.080> are<00:01:47.229> actually

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
for the sims where these are actually

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.990 
for the sims where these are actually
individual<00:01:47.920> discrete<00:01:48.250> buildings<00:01:48.729> they're

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
individual discrete buildings they're

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.540 
individual discrete buildings they're
not<00:01:49.179> they're<00:01:50.140> not<00:01:50.170> made<00:01:50.470> using<00:01:50.800> the<00:01:50.979> walls<00:01:51.250> and

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
not they're not made using the walls and

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.999 
not they're not made using the walls and
floors<00:01:51.789> that<00:01:52.119> you<00:01:52.240> would<00:01:52.330> see<00:01:52.539> in<00:01:52.569> sims<00:01:52.899> 2<00:01:53.140> so

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
floors that you would see in sims 2 so

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.740 
floors that you would see in sims 2 so
your<00:01:54.130> sim<00:01:54.280> can<00:01:54.429> go<00:01:54.550> inside<00:01:54.700> of<00:01:54.880> them<00:01:55.149> and<00:01:55.179> and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
your sim can go inside of them and and

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.559 
your sim can go inside of them and and
they'll<00:01:56.560> go<00:01:57.099> in<00:01:57.220> there<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.610> do<00:01:57.970> a<00:01:58.000> job<00:01:58.270> or<00:01:58.479> do

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
they'll go in there and do a job or do

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:59.820 
they'll go in there and do a job or do
something<00:01:58.780> then<00:01:59.050> come<00:01:59.229> back<00:01:59.259> out<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.740> don't

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
something then come back out you don't

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.469 
something then come back out you don't
follow<00:02:00.009> them<00:02:00.220> inside<00:02:00.520> but<00:02:00.849> they<00:02:00.970> disappearing

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
follow them inside but they disappearing

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.029 
follow them inside but they disappearing
in<00:02:01.750> there<00:02:01.959> but<00:02:02.410> we're<00:02:02.530> able<00:02:02.649> to<00:02:02.770> make<00:02:02.890> the

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
in there but we're able to make the

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.680 
in there but we're able to make the
world<00:02:03.310> then<00:02:03.550> this<00:02:03.789> out<00:02:03.940> it<00:02:04.090> will<00:02:04.209> feel<00:02:04.509> much

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
world then this out it will feel much

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.370 
world then this out it will feel much
richer<00:02:05.050> very<00:02:05.259> much<00:02:05.410> more<00:02:05.619> unique<00:02:06.179> and<00:02:07.179> each<00:02:08.140> of

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
richer very much more unique and each of

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.979 
richer very much more unique and each of
us<00:02:08.470> see<00:02:08.709> that<00:02:08.890> in<00:02:09.069> our<00:02:09.220> everyday<00:02:09.489> lives<00:02:09.849> so<00:02:10.360> you

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
us see that in our everyday lives so you

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.479 
us see that in our everyday lives so you
could<00:02:11.170> go<00:02:11.260> down<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.620> street<00:02:11.830> tomorrow<00:02:12.040> and

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
could go down the street tomorrow and

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
you couldn't do that in the sims 2 as

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.940 
you couldn't do that in the sims 2 as
smoothly<00:02:25.540> as<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:25.840> can<00:02:26.080> with<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.260> sims<00:02:26.500> 3<00:02:26.770> and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
smoothly as you can with the sims 3 and
