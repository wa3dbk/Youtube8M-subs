00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.230
 curtains I could not cut them in one 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.480
 studied catch false because simply 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.120
 I did not know and I want to show you how 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.730
 we can take false or a double to a 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.550
 curtain or any fabric you need 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.910

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.530

 And until next time 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.910
 well we're going to need tape to 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.590
 hem you can find this in 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:25.250
 Anywhere where they sell things for 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.250
 sew and seams and all this pins 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.390
 iron what you have at home 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.010
 and also curtain obviously because this 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.200
 is what we are going to do is take the 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.990
 fold 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.370
 the doubles so well let's start 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.950
 with the video 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.440
 good girls let's start taking the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.870
 curtain and catching the hem 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.790
 obviously we have to turn it over so that 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.620
 the inside part 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.750
 and from the inside part if the first 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.380
 what we are going to do is eat our 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.380
 pins 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.090
 and let's go take the fold 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.940
 depending on how high we want us 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.440
 is our curtain so I'm going to 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.300
 leave like this 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.560
 what we are going to do is put 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.370
 pins 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.370
 to hold it 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:24.000
 and so we obviously seeing my 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.000
 we remain the same the same high 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.849
 well after you have at least 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.560
 the desired length this is my long 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.290
 desired is held with pins 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.750
 remember I got them more because it was 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.780
 supremely long so now we're going to 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.760
 see how it sticks 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.540
 well now let's take our tape 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.640
 for doubles or to host fake I do not know 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.620
 let's remove the pin with a lot 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.709
 careful that we are obviously left to the 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.010
 same height as we already wanted you and what 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.049
 Lets put 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.840
 this way we're going to put it under 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:51.540
 of the two fabrics and we're going to take our 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.540
 iron and let's go ironing 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.620
 It's worth it 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:07.190
 and as you can see, it has already been stuck 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.209
 As you can see, it has already been stuck so we are going to 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.209
 do so in all 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:16.639
 as you can see 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.460
 do not take this off if you want to get off 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.330
 if you move and this can be done 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:28.220
 take off perfectly nothing happens 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.009
 but that's how it is so now I'm going 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.069
 to show a little 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:36.620
 good girls that's how the fas is 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:39.979
 the false of the curtain 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:43.360
 as you see it looks good and like Sep 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:48.160
 was cooked does not take off at all 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.160
 this idea is very good 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.100
 so I hope you like it if you do it 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.810
