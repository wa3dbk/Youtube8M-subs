00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:39.219 
it I might have put it too big in the

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:41.670 
it I might have put it too big in the
game<00:05:39.399> I've<00:05:39.610> never<00:05:39.819> actually<00:05:39.909> seen<00:05:40.569> a<00:05:40.809> steam

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
game I've never actually seen a steam

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.879 
game I've never actually seen a steam
training<00:05:42.159> in<00:05:42.249> real<00:05:42.369> life<00:05:43.229> but<00:05:44.229> I<00:05:44.439> made<00:05:44.499> the

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
training in real life but I made the

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.109 
training in real life but I made the
back<00:05:45.039> part<00:05:45.309> if<00:05:45.460> you're<00:05:45.610> wondering<00:05:45.909> why<00:05:45.969> it's

00:05:46.109 --> 00:05:46.119 
back part if you're wondering why it's

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:47.339 
back part if you're wondering why it's
so<00:05:46.180> much<00:05:46.330> taller<00:05:46.539> it's<00:05:46.869> to<00:05:47.020> fit<00:05:47.169> with<00:05:47.259> the

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
so much taller it's to fit with the

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:49.679 
so much taller it's to fit with the
vehicles<00:05:47.770> how<00:05:48.039> I've<00:05:48.189> made<00:05:48.369> the<00:05:49.089> vehicle<00:05:49.479> parts

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:49.689 
vehicles how I've made the vehicle parts

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:53.359 
vehicles how I've made the vehicle parts
excessively<00:05:50.289> tall<00:05:50.589> like<00:05:50.800> right<00:05:51.039> there<00:05:52.080> also

00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:53.369 
excessively tall like right there also

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:55.499 
excessively tall like right there also
just<00:05:54.369> a<00:05:54.460> quick<00:05:54.610> tip<00:05:54.789> to<00:05:54.969> anybody<00:05:55.210> else<00:05:55.330> who's

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:55.509 
just a quick tip to anybody else who's

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:58.019 
just a quick tip to anybody else who's
doing<00:05:55.809> similar<00:05:56.619> style<00:05:56.919> or<00:05:57.309> making<00:05:57.580> some<00:05:57.729> style

00:05:58.019 --> 00:05:58.029 
doing similar style or making some style

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:00.929 
doing similar style or making some style
works<00:05:58.800> if<00:05:59.800> you<00:05:59.949> notice<00:06:00.219> all<00:06:00.430> these<00:06:00.639> trains

00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:00.939 
works if you notice all these trains

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:03.659 
works if you notice all these trains
here<00:06:01.270> look<00:06:02.050> as<00:06:02.199> if<00:06:02.409> the<00:06:02.919> colors<00:06:03.219> on<00:06:03.430> the<00:06:03.550> more

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
here look as if the colors on the more

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.019 
here look as if the colors on the more
texture<00:06:03.999> specifically<00:06:04.659> for<00:06:05.439> the<00:06:05.589> train

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:06.029 
texture specifically for the train

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:08.820 
texture specifically for the train
that's<00:06:07.029> not<00:06:07.180> the<00:06:07.270> case<00:06:07.449> like<00:06:08.289> this<00:06:08.499> year<00:06:08.740> is

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
that's not the case like this year is

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.199 
that's not the case like this year is
actually<00:06:09.099> the<00:06:09.189> dragon<00:06:09.520> texture<00:06:09.879> that's<00:06:10.029> the

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:10.209 
actually the dragon texture that's the

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:12.689 
actually the dragon texture that's the
fogs<00:06:10.449> texture<00:06:11.020> fire<00:06:11.319> hydrant<00:06:11.680> texture<00:06:12.009> and

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
fogs texture fire hydrant texture and

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:14.730 
fogs texture fire hydrant texture and
the<00:06:12.879> reason<00:06:13.240> why<00:06:13.360> they<00:06:13.659> all<00:06:13.779> work<00:06:14.020> so<00:06:14.259> well<00:06:14.469> is

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
the reason why they all work so well is

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.129 
the reason why they all work so well is
because<00:06:14.919> of<00:06:15.189> the<00:06:15.249> way<00:06:15.369> I've<00:06:15.580> been<00:06:16.020> setting<00:06:17.020> my

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139 
because of the way I've been setting my

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:18.719 
because of the way I've been setting my
layouts<00:06:17.439> for<00:06:17.649> the<00:06:17.770> textures<00:06:18.159> they<00:06:18.459> all<00:06:18.550> follow

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
layouts for the textures they all follow

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.409 
layouts for the textures they all follow
the<00:06:18.789> same<00:06:18.879> pattern<00:06:19.619> so<00:06:20.619> by<00:06:21.279> that<00:06:21.459> I<00:06:21.490> mean<00:06:21.729> the

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
the same pattern so by that I mean the

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.480 
the same pattern so by that I mean the
top-left<00:06:23.169> corner<00:06:23.379> will<00:06:23.919> be<00:06:23.949> like<00:06:24.189> the

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
top-left corner will be like the

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.399 
top-left corner will be like the
brightest<00:06:24.849> color<00:06:25.059> kind<00:06:25.779> of<00:06:25.930> or<00:06:26.110> the<00:06:26.229> main

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:26.409 
brightest color kind of or the main

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:29.010 
brightest color kind of or the main
color<00:06:26.709> and<00:06:27.009> then<00:06:27.550> it's<00:06:27.939> darker<00:06:28.270> tone<00:06:28.479> below<00:06:28.749> it

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
color and then it's darker tone below it

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.809 
color and then it's darker tone below it
and<00:06:29.169> then<00:06:29.680> over<00:06:29.860> to<00:06:30.099> the<00:06:30.129> right<00:06:30.219> you'll<00:06:30.639> have

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:30.819 
and then over to the right you'll have

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:33.509 
and then over to the right you'll have
the<00:06:31.300> highlight<00:06:31.629> color<00:06:31.899> and<00:06:32.219> so<00:06:33.219> on<00:06:33.249> and<00:06:33.430> so

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:33.519 
the highlight color and so on and so

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:36.299 
the highlight color and so on and so
forth<00:06:33.789> and<00:06:34.209> I'll<00:06:34.599> show<00:06:34.719> an<00:06:34.839> image<00:06:35.080> of<00:06:35.139> it<00:06:35.259> so<00:06:36.189> I

00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:36.309 
forth and I'll show an image of it so I

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:37.799 
forth and I'll show an image of it so I
can<00:06:36.459> throw<00:06:36.610> in<00:06:36.789> one<00:06:36.969> model<00:06:37.360> and<00:06:37.449> give<00:06:37.629> it<00:06:37.689> any

00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:37.809 
can throw in one model and give it any

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:39.480 
can throw in one model and give it any
texture<00:06:38.229> I<00:06:38.259> want<00:06:38.469> this<00:06:38.979> could<00:06:39.189> be<00:06:39.309> I<00:06:39.459> don't

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
texture I want this could be I don't

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.759 
texture I want this could be I don't
know<00:06:39.639> if<00:06:39.819> I<00:06:39.879> make<00:06:40.029> some<00:06:40.209> weird<00:06:40.419> candy<00:06:41.080> village

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:41.769 
know if I make some weird candy village

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:50.760 
know if I make some weird candy village
thing<00:06:42.099> this<00:06:42.669> will<00:06:42.819> fit<00:06:42.999> in<00:06:43.089> perfectly

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.350 

so<00:06:51.250> 10<00:06:51.430> what<00:06:51.550> you<00:06:51.669> guys<00:06:51.849> think<00:06:52.150> do<00:06:52.240> you<00:06:52.300> like
