00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 Only eleven days until it starts with the 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.319
 lo capo challenge only eleven days left 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.360
 for you to register and in 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.110
 our secret lodge challenge group too 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.969
 bump 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:18.810
 Welcome this is challenge 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:20.760
 update number five before it starts 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.500
 Today a video with a bit 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.269
 worse light that's because that 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.050
 It was super awesome all day long 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.420
 was outside 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.670
 and now it starts to be right 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.560
 that's why the car training unfortunately falls 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.550
 also in riding the truest sense of the word 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.600
 in the water maybe you can hear it too 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.260
 background a bit like that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.510
 thundered 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.270
 There is a lot going on here in the south 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.550
 We come to today's question and 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.170
 indeed, franziska or katharina has me 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.969
 do not know what a real name is 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.190
 at least that's what it's called on facebook 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.320
 for a question hey people asked me 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.840
 wanted to ask how is that at low 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.180
 carb actually with homemade 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.850
 smoothies or too generally with 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.039
 fruits are allowed or not 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.890
 I have so much different today 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.960
 read as some say it is okay 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.280
 the others turn the fruit in general 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.170
 is prohibited 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.840
 because fructose is included what is 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.689
 Now, really sorry if I ask something 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.090
 the sorry sorry if the question something 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.340
 naive sounds I'm still a bit uncertain 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.650
 with low carb since I have never, so to speak 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.680
 thank you so much franziska for many 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.080
 your question there is no it is 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.320
 no bad stupid ones or no 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.810
 even question every question has meaning and purpose 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.600
 and at least 10,000 million others 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.909
 People have the same questions as you 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.579
 even before now someone in my fan 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.320
 Hand explodes from my computer 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.030
 I'll give you a quick break I think so 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.310
 totally awesome that you are asking this question 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.590
 he has already picked up because low 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.060
 carb it brave are a genius 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.100
 possibility before I do that but completely 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.560
 concrete tips are a few short 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.250
 general things also to low carb 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.740
 challenge in general to low carb 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.780
 many also somehow stamp me as 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.880
 democrat king from that I am at all 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.670
 nothing because low carb is a very very 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.799
 very cool 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.950
 for many people to success 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.899
 However, to celebrate is not the locally 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.090
 only planet on this planet I feed 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.250
 Not me either the whole year or the year 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.090
 all the time about low carb I too 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.920
 like my oatmeal slime or 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.350
 sometimes like rice or in general 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.280
 oatmeal cereal I also like to 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.810
 potatoes but has low carb nutrition 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.610
 then for very special people and from 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.709
 the very large target group very many 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.239
 advantages and I will also after and 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.739
 after in this update or at 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.819
 during the challenge also with her 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.550
 clarify I also had one 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.739
 video made for whom ever low 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.120
 carb makes sense the video is linked 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.830
 Maybe I'll link you here too 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.660
 somewhere then you can already do that 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.000
 take a look and already in general 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.819
 Beyond weighing whether that 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.709
 which is for you or not for 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.390
 me generally means that you are in 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.040
 can do different ways 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.530
 Slow carb you can do very very much 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.930
 do radical with 50 or more 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.810
 less grams of carbohydrates per day 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.090
 but low carb is also something for me 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.910
 above the threshold so at 120 to 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.850
 150 grams of carbs if this 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.470
 so about 120 grams so much 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.060
 glucose so much sugar so much 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.060
 just talked about carbohydrates 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.549
 that's what our brain needs every day 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.440
 does not necessarily mean that you 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.420
 these 120 grams of carbohydrates too 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.340
 our body has to eat completely 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.590
 could coal 3 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.359
 that glucose that sugar for ours 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.579
 make brain yourself 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.100
 in a completely normal physiological 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.560
 processes no matter what his name is and for what and 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.820
 how and what carbohydrates needed 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.440
 First and foremost, I could do the body 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.299
 but also make yourself this threshold 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.250
 from 120 to 150 grams 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.410
 that's the threshold for me , so to speak 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.910
 personally where i define low carb 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.250
 I'll do that too during the low 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.739
 define carb challenge and from it 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.350
 also results if we do not like that 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.079
 have a lot of time as I very lazy 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.180
 are or do not want to eat as much before 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.190
 all in vegetables also very very important 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.200
 we need minerals 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.000
 Minerals next to the protein and the 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.490
 field in 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.050
 a low carb diet we need the 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.850
 Minerals because they are almost 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.460
 even more important to make everything cool 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:19.019
 body works and the krimi where in 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:21.000
 vegetable fruits and I'm just someone here 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.260
 sometimes it does not have to be that often 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.600
 just a quick radio to which I can 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.400
 do not sit quietly for long enough 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.260
 I do not like to drink smoothies myself 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.170
 shows a very great possibility is 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.000
 very fast and very easy very much 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.080
 nutrients and vitamins in my body 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.730
 purely to pump 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.580
 and I had because I have already 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.110
 Prepared recipes when you have recipes in 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.940
 the loo during the lock up challenge too 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.530
 low carb smoothies or fortified 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.610
 max am have told me that 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.360
 maybe write that down in the 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.980
 Comments 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.150
 because maybe I'll go there again 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.410
 and maybe pack some more 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.700
 more of my recipes because it 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.440
 works very very fast 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.840
 I already said I already have 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.280
 I already said and where I'm going 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.419
 if you have the border now 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.690
 carbohydrates at 120 130 150 grams 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.000
 carbohydrates in the day then that is 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.710
 such a smoothie such a locomotive 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.990
 Simply a smoothie then 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.810
 maybe ten or fifteen grams 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.940
 carbohydrates has dripping on the 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.830
 Hot stone that is that is marginal 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.729
 so there you have so much air 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.410
 above 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.570
 there you can do so many other things 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.940
 is there you can even as a side dish one 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.350
 handful of rice or a handful of noodles 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.690
 or what if you eat from it 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.390
 should not do without it 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.150
 not like exchange the low carb 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.830
 smoothies definitely in the low carb 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.590
 diet have a place as I said 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.900
 always remember from which 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.110
 perspective democrat if you consider 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.120
 very little carbohydrates 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.610
 it just so in the form of atkins or 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.190
 something then makes less sense because if 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.720
 or 10 15 grams with a tape or has 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.340
 he only takes it with him then take it 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.979
 are you there then already full 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.560
 but if you keep that pretty moderate 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.660
 what is also purposeful then you can 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.610
 calm in the cool smoothie just stop 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.800
 Drink at this point again 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.660
 really a very important one please 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.320
 for all new to come in the 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.370
 Group please respect the perspective 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.990
 each run up 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.760
 I do not mean that group now 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.889
 only in terms of smoothies or 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.690
 something else, of course, too 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.280
 but what else is it? 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.740
 also on the perspective of the people 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.690
 where they come from we have such a big one 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.090
 Spectrum of people in our group 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.680
 We have people with 60 kilos 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.910
 Just start two three kilos 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.490
 maybe we still want to lose 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:38.160
 people have the city with 120 130 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.169
 kilo want a lot more weight 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.970
 lose and that's cool that we're in 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:43.740
 this group so many people together 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.780
 they just have to be healthier 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.460
 want and have more fun in life 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.710
 want to look for other possibilities 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.380
 therefore , every perspective is respected 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.090
 would not have to share but respect the 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.010
 perspective each other and if you 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.139
 discussed and leave comments 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.389
 then always remember that the other one 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:02.550
 may come from a different and different way 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:04.740
 so we get the whole thing well baked 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.150
 I was still good but very cool baked 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.639
 this works wonderfully so far 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:11.100
 a group and yes I am looking forward to 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:13.110
 everyone still comes to the 28th 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.139
 the registration port is still open 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.220
 the on low carb challenge.de 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:19.889
 I register there for the low carb 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.330
 challenge and I am very happy if 

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:22.770
 you with it is a lock up challenge 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.650
 is of course completely free and 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.720
 non-binding the only one with only 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.780
 hook part is that you do it yourself
