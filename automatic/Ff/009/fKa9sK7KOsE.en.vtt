00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.180
 Welcome to Wüstensachsen 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.309
 group league duel between the sg 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.139
 Ehrenberg and the FC Eichenzell 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.820
 no the camera lens is not 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.379
 beaten the conditions by the 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.960
 Local fog are truly not the 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.210
 best we come to the teams the sg 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.620
 Ehrenberg has a team running 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.390
 out of the rhön has not only eight of the 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.610
 won but last ten games 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.080
 is done with a 18 0 by cell in 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.860
 last week, second place 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.630
 climbed 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.250
 no wonder so that the lot on 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.450
 sunday against eichenzell necessarily 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.149
 to be discharged 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.890
 because competitor sv is still not waving 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.140
 The sge even the table guide 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.000
 referee christian golde 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.820
 Salmünster directs the game and whistles 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.680
 punctually at 14.30 at the first chance 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.750
 of the day belongs to a master in white 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.320
 lucas maierhof loses the ball in the 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.600
 midfield 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.520
 july fits steffen carel and 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.350
 Julius letter solicited 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.090
 however, the conclusion still allows 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.170
 to wish 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.340
 is playful in this weather and 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.120
 the space conditions not much 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.280
 implement 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.360
 Eichenzell is therefore often over 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.430
 standards dangerous 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.500
 matthias heumüller tries it directly 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.840
 but the ball passes right by the goal 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.459
 in the 24 minute minute get the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.270
 Men's blue does not have proper control 

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:13.280
 over the ball 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.619
 müller then with a fatal error 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.200
 because John Metzler ice-cold exploit 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.149
 the 1 0 for the sg ehrenberg it remains 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.149
 He is currently the table leader 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.829
 Eichenzell is through if anything 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.229
 standards reasonably dangerous 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.060
 mayrhofen is the free kick link 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.950
 Moritz miller comes to the ball but 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.959
 his shot from 14 meters does not provide 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.439
 problem for him well set up mass 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:40.909
 helm in the gate the host since the short 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.609
 after the break against meierhof 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.499
 outstanding reflex time the britannia 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:47.479
 still does not come into play 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:51.219
 frivolous mishaps like this one from 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.219
 müller plays ehrenberg in the cards 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.380
 dogan kilic loses the fight against 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.380
 3 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.380
 and in the middle can steffen carel in 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.480
 all peace of mind to 2 0 einnetzen 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.640
 the second mistake of eichenzell the 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.690
 Ehrenberg exploits ice cold when it does 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.690
 once it runs then it runs 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.370
 we jump into the 75 minutes of play 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.790
 blue-white tries again with one 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.439
 free kick the rear team of the sg 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.750
 The situation can not be decisive 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.159
 clarify and again is or to the place 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.840
 the the deflected shot of 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.390
 Maierhof can parry 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.400
 kilic sees again in the final phase 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.200
 bad in defensive behavior from the 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.030
 grabs the ball and caresses can 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.390
 but his second strike achieve 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.890
 Captain Hall Mueller rescues the line 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.109
 but it should do for your way 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.180
 after 90 minutes, the ninth victory is over 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.310
 Eleven play in dry cloths and the 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.260
 So sg says goodbye at least 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.099
 for the time being as a table leader in the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.659
 winterpause 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.040
 the pursuers, however, have in 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.700
 December still catch-up games too 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.590
 contest 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.859
 ehrenberg player trainer robert 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.700
 schorstein is with us at the microphone 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.109
 yes I think it was not a nice game 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.000
 today, too, knew that 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.439
 space was difficult the fog 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.090
 has contributed his part to 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.439
 but we are just having a huge one 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.760
 attitude into the game wanted to go 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.349
 make up for the play where was 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.150
 have played extremely badly in 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.769
 oak cell and then right pack 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.970
 We did not want to get it today 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.829
 show a reaction and we have 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.769
 also impressively proved even if 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.410
 certainly not a nice example 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.870
 think 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.370
 even over space that was us then 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.810
 consciously after entering in sochi 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.940
 have that it will be a fight 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.320
 because you have to say the first halftime 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.270
 right now we do not have the fight 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.200
 accepted 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.880
 that big cities are not so ins 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.290
 actually came more or 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.770
 less run after where you 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.750
 have to say 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.130
 Nuremberg has also no clear 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.630
 Opportunities singled out individual 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.070
 Fields will also be through 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.920
 a mistake and the ball skips 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.150
 and the discoverer family then falls 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.070
 do you lie to one in the winter after so 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.130
 It will be hard for us to get a place 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.570
 aware that 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.640
 that the team is leading 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.530
 Better chances to win the game 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.340
 nonetheless comes from the half time 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.900
 and I think that was another 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.490
 team then from us too just that 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.170
 first 20 25 minutes 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.180
 and then after two minutes 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.820
 through the lukas meyer on the gate 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.500
 what is so alone on the gate is timed 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.930
 and the ball goes in 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.430
 the goalkeeper has great kept that 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.290
 Game got other walls and 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.990
 That's where we did not do 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.630
 then after the 2 0 also still and two 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.540
 three very good chances has been very good 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.920
 held up well from a ehrenberg 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.510
 difficult or difficult 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.800
 playable space was not what we 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.360
 otherwise always want to play 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.760
 playful sometimes not possible and 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.070
 the first fight was accepted and that was 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.070
 crack again is playful 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.830
 so
