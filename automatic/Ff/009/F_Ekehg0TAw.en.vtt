00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
shell decoy you don't stand a chance for

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.269 
shell decoy you don't stand a chance for
a<00:00:23.400> full-body<00:00:23.640> one<00:00:24.470> but<00:00:25.470> away<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.740> can<00:00:25.949> tighten

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
a full-body one but away you can tighten

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.950 
a full-body one but away you can tighten
these<00:00:26.369> up<00:00:26.580> if<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.849> don't<00:00:27.029> already<00:00:27.240> know<00:00:27.480> if

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
these up if you don't already know if

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.279 
these up if you don't already know if
you<00:00:28.140> turn<00:00:28.609> with<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> spring<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.599> turn<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.050> two

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
you turn with a spring you turn the two

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.030 
you turn with a spring you turn the two
parts<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> stick<00:00:32.759> together<00:00:33.559> so<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.649> make

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
parts of the stick together so you make

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.160 
parts of the stick together so you make
for<00:00:35.550> about<00:00:35.790> four<00:00:36.090> or<00:00:36.180> five<00:00:36.390> millimeter<00:00:36.899> gap

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
for about four or five millimeter gap

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.100 
for about four or five millimeter gap
between<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.370> two<00:00:38.610> bits<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.870> way<00:00:40.050> you

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
between the two bits that way you

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.990 
between the two bits that way you
stiffen<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.480> normal<00:00:42.809> show<00:00:43.020> quite

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
stiffen it up I do a normal show quite

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.410 
stiffen it up I do a normal show quite
usually<00:00:45.000> quite<00:00:45.270> happily<00:00:46.039> but<00:00:47.039> they<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.149> still
