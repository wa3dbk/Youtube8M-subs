00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
now I'm going to draw two lines for the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:30.250 
now I'm going to draw two lines for the
legs<00:01:24.640> as<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.700> guide<00:01:26.120> a<00:01:28.780> little<00:01:29.780> bit<00:01:29.900> more<00:01:30.110> than

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
legs as a guide a little bit more than

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.370 
legs as a guide a little bit more than
halfway<00:01:30.500> down<00:01:30.830> and<00:01:31.550> we'll<00:01:31.940> put<00:01:32.780> two<00:01:32.960> circles

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
halfway down and we'll put two circles

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.600 
halfway down and we'll put two circles
for<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:34.670> needs<00:01:35.150> and<00:01:36.009> at<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.040> bottom<00:01:37.310> of<00:01:37.490> the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
for the needs and at the bottom of the

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:45.010 
for the needs and at the bottom of the
lines<00:01:39.040> two<00:01:40.040> circles<00:01:40.520> for<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:42.080> feet<00:01:43.660> now<00:01:44.660> for

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
lines two circles for the feet now for

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:53.170 
lines two circles for the feet now for
the<00:01:45.140> arms<00:01:45.530> I<00:01:46.030> draw<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:50.060> line<00:01:50.740> as<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:51.800> guide<00:01:52.180> to

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
the arms I draw the line as a guide to

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.690 
the arms I draw the line as a guide to
show<00:01:53.360> me<00:01:53.539> where<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:54.020> arms<00:01:54.289> will<00:01:54.410> go<00:01:54.640> now<00:01:55.640> do

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
show me where the arms will go now do

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:05.600 
show me where the arms will go now do
the<00:01:56.000> same<00:01:56.170> on<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.560> opposite<00:01:57.860> side

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.160

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
now I'll go to the feet and join two

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:20.270 
now I'll go to the feet and join two
triangles

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.080 

now<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.550> will<00:02:21.880> do<00:02:22.420> cylinders<00:02:23.910> for<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.030> muscles

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
now I will do cylinders for the muscles

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:35.270 
now I will do cylinders for the muscles
or<00:02:28.090> do<00:02:28.390> this<00:02:28.890> for<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.010> arm<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:31.000> legs

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280

I<00:02:44.750> will<00:02:45.750> connect<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:47.100> head<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> shoulder

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
I will connect the head to the shoulder

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:57.190 
I will connect the head to the shoulder
so<00:02:50.819> I<00:02:51.300> can<00:02:52.200> have<00:02:52.319> a<00:02:52.380> neck

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.339

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
now I'm going to go around the joints

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.559 
now I'm going to go around the joints
and<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.610> cylinders<00:03:02.610> which<00:03:02.909> are<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.150> muscles

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
and the cylinders which are the muscles

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.589 
and the cylinders which are the muscles
and<00:03:06.140> bulk<00:03:07.140> up<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.349> counter<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.430> give<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.819> more

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
and bulk up the counter to give it more

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:17.259 
and bulk up the counter to give it more
the<00:03:09.870> shape<00:03:13.459> exaggerate<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.910> muscles<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:16.590> give

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
the shape exaggerate the muscles to give

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.059

to<00:03:18.269> give<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.569> counter<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.319> more<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.860> a

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
to give you a counter and more of a

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:44.330 
to give you a counter and more of a
superhero<00:03:20.610> feel<00:03:40.910> put<00:03:41.910> two<00:03:42.150> triangles<00:03:43.220> for<00:03:44.220> the

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
superhero feel put two triangles for the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:54.140 
superhero feel put two triangles for the
hands<00:03:50.540> now<00:03:51.540> I'll<00:03:52.109> go<00:03:52.349> back<00:03:52.379> to<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.799> face<00:03:53.150> I'll

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
hands now I'll go back to the face I'll

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.270 
hands now I'll go back to the face I'll
put<00:03:54.599> a<00:03:54.629> horizontal<00:03:54.959> line<00:03:55.560> in<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.950> middle<00:03:56.220> of

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280
