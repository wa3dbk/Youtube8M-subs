00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello youtube friends facebook and others 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.379
 social networks today I bring you a new 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.389
 tutorial on how to buy games for 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.820
 gift in this year we open steam and 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.070
 we enter our account I already have the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.350
 mine started the library games 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.330
 you can not send only the games 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.189
 bought as a gift and games 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.760
 saved in inventory can be 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.760
 sent 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.580
 as you can see there is nothing in me 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.070
 inventory now I will show you how to buy 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.720
 a game to send it as a gift 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.880
 to store and we look for the game that 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.980
 we will send 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.330
 in my case the game that I will use as 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.330
 example will be the counter strike 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.039
 and here is 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.920
 we go down and we give to buy as if 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.920
 it was for ourselves 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.489
 as you can see here gives them to choose 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.079
 between buying to buy as a gift 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.079
 we choose to buy as a gift 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.890
 here we have three options the first is 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.050
 send as a gift by email this option 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.120
 let us send the game by mail 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.000
 if we do not have it added as a friend in 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.430
 steam the second is to send my gift 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.860
 directly by steam this will see if 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.420
 you have your friend added in steam alone 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.740
 you have to select the and give it to 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.740
 Search well as I do 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.320
 and the third one that is the most used to save 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.510
 the gift in my inventory to send it 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.850
 later this option serves to save 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.740
 the game in inventory and be able to send it 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.020
 later or exchange it with other 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.450
 people select one of the three 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.450
 options and we give you to continue here the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.310
 in the process of paying via paypal 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.180
 We give to continue and it will take us to the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.180
 paypal page 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.100
 now we initiate section and act the 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.190
 buy but I will not do it because I do not 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.500
