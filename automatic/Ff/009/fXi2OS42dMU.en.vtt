00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.120
 Yes Yes 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.540
 for what 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.650
 no more 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 I 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.330
 the mind 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.430
 I said in the general 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.670
 but 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.270
 with enough 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.270
 4 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.470
 stop shooting and I open them 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.740
 the partner was half advanced 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:05.820
 wounded dripping blood we load it 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.220
 like football and then we ran we ran and 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.590
 feeling the shots and going to the 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.240
 cars that were on the banks we were going 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.320
 between the cars so they do not shoot 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.370
 On the 26th we were at school 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.200
 we knew that the compaÃ±eras had 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.239
 departures get angry 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.989
 to the option of receiving a call from a 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.780
 partner and said we are emptying the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.849
 policemen here of equality when I 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.750
 they said that we armed the exit in the 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:36.640
 school of the polls in front of the school 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.610
 we enter to equal and we go towards 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:47.489
 where the facts were happening 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:47.489
 when we reach the elderly we are 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.230
 studying us we were going to get to 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.230
 the things 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.299
 because the calm aggression 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:10.519
 because we just saw one of our 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:13.239
 companion was dead was not 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.239
 dead 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:21.950
 and that he is still in a coma with death 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.709
 brain the same one that received an impact 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.739
 in the head we arrived and saw already the 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.859
 buses were totally destroyed 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:34.519
 as he sent us one of the windows the 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:36.409
 windshield work 300 inches blood 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.519
 in cars buses 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:43.489
 clotted blood and it's not a droplet of 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.440
 blood in quantities suddenly by 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.840
 part of the road that comes from 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.290
 everything we started to hear the 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.290
 shots 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.590
 on the street 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.190
 when we reached two or three blocks the 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.000
 military officers were still patrolling the areas 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.000
 they told us 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.130
 We were afraid and terror at the same time because 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.470
 we did not know what to talk we could not do 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.810
 phone calls if someone 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.240
 called the military they were getting 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.760
 listen first and they told us what 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.580
 we had to say they expressed 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.380
 saying 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.310
 the sevillana 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.800
 that they do not realize that we have here 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.770
 you will find that you are well 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.340
 they called an ambulance that 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.590
 They took pictures of everyone, even 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:56.349
 partner who was hurt he was told 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:58.599
 We are going to take pictures so that 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:01.240
 comes this ambulance never arrived 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:03.610
 the companions began to disperse and 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.800
 they left me to my teacher taking care of 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.080
 my partner with the risk that we 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.759
 they will kill between the streets we could arrive 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.420
 to the hospital really at 3 o'clock in the 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.910
 morning 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.050
 took 43 of our classmates and 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.050
 they are still missing 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.060
 In Mexico and in Guerrero people are killed in 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:28.129
 these so-called collateral damages of their 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:30.699
 fuckin politics they fight between them 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:36.189
 we do not want to be part of that 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:36.189
 we want a fair and free Mexico 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:22.979
 I 'm 19 years old and I hope they'll come back 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.310
 food to be able to return in chairs and 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.310
 students
