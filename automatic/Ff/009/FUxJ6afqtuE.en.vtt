friends<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.839> that's<00:00:16.650> half<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.920> fun<00:00:17.070> if<00:00:17.340> he's

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
friends and that's half the fun if he's

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.830 
friends and that's half the fun if he's
getting<00:00:17.789> together<00:00:17.880> with<00:00:18.090> good<00:00:18.359> friends<00:00:18.510> and

getting together with good friends and
then<00:00:18.990> kind<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.830> watching<00:00:20.039> everybody<00:00:21.050> discover

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
then kind of watching everybody discover

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.750 
then kind of watching everybody discover
the<00:00:22.730> GA<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.880> 12<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.600> 1<00:00:24.720> 12<00:00:24.960> amplifiers<00:00:25.760> it's

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
the GA to 12 and 1 12 amplifiers it's

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.120 
the GA to 12 and 1 12 amplifiers it's
kind<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.029> interesting<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:28.410> all<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.920> common

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
kind of interesting we all have a common

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.099 
kind of interesting we all have a common
goal<00:00:29.310> which<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.670> we're<00:00:30.420> learning<00:00:30.570> about<00:00:30.840> this

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
goal which is we're learning about this

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.030 
goal which is we're learning about this
really<00:00:31.349> cool<00:00:31.619> amplifier<00:00:33.559> on<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.800> set<00:00:35.010> in

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
really cool amplifier on the set in

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.229 
really cool amplifier on the set in
there<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.309> noticed<00:00:35.550> there<00:00:35.820> was<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> lot<00:00:36.210> of

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
there I noticed there was a lot of

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.290 
there I noticed there was a lot of
amplifiers<00:00:36.870> not<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.410> rolling<00:00:37.739> amplifiers

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
amplifiers not just rolling amplifiers

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.970 
amplifiers not just rolling amplifiers
there<00:00:39.300> was<00:00:39.420> some<00:00:39.570> very<00:00:39.750> popular<00:00:40.260> stage<00:00:40.559> amps

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
there was some very popular stage amps

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.990 
there was some very popular stage amps
in<00:00:41.070> there<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.399> tell<00:00:41.550> us<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.730> little<00:00:41.760> bit

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
in there can you tell us a little bit

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.170 
in there can you tell us a little bit
about<00:00:42.239> what<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.809> concept<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:44.030> well<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.090> think

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
about what the concept is well I think

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.940 
about what the concept is well I think
when<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.719> did<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> shoot<00:00:46.170> part<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
when we did the shoot part of the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.580 
when we did the shoot part of the
concept<00:00:47.399> was<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.899> remind<00:00:48.899> people<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.320> there

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
concept was to remind people that there

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.279 
concept was to remind people that there
are<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> number<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.160> different<00:00:50.370> iconic

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
are a number of different iconic

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.080 
are a number of different iconic
amplifiers<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.649> know<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.980> all<00:00:53.430> we're<00:00:54.000> all

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
amplifiers you know that all we're all

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.830 
amplifiers you know that all we're all
familiar<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.649> but<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.309> particular

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
familiar with but that this particular

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.720 
familiar with but that this particular
amplifier<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.079> role<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.440> amplifier<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
amplifier this role in amplifier the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.540 
amplifier this role in amplifier the
idea<00:01:00.030> was<00:01:00.180> not<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> copy<00:01:00.840> anything<00:01:01.230> not<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.280> try

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
idea was not to copy anything not to try

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.570 
idea was not to copy anything not to try
to<00:01:02.609> sound<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.390> every<00:01:03.660> other<00:01:03.930> amplifier<00:01:04.589> but

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
to sound like every other amplifier but

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.649 
to sound like every other amplifier but
to<00:01:05.700> try<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.000> take<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.840> best<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:08.270> guess<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> best

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
to try to take the best I guess the best

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.410 
to try to take the best I guess the best
of<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> different<00:01:12.090> kinds<00:01:12.330> of

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
of the of the different kinds of

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.950 
of the of the different kinds of
amplifiers<00:01:12.900> for<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.369> response<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:15.330> dynamics

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
amplifiers for the response the dynamics

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.399 
amplifiers for the response the dynamics
tone<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.240> blend<00:01:18.240> them<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.720> such<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> way<00:01:19.380> that

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
tone and blend them in such a way that

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.420 
tone and blend them in such a way that
you<00:01:19.799> could<00:01:20.090> kind<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.150> create<00:01:21.600> new<00:01:22.320> tones<00:01:23.040> as

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
you could kind of create new tones as

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.450 
you could kind of create new tones as
well<00:01:24.090> as<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> sort<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.780> iconic<00:01:25.250> tones<00:01:26.250> that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
well as the sort of iconic tones that

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.130 
well as the sort of iconic tones that
we're<00:01:26.549> all<00:01:26.640> used<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:27.930> what<00:01:28.080> really

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
we're all used to and that's what really

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.960 
we're all used to and that's what really
fascinated<00:01:28.860> me<00:01:28.979> about<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.340> amplifiers<00:01:29.850> that

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
fascinated me about the amplifiers that

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.330 
fascinated me about the amplifiers that
I<00:01:30.509> got<00:01:31.079> him<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.380> know<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.710> buy<00:01:32.009> as<00:01:32.189> many

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
I got him you know I can buy as many

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.670 
I got him you know I can buy as many
amplifiers<00:01:32.939> as<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.270> want<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.259> idea<00:01:34.619> of

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
amplifiers as I want but the idea of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.149 
amplifiers as I want but the idea of
exploring<00:01:35.130> something<00:01:35.610> new<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.979> as<00:01:37.979> an

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
exploring something new that as an

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.590 
exploring something new that as an
adjunct<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.670> my<00:01:38.790> guitar<00:01:39.119> plane<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.509> I've

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
adjunct to my guitar plane and I've

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.020 
adjunct to my guitar plane and I've
never<00:01:39.720> done<00:01:39.960> before<00:01:40.159> that's<00:01:41.159> something<00:01:41.939> that

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
never done before that's something that

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.889 
never done before that's something that
I<00:01:42.119> really<00:01:42.600> enjoyed<00:01:43.170> look<00:01:43.470> forward<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.950> him<00:01:44.899> is

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
I really enjoyed look forward to him is

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.679 
I really enjoyed look forward to him is
there<00:01:46.110> any<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:47.040> was<00:01:47.220> there<00:01:47.369> any<00:01:47.490> highlights<00:01:47.729> so

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
there any it was there any highlights so

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.350 
there any it was there any highlights so
far<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.200> shoot<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.939> maybe<00:01:51.119> give

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
far in the shoot that you can maybe give

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.960 
far in the shoot that you can maybe give
us<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.540> sneak<00:01:51.750> peak<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.829> found<00:01:53.040> very

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
us a sneak peak on that you found very

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.749 
us a sneak peak on that you found very
interesting<00:01:54.060> about<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> video<00:01:55.640> well<00:01:56.640> half

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
interesting about the video well half

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.450 
interesting about the video well half
the<00:01:56.939> fun<00:01:57.119> was<00:01:57.299> playing<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.409> mean<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:59.310> are

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
the fun was playing and I mean we are

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.190 
the fun was playing and I mean we are
sort<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.909> guitar<00:02:00.210> players<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.750> that's<00:02:00.869> what

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
sort of guitar players and that's what

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.020 
sort of guitar players and that's what
we<00:02:01.320> do<00:02:01.469> best<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.219> what<00:02:02.369> we<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.670> do<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
we do best and what we like to do the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.959 
we do best and what we like to do the
most<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.829> a<00:02:04.829> couple<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> jams<00:02:05.759> were

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
most and a couple of the jams were

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.839 
most and a couple of the jams were
really<00:02:06.710> interesting<00:02:07.710> because<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.250> guys<00:02:08.459> said

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
really interesting because you guys said

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.210 
really interesting because you guys said
that<00:02:08.970> we<00:02:09.060> couldn't<00:02:09.300> do<00:02:09.509> any<00:02:09.690> songs<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.470> know

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
that we couldn't do any songs you know

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.530 
that we couldn't do any songs you know
that<00:02:11.760> we're<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.180> know

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
that we're you know

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.539 
that we're you know
well<00:02:12.689> known<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.079> I<00:02:13.170> understand<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.799> so<00:02:14.010> half

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
well known and I understand that so half

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.270 
well known and I understand that so half
the<00:02:14.760> fun<00:02:14.790> was<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:15.739> really<00:02:16.739> just<00:02:16.890> coming<00:02:17.219> up

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
the fun was just really just coming up

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.369 
the fun was just really just coming up
with<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.519> chord<00:02:17.760> progression<00:02:18.239> in<00:02:18.390> playing<00:02:19.170> on

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
with the chord progression in playing on

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.130 
with the chord progression in playing on
it<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.939> players<00:02:21.180> again<00:02:21.540> were<00:02:21.659> so<00:02:21.870> good

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
it and the players again were so good

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.880 
it and the players again were so good
that<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.849> took<00:02:24.030> about<00:02:24.209> one<00:02:24.840> nanosecond<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.739> get

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
that it took about one nanosecond to get

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.099 
that it took about one nanosecond to get
into<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.189> groove<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:27.420> was<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.599> whole<00:02:27.900> lot<00:02:28.079> of

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
into the groove that was a whole lot of

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.949 
into the groove that was a whole lot of
fun<00:02:28.409> and<00:02:28.939> then<00:02:29.939> we<00:02:30.060> were<00:02:30.209> telling<00:02:30.420> Mike<00:02:30.689> a<00:02:30.720> lot

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
fun and then we were telling Mike a lot

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.119 
fun and then we were telling Mike a lot
of<00:02:31.079> stories<00:02:31.319> because<00:02:31.590> I'm<00:02:31.709> gonna<00:02:31.890> have<00:02:32.010> been

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
of stories because I'm gonna have been

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.979 
of stories because I'm gonna have been
around<00:02:32.310> for<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.579> few<00:02:32.730> years<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:33.689> it's<00:02:33.840> mike

and kind of like the beginnings of you
know<00:02:42.239> when<00:02:42.599> those<00:02:42.989> amplifiers<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.889> you<00:02:44.040> are

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
know when those amplifiers that you are

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.729 
know when those amplifiers that you are
going<00:02:44.639> to<00:02:44.700> see<00:02:44.879> in<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.120> video<00:02:45.470> we're<00:02:46.470> about

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
going to see in the video we're about

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.250 
going to see in the video we're about
three<00:02:47.099> years<00:02:47.250> old<00:02:47.549> you<00:02:48.359> know<00:02:48.480> now<00:02:48.689> there's<00:02:48.930> 50

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
three years old you know now there's 50

years old we were just telling stories

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.360 
years old we were just telling stories
it<00:02:51.720> was<00:02:51.840> fun<00:02:52.019> white<00:02:52.290> was<00:02:52.470> getting<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.040> real<00:02:53.189> kick

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
it was fun white was getting a real kick

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.530 
it was fun white was getting a real kick
out<00:02:53.489> yeah<00:02:54.590> skunk<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.739> played<00:02:56.069> in<00:02:56.340> some<00:02:56.819> very

Dan<00:03:03.959> how<00:03:04.799> would<00:03:05.370> an<00:03:06.000> amplifier<00:03:06.540> such<00:03:07.049> as<00:03:07.230> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
Dan how would an amplifier such as the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.220 
Dan how would an amplifier such as the
ga<00:03:07.739> 2<00:03:08.639> 12<00:03:08.879> or<00:03:09.030> one<00:03:09.180> 12<00:03:09.450> fit<00:03:09.930> into<00:03:10.109> that

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
ga 2 12 or one 12 fit into that

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
ga 2 12 or one 12 fit into that
repertoire<00:03:11.750> well<00:03:12.750> when<00:03:13.079> people<00:03:13.349> ask<00:03:13.530> me<00:03:13.680> you

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
repertoire well when people ask me you

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.860 
repertoire well when people ask me you
know<00:03:14.280> yeah<00:03:14.609> I<00:03:14.669> played<00:03:14.909> it<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.090> lot<00:03:15.209> of<00:03:15.359> bands<00:03:15.540> and

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
know yeah I played it a lot of bands and

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.229 
know yeah I played it a lot of bands and
certain<00:03:16.739> bands<00:03:16.949> have<00:03:17.250> certain<00:03:17.639> somewhat

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
certain bands have certain somewhat

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.369 
certain bands have certain somewhat
signature<00:03:18.780> sounds<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:20.900> most<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:22.079> the<00:03:22.169> time

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
signature sounds and most of the time

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.869 
signature sounds and most of the time
one<00:03:22.650> would<00:03:22.799> go<00:03:22.949> out<00:03:23.069> and<00:03:23.099> buy<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.430> particular

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
one would go out and buy a particular

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.770 
one would go out and buy a particular
amplifier<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:25.079> would<00:03:25.949> best<00:03:26.340> match<00:03:26.780> whatever

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
amplifier that would best match whatever

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.640 
amplifier that would best match whatever
people's<00:03:29.060> sonic<00:03:30.060> image<00:03:30.449> of<00:03:30.629> that<00:03:30.690> particular

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
people's sonic image of that particular

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.250 
people's sonic image of that particular
band<00:03:32.190> would<00:03:32.400> be<00:03:32.609> frankly<00:03:33.599> I<00:03:35.060> haven't<00:03:36.260> played

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
band would be frankly I haven't played

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.729 
band would be frankly I haven't played
anything<00:03:37.859> through<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.669> sample<00:03:38.909> fire<00:03:39.739> that

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
anything through the sample fire that

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.569 
anything through the sample fire that
was<00:03:41.010> problematic<00:03:41.549> in<00:03:42.329> other<00:03:42.510> words<00:03:42.720> if<00:03:43.579> when

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
was problematic in other words if when

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.670 
was problematic in other words if when
we<00:03:44.669> did<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:44.970> jam<00:03:45.209> today<00:03:45.419> we<00:03:45.659> play<00:03:45.870> some<00:03:46.440> blues

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
little bee bop we played some some funk

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.890 
little bee bop we played some some funk
and<00:03:54.780> play<00:03:55.199> some<00:03:55.260> heavy<00:03:55.620> metal<00:03:56.269> all<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.689> which

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
and play some heavy metal all of which

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.629 
and play some heavy metal all of which
sounded<00:03:58.650> very<00:03:59.040> very<00:04:00.199> satisfying<00:04:01.639> through

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
sounded very very satisfying through

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.939 
sounded very very satisfying through
this<00:04:02.760> amplifier<00:04:03.389> there<00:04:04.019> wasn't<00:04:04.349> any<00:04:04.590> time

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.640 
this amplifier there wasn't any time
when<00:04:05.250> either<00:04:05.430> of<00:04:05.579> us<00:04:05.790> said<00:04:06.060> well<00:04:06.439> maybe<00:04:07.439> we

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
when either of us said well maybe we

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.020 
when either of us said well maybe we
shouldn't<00:04:07.919> play<00:04:08.310> this<00:04:08.489> because<00:04:08.849> this

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
shouldn't play this because this

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.179 
shouldn't play this because this
amplifier<00:04:09.509> doesn't<00:04:09.780> quite<00:04:09.989> match<00:04:10.769> what<00:04:11.069> we're

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
amplifier doesn't quite match what we're

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.719 
amplifier doesn't quite match what we're
looking<00:04:11.430> for<00:04:11.459> pretty<00:04:12.329> amazing<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:14.370> what's

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:14.729 
looking for pretty amazing and what's

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.779 
looking for pretty amazing and what's
next<00:04:15.030> for<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.299> what<00:04:15.540> projects<00:04:15.989> you<00:04:16.109> were<00:04:16.349> done

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
next for you what projects you were done

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.860 
next for you what projects you were done
well<00:04:17.789> I've<00:04:18.030> been<00:04:18.060> working<00:04:18.419> on<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.599> solo

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
well I've been working on the solo

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.479 
well I've been working on the solo
record<00:04:19.259> for<00:04:19.409> about<00:04:19.560> three<00:04:19.769> years<00:04:19.949> but<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.280> think

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
record for about three years but I think

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.890 
record for about three years but I think
we're<00:04:20.609> finally<00:04:20.849> going<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.180> reach<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.599> end<00:04:21.750> of

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
we're finally going to reach the end of

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.430 
we're finally going to reach the end of
the

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
the

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.920 
the
into<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.280> Endeavour<00:04:23.670> get<00:04:24.120> that<00:04:24.330> out<00:04:24.510> and<00:04:24.780> I

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
into the Endeavour get that out and I

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.150 
into the Endeavour get that out and I
want<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.140> go<00:04:25.230> out<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:25.470> play<00:04:25.590> some<00:04:25.710> more<00:04:25.980> it's

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
want to go out and play some more it's

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.610 
want to go out and play some more it's
been<00:04:26.340> too<00:04:27.180> long<00:04:27.210> since<00:04:27.450> I've<00:04:27.870> been<00:04:28.020> out<00:04:28.140> this

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
been too long since I've been out this

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.610 
been too long since I've been out this
plan<00:04:29.370> in<00:04:29.580> front<00:04:29.790> of<00:04:29.880> folks<00:04:30.170> studio<00:04:31.170> is<00:04:31.380> fine

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
plan in front of folks studio is fine

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.040 
plan in front of folks studio is fine
but<00:04:32.460> it's<00:04:32.610> not<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.850> same<00:04:33.000> and<00:04:35.840> that's<00:04:36.840> pretty

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
but it's not the same and that's pretty

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.730 
but it's not the same and that's pretty
much<00:04:37.170> it<00:04:37.320> just<00:04:37.920> want<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.280> go<00:04:38.340> out<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.610> play

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
much it just want to go out and play

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.200 
much it just want to go out and play
