00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:07.340
 good morning friends of youtube today we go 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.900
 to 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.750
 give 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.480
 start 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.420
 what is the way we can 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.689
 check the transit status of the 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:24.099
 dude I do not know on this occasion we're going to 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:26.050
 treat traffic channel on how 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.380
 we make the measurements to give us 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.910
 account of the state of this 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.260
 The first thing to do is 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:38.210
 identify the terminals 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:41.930
 if we see in this transit the terminal of 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.340
 the side of the left is the gate 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.380
 or the game 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.990
 the terminal of the center is drained 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.630
 and the terminal on the right is the 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.600
 pump 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.820
 came in between these terminals and this is 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.970
 a rule 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.150
 is how they should measure so that the 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.979
 transistor is in good condition 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.540
 in this case being these little arms of 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.940
 channel n 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:15.150
 / internally the pump enters and 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.810
 coach on this ride is 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.850
 one of them basically godÃ³ that union told me 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.320
 then performing the tests as a 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.920
 god if we put the negative tip of the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.070
 test in the coach that is the point 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.520
 from the center and place the positive tip 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.930
 in the spout that be from the right 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.000
 we will obtain a measure that 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.920
 will correspond to the stress size of 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.010
 a finger to perform the measurement 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.930
 We put the multimeter on the scale of 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.930
 semiconductor or continuity 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.490
 there we have the multimeter of the face of 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.229
 semiconductor opportunity we touch the 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.479
 tip to prove it's working 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.240
 correctly 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.810
 then proceed we place the tip 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.030
 of negative tests on delivery and 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.910
 the positive positive probe 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.890
 over the pump there we get a 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:20.140
 measure SB 426 that measure can be of 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.540
 600 704 of 400 700 is usually the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.400
 measure of a I say then we do it 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.099
 inversely exchanging the 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.489
 terminals and we see that you should not give 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.200
 no measure as a god would 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:36.090
 then we check putting the tip of 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.569
 negative test in turn 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.110
 in this case when measuring each terminal of 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.560
 nador and assortment the respect 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:48.160
 someone should not give any measure let's go 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.460
 to nothing 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.340
 neither then to exchange the tip of 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:58.770
 Nor test does not measure gay 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.770
 none of the other two terminals 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.450
 now it is necessary to finally do what is 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.660
 called a test for auto to the 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.520
 transistor activation 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.000
 We do this on a transistor 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.760
 channel n the gate on the right is 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.400
 positive then if we put the tip of 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.310
 negative tests on the irrigator and the 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.290
 positive about the pump this active 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.110
 the transient makes the measure that 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.970
 We had before the developer the supplier of 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.890
 about 426 that out with had we now go 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.430
 to submit a lower measure 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.230
 depending on the transit as it became 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.570
 of transit activation the measure 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.570
 varies in this case is quite low 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:47.650
 I have a problem 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.840
 we return we activate the transit hour is 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.610
 important something for the test of 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.310
 activation terminals should not is 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.410
 touching any surface if we touch 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.800
 a surface as finished then 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.319
 not activate properly we help 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.709
 Activate 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:09.599
 we see that it emits continuity of the tc and 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:12.700
 it measures 100 49 which is the activation then 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:16.090
 if we touch it 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:20.190
 with fingers then this one 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.190
 disable new equality 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.930
 in total the most so that they reactivate 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.930
 completely and the summers measured before 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.050
 Every say is active 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.030
 save the previous measurement 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.210
 for this you just have to take to do that 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.060
 everything in this case says that the tip 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.729
 will touch the surface of the multimeter to 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.370
 that health be given 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.159
 good if the measures correspond 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.800
 with which we already made very possible the 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:56.139
 transit is in good condition 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.689
 some cases the transit does not stay 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.849
 activated as we saw here when we do 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:03.129
 the test of the estimate but it goes 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.749
 happening this that is going to deactivate but 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:06.790
 still in many cases the receiver 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:09.080
 it works without problems 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.310
 A) Yes 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.310
 Felix rest
