00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.700 
a very nervous experience in that den
what<00:07:21.419> was<00:07:21.539> going<00:07:21.660> through<00:07:21.750> your<00:07:21.930> mind<00:07:22.289> I<00:07:22.500> knew

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.710 
what was going through your mind I knew

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.439 
what was going through your mind I knew
what<00:07:22.830> I<00:07:22.889> had<00:07:23.130> to<00:07:23.160> say<00:07:23.310> but<00:07:23.910> it's<00:07:24.150> just<00:07:24.360> that

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:24.449 
what I had to say but it's just that

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:26.300 
what I had to say but it's just that
first<00:07:24.750> sentence<00:07:25.530> I<00:07:25.740> was<00:07:25.919> standing<00:07:26.280> there

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.310 
first sentence I was standing there

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.580 
first sentence I was standing there
thinking<00:07:26.400> what<00:07:27.090> is<00:07:27.210> it<00:07:27.419> and<00:07:27.660> then<00:07:28.080> after<00:07:28.500> that

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:28.590 
thinking what is it and then after that

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.960 
thinking what is it and then after that
I<00:07:28.650> just<00:07:28.710> carried<00:07:29.190> it<00:07:29.250> on<00:07:29.370> do<00:07:29.639> you<00:07:29.699> think<00:07:29.880> in

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:29.970 
I just carried it on do you think in

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.870 
I just carried it on do you think in
hindsight<00:07:30.210> you<00:07:30.750> may<00:07:30.930> have<00:07:31.110> underestimated

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:31.880 
hindsight you may have underestimated

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.969 
hindsight you may have underestimated
the<00:07:32.880> potential<00:07:33.690> worth<00:07:33.960> of<00:07:34.289> the<00:07:34.409> company<00:07:34.800> in

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979 
the potential worth of the company in

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:36.710 
the potential worth of the company in
three<00:07:35.220> years<00:07:35.310> time<00:07:35.400> they're<00:07:36.360> kind<00:07:36.569> of<00:07:36.599> getting

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 
three years time they're kind of getting

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.390 
three years time they're kind of getting
their<00:07:36.930> money<00:07:37.110> back<00:07:37.380> yeah<00:07:37.710> I<00:07:37.740> think<00:07:37.860> it's

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 
their money back yeah I think it's

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.909 
their money back yeah I think it's
probably<00:07:38.699> being<00:07:39.180> too<00:07:39.449> much<00:07:39.599> prudence<00:07:39.870> yeah<00:07:40.650> in

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 
probably being too much prudence yeah in

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.499 
probably being too much prudence yeah in
hindsight<00:07:41.099> yeah<00:07:41.970> we<00:07:42.090> could<00:07:42.270> have<00:07:42.360> had<00:07:42.479> it

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:42.509 
hindsight yeah we could have had it

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:44.210 
hindsight yeah we could have had it
being<00:07:42.720> a<00:07:42.780> bit<00:07:42.900> more<00:07:43.020> ballsy<00:07:43.409> yeah<00:07:43.770> I'm<00:07:43.979> going

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.220 
being a bit more ballsy yeah I'm going

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.890 
being a bit more ballsy yeah I'm going
for<00:07:44.370> a<00:07:44.430> bit<00:07:44.550> more<00:07:44.699> but<00:07:45.270> I'm<00:07:45.419> at<00:07:45.569> least<00:07:45.750> we've

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900 
for a bit more but I'm at least we've

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.510 
for a bit more but I'm at least we've
learned<00:07:46.110> something<00:07:46.259> from<00:07:46.440> that<00:07:46.590> okay<00:07:47.340> well

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520
