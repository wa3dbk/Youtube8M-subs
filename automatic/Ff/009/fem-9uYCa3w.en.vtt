 this and the enemy would not wish 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.720
 but after 8 hours our hero runs with 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.720
 the work is essential you smile on his face 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.100
 I wonder where he is in such a hurry 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.630
 Mars seems to have some secret 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.110

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.340
 it turns out in the evenings fund 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.980

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.780
 Marx is going to sign 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.209
 transformer box in the center 

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:32.060
 Moscow 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.140
 it may well be already painted but what 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.369
 for the night alone but also the mystery of it 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.550
 no way to do 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.040
 but he knows Galileo 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.440

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.200
 buildings prohibited by law 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.969
 Actually therefore artists draw 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.030
 mystery at first 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.630
 but meeting guys 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.270
 not because not hiding, and even the police 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.659
 guards everything is very simple 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.669

 or painted on the walls 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:38.089

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:39.789
 robbers representing 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:41.499

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.959

 50 thousand cans of paint 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:02.819
 to be honest 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.989
 graffiti festival surprised not only 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.619
 Galileo but also the artists themselves because they 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:11.329
 attracted to hide and araz increase 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.039
 walls under cover of night so as not to fall 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:16.989
 for anyone in the eyes and here they are allowed 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.369

 his works are sold at auction 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.240
 most thousand dollars 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.509
 these are not just drawings but pictures with deep 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:39.629
 meaning 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:43.069
 the most interesting thing is that robert's faces are afraid 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:45.909
 no one has ever seen this person 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.039
 continues to draw graffiti mystery 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.629
 probably because of their drawings 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:54.219
 the artist can still get 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.759
 person

 one of the rules artist as parents 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:00.979
 says 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.939
 nor draws on dirty walls that's why 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:06.620
 street art masters often 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.009
 it is necessary to resort to banal painters 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:10.879
 work 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:13.849
 By the way, paint such a white system 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.449
 spray paint does not work 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.599
 she shears transparent yes and 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:19.860
 expensive 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.710
 spray cans are different 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.500
 pressure with one niche is smoother 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.620
 paint does not apply after application 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.710
 flows and leaves no stains if 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.159
 pressure drops low paint 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.720
 potekaev but causes himself galliano such 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:39.819
 beauty do specifically for

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:46.919
 by the way departments 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.030
 pao skin our hero frustrated so far 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:51.610
 can't believe yet 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.130
