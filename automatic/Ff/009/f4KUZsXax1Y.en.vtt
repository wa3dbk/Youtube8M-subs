00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
another minecraft video today I have a

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.470 
another minecraft video today I have a
showcase<00:00:04.500> for<00:00:04.770> you<00:00:04.859> for<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.160> blaze<00:00:05.609> farm<00:00:06.000> this

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
showcase for you for a blaze farm this

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.390 
showcase for you for a blaze farm this
is<00:00:06.660> something<00:00:06.990> that<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.200> designed<00:00:07.649> over<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.099> year

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
is something that I designed over a year

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.100 
is something that I designed over a year
and<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.550> half<00:00:08.790> ago<00:00:08.940> maybe<00:00:09.420> even<00:00:09.570> longer<00:00:09.990> than

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
and a half ago maybe even longer than

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.020 
and a half ago maybe even longer than
that<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.650> it<00:00:11.190> had<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.400> little<00:00:11.730> bit<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.940> a

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
that and it had a little bit of a

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.370 
that and it had a little bit of a
problem<00:00:12.240> with<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.599> which<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.929> was<00:00:13.019> unhappy

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
problem with it which I was unhappy

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.350 
problem with it which I was unhappy
about<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.370> for<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.580> longest<00:00:14.849> time<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.240> is

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
about and so for the longest time it is

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.359 
about and so for the longest time it is
sat<00:00:15.570> around<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:16.199> my<00:00:16.590> test<00:00:16.859> world<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.310> I've

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
sat around in my test world and I've

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.070 
sat around in my test world and I've
been<00:00:17.490> undecided<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.270> whether<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.600> should<00:00:18.750> show

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
been undecided on whether I should show

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.900 
been undecided on whether I should show
it<00:00:19.109> or<00:00:19.260> not<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:19.560> today<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:20.039> actually<00:00:20.369> went<00:00:20.760> out

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
it or not but today I actually went out

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.609 
it or not but today I actually went out
there<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.449> managed<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.750> fix<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.260> problem

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
there and I managed to fix the problem

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.349 
there and I managed to fix the problem
with<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:22.980> I'm<00:00:23.130> gonna<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.400> happy<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.150> show

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
with it so I'm gonna be happy to show

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.330 
with it so I'm gonna be happy to show
you<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.630> farm<00:00:24.960> design<00:00:25.350> now<00:00:25.590> now<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.189> might

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
you this farm design now now it might

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.800 
you this farm design now now it might
look<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.760> little<00:00:26.789> bit<00:00:27.119> familiar<00:00:27.420> that's

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
look a little bit familiar that's

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.630 
look a little bit familiar that's
because<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.199> actually<00:00:28.619> been<00:00:28.800> featured<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.429> a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
because it's actually been featured in a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.910 
because it's actually been featured in a
video<00:00:29.970> before<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.420> was<00:00:30.720> my<00:00:30.929> top<00:00:31.230> 5<00:00:31.500> nether

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
video before that was my top 5 nether

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.069 
video before that was my top 5 nether
portal<00:00:32.369> uses<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.969> showed<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.930> could

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
portal uses I showed you that you could

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.950 
portal uses I showed you that you could
use<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.730> portal<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.910> send<00:00:36.149> mobs<00:00:36.390> from<00:00:36.570> than<00:00:36.809> ever

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
use a portal to send mobs from than ever

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.990 
use a portal to send mobs from than ever
into<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.410> overworld<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.219> mob<00:00:38.550> farm<00:00:38.790> which

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
into the overworld for a mob farm which

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.090 
into the overworld for a mob farm which
is<00:00:39.030> exactly<00:00:39.600> how<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:40.290> blaze<00:00:40.559> farm<00:00:40.860> works

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
is exactly how this blaze farm works

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.740 
is exactly how this blaze farm works
right<00:00:41.340> here<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.820> revolves<00:00:42.270> around<00:00:42.450> a

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
right here so it revolves around a

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.630 
right here so it revolves around a
spawner<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.620> idea<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.370> funnel

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
spawner and the idea is that we funnel

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.459 
spawner and the idea is that we funnel
them<00:00:44.910> all<00:00:45.090> down<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> single<00:00:45.780> point<00:00:45.930> where<00:00:46.320> we

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
them all down to a single point where we

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.440 
them all down to a single point where we
push<00:00:46.710> them<00:00:46.950> through<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.700> nether<00:00:47.969> pool<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.329> which

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
push them through a nether pool to which

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.479 
push them through a nether pool to which
at<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.780> moment<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.530> activated<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.340> that

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
at the moment is the activated so that

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.700 
at the moment is the activated so that
would<00:00:50.640> send<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.390> mobs<00:00:51.690> through<00:00:52.020> into<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
would send the mobs through into the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.139 
would send the mobs through into the
overworld<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.520> course<00:00:53.760> we're<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
overworld and of course we're in the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.330 
overworld and of course we're in the
overworld<00:00:54.510> right<00:00:54.750> now<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> spawner

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
overworld right now but the spawner

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.830 
overworld right now but the spawner
would<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.579> naturally<00:00:57.030> found<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.539> nether

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
would be naturally found in the nether

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.299 
would be naturally found in the nether
so<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.109> could<00:00:58.260> build<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.559> farm<00:00:58.800> around<00:00:58.980> it

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
so you could build this farm around it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.430 
so you could build this farm around it
and<00:00:59.460> what<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.239> about<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
and what I like about this one is the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.380 
and what I like about this one is the
funnel<00:01:01.770> concept<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.340> also<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.969> uses

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
funnel concept but also that you uses

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.230 
funnel concept but also that you uses
tripwire<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.220> pistons<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> much<00:01:05.549> easier<00:01:05.939> to

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
tripwire and pistons in a much easier to

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.030 
tripwire and pistons in a much easier to
assemble<00:01:06.780> away<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.619> reason<00:01:07.680> I

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
assemble away so for that reason I

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.219 
assemble away so for that reason I
recall<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.460> via<00:01:08.610> tripwire<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.630> blaze<00:01:09.900> farm

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
recall it via tripwire and blaze farm

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.990 
recall it via tripwire and blaze farm
but<00:01:10.380> anyway<00:01:10.650> we're<00:01:11.070> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> go<00:01:11.369> inside<00:01:11.520> and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
but anyway we're going to go inside and

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.520 
but anyway we're going to go inside and
have<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> look<00:01:12.420> at<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.900> pretty<00:01:13.080> easy<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
have a look at this it's pretty easy to

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.740 
have a look at this it's pretty easy to
understand<00:01:14.040> how<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.310> works<00:01:14.520> above<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.420> row<00:01:15.630> of

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
understand how it works above a row of

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.270 
understand how it works above a row of
Pistons<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.530> one<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.860> have<00:01:17.040> some

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
Pistons like this one we have some

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.789 
Pistons like this one we have some
string<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.450> goes<00:01:18.750> into<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.229> block<00:01:19.590> over

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
string and that goes into a block over

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.649 
string and that goes into a block over
here<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.310> if<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> look<00:01:20.759> at<00:01:20.880> what<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.390> on

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
here so if you have a look at what is on

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.210 
here so if you have a look at what is on
the<00:01:21.810> side<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.259> block<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> redstone

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
the side of the block it is a redstone

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.700 
the side of the block it is a redstone
torch<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:24.090> powers<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> block<00:01:24.869> above<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.320> which

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
torch it powers the block above it which

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.530 
torch it powers the block above it which
is<00:01:25.860> next<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.610> hopper<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.330> going<00:01:27.450> to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
is next to a hopper so it's going to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.390 
is next to a hopper so it's going to
keep<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.930> item<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.409> here<00:01:28.680> now<00:01:29.070> when<00:01:29.250> this

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
keep the item in here now when this

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.520 
keep the item in here now when this
thing<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.790> unpowered<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.479> means<00:01:30.689> something<00:01:31.320> ie

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
thing is unpowered it means something ie

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.109 
thing is unpowered it means something ie
a<00:01:31.680> blaze<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.250> standing<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.700> top<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
a blaze is standing on top of the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.330 
a blaze is standing on top of the
tripwire<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.720> then<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.560> item<00:01:34.920> here<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.159> going

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
tripwire and then the item here is going

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.219 
tripwire and then the item here is going
to<00:01:35.430> travel<00:01:35.700> back<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.060> forth<00:01:36.329> which<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.110> going

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
to travel back and forth which is going

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.170 
to travel back and forth which is going
to<00:01:37.290> activate<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.770> comparator<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.549> then

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
to activate this comparator and then

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.550 
to activate this comparator and then
it's<00:01:39.390> going<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> mean<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:39.960> Pistons<00:01:40.439> will

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
it's going to mean the Pistons will

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.770 
it's going to mean the Pistons will
extend<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.220> retract<00:01:41.759> over<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.540> over<00:01:42.689> again

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
extend and retract over and over again

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.929 
extend and retract over and over again
so<00:01:43.049> let's<00:01:43.320> go<00:01:43.409> into<00:01:43.619> game<00:01:43.829> mode<00:01:43.860> one<00:01:44.280> let's<00:01:44.729> hop

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
so let's go into game mode one let's hop

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.340 
so let's go into game mode one let's hop
down<00:01:45.119> onto<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.869> you'll<00:01:45.960> see<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.200> get

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
down onto here and you'll see we get

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.080 
down onto here and you'll see we get
pushed<00:01:46.530> over<00:01:46.740> very<00:01:47.189> quickly<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.820> efficiently

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
pushed over very quickly and efficiently

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.120 
pushed over very quickly and efficiently
all<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> way<00:01:49.140> down<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> bottom<00:01:49.890> and

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
all the way down to the bottom and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.429 
all the way down to the bottom and
actually<00:01:50.729> no<00:01:51.210> because<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.049> problem

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
actually no because this is the problem

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.560 
actually no because this is the problem
but<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.070> I've<00:01:53.159> now<00:01:53.340> fixed<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.390> let's

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
but I have but I've now fixed so let's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.959 
but I have but I've now fixed so let's
demonstrate<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:55.229> working<00:01:55.710> correctly<00:01:56.130> if<00:01:56.850> I

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
demonstrate that working correctly if I

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.789 
demonstrate that working correctly if I
were<00:01:57.210> right<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.810> edge<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.380> piston

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
were right on the edge of this piston

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.740 
were right on the edge of this piston
and<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.009> fell<00:01:59.219> down<00:01:59.430> then<00:02:00.030> I'd<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:00.270> down<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and I fell down then I'd go down to the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.060 
and I fell down then I'd go down to the
one<00:02:00.869> below<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.320> then<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:01.680> pushed<00:02:01.920> through

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
one below and then I get pushed through

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.889 
one below and then I get pushed through
the<00:02:02.159> portal<00:02:02.549> or<00:02:02.850> at<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> moment<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.540> falling

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
the portal or at the moment just falling

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.929 
the portal or at the moment just falling
into<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.680> void<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.219> saw<00:02:05.430> there<00:02:05.670> what<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
into the void so you saw there what the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.760 
into the void so you saw there what the
problem<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.570> farm<00:02:06.840> was<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.740> is

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
problem with this farm was and it is

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.830 
problem with this farm was and it is
that<00:02:08.129> they<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.520> get<00:02:08.729> kind<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.060> trapped<00:02:09.330> across

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
that they can get kind of trapped across

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.720 
that they can get kind of trapped across
this<00:02:10.020> middle<00:02:10.319> gap<00:02:10.500> going<00:02:10.860> back<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.310> forth<00:02:11.580> so

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
this middle gap going back and forth so

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.010 
this middle gap going back and forth so
what<00:02:11.879> I've<00:02:11.970> done<00:02:12.090> over<00:02:12.300> there<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.629> I've

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
what I've done over there is I've

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.890 
what I've done over there is I've
extended<00:02:13.410> it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
extended it

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.470 
extended it
two<00:02:14.379> wide<00:02:14.590> gaps<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.159> problem<00:02:15.640> no<00:02:16.150> longer

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
two wide gaps to that problem no longer

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.240 
two wide gaps to that problem no longer
happens<00:02:16.870> but<00:02:17.079> that's<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.500> concept<00:02:18.040> in

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
happens but that's the concept in

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.220 
happens but that's the concept in
general<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.970> blazes<00:02:19.420> do<00:02:19.629> take<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.900> little

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
general the blazes do take a little

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.869 
general the blazes do take a little
longer<00:02:20.439> to<00:02:20.709> get<00:02:20.860> down<00:02:21.129> just<00:02:21.430> because<00:02:21.730> they

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
longer to get down just because they

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.270 
longer to get down just because they
don't<00:02:22.060> fall<00:02:22.420> as<00:02:22.540> quickly<00:02:22.780> as<00:02:23.049> a<00:02:23.079> player<00:02:23.500> but

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
don't fall as quickly as a player but

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.920 
don't fall as quickly as a player but
it's<00:02:24.459> a<00:02:24.549> pretty<00:02:24.760> cool<00:02:24.970> design<00:02:25.150> very<00:02:25.540> easy<00:02:25.720> to

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
it's a pretty cool design very easy to

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.170 
it's a pretty cool design very easy to
construct<00:02:26.079> and<00:02:26.530> yeah<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.579> blazes<00:02:27.939> are<00:02:28.060> going

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
construct and yeah the blazes are going

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.780 
construct and yeah the blazes are going
to<00:02:28.269> be<00:02:28.530> easily<00:02:29.530> pushed<00:02:29.860> into<00:02:30.129> the<00:02:30.400> port<00:02:30.579> at<00:02:30.760> the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
to be easily pushed into the port at the

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.880 
to be easily pushed into the port at the
bottom<00:02:31.109> provided<00:02:32.109> that<00:02:32.260> you<00:02:32.319> build<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.650> fixed

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
bottom provided that you build the fixed

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.720 
bottom provided that you build the fixed
one<00:02:33.069> not<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.370> one

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
one not this one

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.819 
one not this one
but<00:02:34.390> anyway<00:02:34.689> let's<00:02:34.870> talk<00:02:35.049> about<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.439> spawner

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
but anyway let's talk about the spawner

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.000 
but anyway let's talk about the spawner
at<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.010> top<00:02:36.189> here<00:02:36.459> so<00:02:37.390> in<00:02:37.629> 1.7<00:02:38.409> these<00:02:38.560> had<00:02:38.829> an

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
at the top here so in 1.7 these had an

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.860 
at the top here so in 1.7 these had an
area<00:02:39.370> around<00:02:39.579> them<00:02:39.790> which<00:02:39.939> was<00:02:40.120> 8<00:02:40.329> by<00:02:40.540> 8<00:02:40.569> that

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
area around them which was 8 by 8 that

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.080 
area around them which was 8 by 8 that
means<00:02:40.930> four<00:02:41.379> blocks<00:02:41.620> in<00:02:41.829> two<00:02:41.980> directions<00:02:42.099> free

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
means four blocks in two directions free

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.849 
means four blocks in two directions free
in<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.359> other<00:02:43.540> where<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.989> blazes<00:02:44.349> can<00:02:44.560> spawn

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
in the other where the blazes can spawn

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.160 
in the other where the blazes can spawn
this<00:02:45.159> has<00:02:45.430> been<00:02:45.730> changed<00:02:46.180> in<00:02:46.329> 1.8<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:46.959> can

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
this has been changed in 1.8 I can

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.530 
this has been changed in 1.8 I can
confirm<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.310> now<00:02:48.519> a<00:02:48.549> nine<00:02:49.000> by<00:02:49.329> nine

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
confirm that it is now a nine by nine

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.940 
confirm that it is now a nine by nine
area<00:02:49.989> if<00:02:50.109> you<00:02:50.230> would<00:02:50.319> like<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.650> know<00:02:50.769> more

about<00:02:51.010> how<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:51.549> been<00:02:51.730> changed<00:02:52.120> look<00:02:52.599> in<00:02:52.750> the

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
about how it's been changed look in the

covering<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:55.269> all<00:02:55.659> the<00:02:55.840> details<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.440> showing

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
covering and all the details and showing

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.289 
covering and all the details and showing
you<00:02:56.799> a<00:02:56.829> test<00:02:57.159> of<00:02:57.370> how<00:02:57.489> that's<00:02:57.700> changed<00:02:58.090> but<00:02:58.180> it

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
you a test of how that's changed but it

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.789 
you a test of how that's changed but it
now<00:02:58.420> means<00:02:58.659> that<00:02:58.810> it's<00:02:58.959> four<00:02:59.200> blocks<00:02:59.349> in<00:02:59.650> every

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
now means that it's four blocks in every

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.849 
now means that it's four blocks in every
direction<00:02:59.950> that<00:03:00.489> blazes<00:03:00.909> will<00:03:01.060> spawn<00:03:01.420> and

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
direction that blazes will spawn and

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.110 
direction that blazes will spawn and
this<00:03:02.859> farm<00:03:03.069> is<00:03:03.220> actually<00:03:03.549> designed<00:03:03.819> with<00:03:04.060> a

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
this farm is actually designed with a

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.390 
this farm is actually designed with a
nine<00:03:04.269> by<00:03:04.450> nine<00:03:04.659> area<00:03:05.019> for<00:03:05.230> convenience<00:03:05.709> so<00:03:06.010> we

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
nine by nine area for convenience so we

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.890 
nine by nine area for convenience so we
don't<00:03:06.609> need<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.760> worry<00:03:07.030> about<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.480> but<00:03:07.659> if<00:03:07.780> we

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
don't need to worry about that but if we

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.509 
don't need to worry about that but if we
go<00:03:08.049> over<00:03:08.079> to<00:03:08.409> this<00:03:08.590> area<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.129> can<00:03:09.310> see<00:03:09.489> that

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
go over to this area you can see that

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.179 
go over to this area you can see that
the<00:03:09.790> area<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.629> slightly<00:03:10.840> longer<00:03:11.260> on<00:03:11.650> one<00:03:11.889> side

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 
the area is slightly longer on one side

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.009 
the area is slightly longer on one side
so<00:03:12.400> maybe<00:03:12.549> blazes<00:03:13.090> won't<00:03:13.269> actually<00:03:13.629> ever<00:03:13.750> fall

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
so maybe blazes won't actually ever fall

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.710 
so maybe blazes won't actually ever fall
down<00:03:14.560> on<00:03:14.709> top<00:03:14.920> of<00:03:15.069> this<00:03:15.189> one<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.670> but<00:03:16.480> there

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
down on top of this one and but there

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.000 
down on top of this one and but there
you<00:03:16.870> go<00:03:17.049> you<00:03:17.109> know<00:03:17.379> you<00:03:17.439> can<00:03:17.590> modify<00:03:17.859> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
you go you know you can modify the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.800 
you go you know you can modify the
design<00:03:18.430> slightly<00:03:18.940> if<00:03:19.030> that<00:03:19.180> was<00:03:19.299> a<00:03:19.329> concern

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
design slightly if that was a concern

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.449 
design slightly if that was a concern
but<00:03:20.199> down<00:03:20.440> at<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.680> bottom<00:03:20.829> you<00:03:21.160> can<00:03:21.190> see<00:03:21.310> the

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
but down at the bottom you can see the

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.099 
but down at the bottom you can see the
problems<00:03:21.910> have<00:03:22.030> been<00:03:22.120> fixed<00:03:22.180> because<00:03:22.660> we<00:03:22.900> have

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
problems have been fixed because we have

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.650 
problems have been fixed because we have
this<00:03:23.319> two<00:03:23.709> wide<00:03:24.129> gap<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:25.359> to<00:03:25.419> achieve

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
this two wide gap and so to achieve

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.069 
this two wide gap and so to achieve
pushing<00:03:26.379> the<00:03:27.010> slimes<00:03:27.459> or<00:03:27.849> sorry<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.389> blazes

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
pushing the slimes or sorry the blazes

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.539 
pushing the slimes or sorry the blazes
all<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.349> way<00:03:29.440> across<00:03:29.650> we<00:03:29.919> have<00:03:29.949> some<00:03:30.280> slime

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
all the way across we have some slime

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.180 
all the way across we have some slime
blocks<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:31.419> if<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.659> go<00:03:32.139> into<00:03:32.260> game<00:03:32.560> mode<00:03:32.590> one<00:03:32.980> and

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
blocks so if I go into game mode one and

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.490 
blocks so if I go into game mode one and
fall<00:03:33.639> down<00:03:33.750> then<00:03:34.750> you<00:03:34.810> can<00:03:34.930> see<00:03:35.049> I<00:03:35.079> get<00:03:35.290> pushed

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
fall down then you can see I get pushed

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.170 
fall down then you can see I get pushed
all<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.980> way<00:03:36.069> across<00:03:36.280> like<00:03:36.639> that<00:03:36.669> so<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.150> way

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
all the way across like that so the way

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.819 
all the way across like that so the way
this<00:03:37.389> works<00:03:37.659> is<00:03:37.810> we<00:03:37.989> have<00:03:38.019> two<00:03:38.560> rows<00:03:38.769> of

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
this works is we have two rows of

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.369 
this works is we have two rows of
tripwire<00:03:39.459> they're<00:03:40.030> going<00:03:40.239> to<00:03:40.299> go<00:03:40.599> empower

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
tripwire they're going to go empower

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.649 
tripwire they're going to go empower
these<00:03:41.849> redstone<00:03:42.849> right<00:03:43.030> here<00:03:43.239> which<00:03:43.359> point

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
these redstone right here which point

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.539 
these redstone right here which point
into<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.959> side<00:03:44.169> of<00:03:44.199> a<00:03:44.470> block<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:44.889> that's<00:03:45.400> got

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
into the side of a block and that's got

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.550 
into the side of a block and that's got
a<00:03:45.579> torch<00:03:45.879> which<00:03:46.120> is<00:03:46.239> currently<00:03:46.659> locking<00:03:47.260> this

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
a torch which is currently locking this

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.589 
a torch which is currently locking this
clock<00:03:47.889> right<00:03:48.099> here<00:03:48.159> so<00:03:48.909> this<00:03:49.060> clock<00:03:49.359> will

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
clock right here so this clock will

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.599 
clock right here so this clock will
continually<00:03:50.199> activate<00:03:50.829> a<00:03:50.859> double<00:03:51.280> piston

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
continually activate a double piston

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.550 
continually activate a double piston
extender<00:03:52.000> this<00:03:52.239> is<00:03:52.389> it<00:03:52.510> right<00:03:52.690> here<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.049> that

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
extender this is it right here and that

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.110 
extender this is it right here and that
can<00:03:53.680> retract<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.190> slime<00:03:54.459> blocks<00:03:54.729> all<00:03:54.909> the<00:03:55.030> way

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
can retract the slime blocks all the way

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.509 
can retract the slime blocks all the way
across<00:03:55.419> the<00:03:55.659> two<00:03:55.810> blocks<00:03:56.109> and<00:03:56.290> back<00:03:56.979> again<00:03:57.340> so

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
across the two blocks and back again so

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.159 
across the two blocks and back again so
if<00:03:57.579> anything<00:03:57.819> standing<00:03:58.359> on<00:03:58.479> here<00:03:58.690> it's<00:03:59.019> going

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
if anything standing on here it's going

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.199 
if anything standing on here it's going
to<00:03:59.229> get<00:03:59.290> pushed<00:03:59.560> into<00:03:59.799> the<00:03:59.979> portal<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:01.000> that's

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
to get pushed into the portal and that's

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.849 
to get pushed into the portal and that's
how<00:04:01.359> it<00:04:01.449> works<00:04:01.599> so<00:04:02.019> I<00:04:02.049> think<00:04:02.139> it's<00:04:02.379> about<00:04:02.560> time

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
how it works so I think it's about time

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.819 
how it works so I think it's about time
we<00:04:03.069> did<00:04:03.099> a<00:04:03.280> demonstration<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:05.440> one<00:04:05.590> on<00:04:05.739> the

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
we did a demonstration the one on the

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.920 
we did a demonstration the one on the
left<00:04:06.010> is<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.400> original<00:04:07.030> design<00:04:07.329> and<00:04:07.599> the<00:04:07.750> one

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
left is the original design and the one

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.420 
left is the original design and the one
on<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.229> right<00:04:08.409> is<00:04:08.530> our<00:04:08.680> new<00:04:08.859> and<00:04:08.979> improved<00:04:09.040> one

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
on the right is our new and improved one

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.099 
on the right is our new and improved one
so<00:04:09.639> we<00:04:09.760> can<00:04:09.879> see<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.269> difference<00:04:10.599> between<00:04:10.750> the

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
so we can see the difference between the

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.629 
so we can see the difference between the
two<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.620> while<00:04:11.859> that's<00:04:11.949> playing<00:04:12.220> away<00:04:12.459> I<00:04:12.489> do

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
two and while that's playing away I do

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:13.920 
two and while that's playing away I do
want<00:04:12.849> to<00:04:12.879> talk<00:04:13.030> to<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.239> about<00:04:13.359> a<00:04:13.479> couple<00:04:13.840> of

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
want to talk to you about a couple of

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.750 
want to talk to you about a couple of
things<00:04:14.079> so<00:04:14.680> first<00:04:14.859> of<00:04:15.069> all<00:04:15.129> this<00:04:15.280> does<00:04:15.519> use<00:04:15.729> a

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
things so first of all this does use a

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.490 
things so first of all this does use a
portal<00:04:16.299> one<00:04:16.449> of<00:04:16.539> the<00:04:16.630> cool<00:04:16.780> things<00:04:16.810> about<00:04:17.139> this

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
portal one of the cool things about this

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.080 
portal one of the cool things about this
is<00:04:17.769> wherever<00:04:17.979> it<00:04:18.220> goes<00:04:18.370> through<00:04:18.579> the<00:04:18.699> portal

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
is wherever it goes through the portal

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.729 
is wherever it goes through the portal
on<00:04:19.209> this<00:04:19.419> side<00:04:19.690> it's<00:04:20.139> going<00:04:20.289> to<00:04:20.349> come<00:04:20.470> out<00:04:20.500> in

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
on this side it's going to come out in

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.860 
on this side it's going to come out in
the<00:04:20.829> same<00:04:21.010> spot<00:04:21.430> on<00:04:21.579> the<00:04:21.669> other<00:04:22.240> side<00:04:22.659> which

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
the same spot on the other side which

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.540 
the same spot on the other side which
makes<00:04:23.080> it<00:04:23.320> nice<00:04:23.529> and<00:04:23.560> easy<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.979> get<00:04:24.190> them<00:04:24.370> into

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
makes it nice and easy to get them into

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.459 
makes it nice and easy to get them into
a<00:04:24.580> single<00:04:24.820> place<00:04:25.150> to<00:04:25.479> crush<00:04:25.719> them<00:04:25.960> or<00:04:26.139> farm

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:26.469 
a single place to crush them or farm

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:27.960 
a single place to crush them or farm
them<00:04:26.650> however<00:04:27.190> you<00:04:27.490> want<00:04:27.520> to<00:04:27.729> do

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
them however you want to do

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.790 
them however you want to do
that<00:04:28.120> as<00:04:28.300> well<00:04:28.750> as<00:04:28.870> this<00:04:29.020> I<00:04:29.230> also<00:04:29.380> think<00:04:29.710> you

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
that as well as this I also think you

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.440 
that as well as this I also think you
could<00:04:29.950> probably<00:04:30.130> build<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.700> funnel<00:04:31.030> part<00:04:31.270> of

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
could probably build the funnel part of

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.420 
could probably build the funnel part of
this<00:04:31.600> farm<00:04:31.900> higher<00:04:32.200> up<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.890> was<00:04:33.010> originally

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
this farm higher up it was originally

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.460 
this farm higher up it was originally
built<00:04:33.610> suitors<00:04:34.000> outside<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:34.630> escape<00:04:34.960> area<00:04:35.350> of

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
built suitors outside the escape area of

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.500 
built suitors outside the escape area of
the<00:04:35.560> spawner<00:04:35.890> but<00:04:36.130> it<00:04:36.220> spawns<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.850> blaze<00:04:37.300> is

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
the spawner but it spawns the blaze is

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.480 
the spawner but it spawns the blaze is
so<00:04:37.720> slow<00:04:38.050> it<00:04:38.170> almost<00:04:38.440> seems<00:04:38.710> like<00:04:38.800> a<00:04:38.920> good<00:04:39.160> idea

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
so slow it almost seems like a good idea

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.010 
so slow it almost seems like a good idea
just<00:04:39.670> to<00:04:40.030> have<00:04:40.180> it<00:04:40.270> lower<00:04:40.450> down<00:04:40.660> so<00:04:40.840> you<00:04:40.930> can

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
just to have it lower down so you can

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.690 
just to have it lower down so you can
get<00:04:41.140> the<00:04:41.230> blazes<00:04:41.620> into<00:04:41.950> that<00:04:42.070> nether<00:04:42.310> portal

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
get the blazes into that nether portal

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.790 
get the blazes into that nether portal
quicker<00:04:42.940> there's<00:04:43.600> also<00:04:43.720> no<00:04:44.080> on<00:04:44.290> or<00:04:44.470> off<00:04:44.620> switch

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
quicker there's also no on or off switch

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.560 
quicker there's also no on or off switch
that<00:04:45.130> seems<00:04:45.460> kind<00:04:45.760> of<00:04:45.850> pointless<00:04:46.000> since<00:04:46.450> you

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
that seems kind of pointless since you

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.780 
that seems kind of pointless since you
could<00:04:46.750> just<00:04:46.930> use<00:04:47.140> and<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.830> player<00:04:48.070> proximity

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
could just use and the player proximity

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.790 
could just use and the player proximity
to<00:04:48.940> turn<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.270> spawner<00:04:49.570> off<00:04:49.810> and<00:04:50.080> adding<00:04:50.650> in

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
to turn the spawner off and adding in

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.260 
to turn the spawner off and adding in
larvae<00:04:51.190> and<00:04:51.280> all<00:04:51.400> sorts<00:04:51.640> of<00:04:51.700> things<00:04:51.760> like<00:04:51.970> that

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
larvae and all sorts of things like that

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.810 
larvae and all sorts of things like that
will<00:04:52.750> make<00:04:52.930> this<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.290> lot<00:04:53.650> more<00:04:53.830> complicated<00:04:54.160> as

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
will make this a lot more complicated as

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.400 
will make this a lot more complicated as
well<00:04:55.060> as<00:04:55.150> that<00:04:55.270> I<00:04:55.330> think<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.690> thing<00:04:55.840> itself<00:04:56.230> is

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
well as that I think the thing itself is

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.530 
well as that I think the thing itself is
fairly<00:04:56.680> cheap<00:04:56.830> to<00:04:57.220> build<00:04:57.400> I<00:04:57.580> mean<00:04:57.730> it<00:04:57.820> uses<00:04:58.120> 18

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
fairly cheap to build I mean it uses 18

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.840 
fairly cheap to build I mean it uses 18
hoppers<00:04:58.990> 81<00:04:59.650> Pistons<00:05:00.130> that<00:05:00.220> might<00:05:00.490> sound<00:05:00.700> like

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
hoppers 81 Pistons that might sound like

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.520 
hoppers 81 Pistons that might sound like
a<00:05:00.970> lot<00:05:01.240> but<00:05:01.270> not<00:05:01.570> really<00:05:01.900> if<00:05:02.050> you're

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
a lot but not really if you're

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.960 
a lot but not really if you're
established<00:05:03.130> on<00:05:03.280> a<00:05:03.310> server<00:05:03.640> and<00:05:03.730> if<00:05:03.880> you've

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
established on a server and if you've

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.600 
established on a server and if you've
got<00:05:04.060> a<00:05:04.090> string<00:05:04.390> farm<00:05:04.660> only<00:05:04.900> uses<00:05:05.320> 81<00:05:06.250> string

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
got a string farm only uses 81 string

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.640 
got a string farm only uses 81 string
also<00:05:07.240> 9<00:05:07.450> slime<00:05:07.810> blocks<00:05:08.050> and<00:05:08.230> around<00:05:08.410> 30

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
also 9 slime blocks and around 30

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.470 
also 9 slime blocks and around 30
obsidian<00:05:09.220> so<00:05:09.400> if<00:05:09.550> a<00:05:09.610> little<00:05:09.880> bit<00:05:09.970> of<00:05:10.090> mining<00:05:10.390> in

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
obsidian so if a little bit of mining in

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.150 
obsidian so if a little bit of mining in
preparation<00:05:11.110> you<00:05:11.530> could<00:05:11.710> probably<00:05:11.920> build

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
preparation you could probably build

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.180 
preparation you could probably build
this<00:05:12.370> early<00:05:12.790> on<00:05:12.940> in<00:05:13.150> your<00:05:13.180> game<00:05:13.800> so<00:05:14.800> that<00:05:15.010> is

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
this early on in your game so that is

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.040 
this early on in your game so that is
the<00:05:15.400> blaze<00:05:15.610> farm<00:05:15.970> and<00:05:16.210> a<00:05:16.390> mayor<00:05:16.600> missed<00:05:16.870> out

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
the blaze farm and a mayor missed out

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.140 
the blaze farm and a mayor missed out
one<00:05:17.290> or<00:05:17.410> two<00:05:17.440> and<00:05:17.830> minor<00:05:18.070> details<00:05:18.580> but<00:05:18.880> I<00:05:18.940> think

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
one or two and minor details but I think

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.520 
one or two and minor details but I think
I<00:05:19.240> covered<00:05:19.570> the<00:05:19.660> bulk<00:05:19.900> of<00:05:20.050> what<00:05:20.140> there<00:05:20.290> is<00:05:20.380> to

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
I covered the bulk of what there is to

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.140 
I covered the bulk of what there is to
know<00:05:20.650> about<00:05:20.680> this<00:05:21.100> farm<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:21.550> I<00:05:21.880> cannot

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
know about this farm and I cannot

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.550 
know about this farm and I cannot
believe<00:05:22.480> how<00:05:22.690> long<00:05:22.870> it<00:05:22.990> took<00:05:23.140> me<00:05:23.200> to<00:05:23.440> get

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
believe how long it took me to get

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.960 
believe how long it took me to get
around<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:23.950> showing<00:05:24.190> you<00:05:24.280> this<00:05:24.520> but<00:05:24.700> it's<00:05:24.790> been

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
around to showing you this but it's been

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.540 
around to showing you this but it's been
fixed<00:05:25.210> and<00:05:25.510> it<00:05:26.050> is<00:05:26.140> pretty<00:05:26.410> awesome<00:05:26.919> I<00:05:27.100> do<00:05:27.160> like

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
fixed and it is pretty awesome I do like

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.770 
fixed and it is pretty awesome I do like
it<00:05:27.760> so<00:05:27.880> let<00:05:28.030> me<00:05:28.120> know<00:05:28.210> what<00:05:28.300> you<00:05:28.390> think<00:05:28.570> of<00:05:28.630> it

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
it so let me know what you think of it

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.510 
it so let me know what you think of it
down<00:05:29.200> there<00:05:29.470> in<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:29.770> comment<00:05:30.070> box<00:05:30.190> and<00:05:30.460> of
