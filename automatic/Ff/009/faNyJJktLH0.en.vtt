 hello I am ernesto of the web of technology 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.540
 without a cap and these are the reasons that 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.919
 they make the samsung galaxy tablet s two 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.919
 of the best Android tablets 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.050
 samsung wants to convince us to boot 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.520
 with its super amoled screens that to 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.500
 difference of LEDs do not have to 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.660
 sacrifice intensity in their colors 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.669
 by relying on back lighting but 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.590
 that it is their pixels that generate light 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.539
 own and control the tones by their 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.099
 account something that in practice achieves 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.559
 vibrant images and a level of 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.650
 Contrast his deep well 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.170
 resolution qhd which is 4 times hd and 2 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.000
 Sometimes it's full HD makes watching videos in 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.010
 they are a very good experience 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.910
 and that the texts are clear and 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.910
 always defined 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.750
 but what would be of these advantages if not 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.250
 we could take them everywhere 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.730
 happily the galaxies that come 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.730
 versions of 8.4 and 10.5 inches have 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.500
 something in common are very thin in fact 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.140
 both are six millimeters thick 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.120
 little less a pencil of number two and the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.440
 be quite light they are very easy to 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.440
 transport and hold it 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.060
 the galaxies are sometimes perfect for 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.130
 take to the university not to advance something 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.869
 of work works very well if they are 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.250
 also adds a bluetooth keyboard 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.409
 there is the option to run two 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.210
 apps at the same time and android 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.619
 offers a great selection of apps for 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.619
 that we are more productive 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.660
 but not everything is work thanks to their 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.970
 processors choose their 3 gigas of ram 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.340
 and his chip adreno 330 for graphics 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.260
 the calcite sometimes are not seen before the rigor 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.270
 of the most demanding 3d game 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.160
 for further information about galaxies 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.640
 times and how to acquire them do not hesitate 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.990
 enter replay point com.py is it 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.460
 you in technology can 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.460
