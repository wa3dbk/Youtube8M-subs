you can get kind of around the house I

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.510 
you can get kind of around the house I
figured<00:00:34.380> out<00:00:34.500> how<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.620> make<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.920> work<00:00:35.160> really

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
figured out how to make it work really

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.700 
figured out how to make it work really
well<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:36.630> really<00:00:36.960> strong<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.500> almost

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
well it's really strong it's almost

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.850 
well it's really strong it's almost
epoxy<00:00:38.340> strong<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.540> very<00:00:39.840> very<00:00:40.200> easy<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
epoxy strong and it's very very easy to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.700 
epoxy strong and it's very very easy to
use<00:00:41.570> it<00:00:42.570> comes<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:42.960> these<00:00:43.050> little<00:00:43.350> packages

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
use it comes in these little packages

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.029 
use it comes in these little packages
there's<00:00:44.190> two<00:00:44.550> little<00:00:44.850> cubes<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.329> each<00:00:45.510> package

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
there's two little cubes in each package

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.580 
there's two little cubes in each package
there's<00:00:47.039> about<00:00:47.309> 20<00:00:47.850> grams<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.390> glue<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.170> each

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
there's about 20 grams of glue in each

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.680 
there's about 20 grams of glue in each
of<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> two<00:00:50.039> cubes<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> book<00:00:50.850> they<00:00:51.510> add<00:00:51.660> up

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
of the two cubes so the book they add up

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.060 
of the two cubes so the book they add up
to<00:00:51.840> about<00:00:52.469> 40<00:00:52.890> grams<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:53.940> together<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:55.070> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
to about 40 grams all together and it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.770 
to about 40 grams all together and it
melts<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.579> about<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> hundred<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.510> eighty

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
melts at about a hundred and eighty

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.700 
melts at about a hundred and eighty
degrees

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.110 
of my knife blade my Flint knife blade
okay<00:02:47.389> and<00:02:47.660> then<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:48.470> simply<00:02:49.010> slide<00:02:49.940> them

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
okay and then I simply slide them

okay and then I simply slide them
together<00:02:51.190> like<00:02:52.190> that

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.330 

and<00:02:55.540> I'm<00:02:55.990> gonna<00:02:56.200> use<00:02:56.410> this<00:02:56.650> applicator<00:02:57.160> stick

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
and I'm gonna use this applicator stick

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.180 
and I'm gonna use this applicator stick
and<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:58.120> dip<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.690> little<00:02:58.810> bit<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.440> glue<00:02:59.710> on<00:02:59.740> there

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
and I dip a little bit of glue on there

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.770 
and I dip a little bit of glue on there
what<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.270> drips<00:03:01.540> fall<00:03:01.780> in<00:03:01.960> the<00:03:02.110> pot<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.940> I'm

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
what the drips fall in the pot and I'm

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.940 
what the drips fall in the pot and I'm
gonna<00:03:04.900> just<00:03:05.560> sort<00:03:05.800> of<00:03:05.890> weld<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.990> that<00:03:07.990> point

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
gonna just sort of weld that that point

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.600 
gonna just sort of weld that that point
on<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.400> stick<00:03:09.790> just<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:11.440> little<00:03:11.770> drip<00:03:12.460> at

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
on to the stick just that little drip at

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.200 
on to the stick just that little drip at
a<00:03:12.670> time<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:13.740> guess<00:03:14.740> it's<00:03:15.370> called<00:03:15.670> a<00:03:15.820> fill<00:03:16.060> it

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
a time I guess it's called a fill it

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.110 
a time I guess it's called a fill it
when<00:03:16.390> you<00:03:16.420> fill<00:03:16.960> the<00:03:16.990> space<00:03:17.410> between<00:03:18.120> the

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
when you fill the space between the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.610 
when you fill the space between the
blade<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.690> handle<00:03:21.630> if<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:22.900> screw<00:03:23.200> up<00:03:23.410> but

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
blade and the handle if you screw up but

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.560 
blade and the handle if you screw up but
you<00:03:24.010> can<00:03:24.190> heat<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.790> take<00:03:25.000> it<00:03:25.030> off<00:03:25.300> and

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
you can heat it and take it off and

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.620 
you can heat it and take it off and
start<00:03:25.840> all<00:03:25.960> over<00:03:26.020> again<00:03:26.940> no<00:03:27.940> problem

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
start all over again no problem

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.770 
start all over again no problem
no<00:03:28.840> stress<00:03:29.260> get<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.190> on<00:03:30.340> there<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:34.180> that<00:03:34.420> this

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
no stress get it on there so that this

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.080 
no stress get it on there so that this
part<00:03:35.080> here<00:03:35.140> is<00:03:35.530> kind<00:03:36.010> of<00:03:36.070> interesting<00:03:36.310> I'm

it's in a plastic stage right now it's

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.040 
it's in a plastic stage right now it's
not<00:04:08.680> liquid<00:04:09.010> but<00:04:09.250> it's<00:04:10.060> not<00:04:10.269> solid<00:04:10.540> yet<00:04:10.870> either

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
can you can bend the at this point you

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.480 
can you can bend the at this point you
could<00:04:22.090> bend<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.710> knife<00:04:23.710> blade<00:04:23.979> back<00:04:24.250> and

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
could bend the knife blade back and

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.719 
could bend the knife blade back and
forth<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:25.470> get<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.740> where<00:04:26.890> you<00:04:27.040> want<00:04:27.280> it<00:04:27.430> so

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.440 

this<00:04:32.620> stuff<00:04:32.889> hardens<00:04:33.250> up<00:04:33.370> to<00:04:33.550> almost<00:04:33.700> epoxy

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
this stuff hardens up to almost epoxy

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.170 
this stuff hardens up to almost epoxy
hard<00:04:35.070> they'll<00:04:36.070> be<00:04:36.220> on<00:04:36.370> there<00:04:36.610> really<00:04:36.820> tightly

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
hard they'll be on there really tightly

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.870 
hard they'll be on there really tightly
when<00:04:37.600> I'm<00:04:37.720> done

in this joint
and<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:45.070> other<00:04:45.190> thing<00:04:45.400> I'm<00:04:45.520> going<00:04:45.580> to<00:04:45.730> do<00:04:45.880> is

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
and the other thing I'm going to do is

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.610 
and the other thing I'm going to do is
I'm<00:04:46.389> going<00:04:46.450> to<00:04:46.600> put<00:04:46.750> a<00:04:46.780> little<00:04:47.050> bit<00:04:47.169> of<00:04:47.290> glue<00:04:47.590> on

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
I'm going to put a little bit of glue on

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.850 
I'm going to put a little bit of glue on
on<00:04:48.130> the<00:04:48.310> butt<00:04:48.490> end<00:04:48.730> of<00:04:48.820> it<00:04:49.030> and<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:50.440> reason<00:04:50.770> I

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
on the butt end of it and the reason I

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.510 
on the butt end of it and the reason I
do<00:04:50.919> that<00:04:51.270> usually<00:04:52.270> is<00:04:53.110> so<00:04:54.070> that<00:04:54.220> you<00:04:54.310> have<00:04:54.490> a

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
do that usually is so that you have a

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.690 
do that usually is so that you have a
