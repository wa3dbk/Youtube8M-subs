00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.060
 the description of the video because the 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.280
 truth is that it 's worth putting the 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.320
 contact lenses we start by applying a background 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.619
 of clear makeup on the whole face 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.810
 to get that essence daenerys and with 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.030
 a background of darker makeup 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.159
 in my case he sought to create the feeling of 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.440
 more rounded cheeks one 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.330
 chin also round and with the 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.460
 somewhat sunken center 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.830
 a little the sides of the nose with 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.470
 brown shadow drawing some straight eyebrows 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.420
 at the beginning 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.700
 with the same brown shadow for the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.740
 slits and a beige for the volumes 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.990
 You can modify the face as per 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.240
 example trying to create a flat nose 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.000
 of somewhat wide fins and more holes 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.850
 exposed eyes framed in brown 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.990
 beige tile under the tear a bit 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.659
 torn 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.610
 with a pink lipstick drawing a few lips 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.310
 thick we will accentuate the volume 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.290
 applying garnet at the corners of the 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.689
 part inside and in the center of 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.939
 lips and white in those areas that more 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.950
 excel we continue with the shadows 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.869
 giving the last details near the 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.119
 mouth reinforcing what we had 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.479
 flipped with makeup backgrounds in 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.150
 a principle implying a roundness of 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.959
 the cheek on the inside a little 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.160
 of dark circles pink blush wig guarrate a 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.160
