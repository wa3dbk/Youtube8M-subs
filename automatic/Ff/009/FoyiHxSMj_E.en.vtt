Street<00:01:50.159> mostly<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:50.909> long<00:01:51.060> range<00:01:51.329> gunfights

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
Street mostly for long range gunfights

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.289 
Street mostly for long range gunfights
but<00:01:52.829> with<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.939> get<00:01:54.030> up<00:01:54.119> close

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
but with this I like to get up close

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.600 
but with this I like to get up close
sometimes<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.229> no<00:01:55.380> strafing<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.340> helps

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
sometimes and no strafing really helps

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.760 
sometimes and no strafing really helps
up<00:01:56.759> close<00:01:57.000> especially<00:01:57.240> with<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.810> souls<00:01:58.079> so

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
up close especially with the souls so

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.990 
up close especially with the souls so
otherwise<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.219> really<00:01:59.610> slow<00:01:59.820> with

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
otherwise you just really slow with

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.780 
otherwise you just really slow with
assault<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:01.380> fourth<00:02:01.950> one<00:02:02.189> which<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.460> haven't

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
assault the fourth one which I haven't

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.179 
assault the fourth one which I haven't
unlocked<00:02:03.119> yet<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.229> know<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.619> an<00:02:04.740> absolute

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
unlocked yet but I know it's an absolute

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.709 
unlocked yet but I know it's an absolute
beast<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.149> thought<00:02:06.299> I'd<00:02:06.360> tell<00:02:06.450> you

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
beast so I just thought I'd tell you

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.389 
beast so I just thought I'd tell you
anyways<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.409> case<00:02:07.829> you're<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.009> try<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.250> as<00:02:08.369> a

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
anyways in case you're on try it as a

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.430 
anyways in case you're on try it as a
class<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.420> mp7

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
class is the mp7

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.840 
class is the mp7
basically<00:02:12.440> it's<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.770> best<00:02:13.130> submachine<00:02:13.670> gun

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
basically it's the best submachine gun

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.840 
basically it's the best submachine gun
it<00:02:13.940> has<00:02:14.060> 40<00:02:14.510> rounds<00:02:14.720> in<00:02:15.020> a<00:02:15.110> mug<00:02:15.410> without<00:02:15.980> having

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
it has 40 rounds in a mug without having

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.910 
it has 40 rounds in a mug without having
extended<00:02:17.270> mags<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:17.840> I'd<00:02:17.959> recommend<00:02:18.410> using<00:02:18.740> it

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
extended mags and I'd recommend using it

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.650 
extended mags and I'd recommend using it
we've<00:02:19.040> saved<00:02:19.220> range<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.970> silence<00:02:20.450> or

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
we've saved range and silence or

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.140 
we've saved range and silence or
something<00:02:21.080> or<00:02:21.170> range<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:22.000> extended<00:02:23.000> mags

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
something or range and extended mags

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.800 
something or range and extended mags
because<00:02:23.420> with<00:02:23.569> extended<00:02:24.020> mags<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:24.290> has<00:02:24.380> 60

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
because with extended mags it has 60

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.660 
because with extended mags it has 60
rounds<00:02:26.810> in<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:26.959> mag<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.410> I'd<00:02:28.010> also<00:02:28.160> used<00:02:28.489> that

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
rounds in the mag and I'd also used that

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.860 
rounds in the mag and I'd also used that
with<00:02:28.790> steady<00:02:29.090> aim<00:02:29.270> instead<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.660> stock

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
with steady aim instead of stock

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.210 
with steady aim instead of stock
approaches<00:02:30.350> could<00:02:30.530> base<00:02:30.650> because<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.040> don't

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
approaches could base because you don't

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.660 
approaches could base because you don't
need<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.450> star<00:02:32.450> compro<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:32.930> submachine<00:02:33.200> guns

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
need a star compro and submachine guns

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.880 
need a star compro and submachine guns
so<00:02:34.670> yeah<00:02:35.060> I'm<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.480> final<00:02:36.050> class<00:02:36.230> is<00:02:36.500> because

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
so yeah I'm the final class is because

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.830 
so yeah I'm the final class is because
it<00:02:37.040> just<00:02:37.250> recently<00:02:37.819> got<00:02:37.910> an<00:02:38.150> update<00:02:38.300> I'm<00:02:38.660> not

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
it just recently got an update I'm not

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.059 
it just recently got an update I'm not
tried<00:02:39.050> out<00:02:39.260> yeah<00:02:39.410> but<00:02:39.560> I've<00:02:39.620> seen<00:02:39.739> a<00:02:39.800> lot<00:02:39.920> of

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
tried out yeah but I've seen a lot of

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.309 
tried out yeah but I've seen a lot of
videos<00:02:40.400> so<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.239> could<00:02:41.390> try<00:02:41.630> out<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:42.020> spaz

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
videos so you could try out the spaz

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.229 
videos so you could try out the spaz
with<00:02:42.530> kick<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.130> range<00:02:43.370> i'm<00:02:43.700> going<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:43.910> go<00:02:44.030> in

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
with kick and range i'm going to go in

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.420 
with kick and range i'm going to go in
that<00:02:44.269> scene<00:02:44.750> one's<00:02:45.080> a<00:02:45.230> dumb<00:02:45.440> bash<00:02:45.680> in<00:02:45.890> Skyrim

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
that scene one's a dumb bash in Skyrim

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.240 
that scene one's a dumb bash in Skyrim
but<00:02:47.209> I'm<00:02:47.530> pretty<00:02:48.530> sure<00:02:48.680> that's<00:02:48.980> going<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:49.160> be

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
but I'm pretty sure that's going to be

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.729 
but I'm pretty sure that's going to be
like<00:02:49.400> one<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.640> most<00:02:49.790> fun<00:02:50.120> weapons<00:02:50.540> use<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.590> on

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
like one the most fun weapons use and on

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.949 
like one the most fun weapons use and on
this<00:02:51.890> amusing<00:02:52.310> extreme<00:02:52.730> conditioning<00:02:53.360> just

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
this amusing extreme conditioning just

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.420 
this amusing extreme conditioning just
because<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.320> need<00:02:54.470> that<00:02:54.500> extra<00:02:54.890> sprint<00:02:55.250> to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
because you need that extra sprint to

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.000 
because you need that extra sprint to
get<00:02:55.580> closer<00:02:55.850> up<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.239> people<00:02:56.739> assassin<00:02:57.739> pro

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
get closer up to people assassin pro

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.680 
get closer up to people assassin pro
because<00:02:58.430> otherwise<00:02:59.090> it's<00:02:59.390> going<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.600> be

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
because otherwise it's going to be

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.150 
because otherwise it's going to be
horrendous<00:03:00.170> playing<00:03:00.410> with<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.560> shotgun<00:03:00.800> with<00:03:01.130> a

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
horrendous playing with a shotgun with a

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.979 
horrendous playing with a shotgun with a
lot<00:03:01.370> that<00:03:01.580> many<00:03:01.760> UAVs<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.269> stuff<00:03:02.630> in<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.840> air
