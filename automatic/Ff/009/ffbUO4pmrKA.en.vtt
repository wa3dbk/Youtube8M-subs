reused<00:01:37.310> those<00:01:37.929> they're<00:01:38.929> pretty<00:01:39.140> expensive

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
reused those they're pretty expensive

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.010 
reused those they're pretty expensive
they<00:01:41.090> say<00:01:41.240> you're<00:01:41.360> not<00:01:41.420> supposed<00:01:41.689> to<00:01:41.750> do<00:01:41.899> that

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
but well let's zoom in over here and see

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.940 
but well let's zoom in over here and see
that<00:01:52.630> we<00:01:53.630> do<00:01:53.780> have<00:01:53.869> some<00:01:54.110> interference<00:01:54.679> issues

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
that we do have some interference issues

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:06.090 
that we do have some interference issues
with<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.429> 15<00:01:55.759> inch<00:01:55.909> rims

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.280 

as<00:02:06.460> you<00:02:06.580> can<00:02:06.700> see<00:02:06.850> we're<00:02:07.030> now<00:02:07.150> eat<00:02:07.330> will<00:02:08.280> do<00:02:10.290> and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
as you can see we're now eat will do and

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.880 
as you can see we're now eat will do and
rotors<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:11.980> all<00:02:12.070> that<00:02:12.250> good<00:02:12.430> stuff<00:02:13.470> but<00:02:14.470> as<00:02:14.680> I

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
rotors and all that good stuff but as I

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.170 
rotors and all that good stuff but as I
just<00:02:15.070> mentioned<00:02:15.670> we<00:02:15.700> have<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:18.610> clears<00:02:18.970> the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
just mentioned we have so clears the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:27.940 
just mentioned we have so clears the
shoes<00:02:19.420> are<00:02:19.630> in<00:02:19.690> there

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.410 

so<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.010> correct<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.580> we're<00:02:29.910> going<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.060> grind

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
so to correct it we're going to grind

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.809 
so to correct it we're going to grind
down<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.870> mounting<00:02:31.230> pleat<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.520> caliper

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
down the mounting pleat and the caliper

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.990 
down the mounting pleat and the caliper
itself<00:02:33.830> which<00:02:34.830> kind<00:02:35.099> of<00:02:35.190> sucks<00:02:35.400> but<00:02:35.670> there's

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
itself which kind of sucks but there's

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.059 
itself which kind of sucks but there's
nothing<00:02:36.270> I<00:02:36.330> could<00:02:36.510> do<00:02:36.599> I<00:02:36.890> couldn't<00:02:37.890> find

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
nothing I could do I couldn't find

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.660 
nothing I could do I couldn't find
decent<00:02:38.310> tires<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:39.000> 16<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:40.520> would<00:02:41.520> really

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
decent tires in a 16 that would really

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.740 
decent tires in a 16 that would really
work<00:02:41.970> or<00:02:42.270> 16<00:02:43.020> 5<00:02:44.239> so<00:02:45.239> I'll<00:02:45.300> just<00:02:45.420> wait<00:02:45.569> for<00:02:45.660> a

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
work or 16 5 so I'll just wait for a

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.240
