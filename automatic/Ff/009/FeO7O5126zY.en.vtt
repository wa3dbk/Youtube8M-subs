00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
that would go back since I began making

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.520 
that would go back since I began making
knives<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.600> about<00:00:54.860> 1979<00:00:55.860> or<00:00:56.280> 80<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.090> my<00:00:57.989> hope

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
knives in about 1979 or 80 and my hope

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.050 
knives in about 1979 or 80 and my hope
tonight<00:00:58.830> is<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> culmination<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.910> everything

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
tonight is the culmination of everything

tonight is the culmination of everything
that<00:01:00.510> I've<00:01:00.660> learned<00:01:00.930> since<00:01:01.230> then<00:01:01.380> and

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
that I've learned since then and

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.810 
that I've learned since then and
refinement<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.880> guess<00:01:03.060> is<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> correct<00:01:03.690> turn

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
refinement I guess is the correct turn

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.390 
refinement I guess is the correct turn
one<00:01:05.330> of<00:01:05.450> the<00:01:05.600> things<00:01:05.840> I'm<00:01:06.200> I<00:01:06.560> kind<00:01:07.040> of<00:01:07.160> try<00:01:07.370> to

one of the things I'm I kind of try to
bring<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:07.910> knife-making<00:01:08.360> it's<00:01:08.810> a<00:01:08.870> little<00:01:09.080> bit

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200
