round cover inside the opening here we

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.770 
round cover inside the opening here we
found<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.280> best<00:00:53.520> if<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.699> go<00:00:53.850> towards<00:00:54.239> this

side of that round cover and attempt to

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.069 
side of that round cover and attempt to
pry<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.680> out<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.129> here<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.760> go<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.899> we'll

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
pry that out and here we go and we'll

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.860 
pry that out and here we go and we'll
take<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.289> small<00:01:01.649> black<00:01:01.980> round<00:01:02.789> cover<00:01:03.090> out<00:01:03.300> it's

next we're going to move back to our pry

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.810 
next we're going to move back to our pry
bar<00:01:18.080> again<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:18.770> we<00:01:19.160> have<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.400> tweeter<00:01:19.700> that

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.290 
control panel here we're going to start
at<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:21.950> back<00:02:22.070> here<00:02:22.340> because<00:02:22.640> this<00:02:22.790> piece<00:02:23.060> also

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
at the back here because this piece also

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.780 
at the back here because this piece also
has<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.570> tongue<00:02:23.840> on<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.140> but<00:02:24.260> it's<00:02:24.380> at<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.530> front

so<00:02:25.790> I'm<00:02:25.850> going<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.090> start<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.480> back<00:02:26.660> edge<00:02:26.900> here

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
so I'm going to start the back edge here

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.390 
so I'm going to start the back edge here
and<00:02:27.380> try<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.560> pry<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.160> panel<00:02:28.610> up

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.309 

and<00:02:33.670> then<00:02:33.970> pull<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.330> back<00:02:34.360> a<00:02:34.599> little<00:02:34.870> bit<00:02:35.080> and

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
and then pull it back a little bit and

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.839 
and then pull it back a little bit and
it<00:02:35.409> releases<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:36.010> front<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.370> tongue<00:02:36.580> that's

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
it releases the front of tongue that's

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.300 
it releases the front of tongue that's
up<00:02:37.450> here<00:02:37.810> that<00:02:37.959> fits<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.349> slot<00:02:38.620> down<00:02:38.650> here<00:02:39.159> now

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
up here that fits a slot down here now

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.440 
up here that fits a slot down here now
we're<00:02:39.430> going<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.580> pull<00:02:39.730> this<00:02:39.790> up<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.150> out<00:02:40.269> of

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
we're going to pull this up and out of

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.320 
we're going to pull this up and out of
the<00:02:40.569> up<00:02:41.099> opening<00:02:42.099> this<00:02:42.879> is<00:02:42.940> going<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.120> give<00:02:43.239> us

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
the up opening this is going to give us

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.759 
the up opening this is going to give us
access<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.750> two<00:02:44.019> connectors<00:02:44.500> these

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
access to two connectors these

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.350 
access to two connectors these
connectors<00:02:45.310> have<00:02:45.459> little<00:02:45.760> triggers<00:02:46.150> on<00:02:46.330> the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
connectors have little triggers on the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.080 
connectors have little triggers on the
tops<00:02:46.989> of<00:02:47.230> them<00:02:47.379> and<00:02:48.069> while<00:02:48.280> squeezing<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.879> down

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
tops of them and while squeezing it down

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.640 
tops of them and while squeezing it down
you<00:02:49.269> wiggle<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:49.690> connector<00:02:50.170> loose<00:02:50.349> and<00:02:50.590> it

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
you wiggle the connector loose and it

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.440 
you wiggle the connector loose and it
closed<00:02:50.890> right<00:02:51.129> out<00:02:51.310> there's<00:02:51.579> no<00:02:51.730> need<00:02:51.909> to<00:02:51.940> mark

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
closed right out there's no need to mark

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.000 
closed right out there's no need to mark
these<00:02:52.629> connectors<00:02:53.200> because<00:02:53.409> they're<00:02:53.799> both

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
these connectors because they're both

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.890 
these connectors because they're both
different<00:02:54.459> sizes<00:02:54.879> they<00:02:55.000> go<00:02:55.150> back<00:02:55.299> to<00:02:55.450> one<00:02:55.599> spot

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
different sizes they go back to one spot

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.319 
different sizes they go back to one spot
the<00:02:56.829> second<00:02:57.250> connector<00:02:57.519> also<00:02:57.760> has<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.060> little
