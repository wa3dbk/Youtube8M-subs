00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.740 

oh<00:02:39.849> but<00:02:40.849> did<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.180> think<00:02:41.360> about<00:02:41.510> the

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
oh but did you think about the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.630 
oh but did you think about the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
difficulty will she lose marks for that

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.199

that<00:02:44.239> makes<00:02:44.450> little<00:02:44.690> swing<00:02:44.989> in<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.200> middle<00:02:46.209> yo

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
that makes little swing in the middle yo

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.120 
that makes little swing in the middle yo
she<00:02:47.360> will<00:02:47.720> yes<00:02:48.140> because<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.650> was<00:02:48.739> an<00:02:48.860> empty

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
she will yes because it was an empty

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.210 
she will yes because it was an empty
swing<00:02:49.520> so<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.900> probably<00:02:51.380> will<00:02:51.680> add<00:02:51.890> up<00:02:52.069> to

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
swing so it probably will add up to

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.400 
swing so it probably will add up to
about<00:02:52.310> 2.5<00:02:53.120> deduction<00:02:53.690> not<00:02:53.840> as<00:02:54.020> much<00:02:54.200> as<00:02:54.349> a
