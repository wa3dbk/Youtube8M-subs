this<00:00:06.990> protective<00:00:07.799> soft<00:00:08.040> rubber<00:00:08.370> silicon

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
this protective soft rubber silicon

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.459 
this protective soft rubber silicon
cover<00:00:09.690> for<00:00:10.080> gopro<00:00:10.730> if<00:00:11.730> it's<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.509> gopro<00:00:12.929> 3<00:00:12.960> is

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
cover for gopro if it's the gopro 3 is

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.880 
cover for gopro if it's the gopro 3 is
the<00:00:13.500> twos<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.990> i'm<00:00:15.990> sometimes<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.710> little

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
the twos and i'm sometimes a little

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.970 
the twos and i'm sometimes a little
clumsy<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.490> i<00:00:17.609> drop<00:00:17.940> things<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:19.230> just

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
clumsy and i drop things and I just

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.710 
clumsy and i drop things and I just
thought<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.520> would<00:00:20.609> probably<00:00:21.000> give<00:00:21.180> me<00:00:21.210> added

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
thought it would probably give me added

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.050 
thought it would probably give me added
protection<00:00:22.189> even<00:00:23.189> with<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.519> case<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:24.000> don't

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
protection even with the case I don't

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.970 
protection even with the case I don't
want<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.359> want<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> get<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> case<00:00:25.019> all<00:00:25.289> screwed

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
want to want to get the case all screwed

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.009 
want to want to get the case all screwed
up<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.310> scratched<00:00:26.550> up<00:00:26.849> either<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.390> case<00:00:27.840> they

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
up and scratched up either in case they

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.160 
up and scratched up either in case they
drop<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.189> has<00:00:29.220> all<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.090> necessary

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
drop so it has all the necessary

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.740 
drop so it has all the necessary
openings<00:00:31.170> for<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.700> access<00:00:33.149> all<00:00:33.420> three

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
openings for it you can access all three

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.299 
openings for it you can access all three
buttons<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.829> see<00:00:35.010> what<00:00:35.190> you're

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
buttons and you can see what you're

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.280 
buttons and you can see what you're
doing<00:00:35.489> up<00:00:35.820> front<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.420> don't<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:36.780> an<00:00:36.899> LCD

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
doing up front if you don't have an LCD

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.830 
doing up front if you don't have an LCD
screen<00:00:38.030> do<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.059> have<00:00:39.239> added<00:00:39.690> protection

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
screen do you have added protection

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.650 
screen do you have added protection
around<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.710> lens<00:00:40.920> just<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.910> case<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.329> drops

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
around the lens just in case it drops

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.569 
around the lens just in case it drops
which<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.140> really<00:00:43.469> nice<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.219> could<00:00:44.399> do<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
which is really nice and I could do a

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.940 
which is really nice and I could do a
little<00:00:44.760> more<00:00:45.200> security<00:00:46.200> as<00:00:46.440> far<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.770> that's

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
little more security as far as that's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.150 
little more security as far as that's
concerned<00:00:47.719> another<00:00:48.719> nice<00:00:48.989> feature<00:00:49.020> about<00:00:49.530> it

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
concerned another nice feature about it

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.380 
concerned another nice feature about it
is<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:51.149> has<00:00:51.800> an<00:00:52.800> overlap<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.149> back

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
is that it has an overlap in the back

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.369 
is that it has an overlap in the back
which<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:55.079> act<00:00:55.289> as<00:00:55.649> an<00:00:55.980> LCD<00:00:56.610> Sun<00:00:57.300> covers<00:00:57.809> so

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
which can act as an LCD Sun covers so

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.250 
which can act as an LCD Sun covers so
you<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.340> actually<00:00:59.609> see<00:01:00.149> better<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:00.899> you're

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
you can actually see better what you're

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.860 
you can actually see better what you're
doing<00:01:01.530> during<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> day<00:01:01.920> life<00:01:02.870> time

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
doing during the day life time

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.679 
doing during the day life time
especially<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.769> some<00:01:05.040> directly

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
especially you have some directly

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.510 
especially you have some directly
giddiness<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.930> also<00:01:07.770> takes<00:01:08.010> away<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
giddiness and also takes away the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.510 
giddiness and also takes away the
reflective<00:01:09.270> surfaces<00:01:09.930> such<00:01:10.500> go<00:01:10.830> pro<00:01:11.159> which<00:01:11.369> is

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
reflective surfaces such go pro which is

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.000 
reflective surfaces such go pro which is
really<00:01:11.760> nice<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.900> I'm<00:01:13.260> pretty<00:01:13.530> happy<00:01:13.680> with

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
really nice so I'm pretty happy with

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.300 
really nice so I'm pretty happy with
it's<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.460> pretty<00:01:14.700> thick<00:01:15.119> rubber<00:01:16.310> silicon

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it's a pretty thick rubber silicon

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
it's a pretty thick rubber silicon
around<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.630> does<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
around that so if it does this to the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.679 
around that so if it does this to the
ground<00:01:19.500> I'm<00:01:20.040> sure<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.390> rugged

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
ground I'm sure it's you know as rugged

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.270 
ground I'm sure it's you know as rugged
as<00:01:21.869> these<00:01:22.110> are<00:01:22.470> still<00:01:23.159> should<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.840> added

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
as these are still should be that added

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.280 
as these are still should be that added
security<00:01:26.280> knowing<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.020> little

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
security knowing that you have a little

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.760 
security knowing that you have a little
more<00:01:28.470> protection<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:30.030> product<00:01:30.659> three<00:01:31.439> four

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
more protection on a product three four

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.270 
more protection on a product three four
hundred<00:01:32.159> dollars<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.790> debt<00:01:33.240> cetera<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.619> it

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
hundred dollars in debt cetera so it

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.980 
hundred dollars in debt cetera so it
goes<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:35.970> higher<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.509> course

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
goes you can up higher with course

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.320 
goes you can up higher with course
they'll<00:01:37.170> see<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.470> background

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
they'll see the background

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.110 
they'll see the background
when<00:01:39.200> they<00:01:39.350> ship<00:01:39.410> them<00:01:39.830> this<00:01:40.130> is<00:01:40.310> not<00:01:40.520> open<00:01:40.940> I

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
when they ship them this is not open I

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.830 
when they ship them this is not open I
kind<00:01:41.420> of<00:01:41.570> a<00:01:41.840> pair<00:01:42.620> of<00:01:42.710> scissors<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:43.340> I<00:01:43.760> slid<00:01:44.690> it

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
kind of a pair of scissors and I slid it

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.260 
kind of a pair of scissors and I slid it
open<00:01:45.130> reasoning<00:01:46.130> behind<00:01:46.220> that<00:01:46.460> is<00:01:46.730> a<00:01:46.910> lot

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
open reasoning behind that is a lot

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.910 
open reasoning behind that is a lot
simpler<00:01:47.870> to<00:01:48.430> put<00:01:49.430> on<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:50.090> take<00:01:50.120> off<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:51.830> other

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
simpler to put on and take off the other

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.430 
simpler to put on and take off the other
way<00:01:52.040> where<00:01:52.430> it's<00:01:52.670> all<00:01:52.850> flipped<00:01:53.420> together<00:01:53.780> from

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
way where it's all flipped together from

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.410 
way where it's all flipped together from
the<00:01:54.650> back<00:01:54.860> page<00:01:55.160> just<00:01:55.700> makes<00:01:55.910> it<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.120> little<00:01:56.180> bit

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
the back page just makes it a little bit

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.240 
the back page just makes it a little bit
more<00:01:56.630> difficult<00:01:56.960> so<00:01:57.320> I<00:01:57.500> said<00:01:57.800> you<00:01:57.920> know<00:01:57.980> what

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
more difficult so I said you know what

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.640 
more difficult so I said you know what
they<00:01:58.460> have<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:58.970> know<00:01:59.300> for<00:01:59.720> the<00:02:00.320> amount<00:02:00.470> of

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
they have you know for the amount of

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.930 
they have you know for the amount of
money's<00:02:00.950> I'm<00:02:01.370> just<00:02:01.640> going<00:02:01.760> to<00:02:01.790> finish

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
money's I'm just going to finish

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.180 
money's I'm just going to finish
latarian<00:02:02.480> it<00:02:02.630> has<00:02:02.900> made<00:02:03.170> a<00:02:03.200> lot<00:02:03.500> easier<00:02:03.530> to

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
latarian it has made a lot easier to
