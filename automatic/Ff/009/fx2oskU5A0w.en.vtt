00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.340
 the new range rover sport is the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.350
 sportiest of the 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.750
 there would have to be and the advanced event rover 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.850
 to take a leash 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.130
 and the most versatile he sprays 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.760
 noblesse and is more than just operas 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.760
 fit 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.280
 He is what his name suggests 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.870
 deep, almost aggressive 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.240
 finally sovereign 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.570
 in the area are a real man 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.570
 David 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.300
 Range Rover Sport looks classic 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.250
 range rover amazingly similar in the 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.199
 However, detail shows that it is about 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.930
 two completely different models of 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.030
 world sport is 15 centimeters shorter 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.110
 and six inches shallower than that 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.110
 conventional rey 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.859
 the range rover sport is the angel 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.649
 sports suit really good 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.409
 every detail has a masculine dynamic effect 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.600
 even outweighing in a car for men 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.600
 a drug over the counter 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.480
 the range rover sport is the new one 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.420
 designer piece under the offroadern and 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.420
 Let's start the hunt on knx 5 and co 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.299
 The German market is by far the most 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.290
 most competitive on the whole 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.630
 world exactly that is the challenge 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.130
 for us and I think the ranger was 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.390
 always a nice alternative to the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.920
 established brands from german 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.750
 Production will be a bit different 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.979
 want to be away from the mainstream for 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.080
 a range rover is quite a 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.060
 alternative even if the huge one 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.009
 competition is established and almost 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.200
 reached the range rover sport seems 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.630
 is worth considering for one 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.610
 industry as in w or mercedes drives in 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.680
 After all, everyone circles around 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.430
 who wants to differ seems so 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.430
 on the island 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.900
 in the interior is the range rover sport 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.340
 a true gentleman 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.680
 here the passengers receive 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.450
 luxury ambience and square meters way 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.890
 Noblest leather welcome to the royals 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.840
 unlike the conventional one 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.640
 Range does not trump the sport with wood 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.250
 in asia but with all kinds 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.840
 carbon decor and alu applications the 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.840
 emphasize the athletic claim 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.550
 supersport quite clearly the service 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.950
 easier to do we have about 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.930
 50 that is more than half of the 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.130
 Buttons taken out only the functions 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.170
 you can use directly 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.459
 dial in directly by key and used 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.660
 everything else is in a very 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.920
 find practical menu 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.900
 we have the operability with it 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.040
 be made much easier that 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.959
 whole car a bit sportier 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.670
 designed in the interior by aluminum 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.870
 we have the rotating de cler for the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.709
 have automatically thrown out 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.239
 instead like a real one 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.620
 shift knob to make German that 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.150
 this car is really sportier 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.030
 is positioned as the conventional one 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.190
 hard as that too 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.780
 stÃ¼hl the club chair from the range 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.459
 rovers had to be clear in the sport 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.459
 soft firmer sport sit 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.090
 despite the reduction of the dimensions for 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.239
 Passengers and luggage remains a lot 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.239
 space 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.940
 on request, the range rover sport 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.110
 even with a third row of seats 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.110
 to be delivered 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.000
 the best place in the imposing luxury liner 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.770
 is front left who has been sitting somewhere else 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.770
 bad luck because missed the best 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.420
 in the 510 hp strong v8 is the sport 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.980
 from a three-liter diesel 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.090
 powered by the optional with 258 under 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.190
 292 ps is offered 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.110
 the weaker though not weak 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.980
 auto-ignition consumes just barely 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.110
 over seven liters 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.890
 This will make the range rover almost to 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.890
 fuel-efficient model 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.340
 the new human spot actually covers 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.620
 a very large bandwidth 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.090
 possibilities you can very quickly 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.500
 comfortably cultivated with diesel 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.699
 traveling is very low 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.830
 Consumption through a high range 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.930
 but each one really sporty now 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.520
 He also likes to have up to 250 times 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.919
 he wants to accelerate fast 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.090
 would like 0 to 100 in 5.3 seconds 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.060
 should definitely to 5 0 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.220
 supercharged with 510 hp attack with the 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.259
 uncompromising v8 or the green 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.360
 certain in the small diesel not enough 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.690
 in the late autumn the first hybrid of the 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.639
 brand 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.690
 with them, the consumption should be at about 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.690
 sink six liters 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.050
 We will first be on the Frankfurter 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.180
 tor show a hybrid presentation 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.380
 first in the range rover that becomes one 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.780
 his combination of three liters 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.490
 turbodiesel engine and electric motor and 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.870
 the car promises again clearly 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.880
 more torque at the same time 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.100
 Low consumption despite all fan 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.889
 Dynamics and sportiness of the range 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.510
 rover is a suv and no 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.860
 super sports car brings the high construction 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.780
 the heavyweight in the course too 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.030
 slight pages thick certain 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.919
 effects of physical laws 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.760
 not even with the latest technology 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.760
 to get around 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.600
 Nevertheless, the agility is for a suv 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.759
 extraordinary and impressive the 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.419
 new circles nimble and precise around the 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.190
 little hat 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.169
 this is also helped by the new torque 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.550
 vectoring system that force 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.850
 the rear axle increases to 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.320
 outside wheel sends 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.330
 also of advantage of the range rover 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.070
 sport is a lightweight, the 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.560
 Body is completely made of aluminum 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.130
 the power weight accordingly 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.130
 attractive 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:17.960
 absolutely technical rider what meaning 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.550
 the weight savings by the fact that we 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.439
 the car completely made of aluminum 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.919
 We can save up to 24 kilograms 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:23.509
 on 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.099
 that brings advantages in dynamics but 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.869
 also when it comes to consumption that means the car 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:30.409
 is faster at the same power 

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:32.569
 less is used for the sake of form 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:34.969
 mentioned the range rover sport is and 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:36.469
 a land rover remains the absolute 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:38.330
 Off-road capability is there 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:40.639
 honor and self-evident 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.649
 such obstacles a bit 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.689
 sticks and stones or a few 

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:48.999
 mud puddles commented the premium 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:51.439
 suv just relaxed and bored 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:54.110
 theoretically feasible in practice rarely 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:56.029
 abruptly too big the risk of dirt and 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.680
 To risk scratching the vehicle 

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:59.779
 but at least it is just one 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.319
 reassuring feeling that you could if 

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:03.669
 one wanted 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.669
 and he wants to 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.729
 save the best for last the price of 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:14.310
 Range Rover Sport is not a bargain 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:16.889
 but in comparison a price breaker off 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.990
 under 60.000 euro it starts where ever 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:21.419
 after equipment and motor also 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.810
 easily the 100,000 euros are cracked 

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:24.270
 can 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.669
 Power and exclusivity in the 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.569
 also have abundance on the island 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:29.569
 your price
