00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.100
 you might become one right away 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.760
 but I am terrified 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.519
 really anyway and I'm coming now 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:17.539
 out 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:19.500
 hello I'm blonde pretty blond 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:24.449
 testator I'm not just 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:29.330
 it's really just the light in 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.710
 The camera will be celebrating on the weekend 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.989
 and I was pretty good at that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.030
 and on sunday why that explains now 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.500
 come so it was not planned that 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.160
 now plan who the warburg is one 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.050
 very fixed idea and me together 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.120
 Breakfast sailer we will be fine 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.300
 somehow get to see something different 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.590
 Try borrowing against the going 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.329
 and I have yesterday all day 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.620
 spent and now also and so 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.750
 it looks like now 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.579
 and then I still have my eyebrows 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.230
 area because they were really fast 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.969
 black yes soon pretty dark 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.309
 eyebrows, I am also pretty dark 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.100
 from my exit and he has 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.570
 not that he then wiggles off 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.340
 when the eyebrows are still so dark 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.640
 are respectful believe so and so unfamiliar 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.470
 but like I like it though except 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.450
 my whole my whole environment it is 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.930
 my brother pretty much split it 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.610
 think it's awful and yes, you kid 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.770
 Write what you want to say so many 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.780
 was more beautiful and but I already have 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.729
 Now they have found it 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.770
 nice that in any case, first totally 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.900
 unfamiliar but the most important is that 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.250
 I like it and I'm glad that 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.079
 because I have never had 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.000
 Something else was always brown 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.860
 or just blush but I never had 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.390
 Somehow something extraordinary 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.189
 always about the same and yes me 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.110
 I like it and I'm glad that müller 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.049
 said commotion to propose 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.850
 that müller said try it 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.240
 abroad is not made although quite so 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.729
 just so i am trying it out now and 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.750
 yes, but it was really exhausting 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.829
 work and it was also painful yes 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.390
 okay I just wanted to say that 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.369
 when I have eyes like this 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.890
 be what I did everything 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.540
 and become so busy 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.750
 I just do that as a 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:20.560
 small mini information as a small shop 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.560
 Thank you for seeing here
