right<00:01:14.850> let's<00:01:15.030> grab<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.450> magnet<00:01:15.869> ah<00:01:16.400> we<00:01:17.400> missed

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
right let's grab the magnet ah we missed

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.219 
right let's grab the magnet ah we missed
it<00:01:17.970> can<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.210> believe<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:18.869> missed<00:01:19.200> it

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
it can you believe that we missed it

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.109

well<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.380> either<00:01:22.500> missing<00:01:22.979> or<00:01:23.100> diorite<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.060> I

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
well it's either missing or diorite so I

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.219 
well it's either missing or diorite so I
