00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
you're able to copy over codes really

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.360 
you're able to copy over codes really
easily<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:25.490> right<00:02:25.910> now<00:02:25.940> i'm<00:02:26.810> using<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.950> beta

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
easily so right now i'm using the beta

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.970 
easily so right now i'm using the beta
channel<00:02:28.880> design<00:02:29.420> if<00:02:29.900> you're<00:02:30.470> using<00:02:30.710> the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
channel design if you're using the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.530 
channel design if you're using the
original<00:02:31.190> one<00:02:31.610> that's<00:02:31.820> fine<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.330> works

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
original one that's fine it works

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.450 
original one that's fine it works
exactly<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.170> same<00:02:33.290> way<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:33.710> for<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.280> beta
