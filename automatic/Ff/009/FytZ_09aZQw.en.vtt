 Hi, I'm Carlos Cato and vocalist 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.150
 tony guitarist and we're in another 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.100
 episode of tips and today I'm here to 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.480
 tell you a little about a 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.830
 particularity that this guitar has 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.370
 that a beauty is the same that I occupy 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.010
 me an ele of eclipse milk deluxe 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.230
 in this toy that is here that 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.430
 basically it's designed to change 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.300
 the sounds of the capsules of the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.129
 guitar if you notice it changes the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.890
 sound of the bridge capsule to the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.329
 arm 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.190
 good 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.579
 with sweeter sound a happier sound 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.989
 but it has a particularity that is a 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.729
 of the capsules turns off if one lowers 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.479
 all the volume and it gives you the option of 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.479
 do things like 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.120
 and this is going rock are exquisite we are going to 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.980
 try a couple of little things basically 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.060
 well this guitar has a tone that 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.400
 that you have to have the volumes of 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.600
 the two capsules what I 'm going to 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.070
 explain a little bit is how to do the 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.930
 effect of killing switch is much what 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.120
 used morelos and well I also like it 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.560
 a lot in my songs can do 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.560
 things like from dj 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.150
 that's a classic effect of monelos 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.150
 also occupies other things like 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.720
 things like that 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.340
 how do I explain you have to go in the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.170
 background is like what comes to replace 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.880
 the kill switch what they are doing is 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.200
 like what they did with the granddaughter and 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.460
 when they throw it up it goes off 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.140
 that has turned on and off and they can play 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.420
 with an infinity of scales and things 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.590
 but I hope to play with a song of mine 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.750
 that is called a thousand kilometers I'm going to 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.340
 show two bits of the song for 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.810
 that they listen to it is one they are the intro and 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.710
 the others a bridge that is like a single 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.710
 part well 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.190
 I want that 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.020
 if you notice that, it has given you a sense 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.230
 as well as rhythmic in addition to using the 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.730
 guitar as a rhythm instrument and 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.860
 also what puts a part of a single 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.120
 background here where this guitar is final 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.819
 drop then lets you do 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.450
 fifths with only one finger 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.450
 and we do something like that 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.850
 do not 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.040
 it's a technique that requires a lot 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.510
 practice at first you reach 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.370
 hand because you have suite of the 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.230
 guitar but you can always with another 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.060
 but the idea is to get the juice out 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.980
 instrument and like to play with these 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.050
 little things that make you have a sound 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.290
 a little bit more particular is a problem 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.620
 practice in act with the kill switch and 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.620
 hold on for a while 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.459
 if you want 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.709
 punished
