00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 the girl, fine, I came to make one today 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.919
 video with a super easy tip but that 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.080
 has worked very well for me has been 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.480
 very cool to me that I felt desire 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:21.420
 to share with you what it is about 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:23.850
 an organizing tip is a little notebook 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.670
 What am I wearing and was I watching? 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.310
 a few videos and I thought I did not give 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.260
 Actually, I'm going to tell you that until 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.440
 I tried to do it through my cell phone 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.239
 through notepads dude things 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.879
 that I had to do things that they had 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.410
 I wanted to buy things that 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:44.190
 need to be made and etc. 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.710
 Only that is to see which seems to tire me a lot. 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.520
 Do you know how to do typing so I preferred 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.399
 is to even vote for pro manual even though 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.120
 notebook you keep track of you 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.219
 Look at you feeling nothing in my hand so I 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.600
 I bought a notebook, I do not have a date. 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.610
 nothing is simple i paid six 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.100
 It was really in that notebook that he came 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.740
 with some leaves and I bought with a 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.770
 drawing that stimulate your writing is a 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.170
 cool drawing then if you like 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.119
 clean things you buy have to 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.450
 buy what you like process that 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.159
 pleasure to write you look you think 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.530
 which is a silly thing but actually 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.659
 greatly stimulates this 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.430
 so it's a pretty cool size for 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.420
 carry the bag and I wanted the notebook 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.229
 could carry everywhere and someone 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.229
 go there 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.930

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.580
 Post here I put one more here 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.350
 after some leaves it is written 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.500
 thoughts inspirations things that I 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.470
 I think I write suggestions here 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.940
 then videos is where you write 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.160
 according to your need sometimes 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.570
 Do you have a house to take care of the family? 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:52.470
 you want to make them are last 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.200
 private here family things to 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.580
 buy wishes dreams there you divide 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.580
 any way you want 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.350
 So how do I do everything I do not 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.750
 I have to do everything I think 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.350
 so I wish I had not forgotten the 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.780
 note 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.400
 So, for example, my business is very 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.739
 Yummy when you write everything that 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.300
 You have to do it and you get 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.410
 Things You 've Done Because You Look 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.989
 and talk but I was productive today is not 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.300
 I was so stopped, I was not looking for 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.580
 But I did not get so messed up. 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.650
 so you organizing you know everything 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.930
 What do you have to do for example? 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.090
 It is that records videos and what does that 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.989
 I do not want to have not done it yet 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.310
 record videos is to go to the bank answered 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.230
 to comments 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.270
 is to dial consultation is to pay phone in 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.760
 count on him by cell phone and so on 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.489
 I've been putting things here that I need 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.610
 do what i think i will forget 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.590
 and it's cool it's always you look every day 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.620
 're always looking to see what you 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.750
 Gotta do it and everything, so talk. 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.940
 things I need to do on the day and 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.110
 Always leave me to think things that I 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.269
 I have to do 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.340
 that week or just the day otherwise 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.160
 average daily pirate population that a month is 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.470
 next month, it is not only 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.140
 will some kind consult something 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.930
 well but I have to always tell the 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.849
 day 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.400
 the maximum of the next day not the people 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.979
 gets very anxious then puts the 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.080
 things of the day and there are things until I 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.360
 it's not so much a priority but I remembered 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.710
 what he said look I need to do this 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.960
 because it's putting the policy on my cell phone 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.729
 It's something I do not know how to do. 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.820
 today exactly but it's something I 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.740
 I need to do it so I put it there without 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.870
 that heavy son then charging for 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.570
 I do not know what has not yet been given 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.120
 super sure super inspired when 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.789
 Look how our thing I've done. 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.190
 and I chose to do what we do more 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.500
 easy first because it already kills and already does 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.240
 everything and ready, you're free to 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.220
 do other things 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.419
 Who do you think is the most difficult boring? 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:01.630
 Here in on the thoughts I am 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.009
 putting it is some phrases that I like 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.530
 because I want to share with you 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.360
 there on the page phrases even made by me 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.039
 some thought that I have that I 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.289
 Yes, I like to think and write. 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.699
 Something so I'll leave it here to 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.729
 write to you 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:18.130
 and here in the background your suggestions for videos 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:22.330
 that makeup the themes that you 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:24.639
 put there for me to record and that then 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.520
 It's a simple division but for me it has 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.590
 perfect surface because you look 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.919
 I see what you are producing 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.580
 This is already of great value so I found 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.229
 cool 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.260
 You can even share things with 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:40.870
 Do you want to buy what you need by 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.810
 example is free market you 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.940
 can stop here for a list is always 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.000
 What you need, you will always look 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:51.880
 you buy adds things can 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.039
 put list of payments of the month 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.080
 and you can for things you like 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:59.409
 to buy here that are dreams wishes 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.509
 For example, I want to buy a cell phone. 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.759
 Then you may notice that I wanted a 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:06.849
 I dream of buying where to travel 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:08.320
 then you make a list anyway if you look 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.449
 So we do not lose our 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.039
 thoughts and ending we end up 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.440
 putting things off we have to do 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:17.380
 and it seems that time has not yielded nor 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.620
 it seems that the young woman's phrase should have 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.840
 25 more than 24 hours in the day but not 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.340
 people get organized even if they like law 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.440
 at the 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.720
 the previous videos that organization 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.419
 balance a thing to be sought then 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.550
 even if you are not as organized as 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.919
 I 'm not authorized but I always 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.600
 I try to find balance, too. 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:39.660
 sink if we do not skate 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.650
 But it's a good place, so simple ethics of 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.780
 today that I wanted to share with 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.820
 you who promise to give a certain 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.880
 It seems like bullshit like this but if you catch it 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.740
 and really doing is focused will give 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.090
 super sure you will be super happy 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.820
 Because at the end of the day you look and say 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:56.250
 It worked out today when that day 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.430
 did not give you talk ah did not do much 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.229
 today but tomorrow I'll try to do so it's 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.260
 Even a stimulus is not a burden for 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:06.600
 you stay and refined tonight is not a 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.639
 Our style week, I'm going to do this. 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.470
 do what it is 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:12.570
 I think it was not confusing, right? 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.500
 final because talking things nobody 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.510
 In my head 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.539
 usually a very video degree of 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:20.460
 loose hair so there is always a file 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:22.139
 I hope it's good there that it is 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.889
 We really try to get people to 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:27.450
 keep messing with good hair so that's it 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:30.690
 Girls, I hope you have
