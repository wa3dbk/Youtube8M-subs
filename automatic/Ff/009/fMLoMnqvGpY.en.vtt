00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.560
The talent development

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.490
Wow, Lyzka, ft now in nasedky leaned?

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.830
Beeeee!

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.300
Baby, why do you have a cap on?

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.210
The dinner is on the stove.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.660
Well, allright... What's actually happening?

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.600
Come on, go! Go-a-l. Uh-huh

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.900
Hey! What are you all doing here? What happened? Hey, are you deaf or what?

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.050
Huh?

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.670
I am asking, what are you staying in the bathroom?

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.700
A-a-a! O-o-o!

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.910
And all day like this...

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.160
Liza.... Liza! Lizka, shut up!

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.380
Why? Yesterday I sent a CD to the radio with my best songs and now I am exercising

00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:14.004
for the solo concert. I will have a real concert on a big stage.

00:01:14.628 --> 00:01:16.628
Like the Great Jeanne Kitty!

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.700
Oh. I am delighted! But could you be silent untill the concert?

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.330
Nevermind. The lack of training - is a catastrophe for the voice. I need to exercise all the time.

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:38.554
And if you will stay in my way, I will tell mom that you don't let me develop my talent! A-a-a! O-o-o! One second...

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.410
When Liza is eating egss, we may have a little silence.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:01.350
Yummy-yummy... Mmmm, such a delicios chocolate! Truth to be told, I already ate two of these. Want some?

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.630
Isn't it harmful for my voice chords?

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.710
No-o-o-o!

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.980
It worked!

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.540
I suspect, that chocolate soon will be over.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.850
This mean that we need more chocolate!

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.300
Eh, Lizka won't eat this in a week! Sweet silence!

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.090
Ah-ah-ah! O-o-o!

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.340
Thank you, I ate. No more sweets.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.100
We must have been put sleeping pills in her sweets.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.360
We'll have to wait until Lisa will become a
star and  would go on tour.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.460
We will not last for so long

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.810
I know what to do.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.740
What, there is nobody to pick up the phone, already?
Hello...

00:03:16.741 --> 00:03:19.541
-This is Lisa?
-Yes.. it's me...

00:03:19.542 --> 00:03:24.142
-And this is me.
-A-ah ... Jeanne Kitty ...

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.371
Lizonka, you are a very talented girl.
But you know ... you just now

00:03:31.496 --> 00:03:38.492
develop your voice, and if you'll break it... then you will never be able to sing again. So just wait...

00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:41.199
a year or two. But better three!

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.000
Yes ... well ... bye ...

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.500
Have you heard ?! I'm a star-ah ... Oh ...
I am not allowed scream ... Imagine ....

00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:57.701
I pick up the phone ... And there ...
Jeanne Kitty !!!

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.900
But ... What? Where?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.300
Oh ... Ah ...

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.600
Hmmm ... Well, what ?!

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.400
-What is buzzing, eh? 
-Yes, what's the matter finally?
-What's that noise? For how long you can still make such a noise?!

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:26.785
Good morning! I was thinking ... Since I can not sing anymore- I will master the trombone!

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.800
I can not leave the talent to dissapear.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.600
NO-O-O-O!
