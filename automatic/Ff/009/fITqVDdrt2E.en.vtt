 hello here reginaldo ferreira director of 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.420
 ati nautical and marine cas q club 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.460
 this tip 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.740
 talking about a theme once again 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.070
 which I very much like to address is the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.619
 security is mainly for those who 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.890
 is starting when you are leaving with the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.080
 vessel to pay close attention to the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.890
 crew if everyone is already 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.010
 sitting is a is something is a kind of 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.500
 very common accident to happen 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.050
 people are standing on the boat and the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.590
 sometimes forgotten by the driver right 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.050
 by some fault it accelerates and who is 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.489
 standing really loses complete balance and 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.370
 it ends up falling 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.780
 the very important detail to speak 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.100
 respect for fall 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.530
 is when you go out to browse check 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.559
 if there is someone who is near you know 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.870
 to fly a boat because in the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.869
 Do you happen to have an accident? 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.299
 fatality or you fall into the water for 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.130
 example is a moment of despair 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.080
 It's important to have someone who knows 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.320
 navigate to get the boat 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.930
 until next to you because at that moment 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.930
 if you have someone who does not have skill 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.750
 can trample increasing including 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.650
 risk of the seriousness of 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.450
 accident 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.430
 It's very important when you know 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.710
 navigate at least the basics 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.290
 if there is no one who can navigate 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.829
 you pass that person where you turn off the 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.259
 engine what to do because suddenly you 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.259
 may not have time to pass this 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.880
 orientation in the midst of an accident 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.890
 so stay put more these tips for you 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.170
