cars
these<00:00:24.730> are<00:00:25.000> ride<00:00:25.869> height<00:00:26.170> and<00:00:26.439> sway<00:00:27.220> bar<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
these are ride height and sway bar the

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.019 
these are ride height and sway bar the
ride<00:00:28.990> height<00:00:29.289> can<00:00:29.949> be<00:00:29.980> adjusted<00:00:30.550> individually

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
ride height can be adjusted individually

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.100 
ride height can be adjusted individually
at<00:00:31.960> each<00:00:32.199> corner<00:00:32.590> of<00:00:32.800> the<00:00:33.040> car<00:00:33.690> unless<00:00:34.690> you<00:00:34.960> are

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
at each corner of the car unless you are

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.070 
at each corner of the car unless you are
oval<00:00:35.650> racing<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:36.850> left<00:00:37.120> and<00:00:37.390> right<00:00:37.660> ride

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
oval racing the left and right ride

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.280 
oval racing the left and right ride
heights<00:00:38.470> should<00:00:39.339> remain<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:39.879> same<00:00:40.290> having

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
heights should remain the same having

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.280 
heights should remain the same having

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
different left and right ride heights

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.439 
different left and right ride heights
will<00:00:44.290> change<00:00:44.620> how<00:00:44.830> the<00:00:44.890> car<00:00:45.190> feels<00:00:45.449> during

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
will change how the car feels during

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.229 
will change how the car feels during
left<00:00:46.659> and<00:00:46.839> right<00:00:47.049> cornering<00:00:47.680> thus<00:00:48.549> giving<00:00:49.030> an

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
left and right cornering thus giving an

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.219 
left and right cornering thus giving an
unpredictable<00:00:50.140> car<00:00:51.210> generally<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:53.019> lower

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
unpredictable car generally the lower

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:55.950 
unpredictable car generally the lower
the<00:00:53.500> ride<00:00:53.710> height<00:00:54.040> the<00:00:54.519> better<00:00:54.820> as<00:00:55.089> there<00:00:55.809> will

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
the ride height the better as there will

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.920 
the ride height the better as there will
be<00:00:56.019> less<00:00:56.290> weight<00:00:56.559> transfer<00:00:57.100> during<00:00:57.519> cornering

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
be less weight transfer during cornering

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.130 
be less weight transfer during cornering
braking<00:00:58.930> and<00:00:59.129> acceleration<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:01.510> is<00:01:01.570> due<00:01:01.960> to

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
braking and acceleration this is due to

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.070 
braking and acceleration this is due to
the<00:01:02.260> spring<00:01:02.530> travel<00:01:03.010> being<00:01:03.460> shortened<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
the spring travel being shortened the

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.080 
the spring travel being shortened the
shortened<00:01:05.560> spring<00:01:05.860> travel<00:01:06.159> will<00:01:06.820> mean<00:01:06.970> the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
shortened spring travel will mean the

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.870 
shortened spring travel will mean the
car<00:01:07.330> body<00:01:07.570> will<00:01:08.320> move<00:01:08.530> less<00:01:08.920> when<00:01:09.369> loads<00:01:09.640> are

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
car body will move less when loads are

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.530 
car body will move less when loads are
applied

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
applied

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.499 
applied
thus<00:01:11.260> the<00:01:11.409> tire<00:01:11.650> loading<00:01:12.189> won't<00:01:12.939> differ<00:01:13.240> as

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
thus the tire loading won't differ as

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.179 
thus the tire loading won't differ as
much<00:01:13.719> and<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.409> car<00:01:14.619> will<00:01:14.799> be<00:01:14.859> more

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
much and the car will be more

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.230 
much and the car will be more
predictable<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:17.530> too<00:01:17.770> low<00:01:18.009> however<00:01:18.340> will

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
predictable going too low however will

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.649 
predictable going too low however will
cause<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.719> car<00:01:19.929> to<00:01:19.960> bottom<00:01:20.469> out<00:01:21.299> when<00:01:22.299> a<00:01:22.329> car

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
cause the car to bottom out when a car

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.440 
cause the car to bottom out when a car
bottoms<00:01:23.079> out<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.950> car<00:01:24.219> body<00:01:24.429> is<00:01:24.700> in<00:01:25.030> contact

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
bottoms out the car body is in contact

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.679 
bottoms out the car body is in contact
with<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.810> road<00:01:26.249> this<00:01:27.249> causes<00:01:27.820> a<00:01:27.999> sudden<00:01:28.539> loss

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
with the road this causes a sudden loss

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.989 
with the road this causes a sudden loss
of<00:01:28.840> control<00:01:29.350> if<00:01:29.740> it<00:01:30.100> occurs<00:01:30.460> during<00:01:30.490> the

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:30.999 
of control if it occurs during the

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:35.489 
of control if it occurs during the
cornering<00:01:32.219> if<00:01:33.219> the<00:01:34.030> front<00:01:34.270> bottoms<00:01:34.659> out<00:01:34.869> you

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:35.499 
cornering if the front bottoms out you

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:37.709 
cornering if the front bottoms out you
will<00:01:35.619> get<00:01:35.770> understeer<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:37.329> car<00:01:37.539> will

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
will get understeer and the car will

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.099 
will get understeer and the car will
feel<00:01:37.960> like<00:01:38.229> you<00:01:38.439> are<00:01:38.560> driving<00:01:38.829> on<00:01:39.069> ice<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:40.840> the

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
feel like you are driving on ice if the

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.380 
feel like you are driving on ice if the
rear<00:01:41.350> bottoms<00:01:41.740> out<00:01:41.890> you<00:01:42.729> will<00:01:42.880> end<00:01:43.030> up<00:01:43.119> in<00:01:43.240> the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
rear bottoms out you will end up in the

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.929 
rear bottoms out you will end up in the
gravel<00:01:43.600> or<00:01:44.020> exit<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.859> corner<00:01:45.100> facing<00:01:45.460> in<00:01:45.850> the

wrong direction having the front ride
height<00:01:49.749> higher<00:01:50.319> will<00:01:51.039> cause<00:01:51.249> the<00:01:51.490> car<00:01:51.640> to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
height higher will cause the car to

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.029 
height higher will cause the car to
understeer<00:01:52.389> this<00:01:53.350> is<00:01:53.499> as<00:01:53.679> the<00:01:53.829> weight
