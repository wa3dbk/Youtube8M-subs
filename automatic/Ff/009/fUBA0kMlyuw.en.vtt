00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.500
 fuses are the most 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.710
 varied depending on 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.710
 destinations 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.770
 for making a high fuse 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.800
 voltage special device makes 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.050
 notches on this strip later it will become 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.390
 fusible element of the recess will allow 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.330
 control the combustion process 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.700
 fuse then put on a strip 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.390
 pieces of soft metal precisely in these 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.009
 ground and the fuse will blow 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.910
 one end of a silver plate 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:37.050
 welded to the ceramic core and 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.310
 wrapped around her 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.770
 by the way high fuses 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.770
 voltage used at power plants 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.520
 core fuse inserts into 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.710
 body and bend over metal contacts 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.489
 then it all connects with 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.489
 hard solder 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.309
 high voltage wire wrapped 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.590
 around copper washers and collects so 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.510
 called booster devices which 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.979
 report fuse blown 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.170
 and unplugged the top striker puts a puck on 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.710
 sticking out out puts in 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.710
 holder 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.190
 then pour a little bit in 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.190
 explosive powder 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.690
 the lower holes cover the rubber 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.720
 stopper 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.720
 but 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.680
 after which the copper is pressed inside 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.399
 a capsule that can stand 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.340
 mini blast 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.300
 he pushes the warhead when the fuse 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.000
 burn out 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.380
 you can see how things are going on 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.140
 example of this test 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.710
 here's a bike wire wrapped around so 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.050
 called the capsule withdrawal column 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.870
 bike closes and set the pendulum 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.950
 later he will show off with what force 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.530
 the current pulse causes detonation in 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.280
 by the striker comes forward 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.850
 signal fuse 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.850
 burned out 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.950
 thereafter the bike wire inserts into 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.200
 sex and restrained and joins not 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.060
 wire spiral on this assembly 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.060
 warrior's system is complete 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.590
 using a loop the system is pulled in 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.590
 fuse 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.460
 the end of the helix is ​​attached to the contact 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.970
 top outer cap is put on after 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.640
 this fuse fill 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.180
 special sand it will absorb energy 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.180
 at burnout 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.730
 automatic rods and compacted sand 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.230
 outer cap covers with grease and 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.040
 put it on the other end 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.210
 fuse 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.210
 then press down 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.180
 this mechanism is made peculiar 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.680
 grooves on the surface of the cap pressed 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.680
 it is stronger than the fuse 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.000
 then through each fuse 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.330
 passes current and checks voltage 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.120
 to make sure everything is fixed 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:25.400
 edges of caps are treated with sealant 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.400
 to make them waterproof 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.670
 stickers with information about 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.630
 security measures 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.750
 as well as knocks on caps 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.130
 specifications 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.940
 now fuse and ready for 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.040
 operation 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.890
 so if any problems arise 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.810
 they immediately burn out burn out at work 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.810
 this is their job
