00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
much as i do so as usual we're going to

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.069 
much as i do so as usual we're going to
take<00:00:51.430> our<00:00:51.579> grip<00:00:51.820> run<00:00:52.030> here<00:00:52.270> this<00:00:52.510> is<00:00:52.630> 50<00:00:52.930> roll

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
take our grip run here this is 50 roll

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.080 
take our grip run here this is 50 roll
starts<00:00:53.350> at<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.500> Corvette's<00:00:53.860> bridge<00:00:54.550> and<00:00:54.790> ends

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
starts at the Corvette's bridge and ends

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.569 
starts at the Corvette's bridge and ends
at<00:00:55.180> that<00:00:55.329> second<00:00:55.780> chevrolet<00:00:56.200> banner<00:00:56.579> this

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
at that second chevrolet banner this

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:58.860 
at that second chevrolet banner this
entry<00:00:57.790> is<00:00:57.970> a<00:00:58.030> little<00:00:58.239> tricky<00:00:58.540> because<00:00:58.630> you

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
entry is a little tricky because you

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.900 
entry is a little tricky because you
always<00:00:59.020> always<00:00:59.470> enter<00:00:59.890> way<00:01:00.370> sooner<00:01:00.760> than<00:01:00.790> I

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
always always enter way sooner than I

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.790 
always always enter way sooner than I
think<00:01:01.000> I<00:01:01.210> should<00:01:01.420> you're<00:01:02.200> only<00:01:02.350> allowed<00:01:02.620> to

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
think I should you're only allowed to

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.649 
think I should you're only allowed to
cut<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.130> corner<00:01:03.460> where<00:01:03.670> there's<00:01:03.940> no<00:01:04.239> gray

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
cut the corner where there's no gray

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.899 
cut the corner where there's no gray
thing<00:01:04.960> I<00:01:05.920> guess<00:01:06.340> it's<00:01:06.460> not<00:01:06.520> really<00:01:06.729> a<00:01:06.759> huge

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
thing I guess it's not really a huge

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.240 
thing I guess it's not really a huge
deal<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:08.170> transition<00:01:08.770> can<00:01:08.920> be<00:01:08.979> a<00:01:09.070> little

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
deal this transition can be a little

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.880 
deal this transition can be a little
difficult<00:01:09.460> but<00:01:10.240> just<00:01:10.990> keep<00:01:11.260> it<00:01:11.440> quick<00:01:11.650> and

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
difficult but just keep it quick and

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.500 
difficult but just keep it quick and
then<00:01:12.070> you<00:01:12.130> can<00:01:12.280> really<00:01:12.580> hang<00:01:12.790> it<00:01:12.909> out<00:01:13.030> on<00:01:13.210> the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
then you can really hang it out on the

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.480 
then you can really hang it out on the
entry<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:14.020> this<00:01:14.170> corner<00:01:14.470> I<00:01:14.740> found<00:01:15.250> that<00:01:15.370> this

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
entry to this corner I found that this

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.100 
entry to this corner I found that this
corner<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:15.850> probably<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.450> most<00:01:16.600> prone<00:01:16.900> to<00:01:17.080> a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
corner is probably the most prone to a

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.840 
corner is probably the most prone to a
big<00:01:17.380> 90-degree<00:01:17.920> entry<00:01:18.220> and<00:01:18.370> you<00:01:18.430> can<00:01:18.520> really

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
big 90-degree entry and you can really

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.950 
big 90-degree entry and you can really
pull<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:19.120> off<00:01:19.240> if<00:01:19.420> you're<00:01:19.510> holding<00:01:19.750> enough

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
pull it off if you're holding enough

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.899 
pull it off if you're holding enough
speed<00:01:20.229> you<00:01:20.799> bring<00:01:20.979> it<00:01:21.040> out<00:01:21.130> wide<00:01:21.400> and<00:01:21.430> bring<00:01:21.820> it

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
speed you bring it out wide and bring it

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.340 
speed you bring it out wide and bring it
out<00:01:22.000> wide<00:01:22.180> again<00:01:22.479> which<00:01:22.750> will<00:01:22.900> set<00:01:23.080> you<00:01:23.200> up<00:01:23.229> for

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
out wide again which will set you up for

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.399 
out wide again which will set you up for
this<00:01:23.530> long<00:01:23.920> long<00:01:24.610> right-hand<00:01:25.360> turn<00:01:25.659> a<00:01:25.960> lot<00:01:26.260> of

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
this long long right-hand turn a lot of

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.410 
this long long right-hand turn a lot of
under<00:01:26.590> powered<00:01:26.920> cars<00:01:27.159> or<00:01:27.430> really<00:01:27.880> grippy<00:01:28.210> cars

under powered cars or really grippy cars

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.640 
under powered cars or really grippy cars
are<00:01:28.600> going<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.840> struggle<00:01:29.049> with<00:01:29.170> this<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.530> in

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
are going to struggle with this you in

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.170 
are going to struggle with this you in
the<00:01:29.740> falken<00:01:30.070> i'm<00:01:30.190> using<00:01:30.490> right<00:01:30.520> now<00:01:30.640> really

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
the falken i'm using right now really

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.969 
the falken i'm using right now really
didn't<00:01:31.479> like<00:01:31.720> stretching<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.619> drift<00:01:32.860> out

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
didn't like stretching the drift out

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.800 
didn't like stretching the drift out
this<00:01:33.190> long<00:01:33.369> but<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.060> can<00:01:34.240> use<00:01:34.360> this<00:01:34.479> rumble

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
this long but you can use this rumble

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.179 
this long but you can use this rumble
