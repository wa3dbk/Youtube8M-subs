00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello then today I'm going to you 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.319
 show how to install a 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.799
 relay on a small long step then the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.030
 not the shadow 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.040
 it's very simple, but mostly 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.980
 the ring in that sense for it to be 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.600
 pulled back not in this sense there 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.970
 nor anything to the recipe 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.430
 easy list stands alone a little 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.260
 elastic john sheep 12.9 to because 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.220
 that must be changed every year here 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.399
 and a little dove nice wolf for 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.809
 its high and the importance then go on that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.200
 I project you the sica sheep on 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.489
 shoulder 1 we think the little hawk 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.129
 by the way you're wrong he ate 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.390
 after then never feed them before 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.190
 because otherwise they have the crop full 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.870
 and we can smother them 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.989
 we think the little blonde 6th well put 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.449
 his head in like that and we got it 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.010
 hugs the two front elastics 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.649
 in front of the wings and the other two 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.629
 think behind it's simple as 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.940
 his thoughts behind them offsets 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.070
 the wings of nant s is never happy 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:08.040
 even if these people say one without real a 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.900
 side and we get up from each other very 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.490
 important we return the small plant 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.720
 and here we see on the pasta are 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:19.020
 behind and there we make them think like 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.430
 that we make them think before like 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.240
 those with seated behind the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.280
 thigh the other case of like 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.780
 that's how it's done and we 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.549
 finds that the little ring is ready 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.409
 to return there is play 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.909
 so to avoid the game we take the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.390
 little elastic asia I recover 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.840
 elastic 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.840
 we pass them around the ring 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.439
 we put them around everything and there I have to 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.799
 take the 400 at the same time what 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.329
 does it tighten up we check that it 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.399
 holds well-heeled for this lawsuit in the 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.929
 second we would have run away we call 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.560
 bouncing off a second placed good 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.520
 young bungees comes to hear 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.810
 loiret what makes that small to 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:09.460
 the shade and palisson and that's how it 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.460
 can be cut
