00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.080 

let's<00:00:01.050> take<00:00:01.290> a<00:00:01.319> look<00:00:01.500> at<00:00:01.740> using<00:00:02.370> aggregate

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
let's take a look at using aggregate

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.300 
let's take a look at using aggregate
functions<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:03.750> grouping<00:00:04.080> records<00:00:04.470> I'm<00:00:04.830> on

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
functions and grouping records I'm on

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.249 
functions and grouping records I'm on
page<00:00:05.700> 113<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.359> your<00:00:06.569> text<00:00:06.899> if<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.020> want<00:00:07.200> to

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
page 113 of your text if you want to

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.960 
page 113 of your text if you want to
follow<00:00:07.470> along<00:00:07.589> I'm<00:00:07.919> beginning<00:00:08.069> with<00:00:08.250> step<00:00:08.550> 3

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
follow along I'm beginning with step 3

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.140 
follow along I'm beginning with step 3
so<00:00:09.630> I've<00:00:09.719> got<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.019> PAC<00:00:10.260> Trek<00:00:11.250> database<00:00:11.849> here

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
so I've got the PAC Trek database here

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.950 
so I've got the PAC Trek database here
this<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.480> um<00:00:12.809> like<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:14.330> mmm<00:00:15.420> campaign<00:00:15.719> supply

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
this is um like it mmm campaign supply

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.650 
this is um like it mmm campaign supply
company<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.910> we're<00:00:17.910> gonna<00:00:18.029> find<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.449> total

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
company and we're gonna find the total

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.240 
company and we're gonna find the total
and<00:00:18.930> average<00:00:19.050> order<00:00:19.619> amounts<00:00:19.949> for<00:00:20.070> each

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
and average order amounts for each

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.609 
and average order amounts for each
supplier<00:00:20.600> so<00:00:21.600> we're<00:00:21.990> going<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.380> create

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
supplier so we're going to the create

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.099 
supplier so we're going to the create
tab<00:00:22.650> we're<00:00:23.519> gonna<00:00:23.609> click<00:00:23.939> on<00:00:24.119> query<00:00:24.900> design

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
tab we're gonna click on query design

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.759 
tab we're gonna click on query design
and<00:00:26.330> then<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.510> want<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> orders<00:00:28.170> table<00:00:28.380> and

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
and then we want the orders table and

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.209 
and then we want the orders table and
the<00:00:29.340> suppliers<00:00:29.730> table<00:00:30.859> and<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:31.949> see<00:00:32.099> that

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
the suppliers table and we see that

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.810 
the suppliers table and we see that
those<00:00:32.340> are<00:00:32.489> already<00:00:32.759> linked<00:00:33.059> up<00:00:34.130> so<00:00:35.130> right

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
those are already linked up so right

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:47.090 
those are already linked up so right
here<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:36.930> want<00:00:38.660> a<00:00:41.840> second<00:00:45.710> okay<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.770> these<00:00:47.039> are

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
here we want a second okay so these are

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.440 
here we want a second okay so these are
the<00:00:47.370> fields<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.730> we're<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.030> add<00:00:48.180> we

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the fields that we're going to add we

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.630 
the fields that we're going to add we
added<00:00:48.809> amount<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:49.710> orders<00:00:50.129> two<00:00:50.370> times

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
added amount for orders two times

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.270 
added amount for orders two times
because<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:51.719> we're<00:00:51.840> gonna<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.469> make<00:00:53.070> this

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
because what we're gonna do is make this

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.229 
because what we're gonna do is make this
one<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.550> sum<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:55.590> an<00:00:55.920> average<00:00:56.760> so

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
one a sum and this one an average so

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.240 
one a sum and this one an average so
that's<00:00:57.360> why<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.719> put<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.199> twice<00:00:58.469> going<00:00:59.160> up

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that's why we put this in twice going up

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.380 
that's why we put this in twice going up
to<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> top<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.699> click<00:01:00.030> totals<00:01:02.120> so<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.239> gives

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to the top to click totals so it gives

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.039 
to the top to click totals so it gives
me<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> totals<00:01:04.080> row<00:01:05.479> right<00:01:06.479> here<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.960> we

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
me the totals row right here and we

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.090 
me the totals row right here and we
don't<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.500> be<00:01:07.619> grouped<00:01:07.830> by<00:01:07.950> this

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
don't want it to be grouped by this

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.160 
don't want it to be grouped by this
one's<00:01:08.400> going<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.640> sum<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.720> we're

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
one's going to be sum and then we're

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.620 
one's going to be sum and then we're
gonna<00:01:10.260> look<00:01:10.530> at<00:01:10.680> average<00:01:11.310> amount<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.240> orders

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
gonna look at average amount of orders

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.350 
gonna look at average amount of orders
by<00:01:12.930> supplier<00:01:13.500> name<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.490> then<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.030> leave<00:01:15.210> these

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
by supplier name and then we leave these

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.030 
by supplier name and then we leave these
two<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.869> grouped<00:01:16.409> by<00:01:16.530> we<00:01:16.680> don't<00:01:16.830> need<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
two to be grouped by we don't need to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.609 
two to be grouped by we don't need to
change<00:01:17.310> those<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:20.210> then<00:01:21.210> we're<00:01:22.170> gonna<00:01:22.290> run

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
change those and then we're gonna run

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.510 
change those and then we're gonna run
the<00:01:22.770> query<00:01:23.070> let's<00:01:23.369> see<00:01:23.520> what<00:01:23.640> happens<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:25.520> here

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the query let's see what happens so here

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.069 
the query let's see what happens so here
we<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.240> see<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.380> supplier<00:01:28.829> hopewell

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
we can see that the supplier hopewell

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.999 
we can see that the supplier hopewell
average<00:01:31.079> amount<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:32.090> order<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.680> 116<00:01:34.680> dollars

well it just got name supplier so there
is<00:01:56.650> that<00:01:57.310> query<00:01:57.870> using<00:01:58.870> sum<00:01:59.800> and<00:01:59.980> average<00:02:00.100> for

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
is that query using sum and average for

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.600 
is that query using sum and average for
aggregate<00:02:01.180> functions
