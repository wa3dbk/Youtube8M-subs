00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
got to spend some more time on each bit

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.359 
got to spend some more time on each bit
and<00:00:14.820> plus<00:00:15.330> i'm<00:00:15.509> getting<00:00:16.049> tired<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.619> sore<00:00:16.980> and

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
get the cabinet's hanging on this side I

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.540 
get the cabinet's hanging on this side I
started<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.710> didn't<00:00:28.949> get<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.070> chance<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.369> finish

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
started I didn't get a chance to finish

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.130

the<00:00:49.950> cabinets<00:00:50.340> are<00:00:50.430> dead<00:00:50.730> level<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.930> that's

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
the cabinets are dead level so that's

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.500 
the cabinets are dead level so that's
very<00:00:52.680> intense<00:00:53.550> ceiling<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.390> do

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
very intense ceiling so we have to do

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.959 
very intense ceiling so we have to do
some<00:00:54.719> field<00:00:55.020> work<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.219> fill<00:00:56.430> all<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.760> in

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
over the fridge the one problem that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.070 
over the fridge the one problem that
we're<00:01:12.780> going<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.140> here<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.490> course<00:01:15.080> i

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
we're going to have here is of course i

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.710 
we're going to have here is of course i
measured<00:01:16.740> twice<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.549> cut<00:01:18.030> once<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
measured twice and cut once and

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.539 
measured twice and cut once and
installed<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.409> rail<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.950> these<00:01:20.189> cabinets

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
installed the rail that these cabinets

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.270 
installed the rail that these cabinets
hang<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:22.020> reveal<00:01:22.439> at<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> top<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.130> not

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
hang on and the reveal at the top is not

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.649 
hang on and the reveal at the top is not
big<00:01:23.490> enough<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.970> molding<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.420> i'm<00:01:24.540> going

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
big enough for the molding so i'm going

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.420 
big enough for the molding so i'm going
to<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> take<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> down<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:26.100> see<00:01:26.280> that

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
to have to take it down you see that

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.600 
to have to take it down you see that
molding<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.030> fairly<00:01:27.869> thick<00:01:28.229> there<00:01:28.500> let's<00:01:29.369> take

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
molding is fairly thick there let's take

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.330 
molding is fairly thick there let's take
that<00:01:29.820> down<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.409> and<00:01:32.479> move<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.990> rail<00:01:34.340> little

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that down and and move this rail little

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.380 
that down and and move this rail little
further<00:01:35.520> down<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:35.939> i<00:01:35.970> got<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> do<00:01:36.240> some

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
further down so i got to do some

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.109 
further down so i got to do some
measuring<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:38.250> cabinet<00:01:38.850> right

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
measuring and then this cabinet right

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.730 
measuring and then this cabinet right
kid<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:41.479> plate<00:01:42.479> rack<00:01:42.720> seems<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.200> be<00:01:43.350> from<00:01:43.619> a

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
kid the plate rack seems to be from a

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.620 
kid the plate rack seems to be from a
different<00:01:43.950> model<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.970> different<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
different model and the different the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.929 
different model and the different the
hype<00:01:45.930> from<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.619> hanger<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> top<00:01:47.610> seem<00:01:47.850> to

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
hype from the hanger to the top seem to

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.149 
hype from the hanger to the top seem to
be<00:01:48.119> slightly<00:01:48.570> different<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.979> might

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
be slightly different so that might

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.969 
be slightly different so that might
account<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:50.549> some<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.649> mismatch<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
account for some of the mismatch and the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.760 
account for some of the mismatch and the
measurements<00:01:53.399> too<00:01:53.579> i'm<00:01:53.759> not<00:01:53.939> sure<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.770> i'm

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
measurements too i'm not sure but i'm

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.690 
measurements too i'm not sure but i'm
going<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.950> pull<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.219> down<00:01:56.430> unfortunately

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
going to pull that down unfortunately

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.469 
going to pull that down unfortunately
that's<00:01:57.119> that's<00:01:57.329> not<00:01:57.390> too<00:01:57.659> awful<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.860> rehang
