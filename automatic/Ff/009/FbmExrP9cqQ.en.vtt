situation

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.240 

so<00:01:47.719> the<00:01:47.929> reason<00:01:48.229> that<00:01:48.259> we<00:01:48.469> go<00:01:48.590> out<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:49.009> do

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
so the reason that we go out and do

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.149 
so the reason that we go out and do
Avalanche<00:01:49.729> control<00:01:50.000> is<00:01:50.479> that<00:01:51.049> we're<00:01:51.890> in<00:01:52.100> a

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
Avalanche control is that we're in a

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.459 
Avalanche control is that we're in a

a bunch of snow gets triggered it can

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.779 
a bunch of snow gets triggered it can
