00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.690
 so what are we doing there so must 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.710
 patient the safe the subject builds a mini 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.210
 why is it all about her ? 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.490
 Get gold out of ten teams 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.360
 or from computer parts fathers 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.590
 Of course , the goal continues that 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.690
 if you do not do it right then 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.320
 it is not worth minister penis 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.980
 Do you understand that a little bit almost why 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.490
 do you ask him ten times what is that ? 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.260
 How can I get the ceramic even needed 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.940
 get the ceramic away but that 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.710
 getting gold away 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:30.850
 the gold is the precious must 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.850
 penis hello but okay not everything is 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.570
 So maybe political explain here 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:47.850
 goes without saying here the ceramic tv 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:52.200
 knocked in hammer small to 6 with one 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:57.210
 penis face that was never seen that 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:03.360
 the whole thing looks like this then in the 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:11.370
 inner she puts even more gold because 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:12.800
 it clear here these teams with plastic 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:18.090
 takes in the pliers 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:22.770
 hold her tight and use one 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.300
 Bunsen burner or a storm lighter 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.180
 a comet burner 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:32.489
 it also suffices to guide you 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.800
 when it's warm so the solder gets hot 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.850
 and how it could then run into one 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:44.900
 bowl or plug-ins toppings me 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:47.989
 everything tastes at first thought it all so 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.390
 Of course, you'll pick up the prints 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.940
 collect the extra for amazement collecting 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.600
 collect 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.890
 at the tebus and physically recommend 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.739
 just go to the scrap dealer and 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.090
 looks like selling for what you are 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.780
 the effort is worth it again 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:10.709
 sometimes not so much cost too much time to 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.140
 There was much less than that despite the 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.150
 After twelve euros, the kilo of schools 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.790
 dealer 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.980
 my recommendation in my next 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:29.189
 then compare videos even like it 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:32.959
 goes on with the whole motherboard 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.959
 should do what you should pick up 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.140
 what should do with those here 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:49.230
 which has more possibility which is 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.720
 I'm not worth it until the end 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:58.519
 next bye bye bye 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.519
 would penis stapler over gold
