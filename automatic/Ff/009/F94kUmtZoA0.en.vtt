other<00:02:50.260> other<00:02:51.260> situations<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.430> that<00:02:53.030> where<00:02:53.690> it

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
other other situations and that where it

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.720 
other other situations and that where it
may<00:02:54.440> be<00:02:54.470> possible<00:02:54.800> that<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:55.250> can<00:02:55.400> use<00:02:55.580> this

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
may be possible that you can use this

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.470 
may be possible that you can use this
information<00:02:56.110> but<00:02:57.110> they're<00:02:57.950> rare<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.550> so<00:02:59.060> what

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
information but they're rare and so what

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.920 
information but they're rare and so what
I<00:02:59.510> suggest<00:03:00.020> is<00:03:00.170> is<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:00.500> if<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:01.130> if<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.390> are

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
I suggest is is that if you if you are

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.320 
I suggest is is that if you if you are
still<00:03:03.500> trying<00:03:03.770> to<00:03:03.980> understand<00:03:04.580> higher

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
still trying to understand higher

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.930 
still trying to understand higher
consciousness<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:06.200> ascension<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.580> you<00:03:07.760> go

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
consciousness and ascension that you go

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.000 
consciousness and ascension that you go
on<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:08.270> the<00:03:08.360> school<00:03:08.570> of<00:03:08.720> remembering<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.410> in

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
on to the school of remembering and in

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.700 
on to the school of remembering and in
there<00:03:10.450> we<00:03:11.450> have<00:03:11.480> teachers<00:03:12.080> all<00:03:12.290> over<00:03:12.590> the

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
there we have teachers all over the

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.290 
there we have teachers all over the
world<00:03:12.890> there's<00:03:13.160> hundreds<00:03:13.640> of<00:03:13.730> teachers<00:03:14.120> in

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
world there's hundreds of teachers in

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.020 
world there's hundreds of teachers in
many<00:03:14.990> many<00:03:15.230> languages<00:03:15.740> in<00:03:16.070> 60<00:03:16.460> countries<00:03:16.670> or

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
many many languages in 60 countries or

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.300 
many many languages in 60 countries or
something<00:03:17.360> like<00:03:17.480> this<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:17.900> they<00:03:18.800> know<00:03:19.130> how

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
something like this and they know how

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.800 
something like this and they know how
they've<00:03:19.610> been<00:03:19.760> certified<00:03:20.300> and<00:03:20.480> trained

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
they've been certified and trained

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.930 
they've been certified and trained
deeply<00:03:21.290> on<00:03:21.470> this<00:03:21.620> work<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.070> so<00:03:22.610> they<00:03:22.760> can

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
deeply on this work and so they can

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.820 
deeply on this work and so they can
teach<00:03:23.150> you<00:03:23.330> all<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:24.080> information<00:03:24.320> that<00:03:24.710> you

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
teach you all the information that you

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.710 
teach you all the information that you
need<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.160> know<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.640> then<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:26.270> can<00:03:26.390> go<00:03:26.510> on<00:03:26.540> to

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
need to know and then you can go on to

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.650 
need to know and then you can go on to
this<00:03:26.810> website<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.440> get<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.250> final<00:03:28.910> that<00:03:29.330> last
