 Manage Hayek's why are you the android app? 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.699
 Percent what do you mean 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.470
 New customers who are German 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.089
 per year because 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:27.189
 Minden MT 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.699
 a year more to about 1 50 clock therefore the room the foreigners 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.200
 Musicians now feel at home here 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200
 because it does not affect 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.700
 who are not foreigners 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.750
 though they will not ask you directly 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.140
 Wehrheim does not bet 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.670
 I feel like a wall stood 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.960
 si style and diabetes im now we have to implement for foreigners 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.600
 so 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.940
 Nomura and and the East, which actually is also so obvious to us 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.910
 deep 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.300
 three abstentions 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.700
 in the foreign, I can be what you say no 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.560
 Breaks in India the little galactic fisherman place where I every 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.250
 year 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.730
 but has 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.730
 They have me for a German artist 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.940
 during a tour but what the problem percentage of foreigners in itself 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.630
 flies the earth 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.570
 but he was not just the sum but we have to think about how 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.760
 we can provide the home end with an environment 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.070
 in which the free development is not for everyone 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.210
 lesser untruth finds again 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.210
 Yes, it is raised 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.930
 Â«We feel 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.320
 times 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.280
 an example 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.230
 Summer at 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.160
 for lesson example also as they are so often our foreign 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.250
 fellow citizens 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.130
 Do not want to send her child% mom report for swimming lessons 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.320
 because they are not surprised that the reporters and also that Toni 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.600
 in the ground as the Mainzer is seen 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.470
 ca 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.050
 check out this before the Aarauer this swimming lessons he had one 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.130
 sustained clouding of even the nearness of man is inviolable 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:17.290
 and then who our compromise proposal looks like then the O'Brien for example 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.929
 always with an eye on touch 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.339
 I have 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:24.259
 we have to take the house 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.259
 Ernst make clear my benefits of integration 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.129
 we have to tie that up 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.129
 so that the stranger feels at home 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.169
 colonies 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.169
 colonies 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.409
 the Tunisians and the poorest halve instead 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:48.239
 and the next logical step better 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.919
 Freedom could 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.919
 Boss there are so many empty inner cities 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:58.549
 in the East 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.609
 Melor 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.360
 new infrastructure 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.169
 a lot of space low prices 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:07.459
 when the foreigner is under himself 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.059
 then he feels able to hold on 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:11.859
 So I dared end 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.409
 Habitat in the northeast
