00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello, welcome, I'm a teacher 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.319
 manoel viana I'm here for today 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.690
 discuss with you a test question 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.259
 of a contest that was held in 2010 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.639
 in the state of são paulo the proof was already 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.800
 this contest is exactly for 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.890
 fill positions of teacher of 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.449
 basic mathematics education and the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.180
 that we are going to discuss the issue of 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.660
 number 36 of that test that says 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.910
 next in the equation x to the cube plus 3 x 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.360
 square plus x - 1 to 0 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.570
 substituted by x by z - one yields a 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.489
 equation in z100 the term quadrat cco that 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.129
 facilitates its resolution 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.829
 from this can also be obtained the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.010
 Original solutions of the equation 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.590
 What are we then going to get this 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.199
 equation to replace the x for example - a 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.559
 it is enough to make stock x square in the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.239
 place of the xa people puts c - one here 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.239
 I will not be staying here with a 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.080
 x - the stage for another three times x - 1 to 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.350
 square plus and minus one minus the iguazu 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.320
 is developing z - a stage you go 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.580
 find zé okubo at least three errors to the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.880
 square plus 3 - 1 and easy - a square 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.770
 exel square minus two and more then 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.950
 We have, I said the first one here. 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.460
 we have 10 with at least 30 more square 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.409
 three and one less that I keep three out 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.860
 the parenthesis develops here it goes 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.790
 give zero square minus two and more 1 and 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.189
 continues with z - 1 - 1 to 0 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.460
 here I distribute three times is the 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.850
 square 3 is the square three times less 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.579
 206 ze three times 1 and 3 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.960
 so this equation is here now the people 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.259
 can reduce similar terms 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.530
 doing here ó eliminating here - three and 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.369
 a square with three more is the square and 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.250
 here is the 3 positive I have - 1 - 1 - 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.829
 You can cancel all this, right? 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.690
 at least three is the square plus three is the 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.760
 square 3 positive has - 1 - 1 - 1 - 3 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.250
 that I can cancel here then what? 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.819
 left to tell the cube 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.160
 3643 and minus six and gives three less and more 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.920
 and it will be minus two and then I'm 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.620
 now with the museum occupying less 2.0 looks 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.870
 only this equation was induced to it here 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.790
 people can now put a little 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.920
 housing putting in evidence will 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.540
 keep z is z which multiplies the square 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.400
 - 2 to 0 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.980
 product of two numbers equals zero 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.330
 then these two numbers equals zero 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.400
 the zebu at 0 or z is the square minus two 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.880
 guards he has continued step 2 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.950
 on the other hand z squared equal to 2 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.340
 then zebu to more or less square root 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.250
 of two I do not know which squadron of 2 11 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.880
 water - the 23- root squares of equation 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.470
 in z the roots of equations 10 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.200
 the choice of the first two to explore 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.930
 two then if the mistake can lead you to 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.599
 alternative brand because that is a mistake 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.400
 because he does not want the resolution him 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.160
 is not asking you to put the 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.739
 root of the equation z it that the root of 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.380
 equation then he wants to know the 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.930
 value of x to know the value of xa 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.170
 We know that guazzi x minus one 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.319
 then get x almost minus 1 replacing 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.480
 I used it for 0 for example so I used the same 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:37.540
 to x 1 to 0 - 1 logo x equal - o 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.370
 replaced x osei sorry for the 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.880
 square root of two then you have x 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.579
 equal to the squad of 2 - 1 and replacing 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.579
 I used for less the squad of 2 70 x 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.889
 equal to minus the history of 2008 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:54.190
 Original equation least one roots are 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:55.780
 square root of 2 - 1 - square root 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.569
 of 2 - 1 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.359
 which of these three roots is any company 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.489
 that appears here in the alternatives 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.620
 appears square root of 2 - 1 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.139
 the alternative can then mark with 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.569
 alternative certainty and as being the 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.430
 Correct alternative for this question ok 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.170
 so that's it, I hope you 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.190
 have tanned and promised to return 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.389
 brief with other commented questions 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.049
 corrected and commented to you a 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.049
 hugs and see you later
