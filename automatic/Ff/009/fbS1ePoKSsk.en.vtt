80 millimeter mortar it does not have
any<00:00:19.279> 7.62<00:00:20.279> millimeters<00:00:20.880> or<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.660> believe<00:00:22.080> what

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
any 7.62 millimeters or I believe what

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.839 
any 7.62 millimeters or I believe what
does<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.859> calibers<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.730> like<00:00:24.289> 12<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:26.070> 7

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
does that in calibers is like 12 to 7

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.259 
does that in calibers is like 12 to 7
points<00:00:27.119> no<00:00:27.480> that's<00:00:27.750> that's<00:00:28.019> millimeters

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
points no that's that's millimeters

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.759 
points no that's that's millimeters
maybe<00:00:30.269> it'd<00:00:30.420> be<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> 30<00:00:30.869> caliber<00:00:31.080> no<00:00:31.500> 30

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
maybe it'd be a 30 caliber no 30

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.090 
maybe it'd be a 30 caliber no 30
calibers<00:00:32.279> on<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> side<00:00:33.260> because<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.440> was<00:00:34.649> too

laggy some some of the armor on this is
broken<00:00:38.760> already<00:00:38.879> because<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.390> seen<00:00:39.600> battle

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
frames like you the entire hole is like

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.369 
frames like you the entire hole is like
five<00:00:55.559> millimeters<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.030> penetration<00:00:57.390> we

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
five millimeters and the penetration we

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.049 
five millimeters and the penetration we
made<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.649> board<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.039> aluminum<00:00:59.489> foil<00:00:59.789> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
made this board I have aluminum foil and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.520 
made this board I have aluminum foil and
duct<00:01:00.239> tape<00:01:00.449> well<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> hall<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.289> five

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
duct tape well the hall is like five

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.900 
duct tape well the hall is like five
millimeters<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.190> penetration<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
millimeters in the penetration of the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.910 
millimeters in the penetration of the
guns<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.480> 13<00:01:03.930> millimeters<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.650> tried

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
guns it's like 13 millimeters so I tried

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.649 
guns it's like 13 millimeters so I tried
to<00:01:04.949> try<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> balance<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.119> little<00:01:06.390> bit

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
to try to balance it out a little bit

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.130 
to try to balance it out a little bit
not<00:01:07.200> make<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.530> such<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> Swiss<00:01:08.220> cheese<00:01:08.250> affair

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
not make it such a Swiss cheese affair

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.859 
not make it such a Swiss cheese affair
the<00:01:10.140> ammo<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.720> then

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the ammo is here and here and then

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.660 
the ammo is here and here and then
there's<00:01:13.080> an<00:01:13.619> engine<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.400> engine

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
there's an engine here but the engine

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.280 
there's an engine here but the engine
doesn't<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:15.030> anything<00:01:15.330> except<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:15.659> provide<00:01:16.259> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
doesn't do anything except for provide a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.530 
doesn't do anything except for provide a
sound<00:01:16.650> because<00:01:16.979> getting<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.090> an<00:01:18.180> engine<00:01:18.450> to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
sound because getting in an engine to

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.539 
sound because getting in an engine to
turn<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.750> propeller<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.380> water<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:20.070> fin<00:01:20.310> tool

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
turn a propeller and water with fin tool

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.910 
turn a propeller and water with fin tool
to<00:01:21.299> make<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.479> boat<00:01:21.689> go<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.439> hard<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.770> make

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
to make a boat go it's hard to make

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.840 
to make a boat go it's hard to make
those<00:01:23.070> go<00:01:23.310> fast

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
those go fast

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.720 
those go fast
when<00:01:25.180> you<00:01:25.270> get<00:01:25.390> in<00:01:25.510> you<00:01:26.500> have<00:01:26.530> this<00:01:27.220> display

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
when you get in you have this display

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.750 
when you get in you have this display
here<00:01:28.240> there's<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.200> red<00:01:29.410> ball<00:01:29.620> follows<00:01:30.520> your

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
here there's a red ball follows your

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.900 
here there's a red ball follows your
cursor<00:01:31.390> it<00:01:31.750> was<00:01:31.870> made<00:01:32.080> by<00:01:32.260> Sir<00:01:32.830> Dobber<00:01:33.340> who<00:01:33.640> is

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
cursor it was made by Sir Dobber who is

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.500 
cursor it was made by Sir Dobber who is
the<00:01:34.780> man<00:01:34.990> he<00:01:35.500> did<00:01:35.650> a<00:01:35.680> very<00:01:35.860> good<00:01:35.980> job<00:01:36.130> on<00:01:36.430> it<00:01:36.550> you

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
the man he did a very good job on it you

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.730 
the man he did a very good job on it you
can<00:01:37.630> limit<00:01:37.780> your<00:01:37.930> turret<00:01:38.260> Traverse<00:01:38.560> speed

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
can limit your turret Traverse speed

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.220 
can limit your turret Traverse speed
your<00:01:39.100> turret<00:01:39.430> height<00:01:40.120> speed<00:01:40.570> which<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.080> can

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
your turret height speed which you can

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.560 
your turret height speed which you can
see<00:01:41.410> here<00:01:41.980> how<00:01:42.400> I<00:01:42.430> could<00:01:42.640> turn<00:01:42.790> faster<00:01:43.300> than

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
see here how I could turn faster than

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.150 
see here how I could turn faster than
turret<00:01:43.810> turns<00:01:44.050> it's<00:01:44.740> just<00:01:44.890> a<00:01:44.980> very

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
turret turns it's just a very

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.950 
turret turns it's just a very
complicated<00:01:45.550> control<00:01:46.300> these<00:01:46.420> turrets<00:01:46.750> it's

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
complicated control these turrets it's

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.680 
complicated control these turrets it's
really<00:01:47.290> used<00:01:47.470> it's<00:01:48.100> it's<00:01:48.460> kind<00:01:49.030> of<00:01:49.180> wonky<00:01:49.480> on

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
really used it's it's kind of wonky on

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.880 
really used it's it's kind of wonky on
the<00:01:49.870> water<00:01:50.080> because<00:01:50.320> there's<00:01:50.590> so<00:01:50.740> much

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
the water because there's so much

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.030 
the water because there's so much
rocking<00:01:51.430> with<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.730> boats<00:01:52.030> but<00:01:52.530> like<00:01:53.530> how<00:01:53.890> it

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
rocking with the boats but like how it

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.609 
rocking with the boats but like how it
sounds<00:01:54.460> when<00:01:54.580> you<00:01:54.640> turn<00:01:54.940> sometimes<00:01:55.480> but<00:01:55.810> but

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
sounds when you turn sometimes but but

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.150 
sounds when you turn sometimes but but
