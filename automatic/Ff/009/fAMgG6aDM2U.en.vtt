on-road specific tires their street
tires<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:13.860> it's<00:00:13.980> really<00:00:14.130> silly<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.940> drive

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
tires so it's really silly to drive

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.200

off-road<00:00:16.020> with<00:00:16.410> street<00:00:16.920> specific<00:00:17.400> tires<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.150> I

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
off-road with street specific tires so I

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.179 
off-road with street specific tires so I
went<00:00:18.390> ahead<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.570> swapped<00:00:19.020> out<00:00:19.199> those<00:00:19.920> tires

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
went ahead and swapped out those tires

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.189 
went ahead and swapped out those tires
for<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.699> real<00:00:21.090> entire<00:00:21.510> set<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.930> comes<00:00:22.020> with

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
for the real entire set that comes with

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.779 
for the real entire set that comes with
the<00:00:22.320> Nitro<00:00:22.800> wr8

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the Nitro wr8

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.700 
the Nitro wr8
well<00:00:24.119> one<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.630> them<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:25.199> comes<00:00:25.410> with<00:00:25.560> these

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
well one of them that comes with these

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.380 
well one of them that comes with these
gravel<00:00:26.310> tires<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.849> that's<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.359> a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
gravel tires so that's going to be a

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.240 
gravel tires so that's going to be a
little<00:00:27.630> bit<00:00:27.779> better<00:00:27.930> for<00:00:28.380> going<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.740> multiple

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
little bit better for going on multiple

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.220 
little bit better for going on multiple
surfaces<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:30.240> other<00:00:30.359> modification<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.170> I

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
surfaces the other modification that I

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.799 
surfaces the other modification that I
did<00:00:31.470> there's<00:00:31.890> only<00:00:32.070> two<00:00:32.309> cut<00:00:33.120> off<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.450> front

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
did there's only two cut off the front

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.299 
did there's only two cut off the front
splitter<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.320> little<00:00:34.590> bit<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:34.890> took<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.160> little

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
splitter a little bit just took a little

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.160 
splitter a little bit just took a little
bit<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.670> arrow<00:00:36.180> off<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.050> an

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
bit of that arrow off of it it's an

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.110 
bit of that arrow off of it it's an
on-road<00:00:37.620> specific<00:00:38.190> style<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.879> they<00:00:38.969> have

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
on-road specific style that they have

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.209 
on-road specific style that they have

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
for this body for the ken Block Gymkhana

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.889 
for this body for the ken Block Gymkhana
edition<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.000> cut<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.329> off<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.600> give<00:00:42.719> me<00:00:42.809> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
edition so I cut that off to give me a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.229 
edition so I cut that off to give me a
little<00:00:43.110> bit<00:00:43.260> more<00:00:43.500> space<00:00:44.280> under<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.940> front<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
little bit more space under the front a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.610 
little bit more space under the front a
little<00:00:45.329> better<00:00:45.539> approach<00:00:45.870> angle<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.500> it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
little better approach angle just so it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.650 
little better approach angle just so it
would<00:00:46.710> scrape<00:00:47.070> quite<00:00:47.340> as<00:00:47.460> much<00:00:47.640> now<00:00:48.210> let's<00:00:48.510> see

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
would scrape quite as much now let's see

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.209 
would scrape quite as much now let's see
how<00:00:48.840> many<00:00:48.899> different<00:00:49.350> surfaces<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.829> can<00:00:50.010> drive

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
how many different surfaces I can drive

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.490 
how many different surfaces I can drive
this<00:00:50.370> thing<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.760> successfully<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:52.170> single

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
this thing on successfully on one single

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.710 
this thing on successfully on one single
battery

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:04:52.750 

you

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.350 

what<00:04:53.390> do<00:04:53.480> I<00:04:53.510> even<00:04:53.720> need<00:04:54.020> to<00:04:54.050> say
