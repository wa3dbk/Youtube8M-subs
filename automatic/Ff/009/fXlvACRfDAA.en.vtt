 see with any car that we have 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.770
 the view then we'll have to see 

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:13.420
 would be 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.159
 to the bottom and once we have 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.170

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.270
 ok bridge we see once we get on 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.609
 boom we would be inside the walt bridge 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.009
 we could kill everyone wherever 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:33.899
 that I think here if we can kill them 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:37.290
 see to see that you do not mess with me 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:42.210

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.340
 look where things are comrades 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.100
 savior how are these things where 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.500
 I can point automatically 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.600

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.310
 ok because we see that is not apart 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.110
 nothing else we have this we can walk 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.909
 all this apart from here we can come 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.890
 here to annoy those who are involved 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.299
 Losantos customs we could shoot the 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.700
 to go up here as they saw 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.750
 right now or we could even launch 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.120
 bombs I think you can throw 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.160
 explosives and bombs to see 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.580
 on base we could even bother the 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.580
 police 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.580
 here is avatar but good is a wing 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.590
 very simple list very easy to make 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.480
 so that he troll in his friends so that 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.010
 hide from a reward or to 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.290
 flee from the police what you 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.700
 they want to do I would see it as a troll 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.290
 so that you can troll your 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.920
 friends as you want but here 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.459
 from this side we can not kill them 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.140
 well the issues and I'm killing the 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.540
 I will kill eggs here just have to have 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.099
 waters because they can shoot us that 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.840

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.610
 who burns everything from outside but good 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.440

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.380
 that taste this little wahlberg here in 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.480
