00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
so it's dual density foam with the poly

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.790 
so it's dual density foam with the poly
insert<00:00:22.300> it's<00:00:22.600> a<00:00:22.630> good<00:00:22.900> level<00:00:23.110> protection<00:00:23.380> up

triangle shapes here are a mesh that
adds<00:00:58.420> more<00:00:58.719> ventilation<00:00:59.079> that's<00:00:59.530> going<00:00:59.679> to

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
adds more ventilation that's going to

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.160 
adds more ventilation that's going to
continue<00:01:00.010> all<00:01:00.249> the<00:01:00.280> way<00:01:00.339> throughout<00:01:00.609> the<00:01:00.819> pant

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
continue all the way throughout the pant

continue all the way throughout the pant
moving<00:01:02.170> down<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:02.559> pant<00:01:03.399> here<00:01:03.729> the<00:01:04.720> body<00:01:04.960> of

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
moving down the pant here the body of

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.940 
moving down the pant here the body of
the<00:01:05.260> pant<00:01:05.500> is<00:01:05.710> a<00:01:05.880> 420d<00:01:06.960> nylon<00:01:07.960> so<00:01:08.500> a<00:01:08.530> pretty

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
the pant is a 420d nylon so a pretty

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.770 
the pant is a 420d nylon so a pretty
standard<00:01:09.400> issue<00:01:09.580> for<00:01:09.850> this<00:01:09.910> level<00:01:10.270> pant<00:01:10.540> and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
standard issue for this level pant and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.990 
standard issue for this level pant and
then<00:01:10.960> you<00:01:11.110> do<00:01:11.290> have<00:01:11.320> some<00:01:11.670> some<00:01:12.670> higher

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
then you do have some some higher

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.200 
then you do have some some higher
abrasion<00:01:13.630> wear<00:01:13.900> areas<00:01:14.230> so<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.430> panel<00:01:15.670> askin

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
abrasion wear areas so the panel askin

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.190 
abrasion wear areas so the panel askin
you<00:01:16.300> know<00:01:16.390> going<00:01:16.540> up<00:01:16.630> against<00:01:16.870> the<00:01:16.990> boards

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
you know going up against the boards

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.560 
you know going up against the boards
this<00:01:17.620> is<00:01:17.680> where<00:01:18.010> you<00:01:18.100> really<00:01:18.190> hit<00:01:18.520> it<00:01:18.670> so<00:01:19.480> you

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
this is where you really hit it so you

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.060 
this is where you really hit it so you
get<00:01:19.690> some<00:01:19.840> good<00:01:19.990> durability<00:01:20.380> on<00:01:20.650> the<00:01:20.740> side<00:01:20.950> of

look at the tailbone protection and the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.020 
look at the tailbone protection and the
9<00:02:49.870> K<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.680> can<00:02:50.770> see<00:02:50.920> it's<00:02:51.040> nicely<00:02:51.220> segmented

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
9 K you can see it's nicely segmented

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.600 
9 K you can see it's nicely segmented
throughout<00:02:52.330> this<00:02:53.110> is<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.470> high-density<00:02:54.160> foam

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
throughout this is a high-density foam

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.640 
throughout this is a high-density foam
to<00:02:54.880> offer<00:02:54.970> great<00:02:55.180> protection<00:02:55.300> as<00:02:55.810> well<00:02:56.290> as<00:02:56.470> it

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
to offer great protection as well as it

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.940 
to offer great protection as well as it
has<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.880> poly<00:02:58.180> inserts<00:02:58.690> that<00:02:58.840> run<00:02:59.080> to

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
has the poly inserts that run to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.500 
has the poly inserts that run to
different<00:03:00.310> sections<00:03:00.700> actually<00:03:00.970> one<00:03:01.150> here<00:03:01.390> and

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
different sections actually one here and

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.090 
different sections actually one here and
then<00:03:01.600> one<00:03:01.630> here<00:03:01.810> so<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.500> really<00:03:02.650> kind<00:03:02.800> of<00:03:02.890> moves

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
then one here so it really kind of moves

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.590 
then one here so it really kind of moves
with<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.430> player<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:03.820> offers<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.090> good<00:03:04.300> level

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
with the player and offers a good level

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.960 
with the player and offers a good level
protection<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.070> was<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.190> quick<00:03:06.430> look<00:03:06.610> at<00:03:06.820> the

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
protection so I was a quick look at the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.270 
protection so I was a quick look at the
