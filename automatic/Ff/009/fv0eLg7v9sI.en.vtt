00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.210
 in this video I will describe the way 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.400
 correct to work with the system 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.730
 Creation of 2015 schedules for the 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.390
 school garcilaso la vega de comas 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.840
 let's first observe the sheet called 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.610
 general information in which for the 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.680
 next year probably wanting 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.410
 using the system is going to serve this 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.710
 video as a description the first thing that 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.079
 it will do is 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.670
 place the names of each teacher by 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.800
 example the first teacher is July 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.340
 ubillus according to the number of the cap and the 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.550
 teach the math course I'm here 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.610
 we will choose to list as 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.680
 the teacher's course and the code is going to 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.900
 generate automatically for example if 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.960
 if assuming 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.850
 cubillos teaches communication 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.970
 it is automatically generated as no 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.930
 communication so this can not be 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.659
 move 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.520
 in the part 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.850
 right let's look at the list of 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.180
 teachers 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.850
 according to the order as planned 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.990
 as it is raised in the with the number 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.850
 of caps 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.220
 what if, for example, the teacher 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.740
 Jorge Cuba which is the number two under 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.380
 cap teaches more than one course then 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.780
 let's put the number of courses 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.479
 that teaches and we will place your number 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.280
 of layer on the side in this case are going to 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.580
 generate three codes for the teacher 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.130
 what would be two epg because in that 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.110
 year history peru 12 fcc because the 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.569
 teaches family citizenship and two hours of 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.909
 tutoring because he is tutor of this 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.580
 way we will go placing all the 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.520
 names and all courses or tutorials 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.100
 that the one that each teacher uses next 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.700
 left we will observe that it has 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.100
 separated by degrees and sections 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.380
 all the classrooms of the school d in this 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.649
 case the secondary level we are going to 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.899
 observe in the left list all the 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.959
 the courses that are assigned for the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.600
 first high school and here we are going 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.910
 picking out 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.730
 the teacher who has been assigned as 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.290
 order of address to each grade in this 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.200
 case for example to the first of 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.410
 secondary the first one has been 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.090
 assigned to teacher number 4 which is 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.090
 the nativity teacher 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.420
 and so we will go assigning the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.450
 teachers that have been defined according to 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.330
 management orders 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.480
 now let's place in the part 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.250
 right the hours allotted for each 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.670
 course in this case mathematics the has 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.940
 placed 66 communication 3 of 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.760
 history of Peru and so on 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.530
 let's do this work that maybe 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.330
 be a bit heavy but that is going to 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.030
 serve for later 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.310
 on the next page we will see the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.800
 purpose of this system in which 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.430
 let's go squares the hours of each 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.140
 teacher to start with this kind of 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.940
 work the first thing that you have to 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.670
 to do is define the free hours for 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.310
 each teacher in this case according to the order 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.290
 of cap the teacher or the teacher in 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.500
 this case the teacher stop that is the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.440
 number 3 chosen on Monday as as 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.480
 free day the professor gentleman and in the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.300
 tomorrow the English teacher the 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.850
 teacher 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.370
 Judith Mesa and Professor Kokang have 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.800
 chosen the morning shift if it is that 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.830
 It can not exceed three if there 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.930
 that other teacher with the possibility of 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.000
 choose shift tomorrow- then 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.030
 automatically go to the second option 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.140
 that he chose since according to the order of 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.660
 cap would be coming out of those of 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.180
 maximum number of teachers with the 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.129
 Free hours 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.409
 let's go ordering all the 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.269
 teachers according to the day they chose or 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.050
 according to what is being assigned by 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.120
 commission 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.460
 once we start with this and 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.450
 we start with the filling we are going to 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.940
 observe 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.030
 two types of formats conditioned in 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:23.530
 which the first type of color is that 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:27.530
 that allows us to determine when it has 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.870
 there has been a misuse of the box 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.900
 hours of the framing of hours as per 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.260
 example assign to monday a teacher 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.830
 have free days on Monday by 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.230
 example if we assign here 5 fcc we can 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.170
 observe that it shows green and 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.010
 the system tells us where is the the 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.600
 wrong 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.830
 the bad assignment of the time that in 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.980
 this case for not having or for violating 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.170
 the rule of having no day off when 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.600
 we want to square the hours 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:01.580
 we will also see another type of format 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.930
 that in this case for example is given 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:08.900
 when when we go to place two 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.060
 hours of a single teacher in different 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.300
 classrooms that in this case we call 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.990
 the crossing in this case the crosses are going 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.610
 coloring 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:21.420
 red and with light red background 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.960
 this way 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.310
 the job then consists of this 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.110
 type of work involves replacing 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.110
 what is manually done with the 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.690
 chips and with it with the paper or graph and 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.580
 avoiding being stuck all the 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.100
 chips that many times visually 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.430
 we also are we going vision 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:45.150
 this system allows at least treat 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.490
 to improve that if that manual system and 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.860
 try to avoid as much of 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.750
 mistakes unfortunately the system does not 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.370
 does the distribution automatically 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.800
 but we also do it in a way 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.750
 manual but this time already with the 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.780
 limitations that allows us to do this 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.880
 system once we have placed the 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.610
 box we have squared hours 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.630
 all hours for teachers 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.700
 obviously not all are going to be 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.970
 according to the distribution but 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:14.220
 unfortunately things like that even with a 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.849
 system can be made perfect the 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.909
 hour box 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:21.369
 to finish with this video we will go 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:24.099
 with the last part that in this case 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:26.589
 interesting the address that is the 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:27.759
 allocation of schedules for each 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:29.379
 teacher 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:31.300
 what if, for example, I want to choose 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:34.629
 for the first teacher that in this case 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:37.119
 is july ubillus for legal virus yes yes 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:39.159
 we put your name here on the list 

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:41.770
 then we will observe that he 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:44.050
 he only teaches the morning his 24 hours 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.389
 and that Monday has been assigned to 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:50.349
 which we see on Tuesdays and Thursdays is its 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:52.360
 free day in the afternoon shift does not have 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:54.939
 nothing because he is only a professor of 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.409
 the morning in the code only 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:58.900
 observe a code because it teaches you 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:00.970
 only one course 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.600
 in the case of the teacher cuba for example 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:07.780
 he does not teach in the morning he only 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:11.380
 teaches afternoons and he has three courses 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:13.889
 assigned history the peru family form 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:17.159
 citizenship training and tutoring 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:20.939
 and so we will search for any 

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:24.330
 teacher or teacher and according to the search 

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:27.169
 which is supposed to be sought from the 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:31.699
 assignment of their hours in the block 

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:31.699
 then your schedule is being generated 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.880
 so if you want to 

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.200
 finalize this video is so if it is 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.020
 what we want to print 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.760
 we simply press control py 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.730
 we can see that this is going to come out in 

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:50.220
 a single sheet and that you can deliver the 

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:52.340
 One-time schedule printed for each 

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.340
 teacher
