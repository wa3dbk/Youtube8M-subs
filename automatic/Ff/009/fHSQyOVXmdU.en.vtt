Welcome to the fifth day of Intel Extreme Masters. This time I am with Diamond, our jungler. Diamond, many consider you to be one of the most innovative junglers. How do you come up with new ideas in regards to implementing new champions and how did you realize that your team should counter jungle?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Diamond: Actually, when it comes to implementing new champions in the jungle, I grasp new ideas from patch and meta changes. I just browse through the list of champions and think about how can a particular one function as a jungler, by trying to comprehend his capabilities. If one seems to fit to this role, I test him. Provided that he passes the test, I start using him. Sometimes they appear from solo ranked, when I see someone perform well. In this case I just steal his idea, improve it and start using it myself.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
In what way do you test them? Do you manipulate with runes and masteries or do you tend to test them during scrims with your team?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Diamond: It is mostly tested in solo ranked, but team is involved as well. You need to see how he can contribute - how does he gank different lanes,  how does he take dragons, how safely he can move through non-warded jungle, how safely he can ward the opposing jungle, whether he can invade and quickly steal buffs and so on.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Recently you popularized two champions, Nasus and Volibear. When it comes to it, do you think you have an advantage, when heroes you have implemented are picked against you?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Diamond: Not always. Mostly, like it turned out with Nasus and Volibear, I do have an advantage, when they are picked against us, since so far, as far as I have seen, nobody contributed to their development. I know what these champions are capable of, so I know how to counter them.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:41.000
During your first match at LCS against EG you tried to use Udyr. Did all come down to taking an early Dragon or was there anything else behind this pick?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Diamond: At that time Udyr was a very strong jungler, one of the best, actually, since Volibear and Nasus were relatively weak at that point. Well, Volibear was more or less fine, whereas Nasus wasn't. Udyr is very tanky - his passive got a buff back then (4% magic and armor resistance per stack). Besides taking a very early Dragon, he was a brilliant tank in team fight, but it didn't work out in the end.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
What is he lacking to become a frequent pick for you?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Diamond: Nasus and Volibear came out.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Here at Intel Extreme Masters many teams are frequently using champions like Skarner, Jarvan, Shen and Vi. What do you think about their viability and why didn't you use them yourself at IEM?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Diamond: I think that all of them but Vi are relatively weak as junglers. Perhaps Shen is worth to be a jungler, but he is much stronger as solo top champion, therefore you shouldn't use him as a jungler, unless you can't play other imbalanced junglers. Skarner is totally useless. That's it.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000
In his interview Darien said that you and Alex are responsible for bans during the draft. Why is it so? Do you tend to follow other teams more than your teammates or are there any other reasons?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Diamond: Mostly, it is me and Alex, who are following our opponents' official games and solo ranked data. Two of us jointly decide whom we should and should not ban.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Was there any team at this tournament that managed to surprise you or were all victories achieved due to mistakes of the opposition?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Diamond: Frost did. I didn't know that their jungler can play Xin. 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Six players were nominated for MVP title, among them are five Koreans: StarLast, Raven, Flame, Shy and Woong, and OverPow from Anexis. Would you vote for one of them or would you nominate someone else?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Diamond: I'd vote for Shy. His performance was the best at this tournament. He doesn't make mistakes as such, he excellently handles most overpowered champions of current patch and meta. He deserves it.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Right now you have a really intensive schedule. How do you deal with it? You spend only three days at home per week, yet most of the time you are training.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Diamond: It is quite difficult. You get exhausted, but you get used to it. Even if you have to fly without sleeping for the past 24 hours, you can get an hour of sleep here and there.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
In a week from now you are going to Dallas. What do you know about the teams you are going to play against?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Diamond: I know that there are going to be relatively strong teams from NA. We will finally get a chance to compare the skill level between Europe and NA. We will finally get to know, whether NA teams did manage to learn something over the course of the past six months.  I am sure that KT Rolster B will reach the final, since they are the strongest Asian team. I don't think Americans will be able to challenge them. I hope to face them in the final and to demonstrate a good level of play.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
I hope so too. Do you have anything to say to your fans, friends and family?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Diamond: I would like to thank our sponsors for being there for us. I would like to thank Pringles for their delicious offering. I would like to thank my relatives for supporting me.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Thank you for watching this interview and see you in Dallas!
