I will constantly scuba comm in this
session<00:00:06.850> we<00:00:07.000> look<00:00:07.120> at<00:00:07.180> the<00:00:07.240> oceanic<00:00:07.690> vo3<00:00:08.020> dive

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.530 
session we look at the oceanic vo3 dive

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.629 
session we look at the oceanic vo3 dive
computer<00:00:08.770> let's<00:00:09.730> take<00:00:09.910> a<00:00:09.940> closer<00:00:10.210> look<00:00:10.299> a

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
computer let's take a closer look a

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.799 
computer let's take a closer look a
number<00:00:12.639> of<00:00:12.730> oceanic<00:00:12.850> dive<00:00:13.240> computers

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
number of oceanic dive computers

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.299 
number of oceanic dive computers
including<00:00:14.289> the<00:00:14.379> one<00:00:14.500> we're<00:00:14.619> taking<00:00:14.920> a<00:00:15.010> look<00:00:15.129> at

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
including the one we're taking a look at

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.160 
including the one we're taking a look at
today<00:00:15.639> gives<00:00:16.240> you<00:00:16.330> the<00:00:16.449> ability<00:00:16.570> to<00:00:16.810> switch

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
today gives you the ability to switch

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.320 
today gives you the ability to switch
between<00:00:17.320> two<00:00:17.680> different<00:00:17.980> algorithms<00:00:18.330> the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
between two different algorithms the

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.510 
between two different algorithms the
advantage<00:00:19.750> of<00:00:19.960> this<00:00:20.140> is<00:00:20.470> it<00:00:20.950> means<00:00:21.280> it<00:00:21.400> can

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
advantage of this is it means it can

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.310 
advantage of this is it means it can
mimic<00:00:21.700> most<00:00:22.150> of<00:00:22.330> the<00:00:22.390> dive<00:00:22.600> computers<00:00:23.080> on<00:00:23.230> the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
mimic most of the dive computers on the

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.470 
mimic most of the dive computers on the
market<00:00:23.770> so<00:00:24.250> if<00:00:24.340> your<00:00:24.460> buddy<00:00:24.820> is<00:00:25.150> using<00:00:25.420> a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
market so if your buddy is using a

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.870 
market so if your buddy is using a
different<00:00:25.840> computer<00:00:26.200> you<00:00:26.920> can<00:00:27.070> adjust<00:00:27.400> it<00:00:27.580> to

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
different computer you can adjust it to

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.930 
different computer you can adjust it to
provide<00:00:28.120> a<00:00:28.180> similar<00:00:28.600> profile<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:30.670> gives<00:00:30.850> you

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:30.940 
provide a similar profile this gives you

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.360 
provide a similar profile this gives you
the<00:00:31.030> flexibility<00:00:31.600> for<00:00:31.840> safety<00:00:32.370> providing

the flexibility for safety providing

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.220 
the flexibility for safety providing
much<00:00:33.789> more<00:00:34.000> conservative<00:00:34.360> options<00:00:35.020> if

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
much more conservative options if

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.240 
much more conservative options if
required<00:00:35.560> giving<00:00:36.400> you<00:00:36.460> a<00:00:36.489> safer<00:00:36.850> dive<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:39.100> some

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
required giving you a safer dive so some

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.170 
required giving you a safer dive so some
of<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.400> features<00:00:39.489> you've<00:00:39.790> got<00:00:39.880> on<00:00:39.970> the<00:00:40.030> dive

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180

onto your PC so let's take a look at the

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.690 
onto your PC so let's take a look at the
menu<00:02:00.189> system<00:02:00.579> on<00:02:00.669> the<00:02:00.729> computer<00:02:01.149> now<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.520> as<00:02:03.609> we

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
menu system on the computer now so as we

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.339 
menu system on the computer now so as we
said<00:02:03.849> before<00:02:04.209> we<00:02:04.299> have<00:02:04.389> a<00:02:04.450> nice<00:02:04.599> clear<00:02:04.959> display

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:05.349 
said before we have a nice clear display

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:06.779 
said before we have a nice clear display
on<00:02:05.529> the<00:02:05.649> front<00:02:05.919> here<00:02:06.159> displays<00:02:06.609> all<00:02:06.759> your

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.999 
on the front here displays all your
vital<00:02:06.909> information<00:02:07.739> there's<00:02:08.739> a<00:02:08.830> water

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
vital information there's a water

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.620 
vital information there's a water
activated<00:02:09.459> computer<00:02:10.000> as<00:02:10.119> well<00:02:10.239> so<00:02:10.420> once<00:02:10.509> you

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
activated computer as well so once you

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.300 
activated computer as well so once you
do<00:02:10.780> enter<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.110> water<00:02:11.290> automatically<00:02:11.980> switch

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
do enter the water automatically switch

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.030 
do enter the water automatically switch
on<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:12.820> go<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.510> dive<00:02:13.720> mode<00:02:14.050> this<00:02:14.830> makes

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
on and go to the dive mode this makes

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.320 
on and go to the dive mode this makes
life<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.370> whole<00:02:15.400> lot<00:02:15.520> easier<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:16.030> don't<00:02:16.060> have

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
life a whole lot easier you don't have

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.800 
life a whole lot easier you don't have
to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
to

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.840 
to
fiddle<00:02:17.230> around<00:02:17.290> with<00:02:17.470> any<00:02:17.709> settings<00:02:18.459> before

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
fiddle around with any settings before

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.760 
fiddle around with any settings before
the<00:02:18.970> dive<00:02:19.180> can<00:02:19.810> actually<00:02:20.050> just<00:02:20.170> jump<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:20.620> and

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
the dive can actually just jump in and

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.850 
the dive can actually just jump in and
not<00:02:20.890> have<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.250> worry<00:02:21.430> about<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.709> menu

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
not have to worry about it so the menu

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.890 
not have to worry about it so the menu
system<00:02:24.160> works<00:02:25.150> around<00:02:25.450> obviously<00:02:25.600> the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
system works around obviously the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.890 
system works around obviously the
buttons<00:02:26.260> we<00:02:26.440> have<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:27.209> advance<00:02:28.209> button<00:02:28.540> a
