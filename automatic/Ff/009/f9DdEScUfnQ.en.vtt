 which is the normal map for gta san 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.630
 andreas what the normal map is for 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.149
 Well, it serves mainly to 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.610
 the skins look with better quality and in 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.380
 3-d installation is very simple to 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.870
 below I show them and more 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.140
 forward I will leave a gameplay of how it 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.140
 would see 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.370
 since the file that was downloaded 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.800
 I will leave you in the description will be left 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.180
 a zip file what we will do is give 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.110
 right click extract here 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.770
 they will automatically appear 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.080
 folder with the same name we will open it 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:07.080
 open the next folder 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.630
 and you will see three files here will appear what 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.210
 which is a tx file that contains the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.530
 instructions and also a preview 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.530
 of the mod which is not mine 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.700
 as we can see here is the view 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.329
 previous which shows the gta with and without 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.329
 normal map 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.570
 ok then we open the folder 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.479
 called mapping pecs copy all the 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.859
 there are files and we go to the 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.899
 route of our game in my case is this 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:43.600
 when we have found it, they all hit 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.700
 the files in a blank space to 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.280
 my asked me to replace because I already 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.799
 had and it would be that simple 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.380
 installation in this way I'll leave you with 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.390
 a gameplay will not notice much change 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.000
 for the emos series but they do change 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.220
 the skins I do not say goodbye because we 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.700
 we will be watching in a new video like this 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.700
 asking 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.510
