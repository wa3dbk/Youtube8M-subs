00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
provided the magnets here so it's real

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.670 
provided the magnets here so it's real
good<00:02:32.430> very<00:02:32.760> easy<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.269> take<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.570> off<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.959> put<00:02:34.080> it

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
good very easy to take it off and put it

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.330 
good very easy to take it off and put it
back<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.190> again<00:02:35.570> there<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.720> lots<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.380> area<00:02:37.980> here

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
back in again there is lots of area here

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.860 
back in again there is lots of area here
as<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.580> can<00:02:38.610> see<00:02:38.760> that's<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.420> battery

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
as you can see that's the battery

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.350 
as you can see that's the battery

compartment batteries mike fits tight

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.740 
compartment batteries mike fits tight
and<00:02:42.660> easy<00:02:43.670> apart<00:02:44.670> from<00:02:44.849> this<00:02:45.090> if<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.480> want<00:02:45.660> to

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
and easy apart from this if you want to

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.920 
and easy apart from this if you want to
put<00:02:45.990> something<00:02:46.290> here

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
put something here

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.709 
put something here
showed<00:02:47.079> that<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:47.379> don't<00:02:47.620> make<00:02:47.799> plain<00:02:48.099> Haley

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:48.719 
showed that you don't make plain Haley

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.679

you can and the cockpit fits pretty good
pretty<00:02:53.170> neat<00:02:53.409> and<00:02:53.680> very<00:02:53.709> easily<00:02:54.189> you<00:02:54.519> don't

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
pretty neat and very easily you don't

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.420 
pretty neat and very easily you don't
have<00:02:54.819> to<00:02:54.939> do<00:02:55.030> any<00:02:55.180> type<00:02:55.569> thing<00:02:55.870> or<00:02:56.430> screws

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
performance for the performance I like

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.629 
performance for the performance I like
it<00:03:06.129> because<00:03:06.280> they<00:03:06.639> have<00:03:06.730> given<00:03:07.060> us<00:03:07.299> brushless

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
it because they have given us brushless

the plane is very stable but one more

the plane is very stable but one more
thing<00:03:43.810> that<00:03:44.110> I<00:03:44.140> wanted<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.590> tell<00:03:44.800> is<00:03:45.130> that<00:03:45.400> you

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
thing that I wanted to tell is that you

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.450 
thing that I wanted to tell is that you
might<00:03:46.300> want<00:03:46.570> to<00:03:46.660> set<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.200> dual<00:03:47.500> rates<00:03:47.890> on<00:03:48.280> the

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
might want to set the dual rates on the

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.880 
might want to set the dual rates on the
L<00:03:48.610> Ron's<00:03:49.000> otherwise<00:03:49.510> you<00:03:49.780> will<00:03:49.900> find<00:03:50.200> the

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
L Ron's otherwise you will find the

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.310 
L Ron's otherwise you will find the
roles<00:03:51.160> on<00:03:51.520> this<00:03:51.730> plane<00:03:52.030> are<00:03:52.300> really<00:03:52.990> very

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
roles on this plane are really very

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.220 
roles on this plane are really very
quick<00:03:53.920> very<00:03:54.730> responsive<00:03:55.510> so<00:03:55.660> if<00:03:55.750> you<00:03:55.870> want<00:03:56.110> to

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
quick very responsive so if you want to

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.300 
quick very responsive so if you want to
do<00:03:56.820> smooth<00:03:57.820> flying<00:03:58.270> make<00:03:58.780> sure<00:03:58.810> to<00:03:58.990> set<00:03:59.500> dual

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
do smooth flying make sure to set dual

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.130 
do smooth flying make sure to set dual
rates<00:04:00.670> and<00:04:00.970> expo<00:04:01.560> 2-25<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:03.180> on<00:04:04.180> channel<00:04:04.630> one<00:04:04.870> i

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
rates and expo 2-25 and on channel one i

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.460 
rates and expo 2-25 and on channel one i
have<00:04:05.590> done<00:04:05.860> a<00:04:06.130> dual<00:04:06.430> race<00:04:06.730> 65<00:04:07.600> on<00:04:07.900> channel<00:04:08.260> one

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
have done a dual race 65 on channel one

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.430 
have done a dual race 65 on channel one
and<00:04:08.709> i<00:04:09.250> have<00:04:09.459> done<00:04:09.700> expo<00:04:10.330> number<00:04:10.750> one<00:04:10.930> that's

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
and i have done expo number one that's

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.860 
and i have done expo number one that's
what<00:04:11.590> we're<00:04:11.740> gonna<00:04:11.830> test<00:04:12.160> today<00:04:13.000> with<00:04:13.780> the

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
what we're gonna test today with the

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.930 
what we're gonna test today with the
dual<00:04:14.050> rates<00:04:14.320> on<00:04:14.530> how<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:14.980> plan<00:04:15.400> will<00:04:15.610> behave

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
dual rates on how the plan will behave

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.090 
dual rates on how the plan will behave
and<00:04:16.209> without<00:04:16.840> dual<00:04:17.200> rates<00:04:17.410> how<00:04:17.590> sharp<00:04:17.950> the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
and without dual rates how sharp the

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.900 
and without dual rates how sharp the
chance<00:04:18.310> could<00:04:18.519> be<00:04:18.700> no<00:04:19.890> sweet<00:04:20.890> baby<00:04:21.190> is<00:04:21.340> here<00:04:21.669> I

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
chance could be no sweet baby is here I

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.450 
chance could be no sweet baby is here I
think<00:04:22.600> we<00:04:22.750> should<00:04:22.780> put<00:04:23.530> our<00:04:23.560> hands<00:04:24.010> on<00:04:24.100> it<00:04:24.280> and

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
think we should put our hands on it and

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:35.650 
think we should put our hands on it and
see<00:04:24.790> how<00:04:24.820> it<00:04:24.970> will<00:04:25.270> fly

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.119 

you

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:44.490 

you

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.560 

you
