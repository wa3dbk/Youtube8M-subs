00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
of a gel paste is it doesn't add any

liquid<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.959> your<00:02:09.050> meringue<00:02:09.349> so<00:02:09.379> you're

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
barely swirl that color together so I

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.470 
barely swirl that color together so I

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
colored swirl happening so these may be

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.560
