00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.750
 My dear college graduates, My dear college graduates. 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.870
 In the past few years, you have hopefully acquired a great deal of knowledge here over these past years. 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.950
 But in life, wisdom is much more important than knowledge. But in life, knowledge islinkedin less important than wisdom. 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.670
 Here are five ideas for your life. Here then are five ideas for your life. 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.700
 1, the greatest struggle in your life should not be - in fact, not - and society 1. The greatest struggle in your life should not be -- and, in fact, is not -- with society. 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.100
 Is fighting yourself. It is with yourself. 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.620
 The idea that every great religion teaches this way - has now been abandoned. This idea -- taught by every great religion -- is not taught today. 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.150
 Instead, we are taught to fight the society. Instead we are taught that we have to battle society 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.900
 Sexism, racial discrimination, prejudice and other defects are its sexism, racism, prejudices and it's other flaws. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.650
 The great temptation is that you will think of all the problems you face. The overwhelming temptation is therefore to see whatever problems you have 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.300
 All come from society, not yourself as coming from society, not from within yourself. 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.970
 But in a free and decent society, such as ours, but in a free and decent society such as ours 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.020
 Our own flawed human nature is our biggest flawed human nature -- not a flawed society 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.950
 Not a society with defects, that is our biggest problem 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.600
 2, use your common sense 2. Use your common sense. 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.270
 For example, when you hear "research shows" outside the natural sciences, when you hear the words "studies show" -- outside of the natural sciences 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.020
 And you find that these studies express the idea of ​​breaking common sense and you find that these studies show the opposite of what common sense suggests 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.170
 It takes a lot of doubts to be very skeptical 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.000
 I don't remember that I have encountered any reasonable research against common sense. I don't recall ever coming across a valid study that contravened common sense 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.050
 For example, when I was in college, I was told that For example, I was told when I was in college that 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.000
 "Research shows that boys and girls are not essentially different" "studies show" that boys and girls are not inherently different 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.870
 They differ only because parents raise them in a sexist manner that they differ only because parents raise them in a sexist manner. 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.450
 This is a crap, this was nonsense then 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.720
 It is even more nonsensical now since we have brain scans showing how different the male and females brains are since we have a brain scan showing how different the brains of the two sexes are. 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.470
 3, the race is not important 3. Race is unimportant 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.550
 You are taught that it is extremely important, but it is not that you've been taught that it is very important, but it isn't. 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.950
 The color of people's skin is as trivial as the color of their hair. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.970
 Reference to the idea of ​​Victor Frank Be guided by the idea of ​​Viktor Frankl 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.350
 He is a Jewish psychiatrist and suffered the horror of the Nazi death camp. The Jewish psychiatrist who suffered the horrors of a Nazi death camp 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.350
 The family was also poisoned and the family was gassed 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.120
 After the Nazi Holocaust, he was asked: After the Holocaust, he was asked 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.350
 “Do you hate the German nation?” “Do you hate the German race?” 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.250
 "No" he answered "No" he replied 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.070
 "I don't hate them. There are only two peoples in the world who are decent and indecent." "I don't, there are only two races, the decent and the indecent." 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.370
 Remember that self-evident, you can't be a racist, that truism, and you can never be a racist. 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.250
 4, be vigilant 4. Beware of good intentions 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.470
 The 20th century was the bloodiest and most ruthless century in history. The 20th century was the bloodiest and cruelest century on record. 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.970
 Why? 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.250
 Not because many people are evil, Not because so many more people were bad 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.000
 But because many people believe in evil thoughts but because so many people believe in bad ideas. 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.800
 Many Nazis and communists and the current Islamic terrorists Most Nazis and Communists in their time and Islamic terrorists in our time 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.970
 Not necessarily abusive madness were not/are not sure sadists 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.870
 They just believe in the ordinary people of evil thoughts they were normal people who believed in bad ideas. 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.970
 Here is a quick way to measure whether a thought is good or not. So here is a quick way to measure if an idea is good. 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.950
 No - I repeat, don't - ask how it feels good. Do not -- I repeat, do NOT -- ask if it feels good 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.770
 Or whether it is out of good or if it has good intentions. 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.570
 Ask how it works. Ask will it DO good? 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.100
 Will it make people more friendly and ethical? Will it make people kinder and more ethical? 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.900
 Does it encourage responsible behavior? Will it encourage responsible behavior? 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.900
 Has it been tested before? Has it been tried before 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.000
 If so, what is the result? And if so, what were the results? 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.850
 What matters is how you act. What matters is how you act. 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.920
 If you do something bad then you "what is meant to be good" is not important at all. If you do something bad, it is not important that you "meant well." 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.470
 If you do something good then you don’t care if you do something good, it doesn’t matter if you did it for "selfish" reasons. 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.100
 So spend less time paying attention to your motivation. So spend much less time monitoring your motives 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.800
 Pay more attention to your actions and far more time monitoring your actions. 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.020
 5. Jewish Christian values ​​are the current counterculture 5. Judeo-Christian values ​​are the real counterculture today. 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:05.020
 Many people think that dressing up or body tattoos or eye-catching eyes is a symbol of personality. Many people think that dressing weird or having their body tattooed or pierced is a statement of individuality or strength 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.700
 Or rebellion against the dominant culture. 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.350
 That is false Not true. 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.500
 The best statement of counter-mainstream culture and personal strength in the United States today is The ultimate statement of counterculture and individual strength in America today 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.800
 God who is serious about Judaism and Christianity is to take the God of Judaism and Christianity seriously 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.170
 If you want to be a different person and become strong If you want to be an individual and to be strong 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.600
 Affirming a higher value system that enables you to say no to the prevailing culture 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.150
 When you know to whom you are accountable and when you march to the beat of that Higher Drummer

 You will be able to lead a happy and happy life. You will lead a more peaceful, happy and good life.
