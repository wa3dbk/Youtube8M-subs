and<00:03:06.040> using<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.520> same<00:03:06.700> screws<00:03:07.090> just<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.540> screw

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
and using the same screws just to screw

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:16.910 
and using the same screws just to screw
it<00:03:08.110> down<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:12.100> I've<00:03:12.660> tied<00:03:13.660> it<00:03:13.780> up<00:03:13.900> this<00:03:14.200> screw

focus<00:03:17.920> is<00:03:18.070> it<00:03:18.160> off<00:03:19.050> make<00:03:20.050> sure<00:03:23.160> connected

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
focus is it off make sure connected

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.430 
focus is it off make sure connected
working<00:03:24.790> right<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.650> let's<00:03:26.650> see<00:03:27.010> how<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:27.610> works

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
working right and let's see how it works

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.210 
working right and let's see how it works
sure<00:03:29.440> I<00:03:29.470> mean<00:03:29.980> playing<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.430> for<00:03:30.700> a<00:03:30.760> while

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
sure I mean playing it for a while

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.979 
sure I mean playing it for a while
pretty<00:03:33.220> much<00:03:33.370> does<00:03:33.760> everything<00:03:34.330> that<00:03:34.959> I

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
pretty much does everything that I

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.270 
pretty much does everything that I
wanted<00:03:35.320> to<00:03:35.380> do<00:03:35.650> so<00:03:36.060> normal<00:03:37.680> circle<00:03:38.680> moves<00:03:38.920> or

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
wanted to do so normal circle moves or

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.590 
wanted to do so normal circle moves or
like<00:03:39.700> for<00:03:39.880> example<00:03:40.000> Riis

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
like for example Riis

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.180 
like for example Riis
hadouken<00:03:41.590> down<00:03:41.770> forward<00:03:43.110> so<00:03:44.110> that<00:03:44.260> works

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
hadouken down forward so that works

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.540 
hadouken down forward so that works
pretty<00:03:45.310> well

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
pretty well

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.150 
pretty well
