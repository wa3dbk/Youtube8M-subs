twenty-one light stars and then they

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.209 
twenty-one light stars and then they
changed<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.940> name<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.149> pulse<00:00:51.829> in<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.039> light

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
changed the name to pulse in the light

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.139 
changed the name to pulse in the light
star<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> pulse<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:56.250> same<00:00:56.489> vehicle

one in each of these little compartments

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.009 
one in each of these little compartments
just<00:02:37.519> to<00:02:37.700> cool<00:02:37.939> that<00:02:38.390> Yamaha

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
just to cool that Yamaha

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.759 
just to cool that Yamaha
400<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:41.000> fan<00:02:41.299> is<00:02:41.329> actually<00:02:41.780> sucking<00:02:42.409> in<00:02:42.739> the

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
400 this fan is actually sucking in the

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.819 
400 this fan is actually sucking in the
air<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.390> fan<00:02:44.599> on<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.959> other<00:02:45.110> side<00:02:45.500> is

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:51.280 
air and the fan on the other side is
blowing<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.459> out<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:48.159> the<00:02:49.159> factory<00:02:49.760> had<00:02:50.540> one

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
blowing it out and the factory had one

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.770 
blowing it out and the factory had one
fan<00:02:51.879> already<00:02:52.879> on<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.659> engine<00:02:54.079> but<00:02:54.290> we<00:02:54.470> added

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
fan already on the engine but we added

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.160 
fan already on the engine but we added
two<00:02:56.780> more<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:57.409> it<00:02:58.359> just<00:02:59.359> so<00:02:59.510> that<00:02:59.540> we<00:02:59.780> can<00:02:59.900> treat

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
two more to it just so that we can treat

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.729 
two more to it just so that we can treat
it<00:03:00.200> try<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.620> cool<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.310> engine<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:02.739> we'll

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
it try to cool that engine and we'll

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.800 
it try to cool that engine and we'll
give<00:03:03.920> you<00:03:03.950> a<00:03:04.129> quick<00:03:04.370> shot<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.939> interior<00:03:05.060> it

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
give you a quick shot of the interior it

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.170 
give you a quick shot of the interior it
has<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.379> round<00:03:07.150> steering<00:03:08.150> wheel<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:09.560> gauges

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
has the round steering wheel the gauges

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:18.899 
has the round steering wheel the gauges
are<00:03:11.180> from<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.989> Yamaha<00:03:12.590> 400<00:03:16.389> seats<00:03:17.389> to<00:03:17.720> people

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
are from the Yamaha 400 seats to people

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.910 
are from the Yamaha 400 seats to people
this<00:03:19.909> is<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.209> original<00:03:20.500> upholstery<00:03:22.689> and<00:03:23.920> then

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
this is the original upholstery and then

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.399 
this is the original upholstery and then
new<00:03:25.159> carpet<00:03:25.730> was<00:03:25.939> added<00:03:26.299> in<00:03:26.450> the<00:03:26.480> back<00:03:26.810> on<00:03:27.230> this

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
new carpet was added in the back on this

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:35.349 
new carpet was added in the back on this
one<00:03:32.799> now<00:03:33.799> we'll<00:03:34.310> see<00:03:34.549> if<00:03:34.609> we<00:03:34.730> can<00:03:34.909> see<00:03:35.180> the

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
one now we'll see if we can see the

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:46.560 
one now we'll see if we can see the
engine<00:03:35.540> little<00:03:36.049> better

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:53.380 

now<00:03:47.590> you<00:03:48.590> could<00:03:48.920> convert<00:03:49.460> this<00:03:50.240> engine<00:03:52.360> to<00:03:53.360> the

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
now you could convert this engine to the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.550 
now you could convert this engine to the
water-cooled

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
water-cooled

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.760 
water-cooled
on<00:03:55.250> two<00:03:55.580> Goldwing<00:03:56.210> but<00:03:56.600> you'd<00:03:57.260> actually<00:03:57.500> have

again this canopy just slides on these
rails<00:05:55.100> there's<00:05:56.100> two<00:05:56.400> different<00:05:56.550> kinds<00:05:57.060> of

rails one is the round style which this
has<00:06:00.270> the<00:06:00.660> other<00:06:00.840> is<00:06:01.230> more<00:06:01.500> like<00:06:01.800> a<00:06:03.290> drawer

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
has the other is more like a drawer
