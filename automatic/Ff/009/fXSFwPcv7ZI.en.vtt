00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
problems and I think you know one of my

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.380 
problems and I think you know one of my
studies<00:00:43.360> has<00:00:43.630> always<00:00:43.809> been<00:00:44.020> history<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:46.210> we

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
studies has always been history and we

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.680 
studies has always been history and we
have<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.600> depression<00:00:47.080> every<00:00:47.410> 75<00:00:47.980> years<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.570> the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
have a depression every 75 years so the

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.960 
have a depression every 75 years so the
last<00:00:49.870> depression<00:00:50.170> was<00:00:50.800> in<00:00:50.920> 1930

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
last depression was in 1930

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.960 
last depression was in 1930
so<00:00:52.540> around<00:00:52.830> 2005<00:00:53.830> I<00:00:53.860> was<00:00:54.190> telling<00:00:54.550> people<00:00:54.940> to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
so around 2005 I was telling people to

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.750 
so around 2005 I was telling people to
watch<00:00:55.570> out<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.920> know<00:00:57.010> as<00:00:57.100> baby<00:00:57.340> was<00:00:57.610> coming

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
watch out you know as baby was coming

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.569 
watch out you know as baby was coming
down<00:00:58.150> and<00:00:58.510> it's<00:00:59.200> coming<00:00:59.560> down<00:00:59.740> at<00:01:00.010> very<00:01:00.460> high

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
down and it's coming down at very high

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.480 
down and it's coming down at very high
speed<00:01:01.150> today<00:01:01.540> and<00:01:01.780> I<00:01:02.470> think<00:01:02.740> it<00:01:02.890> won't<00:01:02.980> just<00:01:03.250> be

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
speed today and I think it won't just be

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.539 
speed today and I think it won't just be
a<00:01:03.760> depression<00:01:04.680> it'll<00:01:05.680> be<00:01:05.860> a<00:01:06.040> global

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
a depression it'll be a global

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.359 
a depression it'll be a global
depression<00:01:06.729> and<00:01:07.710> that's<00:01:08.710> why<00:01:08.860> I'm<00:01:08.950> glad<00:01:09.070> you

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:26.730 
hard word to understand but I'm going to
talk<00:02:25.269> to<00:02:25.450> you

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
talk to you

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.010 
talk to you
about<00:02:27.740> that<00:02:29.140> who<00:02:30.140> knows<00:02:30.320> what<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.530> means

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
about that who knows what that means

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.770 
about that who knows what that means
infinity<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.760> I'll<00:02:34.910> be<00:02:35.090> talking<00:02:35.330> for<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.720> next

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
infinity so I'll be talking for the next

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.930 
infinity so I'll be talking for the next
two<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.410> half<00:02:36.590> hours<00:02:37.010> three<00:02:37.250> hours<00:02:37.610> about

two and a half hours three hours about

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.250 
two and a half hours three hours about
an<00:02:38.330> infinite<00:02:38.870> rate<00:02:39.590> of<00:02:39.830> return<00:02:40.310> on<00:02:40.670> your<00:02:40.700> money

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
an infinite rate of return on your money

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.560 
an infinite rate of return on your money
in<00:02:42.260> plain<00:02:43.220> English<00:02:43.730> it<00:02:43.910> means<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.330> doesn't

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
in plain English it means it doesn't

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.110 
in plain English it means it doesn't
take<00:02:45.050> money<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:46.370> make<00:02:46.550> money

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
take money to make money

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.380 
take money to make money
it<00:02:48.050> takes<00:02:48.320> financial<00:02:48.860> education<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:49.730> you'll

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
it takes financial education and you'll

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.600 
it takes financial education and you'll
be<00:02:50.510> getting<00:02:50.780> some<00:02:50.990> of<00:02:51.110> it<00:02:51.350> today<00:02:51.550> I'll<00:02:52.550> be

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
be getting some of it today I'll be

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.060 
be getting some of it today I'll be
coming<00:02:53.120> back<00:02:53.240> in<00:02:53.450> October<00:02:53.930> 18th<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:54.560> 19th<00:02:54.590> and

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
coming back in October 18th and 19th and

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.370 
coming back in October 18th and 19th and
20th<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:55.850> I'll<00:02:55.940> go<00:02:56.090> into<00:02:56.360> more<00:02:56.840> depth<00:02:57.200> for

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
20th and I'll go into more depth for

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.720 
20th and I'll go into more depth for
those<00:02:57.500> who<00:02:57.650> want<00:02:57.770> to<00:02:57.800> learn<00:02:57.950> more<00:02:58.010> about<00:02:58.310> it

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
those who want to learn more about it

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.730 
those who want to learn more about it
but<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.480> only<00:02:59.630> mentioned<00:03:00.170> this<00:03:00.260> in<00:03:00.440> passing

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
but I only mentioned this in passing

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.650 
but I only mentioned this in passing
because<00:03:01.220> generally<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:01.820> was<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.150> little<00:03:02.480> too

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
because generally it was a little too

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.850 
because generally it was a little too
complicated<00:03:03.170> for<00:03:03.470> most<00:03:03.800> people<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.580> it's

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
complicated for most people and it's

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.590 
complicated for most people and it's
it's<00:03:06.860> complicated<00:03:07.700> but<00:03:07.760> it's<00:03:07.940> not<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.300> hard

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
it's complicated but it's not that hard

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.740 
it's complicated but it's not that hard
once<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:09.020> understand<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:10.210> so<00:03:11.210> an<00:03:11.300> infinite

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
once you understand it so an infinite

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.050 
once you understand it so an infinite
return<00:03:11.900> is<00:03:12.350> very<00:03:12.410> simply<00:03:13.070> this<00:03:13.370> let<00:03:13.850> me<00:03:13.880> get

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
return is very simply this let me get

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.390 
return is very simply this let me get
another<00:03:14.150> example<00:03:17.560> let's<00:03:18.560> say<00:03:18.740> you<00:03:18.800> put<00:03:19.010> up<00:03:19.160> 1

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
another example let's say you put up 1

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.000 
another example let's say you put up 1
million<00:03:19.610> Ozzie<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.330> could<00:03:20.510> be<00:03:20.690> $1<00:03:21.260> oz<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.860> could

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
million Ozzie it could be $1 oz it could

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.190 
million Ozzie it could be $1 oz it could
be<00:03:22.130> $10<00:03:22.760> malicious<00:03:23.360> use<00:03:23.660> million<00:03:24.230> for<00:03:24.470> now<00:03:26.200> and

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
be $10 malicious use million for now and

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.370 
be $10 malicious use million for now and
in<00:03:27.380> a<00:03:27.470> year<00:03:27.950> that<00:03:31.780> million<00:03:32.780> throws<00:03:33.080> off<00:03:33.350> a

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
in a year that million throws off a

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:42.460 
in a year that million throws off a
hundred<00:03:33.920> K<00:03:34.130> cash<00:03:34.550> flow<00:03:35.410> what<00:03:36.410> is<00:03:36.530> my<00:03:36.710> ROI<00:03:41.470> it's

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
hundred K cash flow what is my ROI it's

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.420 
hundred K cash flow what is my ROI it's
a<00:03:42.560> 10%<00:03:43.160> okay<00:03:43.580> math<00:03:44.270> is<00:03:44.480> not<00:03:44.510> that<00:03:44.840> hard<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:46.250> one

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
a 10% okay math is not that hard the one

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.340 
a 10% okay math is not that hard the one
thing<00:03:46.580> I<00:03:46.640> do<00:03:46.700> I<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.300> know<00:03:47.390> have<00:03:47.570> I<00:03:47.720> had<00:03:47.930> three

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
thing I do I you know have I had three

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.010 
thing I do I you know have I had three
years<00:03:48.470> of<00:03:48.620> calculus<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.820> I<00:03:50.270> was<00:03:50.420> flunking<00:03:50.750> out

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
years of calculus and I was flunking out

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.980 
years of calculus and I was flunking out
like<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.290> wild<00:03:51.710> man<00:03:51.830> then<00:03:52.100> I<00:03:52.130> go<00:03:52.280> holy<00:03:52.550> jesus<00:03:53.000> and

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
like a wild man then I go holy jesus and

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.770 
like a wild man then I go holy jesus and
I<00:03:54.080> asked<00:03:54.410> my<00:03:54.560> calculus<00:03:55.160> teacher<00:03:55.370> said<00:03:55.880> how<00:03:56.420> in

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
I asked my calculus teacher said how in

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.670 
I asked my calculus teacher said how in
the<00:03:57.500> world<00:03:57.530> am<00:03:58.160> I<00:03:58.640> going<00:03:58.760> to<00:03:58.880> use<00:03:59.000> calculus<00:03:59.680> he

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
the world am I going to use calculus he

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.240 
the world am I going to use calculus he
says<00:04:00.890> I<00:04:01.010> don't<00:04:01.070> know

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
says I don't know

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.640 
says I don't know
so<00:04:03.880> all<00:04:04.090> of<00:04:04.240> you<00:04:04.360> out<00:04:04.390> there<00:04:04.840> who<00:04:05.020> will<00:04:05.200> like<00:04:05.410> me

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
so all of you out there who will like me

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.710 
so all of you out there who will like me
not<00:04:05.980> good<00:04:06.190> at<00:04:06.310> math<00:04:06.550> let<00:04:06.850> me<00:04:06.940> tell<00:04:07.150> you<00:04:07.330> if<00:04:07.600> you

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
not good at math let me tell you if you

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.660 
not good at math let me tell you if you
can<00:04:07.900> count<00:04:08.110> to<00:04:08.350> ten<00:04:08.590> you're<00:04:09.070> okay

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
can count to ten you're okay

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.000 
can count to ten you're okay
you<00:04:10.330> know<00:04:10.450> you<00:04:11.110> don't<00:04:11.260> need<00:04:11.470> much<00:04:11.740> more<00:04:11.950> than

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
you know you don't need much more than

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.750 
you know you don't need much more than
that<00:04:12.190> so<00:04:14.010> this<00:04:15.010> here<00:04:15.370> is<00:04:15.400> a<00:04:15.550> 10%<00:04:16.209> return<00:04:17.760> I'll

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
that so this here is a 10% return I'll

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:29.040 
that so this here is a 10% return I'll
show<00:04:19.060> what<00:04:19.209> an<00:04:19.329> infinite<00:04:19.780> return<00:04:20.140> is<00:04:27.840> you<00:04:28.840> put

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
show what an infinite return is you put

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.320 
show what an infinite return is you put
up<00:04:29.170> no<00:04:29.530> money<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.030> still<00:04:31.300> make<00:04:31.560> $100,000

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
up no money and you still make $100,000

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.900 
up no money and you still make $100,000
that's<00:04:34.330> infinite<00:04:35.790> because<00:04:36.790> why<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:39.610> have<00:04:39.760> no

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
that's infinite because why you have no

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.870 
that's infinite because why you have no
money<00:04:40.150> in<00:04:40.330> it<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:41.560> this<00:04:42.160> is<00:04:42.310> what<00:04:42.460> my<00:04:42.640> rich<00:04:42.850> dad

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
money in it and this is what my rich dad

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.870 
money in it and this is what my rich dad
taught<00:04:43.390> me<00:04:43.770> from<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:44.890> time<00:04:45.070> I<00:04:45.100> was<00:04:45.310> nine<00:04:45.550> began

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
taught me from the time I was nine began

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.200 
taught me from the time I was nine began
teaching<00:04:46.150> me<00:04:46.450> how<00:04:46.600> you<00:04:46.660> do<00:04:47.020> this

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
teaching me how you do this

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.570 
teaching me how you do this
so<00:04:49.210> that's<00:04:49.600> why<00:04:49.780> we<00:04:50.080> all<00:04:50.260> have<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:50.920> power<00:04:51.160> I

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
so that's why we all have the power I

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.340 
so that's why we all have the power I
would<00:04:51.820> say<00:04:52.000> most<00:04:52.240> of<00:04:52.450> us<00:04:52.630> have<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:52.930> million

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350
