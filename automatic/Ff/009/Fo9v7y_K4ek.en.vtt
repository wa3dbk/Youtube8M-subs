00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
your bucket server plugin folder then

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.150 
your bucket server plugin folder then
you<00:00:48.059> reload<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.690> server<00:00:48.960> or<00:00:49.379> run<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
you reload the server or run it for the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.319 
you reload the server or run it for the
first<00:00:50.430> time<00:00:50.640> I'm<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.969> run<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
first time I'm going to run it for the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.979 
first time I'm going to run it for the
first<00:00:51.600> time<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.559> we<00:00:52.739> close<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.780> this

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
first time so we close up and so this

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.840 
first time so we close up and so this
will<00:00:55.170> generate<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.530> config<00:00:56.039> I'm<00:00:56.250> gonna<00:00:56.520> make<00:00:56.670> it

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
will generate a config I'm gonna make it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.970 
will generate a config I'm gonna make it
I<00:00:56.969> got<00:00:57.899> rid<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.050> all<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> config<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:58.890> all

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
I got rid of all the config so it's all

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.950 
I got rid of all the config so it's all
fresh<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.940> I've<00:01:00.030> got<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.210> plug-in<00:01:00.420> metrics

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
fresh so I've got the plug-in metrics

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.740 
fresh so I've got the plug-in metrics
faults<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.760> all<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.000> stuff<00:01:03.120> what<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.570> see

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
faults and all this stuff what you see

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.200 
faults and all this stuff what you see
here<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.470> once<00:01:04.799> that's<00:01:05.070> loaded<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.729> go<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.060> to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
here so once that's loaded we go on to

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.410 
here so once that's loaded we go on to
our<00:01:06.330> server<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:07.049> we<00:01:07.530> join<00:01:07.740> our<00:01:07.770> server<00:01:08.420> we're

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
our server if we join our server we're

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.850 
our server if we join our server we're
on<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.869> first<00:01:10.110> time<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:10.740> we

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
on it for the first time so if we

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.219 
on it for the first time so if we
automatically<00:01:11.400> game<00:01:11.700> add<00:01:11.850> one<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.450> get

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
automatically game add one we can get

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.200 
automatically game add one we can get
out<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> way<00:01:13.680> minecraft<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.939> port

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
out the way minecraft is in that port

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.060 
out the way minecraft is in that port
isn't<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.810> important<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:16.830> want<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
isn't that important for this we want to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.130 
isn't that important for this we want to
look<00:01:17.159> at<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.310> config<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.390> if<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.750> go<00:01:18.869> into<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
look at the config so if you go into the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.899 
look at the config so if you go into the
plugins<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.830> can<00:01:19.860> see<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.400> clear<00:01:20.729> like

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
plugins you can see that a clear like

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.030 
plugins you can see that a clear like
folder<00:01:21.270> was<00:01:21.390> generated<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:21.960> we<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.860> edit

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
folder was generated and we can edit

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.399 
folder was generated and we can edit
that<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.670> go<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.360> config<00:01:24.720> file<00:01:24.930> open

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
that so you go to the config file open

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.980 
that so you go to the config file open
with<00:01:25.590> edit<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:26.400> notepad<00:01:26.430> plus<00:01:27.030> poss<00:01:27.299> you

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
with edit with notepad plus poss you

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.690 
with edit with notepad plus poss you
should<00:01:28.200> get<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> notepad<00:01:28.650> past<00:01:29.009> boss<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:29.549> a

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
should get the notepad past boss it's a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.609 
should get the notepad past boss it's a
lot<00:01:29.939> easier<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> lot<00:01:31.470> of

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.649 
lot easier and then we have a lot of
conflict<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.130> work<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.520> if<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.390> put<00:01:33.540> that

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
conflict to work with if I just put that

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.140 
conflict to work with if I just put that
down<00:01:33.750> there<00:01:33.920> we<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.040> all<00:01:35.159> these<00:01:35.549> options<00:01:35.790> to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
down there we have all these options to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.969 
down there we have all these options to
change<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.380> lot<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.590> stuff<00:01:37.860> to

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
change and you have a lot of stuff to

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.969 
change and you have a lot of stuff to
work<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.189> these<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.869> basically<00:01:40.680> you

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
work with these are the basically you

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.710 
work with these are the basically you
can<00:01:41.130> edit<00:01:41.310> any<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.270> will<00:01:42.329> affect

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
can edit any of this and it will affect

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.380 
can edit any of this and it will affect
how<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.079> plug-in<00:01:43.619> runs<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:44.970> all<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
how the plug-in runs so you have all the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.730 
how the plug-in runs so you have all the
settings<00:01:45.570> which<00:01:45.899> we'll<00:01:46.049> come<00:01:46.229> back<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.680> a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
settings which we'll come back to in a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.830 
settings which we'll come back to in a
second<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.549> want<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.850> focus<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.600> stuff

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
second we want to focus on this stuff

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.960 
second we want to focus on this stuff
what's<00:01:49.049> gonna<00:01:49.170> help<00:01:49.439> with<00:01:49.530> our<00:01:49.740> server<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.700> one

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
what's gonna help with our server so one

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.100 
what's gonna help with our server so one
thing<00:01:51.149> what's<00:01:51.329> gonna<00:01:51.450> help<00:01:51.570> our<00:01:51.750> server<00:01:51.990> is

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
thing what's gonna help our server is

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.740 
thing what's gonna help our server is
limiting<00:01:52.860> Bob<00:01:53.100> X<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:54.060> were<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.390> enable<00:01:54.720> that

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
limiting Bob X so we were to enable that

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.530 
limiting Bob X so we were to enable that
to<00:01:54.840> true<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.829> means<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.490> only<00:01:56.579> use<00:01:56.909> 5

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
to true that means you can only use 5

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.889 
to true that means you can only use 5
mobs<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> mob<00:01:58.860> egg<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.640> radius<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.119> 8<00:02:00.329> so

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
mobs for a mob egg with a radius of 8 so

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.600 
mobs for a mob egg with a radius of 8 so
that<00:02:00.930> way<00:02:01.140> if<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.320> sum<00:02:01.530> up<00:02:01.649> X<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.040> can't<00:02:02.250> spam

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
that way if you sum up X I can't spam

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.610 
that way if you sum up X I can't spam
them<00:02:02.820> everywhere

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
them everywhere

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.150 
them everywhere
and<00:02:03.710> stuff<00:02:04.340> like<00:02:04.460> that<00:02:04.670> so<00:02:05.240> now<00:02:05.560> we<00:02:06.560> go<00:02:06.770> on<00:02:06.920> to

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
and stuff like that so now we go on to

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.340 
and stuff like that so now we go on to
another<00:02:07.190> thing<00:02:07.670> chunk<00:02:08.060> limiter<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.720> suggest

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
another thing chunk limiter I suggest

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.260 
another thing chunk limiter I suggest
you<00:02:09.470> leave<00:02:09.619> that<00:02:09.860> disabled<00:02:10.850> and<00:02:11.030> as<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.210> have

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
you leave that disabled and as you have

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.790 
you leave that disabled and as you have
like<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.450> really<00:02:11.810> really<00:02:11.990> small<00:02:12.230> server<00:02:12.500> and

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
like a really really small server and

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.530 
like a really really small server and
you<00:02:13.130> know<00:02:13.370> early<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.700> certain<00:02:14.060> are<00:02:14.150> chunks<00:02:14.510> that

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
you know early a certain are chunks that

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.890 
you know early a certain are chunks that
can<00:02:14.630> be<00:02:14.900> loaded<00:02:15.290> so<00:02:15.920> say<00:02:16.400> if<00:02:16.520> we<00:02:16.670> had<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:17.090> sky

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
can be loaded so say if we had a sky

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.660 
can be loaded so say if we had a sky
world<00:02:18.200> or<00:02:18.380> something<00:02:18.620> like<00:02:18.740> that<00:02:18.950> we<00:02:19.490> can

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
world or something like that we can

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.850 
world or something like that we can
enable<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.180> true<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.720> we<00:02:21.200> know<00:02:21.410> early<00:02:21.830> a

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
enable that to true and we know early a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.500 
enable that to true and we know early a
thousand<00:02:22.370> chunks<00:02:22.670> active<00:02:22.910> we<00:02:23.000> were<00:02:23.090> loaded

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
thousand chunks active we were loaded

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.330 
thousand chunks active we were loaded
then<00:02:23.960> it<00:02:24.080> won't<00:02:24.230> load<00:02:24.350> anymore<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:25.190> that's

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
then it won't load anymore and that's

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.070 
then it won't load anymore and that's
just<00:02:25.460> an<00:02:25.880> easy<00:02:26.120> way<00:02:26.210> to<00:02:26.360> keep<00:02:26.510> strain<00:02:26.930> off<00:02:27.050> the

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
just an easy way to keep strain off the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.080 
just an easy way to keep strain off the
server<00:02:27.410> but<00:02:27.920> my<00:02:28.100> sub<00:02:28.310> is<00:02:28.400> quite<00:02:28.580> big<00:02:28.820> so<00:02:28.850> I'm

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
server but my sub is quite big so I'm

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.870 
server but my sub is quite big so I'm
gonna<00:02:29.210> keep<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.600> force<00:02:29.870> we<00:02:30.800> can<00:02:30.890> also<00:02:31.100> change

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
gonna keep it a force we can also change

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.720 
gonna keep it a force we can also change
the<00:02:32.060> live<00:02:32.360> time<00:02:32.630> for<00:02:32.930> animals<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.530> items<00:02:34.160> so

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
the live time for animals and items so

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.730 
the live time for animals and items so
being<00:02:34.910> able<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.330> true<00:02:35.630> we<00:02:36.320> can<00:02:36.560> actually

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
being able that to true we can actually

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.710 
being able that to true we can actually
edit<00:02:37.100> how<00:02:37.490> long<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.760> takes<00:02:37.970> for<00:02:38.090> an<00:02:38.210> item<00:02:38.360> DT

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
edit how long it takes for an item DT

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.670 
edit how long it takes for an item DT
spawn<00:02:39.020> so<00:02:39.680> if<00:02:39.890> we<00:02:40.070> go<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:41.080> item<00:02:42.080> live<00:02:42.260> time<00:02:42.470> and

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
spawn so if we go to item live time and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.590 
spawn so if we go to item live time and
change<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.010> six<00:02:43.340> hundred<00:02:43.400> seconds<00:02:43.970> when<00:02:44.570> I

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
change it to six hundred seconds when I

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.690 
change it to six hundred seconds when I
firm<00:02:44.870> item<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.410> would<00:02:45.500> take<00:02:45.650> 600<00:02:46.190> seconds<00:02:46.550> for

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
firm item it would take 600 seconds for

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.970 
firm item it would take 600 seconds for
it<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.790> de-spawn<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:48.470> can<00:02:48.590> actually<00:02:48.710> give

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
it to de-spawn and you can actually give

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.040 
it to de-spawn and you can actually give
a<00:02:49.190> mob<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.610> live<00:02:49.760> time<00:02:50.000> so<00:02:50.240> they<00:02:50.360> don't<00:02:50.570> build<00:02:50.900> up

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
a mob a live time so they don't build up

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.500 
a mob a live time so they don't build up
and<00:02:51.470> I<00:02:52.340> think<00:02:52.550> this<00:02:52.670> doesn't<00:02:52.940> apply<00:02:53.120> if<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.420> has

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
and I think this doesn't apply if I has

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.870 
and I think this doesn't apply if I has
a<00:02:53.600> name<00:02:53.810> tag<00:02:54.130> then<00:02:55.130> you<00:02:55.280> can<00:02:55.430> give<00:02:55.550> an<00:02:55.670> hour

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
a name tag then you can give an hour

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.090 
a name tag then you can give an hour
Akil<00:02:56.180> time<00:02:56.360> so<00:02:56.600> we<00:02:56.720> make<00:02:56.960> that<00:02:57.080> 150<00:02:57.680> seconds

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
Akil time so we make that 150 seconds

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.150 
Akil time so we make that 150 seconds
that<00:02:58.430> way<00:02:58.550> doesn't<00:02:58.760> go<00:02:59.060> up<00:02:59.240> entities<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.920> this

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
that way doesn't go up entities and this

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.680 
that way doesn't go up entities and this
is<00:03:01.280> where<00:03:01.460> you<00:03:01.580> can<00:03:01.760> edit<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:02.150> custom<00:03:02.510> mob

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
is where you can edit the custom mob

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.150 
is where you can edit the custom mob
spawners<00:03:02.990> so<00:03:03.590> if<00:03:03.710> we<00:03:03.830> enable<00:03:04.070> that<00:03:04.660> we<00:03:05.660> can<00:03:06.160> we

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
spawners so if we enable that we can we

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.650 
spawners so if we enable that we can we
can<00:03:07.310> pretty<00:03:07.520> much<00:03:07.610> change<00:03:07.940> everything<00:03:08.450> about

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
can pretty much change everything about

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.660 
can pretty much change everything about
a<00:03:08.810> mob<00:03:09.050> spawner<00:03:09.350> we<00:03:09.590> can<00:03:09.770> change<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.370> chance

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
a mob spawner we can change the chance

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.210 
a mob spawner we can change the chance
of<00:03:10.910> pigs<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.690> certain<00:03:12.350> mob<00:03:12.470> spawning<00:03:12.770> we<00:03:13.040> can

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
of pigs a certain mob spawning we can

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.949 
of pigs a certain mob spawning we can
make<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.850> radius<00:03:14.150> bigger<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.690> stuff<00:03:14.870> like

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
make the radius bigger and stuff like

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.740 
make the radius bigger and stuff like
that<00:03:15.170> check<00:03:15.709> radius<00:03:16.100> from<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.670> all<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.450> green

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
that check radius from and all the green

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.750 
that check radius from and all the green
text<00:03:18.020> told<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.410> exactly<00:03:18.830> what<00:03:19.010> that<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:19.310> so

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
text told you exactly what that is so

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.030 
text told you exactly what that is so
this<00:03:19.940> should<00:03:20.090> be<00:03:20.120> easy<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.630> follow<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.290> then

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
this should be easy to follow and then

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.729 
this should be easy to follow and then
we<00:03:22.160> can<00:03:22.310> go<00:03:22.459> on<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:23.090> stuff<00:03:23.840> war<00:03:24.020> produces<00:03:24.530> stuff

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
we can go on to stuff war produces stuff

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.040 
we can go on to stuff war produces stuff
in<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:24.980> game<00:03:25.130> so<00:03:25.790> we<00:03:25.970> can<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:26.510> option<00:03:26.900> this

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
in the game so we can this option this

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.920 
in the game so we can this option this
allows<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.620> placement<00:03:28.100> of<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.660> okay<00:03:29.660> so<00:03:29.720> you

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
allows the placement of the okay so you

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.000 
allows the placement of the okay so you
can<00:03:30.050> actually<00:03:30.170> just<00:03:30.410> say<00:03:30.560> well<00:03:30.800> how<00:03:30.950> many

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
can actually just say well how many

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.920 
can actually just say well how many
things<00:03:31.370> get<00:03:31.580> placed<00:03:31.790> so<00:03:32.390> we're<00:03:32.720> not<00:03:32.810> gonna

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
things get placed so we're not gonna

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.440 
things get placed so we're not gonna
worry<00:03:33.170> about<00:03:33.290> that<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:34.400> this<00:03:35.060> is<00:03:35.209> all<00:03:35.360> the

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
worry about that and this is all the

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.810 
worry about that and this is all the
same<00:03:35.660> you<00:03:36.140> can<00:03:36.170> disable<00:03:36.800> fire<00:03:37.190> spread<00:03:37.580> or<00:03:37.790> you

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
same you can disable fire spread or you

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.640 
same you can disable fire spread or you
can<00:03:38.150> produce<00:03:38.330> it<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:38.870> if<00:03:39.080> we<00:03:39.200> enable<00:03:39.380> it<00:03:39.620> to

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
can produce it so if we enable it to

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.000 
can produce it so if we enable it to
true<00:03:40.450> that<00:03:41.450> way<00:03:41.630> fire<00:03:42.140> spread<00:03:42.500> is<00:03:42.650> a<00:03:42.680> little

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
true that way fire spread is a little

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.030 
true that way fire spread is a little
less<00:03:43.190> laggy<00:03:43.520> and<00:03:44.080> we<00:03:45.080> want<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.350> get<00:03:45.500> onto<00:03:45.680> our

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
less laggy and we want to get onto our

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.270 
less laggy and we want to get onto our
main<00:03:46.550> thing<00:03:46.940> which<00:03:47.900> is<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.709> automatic

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
main thing which is the automatic

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.330 
main thing which is the automatic
removal<00:03:50.120> of<00:03:50.269> items<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:51.380> by<00:03:51.530> default<00:03:51.739> this<00:03:52.160> will

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
removal of items so by default this will

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.670 
removal of items so by default this will
be<00:03:52.430> running<00:03:52.670> on<00:03:52.880> your<00:03:53.090> server<00:03:53.360> and<00:03:53.570> it's<00:03:54.380> the

Fingal<00:03:55.160> comes<00:03:55.370> up<00:03:55.519> on<00:03:55.700> this<00:03:55.790> chat<00:03:56.060> here<00:03:56.239> so

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
Fingal comes up on this chat here so

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.300 
Fingal comes up on this chat here so
ground<00:03:56.750> items<00:03:57.140> will<00:03:57.320> be<00:03:57.350> removed<00:03:57.769> in<00:03:57.950> 60

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
ground items will be removed in 60

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.870 
ground items will be removed in 60
seconds<00:03:58.700> 20<00:03:59.030> seconds<00:03:59.390> that<00:03:59.959> is<00:04:00.230> this<00:04:00.790> so<00:04:01.790> we

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
seconds 20 seconds that is this so we

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.820 
seconds 20 seconds that is this so we
can<00:04:02.030> change<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.420> amount<00:04:02.480> of<00:04:02.600> time<00:04:02.660> so<00:04:03.560> if<00:04:03.680> we

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
can change the amount of time so if we

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.290 
can change the amount of time so if we
change<00:04:04.070> it<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.900> 1600<00:04:05.900> if<00:04:06.590> we<00:04:06.709> change<00:04:06.920> it<00:04:07.070> to<00:04:07.310> 65

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
change it to 1600 if we change it to 65

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.350 
change it to 1600 if we change it to 65
that's<00:04:09.110> a<00:04:09.200> good<00:04:09.350> time<00:04:09.580> let's<00:04:10.580> make<00:04:10.700> a<00:04:10.760> 10,000

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
that's a good time let's make a 10,000

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.310 
that's a good time let's make a 10,000
because<00:04:11.510> I'm<00:04:11.570> not<00:04:11.660> really<00:04:11.810> sure<00:04:12.019> how<00:04:12.170> long

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
because I'm not really sure how long

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.430 
because I'm not really sure how long
that<00:04:12.470> is<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:12.820> we<00:04:13.820> have<00:04:14.090> this<00:04:14.750> running<00:04:15.019> every

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
that is and we have this running every

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.800 
that is and we have this running every
10,000<00:04:16.010> seconds

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
10,000 seconds

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.099 
10,000 seconds
make<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.079> 5,000<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:18.269> so<00:04:19.269> if<00:04:19.450> we<00:04:19.600> change<00:04:19.810> the

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
make it 5,000 and so if we change the

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.100 
make it 5,000 and so if we change the
message<00:04:20.260> from<00:04:20.859> time<00:04:21.419> message<00:04:22.419> clear<00:04:22.720> lag<00:04:22.900> will

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
message from time message clear lag will

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.260 
message from time message clear lag will
be<00:04:23.200> removed<00:04:23.590> in<00:04:23.740> Nasik<00:04:24.160> okay<00:04:24.460> so<00:04:24.910> we<00:04:25.030> want<00:04:25.180> to

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
be removed in Nasik okay so we want to

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.110 
be removed in Nasik okay so we want to
change<00:04:25.450> that<00:04:25.600> to<00:04:25.710> four<00:04:26.710> thousand<00:04:27.190> one<00:04:27.820> nine

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
change that to four thousand one nine

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.659 
change that to four thousand one nine
hundred<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.690> then<00:04:29.230> four<00:04:29.860> thousand<00:04:30.430> nine

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
hundred and then four thousand nine

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.760 
hundred and then four thousand nine
hundred<00:04:30.910> and<00:04:32.730> ninety<00:04:34.410> then<00:04:35.410> that<00:04:35.590> will

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
hundred and ninety then that will

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.100 
hundred and ninety then that will
display<00:04:36.100> a<00:04:36.730> hundred<00:04:37.270> second<00:04:37.510> warning<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:37.990> a

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
display a hundred second warning and a

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.960 
display a hundred second warning and a
10-second<00:04:38.650> warning<00:04:38.770> because<00:04:39.490> that's<00:04:39.820> the

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
10-second warning because that's the

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.210 
10-second warning because that's the
difference<00:04:40.300> between<00:04:40.389> 5000<00:04:41.260> and<00:04:41.320> you<00:04:42.070> can

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
difference between 5000 and you can

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.800 
difference between 5000 and you can
actually<00:04:42.460> disable<00:04:42.790> all<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.210> things<00:04:43.540> spawning

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
actually disable all the things spawning

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.370 
actually disable all the things spawning
in<00:04:43.990> the<00:04:44.050> world<00:04:44.230> so<00:04:44.919> if<00:04:45.040> we<00:04:45.250> change<00:04:45.460> this<00:04:45.669> to

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
in the world so if we change this to

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.420 
in the world so if we change this to
barber<00:04:47.380> that<00:04:47.410> my<00:04:47.680> recording<00:04:48.100> must<00:04:48.280> have

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
barber that my recording must have

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.510 
barber that my recording must have
stopped<00:04:48.669> this<00:04:48.790> link<00:04:49.030> so<00:04:49.330> if<00:04:49.630> we<00:04:49.780> go<00:04:49.990> to<00:04:50.310> this

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.940 

okay<00:04:54.520> so<00:04:54.820> if<00:04:55.000> we<00:04:55.210> change<00:04:55.450> this<00:04:55.720> the<00:04:56.020> world<00:04:56.260> the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
okay so if we change this the world the

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.420 
okay so if we change this the world the
end<00:04:57.360> this<00:04:58.360> would<00:04:58.600> apply<00:04:58.900> for<00:04:59.440> the<00:05:00.100> world<00:05:00.310> the

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
end this would apply for the world the

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.890 
end this would apply for the world the
end<00:05:00.610> so<00:05:00.790> that<00:05:00.820> this<00:05:01.120> will<00:05:01.300> have<00:05:01.450> like<00:05:01.600> a<00:05:01.630> custom

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
end so that this will have like a custom

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.620 
end so that this will have like a custom
setting<00:05:02.470> for<00:05:02.889> the<00:05:03.100> broadcast<00:05:03.610> removal<00:05:04.090> so

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
setting for the broadcast removal so

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.659 
setting for the broadcast removal so
what<00:05:05.169> should<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.440> world<00:05:05.800> what<00:05:06.130> should<00:05:06.340> be

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
what should the world what should be

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.540 
what should the world what should be
removed<00:05:07.030> during<00:05:07.180> an<00:05:07.419> otter<00:05:07.570> removal<00:05:08.560> so<00:05:09.070> if<00:05:09.370> we

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
removed during an otter removal so if we

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.610 
removed during an otter removal so if we
disable<00:05:10.090> or<00:05:10.479> we<00:05:10.660> have<00:05:10.810> this<00:05:10.960> all<00:05:11.110> enabled<00:05:11.350> by

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
disable or we have this all enabled by

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.120 
disable or we have this all enabled by
default<00:05:11.729> say<00:05:12.729> if<00:05:12.850> we<00:05:12.970> wanted<00:05:13.270> to<00:05:13.510> keep<00:05:14.320> boats

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
default say if we wanted to keep boats

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.120 
default say if we wanted to keep boats
in<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:15.610> end<00:05:15.820> or<00:05:16.060> keep<00:05:16.450> falling<00:05:16.930> XP<00:05:17.830> or

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
in the end or keep falling XP or

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.650 
in the end or keep falling XP or
anything<00:05:18.520> like<00:05:18.760> that<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:19.240> changes<00:05:19.540> the

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
anything like that the changes the

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.870 
anything like that the changes the
forced<00:05:19.990> and<00:05:20.200> whenever<00:05:20.710> the<00:05:21.190> clear<00:05:21.400> like<00:05:21.580> runs

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
forced and whenever the clear like runs

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.909 
forced and whenever the clear like runs
its<00:05:22.210> gonna<00:05:22.360> look<00:05:22.600> at<00:05:22.810> this<00:05:22.900> world<00:05:23.140> and<00:05:23.350> go<00:05:23.470> okay

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
its gonna look at this world and go okay

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.610 
its gonna look at this world and go okay
do<00:05:24.700> not<00:05:24.850> remove<00:05:25.120> any<00:05:25.360> snow<00:05:25.690> balls<00:05:25.930> don't

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
do not remove any snow balls don't

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.640 
do not remove any snow balls don't
remove<00:05:26.860> any<00:05:27.070> arrows<00:05:27.370> and<00:05:27.700> keep<00:05:28.000> Prime<00:05:28.270> TNT<00:05:28.840> and

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
remove any arrows and keep Prime TNT and

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.219 
remove any arrows and keep Prime TNT and
that's<00:05:29.890> just<00:05:30.070> an<00:05:30.160> easy<00:05:30.400> way<00:05:30.669> to<00:05:30.840> do<00:05:31.840> that<00:05:32.020> and

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
that's just an easy way to do that and

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.380 
that's just an easy way to do that and
so<00:05:32.680> if<00:05:32.770> you<00:05:32.890> wanted<00:05:33.100> to<00:05:33.250> remove<00:05:33.430> any<00:05:33.760> items<00:05:33.820> you

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
so if you wanted to remove any items you

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.080 
so if you wanted to remove any items you
can<00:05:34.510> do<00:05:34.630> that<00:05:34.840> unhatched<00:05:35.500> able<00:05:35.890> this<00:05:36.070> and<00:05:36.340> then

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
can do that unhatched able this and then

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.700 
can do that unhatched able this and then
see<00:05:37.300> if<00:05:37.360> we<00:05:37.450> wanted<00:05:37.660> to<00:05:37.780> remove<00:05:38.110> all<00:05:38.320> stone

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
see if we wanted to remove all stone

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.610 
see if we wanted to remove all stone
items<00:05:39.669> dropped<00:05:40.000> i<00:05:40.240> think<00:05:40.960> the<00:05:41.050> stone<00:05:41.320> ids

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
items dropped i think the stone ids

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.980 
items dropped i think the stone ids
should<00:05:41.890> be<00:05:42.010> one<00:05:42.479> then<00:05:43.479> that's<00:05:43.630> gonna<00:05:43.750> remove

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
should be one then that's gonna remove

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.990 
should be one then that's gonna remove
all<00:05:44.200> job<00:05:44.440> stone<00:05:44.800> and<00:05:45.070> you<00:05:45.580> can<00:05:45.729> have<00:05:45.850> it<00:05:45.940> like

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
all job stone and you can have it like

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.210 
all job stone and you can have it like
that<00:05:46.240> and<00:05:46.900> obviously<00:05:47.169> there's<00:05:47.560> a<00:05:47.680> cow<00:05:47.889> or

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
that and obviously there's a cow or

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.400 
that and obviously there's a cow or
there's<00:05:48.400> a<00:05:48.490> mob<00:05:48.910> feature<00:05:49.150> so<00:05:49.990> if<00:05:50.080> you<00:05:50.169> want<00:05:50.350> to

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
add more mobs you just copy and paste

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.440 
add more mobs you just copy and paste
cow<00:05:52.419> press<00:05:53.080> enter<00:05:53.410> once<00:05:54.180> giving<00:05:55.180> it<00:05:55.240> all<00:05:55.360> the

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
cow press enter once giving it all the

cow press enter once giving it all the
way<00:05:55.539> back<00:05:56.220> and<00:05:57.220> then<00:05:57.669> just<00:05:57.970> do<00:05:58.419> that<00:05:58.570> and<00:05:58.810> then

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
way back and then just do that and then

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.779 
way back and then just do that and then
repeat<00:05:59.260> you<00:05:59.800> can<00:05:59.950> change<00:06:00.160> that<00:06:00.310> the<00:06:00.400> creeper

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
repeat you can change that the creeper

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:02.820 
repeat you can change that the creeper
or<00:06:01.090> something<00:06:01.300> like<00:06:01.360> that<00:06:01.620> make<00:06:02.620> sure<00:06:02.650> you

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
or something like that make sure you

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:03.990 
or something like that make sure you
copy<00:06:02.950> and<00:06:03.130> paste<00:06:03.250> it<00:06:03.460> because<00:06:03.669> you<00:06:03.850> might

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
copy and paste it because you might

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.300 
copy and paste it because you might
towards<00:06:04.630> a<00:06:04.750> tab<00:06:05.169> or<00:06:05.410> some<00:06:05.620> kind<00:06:05.770> of<00:06:05.800> error<00:06:06.010> so

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
towards a tab or some kind of error so

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.730 
towards a tab or some kind of error so
this<00:06:06.789> gives<00:06:07.180> you<00:06:07.270> a<00:06:07.300> couple<00:06:08.169> options<00:06:08.229> you<00:06:08.620> can

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
this gives you a couple options you can

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.180 
this gives you a couple options you can
probably<00:06:08.940> copy<00:06:09.940> and<00:06:10.120> paste<00:06:10.330> the<00:06:10.479> whole<00:06:10.600> thing

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
probably copy and paste the whole thing

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.550 
probably copy and paste the whole thing
so<00:06:12.190> if<00:06:12.340> we<00:06:12.430> do<00:06:12.610> that<00:06:12.820> you<00:06:13.380> know<00:06:14.380> we<00:06:14.470> could

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
so if we do that you know we could

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.960 
so if we do that you know we could
probably<00:06:14.620> copy<00:06:15.100> and<00:06:15.250> paste<00:06:15.370> it<00:06:15.520> there<00:06:15.669> but<00:06:15.850> not

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
probably copy and paste it there but not

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.890 
probably copy and paste it there but not
gonna<00:06:16.090> and<00:06:17.020> then<00:06:17.320> we<00:06:17.500> can<00:06:17.620> come<00:06:17.830> down<00:06:18.070> to<00:06:18.900> what

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
gonna and then we can come down to what

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.610 
gonna and then we can come down to what
didn't<00:06:20.289> we<00:06:20.410> look<00:06:20.650> at

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
didn't we look at

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:27.730 
didn't we look at
two<00:06:23.389> meters<00:06:24.389> in<00:06:24.419> TPS<00:06:25.289> and<00:06:25.319> I<00:06:25.889> think<00:06:26.159> you<00:06:26.520> I

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
two meters in TPS and I think you I

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.200 
two meters in TPS and I think you I
think<00:06:28.740> that's<00:06:29.039> pretty<00:06:29.219> much<00:06:29.370> it<00:06:29.729> we<00:06:29.939> cover

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
think that's pretty much it we cover

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.909 
think that's pretty much it we cover
most<00:06:30.419> of<00:06:30.569> the<00:06:30.629> plugin<00:06:31.050> oh<00:06:31.229> it's<00:06:31.830> probably

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
most of the plugin oh it's probably

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.119 
most of the plugin oh it's probably
something<00:06:32.370> I<00:06:32.430> didn't<00:06:32.669> look<00:06:32.759> at<00:06:32.969> oh<00:06:33.749> yeah<00:06:34.229> this

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:35.129 
something I didn't look at oh yeah this

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:37.760 
something I didn't look at oh yeah this
is<00:06:35.159> uh<00:06:35.370> this<00:06:36.360> is<00:06:36.419> what<00:06:36.719> your<00:06:36.839> logs<00:06:37.050> do<00:06:37.289> so<00:06:37.559> if

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
is uh this is what your logs do so if

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.890 
is uh this is what your logs do so if
you<00:06:38.039> if<00:06:38.759> you<00:06:38.999> didn't<00:06:39.210> want<00:06:39.360> your<00:06:39.449> server<00:06:39.749> to

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
you if you didn't want your server to

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.659 
you if you didn't want your server to
keep<00:06:40.050> large<00:06:40.349> logs<00:06:40.710> or<00:06:40.919> of<00:06:41.159> anything<00:06:41.550> what

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:41.669 
keep large logs or of anything what

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:44.119 
keep large logs or of anything what
happens<00:06:42.029> you<00:06:42.210> can<00:06:42.240> purge<00:06:42.990> it<00:06:43.259> so<00:06:43.740> you<00:06:43.830> can<00:06:43.949> set

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:44.129 
happens you can purge it so you can set

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:45.619
