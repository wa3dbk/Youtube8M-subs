I had barely played it beyond the first
couple<00:03:46.200> levels<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.800> sold<00:03:47.430> it<00:03:47.550> off<00:03:47.640> at<00:03:47.850> a

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
couple levels and sold it off at a

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.550 
couple levels and sold it off at a
garage<00:03:48.060> sale<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.540> very<00:03:48.750> next<00:03:49.080> summer<00:03:49.260> I

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
garage sale the very next summer I

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.620 
garage sale the very next summer I
hunted<00:03:50.250> down<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.430> copy<00:03:50.790> just<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.210> see<00:03:51.420> if<00:03:51.510> I

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
hunted down a copy just to see if I

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.330 
hunted down a copy just to see if I
misjudged<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.320> all<00:03:52.500> those<00:03:52.680> years<00:03:52.890> ago<00:03:53.130> and

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
misjudged that all those years ago and

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.210 
misjudged that all those years ago and
yeah<00:03:54.030> it's<00:03:54.300> still<00:03:54.480> pretty<00:03:54.690> bad<00:03:54.920> granted<00:03:55.920> it's

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
yeah it's still pretty bad granted it's

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.820 
yeah it's still pretty bad granted it's
not<00:03:56.370> nearly<00:03:56.700> as<00:03:56.880> bad<00:03:57.030> as<00:03:57.210> I<00:03:57.330> remember<00:03:57.830> the

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
not nearly as bad as I remember the

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.180 
not nearly as bad as I remember the
original<00:03:59.010> still<00:03:59.550> kills<00:03:59.820> it<00:04:00.000> though
