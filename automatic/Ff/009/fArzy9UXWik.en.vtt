00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
like this for example now it may not

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.270

seem<00:01:16.259> like<00:01:16.290> much<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.710> first<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.159> actually

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
seem like much at first but it actually

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.039 
seem like much at first but it actually

version<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:05.120> little<00:04:06.120> bit<00:04:06.329> surprising<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:06.840> guess

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
version a little bit surprising I guess

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.470 
version a little bit surprising I guess
not<00:04:07.200> that<00:04:07.230> many<00:04:07.500> people<00:04:07.590> know<00:04:07.739> about<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.250> and

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
not that many people know about it and

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.810 
not that many people know about it and
then<00:04:09.480> we<00:04:09.540> can<00:04:09.660> also<00:04:09.780> go<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:09.959> clan<00:04:10.640> look<00:04:11.640> at<00:04:11.730> that

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
then we can also go to clan look at that

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.940 
then we can also go to clan look at that
seek<00:04:12.060> universe<00:04:12.390> ranks<00:04:12.750> number<00:04:12.870> 3<00:04:13.260> with<00:04:13.410> an<00:04:13.530> 11

I'm<00:04:14.640> not<00:04:14.790> sure<00:04:14.910> who<00:04:15.060> set<00:04:15.299> that<00:04:15.329> but

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
I'm not sure who set that but

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.229
