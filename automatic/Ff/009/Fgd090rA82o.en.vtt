00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
to me by G garb of and he's been

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.640 
to me by G garb of and he's been
experimenting<00:00:49.280> with<00:00:49.280> block<00:00:49.760> number<00:00:50.239> 36<00:00:51.170> which

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
experimenting with block number 36 which

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.890 
experimenting with block number 36 which
is<00:00:51.830> actually<00:00:52.040> part<00:00:52.519> of<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:52.760> piston<00:00:53.300> code<00:00:53.600> but

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900

is<00:00:54.080> essentially<00:00:54.739> an<00:00:54.949> invisible<00:00:55.640> block<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.540> you

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
is essentially an invisible block so you

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.600 
is essentially an invisible block so you
can't<00:00:56.870> place<00:00:57.110> it<00:00:57.140> in<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:57.409> normal<00:00:57.890> game<00:00:58.070> but

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
can't place it in the normal game but

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.250 
can't place it in the normal game but
you<00:00:58.760> can<00:00:58.909> place<00:00:59.150> it<00:00:59.390> if<00:00:59.510> you're<00:00:59.629> using<00:00:59.870> morse

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
you can place it if you're using morse

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.170 
you can place it if you're using morse
to<00:01:00.470> make<00:01:00.650> an<00:01:00.799> adventure<00:01:01.339> map<00:01:01.489> or<00:01:01.699> something

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
and then somebody playing that adventure

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.180 
and then somebody playing that adventure
map<00:01:04.820> with<00:01:05.120> no<00:01:05.150> mud<00:01:05.600> so<00:01:05.810> anything<00:01:06.290> it<00:01:06.620> will<00:01:07.010> be

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
map with no mud so anything it will be

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.280 
map with no mud so anything it will be
there<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:07.520> it<00:01:07.880> will<00:01:08.180> work<00:01:08.450> in<00:01:08.750> vanilla

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
there and it will work in vanilla
