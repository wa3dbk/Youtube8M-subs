00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.510 
the Argentinian squad we're on Miss Indy
Maria<00:01:24.180> they've<00:01:24.900> always<00:01:25.290> had<00:01:25.680> such<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> good

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
Maria they've always had such a good

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.179 
Maria they've always had such a good
attacking<00:01:27.090> aside<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.470> my<00:01:28.619> opinion<00:01:29.040> I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
attacking aside but in my opinion I

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.890 
attacking aside but in my opinion I
don't<00:01:29.220> think<00:01:29.549> they're<00:01:29.700> very<00:01:30.000> tight

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
don't think they're very tight

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.060 
don't think they're very tight
defensively

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
defensively

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.429 
defensively
I<00:01:32.100> mean<00:01:32.670> Javier<00:01:33.299> Mascherano<00:01:33.869> yeah<00:01:34.229> he's

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
I mean Javier Mascherano yeah he's

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.990 
I mean Javier Mascherano yeah he's
obviously<00:01:34.979> playing<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.250> bar<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.520> he's<00:01:35.790> really

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
obviously playing a bar so he's really

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.929 
obviously playing a bar so he's really
good<00:01:36.329> but<00:01:36.780> he<00:01:36.960> he's<00:01:37.530> kind<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.950> short<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.909> a

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
good but he he's kind of short for a

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.969 
good but he he's kind of short for a
defender<00:01:39.420> he's<00:01:39.600> never<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.470> imposing

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
defender he's never really that imposing

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.429 
defender he's never really that imposing
and<00:01:41.100> he<00:01:41.250> mostly<00:01:41.670> plays<00:01:41.759> at<00:01:42.119> CDM<00:01:42.600> anyway<00:01:43.110> for

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
and he mostly plays at CDM anyway for

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.679 
and he mostly plays at CDM anyway for
his<00:01:43.619> country<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.430> think<00:01:44.549> there<00:01:44.850> are<00:01:45.030> Janina

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
his country so I think there are Janina

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.060 
his country so I think there are Janina
will<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:45.990> prove<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.350> very<00:01:46.470> dangerous<00:01:46.799> on

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
will just prove to be very dangerous on

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.710 
will just prove to be very dangerous on
the<00:01:47.189> counter<00:01:47.460> but<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:47.850> would<00:01:48.030> be<00:01:48.180> very<00:01:48.509> easy

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the counter but they would be very easy

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.469 
the counter but they would be very easy
to<00:01:48.960> penetrate<00:01:49.759> defensively<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.299> don't

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
to penetrate defensively and I don't

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.510 
to penetrate defensively and I don't
know<00:01:51.659> who<00:01:51.750> they<00:01:51.869> haven't<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.979> believe

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
know who they haven't go but I believe

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.370 
know who they haven't go but I believe
that<00:01:53.549> number<00:01:53.970> one<00:01:54.090> keeper<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.509> Romelu<00:01:55.170> or

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
that number one keeper is Romelu or

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.050 
that number one keeper is Romelu or
something<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.130> for<00:01:56.729> me<00:01:56.759> he's

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
something like that and for me he's

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.270 
something like that and for me he's
always<00:01:57.270> really<00:01:57.630> inconsistently<00:01:58.280> unreliable

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
always really inconsistently unreliable

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.350 
always really inconsistently unreliable
so<00:02:00.149> that's<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.540> good<00:02:00.719> thing<00:02:00.979> for<00:02:01.979> us<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.549> yeah

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
so that's a good thing for us and yeah

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.749
