my equipment setup that's crucial to

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.910 
my equipment setup that's crucial to
swim<00:00:43.110> baits<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.500> having<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.829> right

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
swim baits is having the right

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.619 
swim baits is having the right
application<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.640> right<00:00:44.789> rod<00:00:45.000> or<00:00:45.239> write<00:00:45.390> real

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
application the right rod or write real

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.880 
application the right rod or write real
the<00:00:45.840> right<00:00:45.989> line<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.699> catch<00:00:47.699> a<00:00:47.820> fish<00:00:48.559> so<00:00:49.559> right

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
the right line to catch a fish so right

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.889 
the right line to catch a fish so right
off<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.070> bat<00:00:50.250> from<00:00:50.969> ice<00:00:51.180> out<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.960> 48<00:00:52.410> degrees

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
off the bat from ice out to 48 degrees

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.650 
off the bat from ice out to 48 degrees
so<00:00:54.899> basically<00:00:55.260> winter<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.859> early<00:00:55.920> spring<00:00:56.660> my

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
so basically winter to early spring my

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.229 
so basically winter to early spring my
go-to<00:00:57.960> baits<00:00:58.590> are<00:00:58.949> these<00:00:59.370> two<00:00:59.609> right<00:00:59.820> here<00:00:59.850> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
go-to baits are these two right here and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.910 
go-to baits are these two right here and
it's<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.539> swarming<00:01:00.899> Hornet<00:01:01.230> fish<00:01:01.410> head<00:01:01.590> spin

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
it's the swarming Hornet fish head spin

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.430 
it's the swarming Hornet fish head spin
it's<00:01:02.699> also<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.090> context<00:01:03.510> women<00:01:03.870> packed<00:01:04.140> fat

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
it's also the context women packed fat

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.430 
it's also the context women packed fat
and<00:01:04.739> those<00:01:05.640> two<00:01:05.880> baits<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.960> fish<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
and those two baits you fish on the

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.920 
and those two baits you fish on the
bottom<00:01:07.830> now<00:01:08.160> you<00:01:08.760> can<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.270> know<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.600> do<00:01:09.900> a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
bottom now you can you know you can do a

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.120 
bottom now you can you know you can do a
little<00:01:10.110> bit<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> different<00:01:10.770> things<00:01:10.920> with

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
little bit of the different things with

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.289 
little bit of the different things with
them<00:01:11.250> you're<00:01:11.490> going<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> see<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> little<00:01:12.060> bit<00:01:12.180> as

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
them you're going to see a little bit as

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.990 
them you're going to see a little bit as
I<00:01:12.450> go<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.780> these<00:01:13.740> baits<00:01:13.979> are<00:01:14.189> versatile<00:01:14.729> but

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
I go on these baits are versatile but

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.370 
I go on these baits are versatile but
for<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> gist<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.869> when<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> water<00:01:16.290> is

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
for the gist of it when the water is

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.350 
for the gist of it when the water is
real<00:01:16.560> cool<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.880> want<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.119> move<00:01:18.210> it

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
real cool like that you want to move it

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.929 
real cool like that you want to move it
real<00:01:18.570> slow<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.290> like<00:01:19.530> swindle<00:01:20.400> said<00:01:20.579> earlier

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
real slow so like swindle said earlier

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.399 
real slow so like swindle said earlier
you<00:01:21.210> know<00:01:21.360> when<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.720> water<00:01:21.869> temperature<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
you know when that water temperature is

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.810 
you know when that water temperature is
low<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.650> want<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> make<00:01:23.009> sure<00:01:23.040> you're<00:01:23.520> moving

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
low you want to make sure you're moving

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.190 
low you want to make sure you're moving
that<00:01:23.909> presentation<00:01:24.299> real<00:01:24.630> slow<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> fish

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
that presentation real slow the fish

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.350 
that presentation real slow the fish
aren't<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.560> active<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.250> baits<00:01:27.119> not

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
aren't that active and the baits not

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.969 
aren't that active and the baits not
moving<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.720> fast<00:01:27.960> either<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:28.770> real

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
moving that fast either so it's real

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.859 
moving that fast either so it's real
slow<00:01:29.340> presentation<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.479> bottom

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
thing apart paralleled every single side

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.650 
thing apart paralleled every single side
to<00:04:40.560> that<00:04:40.680> pylon<00:04:41.130> never<00:04:41.940> even<00:04:42.120> caught<00:04:42.360> a<00:04:42.390> fish

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
to that pylon never even caught a fish

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.210 
to that pylon never even caught a fish
as<00:04:43.020> soon<00:04:43.200> as<00:04:43.290> she<00:04:43.440> left<00:04:43.620> I<00:04:43.770> pulled<00:04:43.980> up<00:04:44.100> there

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
as soon as she left I pulled up there

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.950 
as soon as she left I pulled up there
with<00:04:44.370> that<00:04:44.400> KY<00:04:44.670> tech<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:45.090> caught<00:04:45.390> like<00:04:45.540> 10<00:04:45.750> in<00:04:45.870> a

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
with that KY tech I caught like 10 in a

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.590 
with that KY tech I caught like 10 in a
row<00:04:45.990> so<00:04:46.800> that's<00:04:46.980> just<00:04:47.070> a<00:04:47.310> prime<00:04:47.610> example<00:04:47.640> and

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
row so that's just a prime example and

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.480 
row so that's just a prime example and
now<00:04:49.080> it<00:04:49.260> could<00:04:49.410> be<00:04:49.620> you<00:04:49.950> could<00:04:49.980> get<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.370> that

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
now it could be you could get to that

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.860 
now it could be you could get to that
piling<00:04:50.910> I<00:04:51.030> could<00:04:51.180> have<00:04:51.270> not<00:04:51.390> caught<00:04:51.630> anything

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
piling I could have not caught anything

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.180 
piling I could have not caught anything
on<00:04:52.080> those<00:04:52.200> two<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:52.680> I<00:04:52.710> could<00:04:52.860> have<00:04:52.950> picked<00:04:53.040> up

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
on those two and I could have picked up

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.410 
on those two and I could have picked up
that<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.400> rig<00:04:53.700> and<00:04:53.850> I<00:04:53.880> could<00:04:54.030> have<00:04:54.120> wore<00:04:54.270> them

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
that a rig and I could have wore them

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.470 
that a rig and I could have wore them
out<00:04:54.510> so<00:04:55.320> it<00:04:55.680> just<00:04:55.890> shows<00:04:56.160> that<00:04:56.340> mixing<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.360> up

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
out so it just shows that mixing it up

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.670 
out so it just shows that mixing it up
and<00:04:57.720> not<00:04:57.810> just<00:04:57.990> getting<00:04:58.170> caught<00:04:58.410> up<00:04:58.440> but

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
and not just getting caught up but

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.560 
and not just getting caught up but
throwing<00:04:58.920> one<00:04:59.160> thing<00:04:59.520> could<00:05:00.000> allow<00:05:00.210> you<00:05:00.270> put

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
throwing one thing could allow you put

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.390 
throwing one thing could allow you put
more<00:05:00.720> fish<00:05:00.990> in<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.140> boat<00:05:01.350> just<00:05:02.010> keeping<00:05:02.340> an
