on<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> head<00:00:45.649> you<00:00:46.649> will<00:00:46.770> find<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.340> because

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
on the head you will find that because

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.869 
on the head you will find that because
it's<00:00:48.059> loosely<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.840> slide<00:00:49.110> around<00:00:49.670> it<00:00:50.670> will

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
it's loosely it can slide around it will

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.119 
it's loosely it can slide around it will
be<00:00:51.000> eliminating<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> tension<00:00:52.140> but<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.920> might

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
be eliminating the tension but you might

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.790 
be eliminating the tension but you might
have<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.640> movement<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:55.170> hold<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.620> in

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
have that movement so to hold that in

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.880 
have that movement so to hold that in
place<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.820> use<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.180> hair<00:00:57.420> pin<00:00:57.710> which<00:00:58.710> is

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
place you can use the hair pin which is

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.319 
place you can use the hair pin which is
better<00:00:59.039> than<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> bobby<00:00:59.550> pin<00:00:59.640> because<00:01:00.030> it's

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
better than a bobby pin because it's

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.290 
better than a bobby pin because it's
already<00:01:00.690> open<00:01:01.199> whereas<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> bobby<00:01:02.250> pin<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.820> very

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
already open whereas a bobby pin is very

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.950 
already open whereas a bobby pin is very
very<00:01:03.570> tight<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.260> won't<00:01:04.500> stay<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.150> band

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
very tight and it won't stay on the band

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.840 
very tight and it won't stay on the band
itself<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.220> use<00:01:08.549> an<00:01:08.700> open<00:01:09.710> hair<00:01:10.710> pin<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
itself so you use an open hair pin and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.609 
itself so you use an open hair pin and
you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.360> secure<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:14.030> under<00:01:15.030> your<00:01:15.150> hair

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:25.039 

holding<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.770> band<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.280> place<00:01:23.900> so<00:01:24.900> you've

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
holding the band in place so you've

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.230 
holding the band in place so you've
eliminated<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.710> tension<00:01:26.100> by<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> larger

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
eliminated the tension by a larger

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.690 
eliminated the tension by a larger
headband<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.960> holding<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:28.950> place<00:01:29.070> with

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
headband and holding it in place with

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.510 
headband and holding it in place with
the<00:01:30.030> hair<00:01:30.240> pins<00:01:30.479> your<00:01:31.200> second<00:01:31.560> option<00:01:31.710> for

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
the hair pins your second option for

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.230 
the hair pins your second option for
having<00:01:32.880> headbands<00:01:33.329> not<00:01:33.630> hurt<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:35.090> keep<00:01:36.090> in

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
having headbands not hurt is to keep in

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.850 
having headbands not hurt is to keep in
mind<00:01:36.420> when<00:01:36.630> getting<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.020> headband<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.680> get<00:01:37.829> a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
mind when getting a headband to get a

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.670 
mind when getting a headband to get a
fair<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.490> style<00:01:38.790> headband<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.229> take

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
fair and a style headband you can take

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.310 
fair and a style headband you can take
the<00:01:40.920> clip<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> end<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.939> slide<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the clip on the end and slide it on to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.380 
the clip on the end and slide it on to
the<00:01:43.439> hair<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:44.399> way<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.700> locking<00:01:44.939> onto<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the hair that way it's locking onto the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.569 
the hair that way it's locking onto the
hair<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.780> not<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.140> head<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.280> are

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
hair and not the head so you are

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.600 
hair and not the head so you are
eliminating<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> tension<00:01:49.549> that<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
eliminating the tension that a

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.810 
eliminating the tension that a
traditional<00:01:51.450> style<00:01:51.659> headband<00:01:52.170> creates

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
traditional style headband creates

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.639 
traditional style headband creates
pulling<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.970> band<00:01:54.479> across<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.899> top<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
pulling the band across the top and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.730 
pulling the band across the top and
using<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> clip<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.820> other<00:01:56.909> side<00:01:57.740> to

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
using the clip on the other side to

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.910 
using the clip on the other side to
secure<00:01:58.950> placement<00:01:59.549> here<00:02:00.079> which<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.380> also

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
secure placement here which is also

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.889 
secure placement here which is also
locking<00:02:02.520> onto<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.790> hair<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.299> not<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.659> head

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
locking onto the hair and not the head

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.080 
locking onto the hair and not the head
so<00:02:04.439> you've<00:02:04.590> eliminated<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.130> tension<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.759> it

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
so you've eliminated the tension and it

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.570 
so you've eliminated the tension and it
also<00:02:06.240> stays<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.840> place<00:02:07.049> I'm<00:02:07.860> summer<00:02:08.250> Spence

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
also stays in place I'm summer Spence

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.219 
also stays in place I'm summer Spence
and<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.879> just<00:02:09.119> showed<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.420> two<00:02:09.660> possible

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
and I just showed you two possible

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.380 
and I just showed you two possible
solutions<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:11.039> wearing<00:02:11.670> headbands<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.239> that

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
solutions to wearing headbands so that

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.700 
solutions to wearing headbands so that
they<00:02:12.480> do

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
they do

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.920 
they do
