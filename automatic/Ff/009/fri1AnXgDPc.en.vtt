00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.360 
stuff but I think when it comes to
racing<00:05:23.330> battling<00:05:24.200> up<00:05:24.350> friends<00:05:24.710> once<00:05:25.220> you

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
racing battling up friends once you

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.710 
racing battling up friends once you
leave<00:05:25.490> this<00:05:25.640> semi<00:05:25.940> it's<00:05:26.090> pretty<00:05:26.330> much<00:05:26.480> over

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720
