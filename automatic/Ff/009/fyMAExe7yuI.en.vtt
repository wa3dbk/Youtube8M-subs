pulse<00:00:25.050> rifles<00:00:25.439> are<00:00:25.590> definitely<00:00:25.980> good<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.279> PvE

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
pulse rifles are definitely good in PvE

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.939

but<00:00:26.970> Hankin<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.420> dominate<00:00:27.930> however<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
but Hankin is dominate however in the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.529 
but Hankin is dominate however in the
crucible<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.699> other<00:00:29.820> way<00:00:29.970> around<00:00:30.240> and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
crucible it's the other way around and

this pulse rifle is a mid high-impact
pulse<00:00:39.270> rifle<00:00:39.660> similar<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.079> The<00:00:40.200> Strangers

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
pulse rifle similar to The Strangers

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.459 
pulse rifle similar to The Strangers
rifle<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.489> rate<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.760> fire<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.180> at<00:00:42.390> 360<00:00:43.200> rounds

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
per minute that is sustained of course

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.150 
per minute that is sustained of course
not<00:00:45.329> within<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.780> first<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.620> counting<00:00:47.010> in

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
not within the first that is counting in

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.680 
not within the first that is counting in
the<00:00:47.309> first<00:00:47.520> delays<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.030> making<00:00:48.450> an<00:00:48.539> average

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the first delays in making an average

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.680 
the first delays in making an average
basically<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.920> impact<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.610> as<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.090> said<00:00:51.300> mid<00:00:51.539> to

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
basically the impact is as I said mid to

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.689 
basically the impact is as I said mid to
high<00:00:51.870> it'll<00:00:52.230> do<00:00:52.379> 33<00:00:52.829> damage<00:00:53.280> with<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> headshot

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
high it'll do 33 damage with a headshot

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.850 
high it'll do 33 damage with a headshot
and<00:00:54.120> 22<00:00:54.510> with<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.719> body<00:00:54.930> shot<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> crucible

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
and 22 with a body shot in the crucible

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.189 
and 22 with a body shot in the crucible
which<00:00:56.460> means<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.879> will<00:00:56.969> take<00:00:57.210> 6<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.719> 10<00:00:57.899> shots

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
which means it will take 6 to 10 shots

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.900 
which means it will take 6 to 10 shots
to<00:00:58.379> kill<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.559> guardian<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.280> time<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.609> kill<00:00:59.760> is

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
to kill a guardian the time to kill is

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.729 
to kill a guardian the time to kill is
very<00:01:00.239> very<00:01:00.510> fast<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:01.050> you're<00:01:01.170> up<00:01:01.379> against<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
very very fast if you're up against a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.130 
very very fast if you're up against a
low<00:01:02.039> armored<00:01:02.579> guardian<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.750> kill<00:01:03.899> them

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
low armored guardian you can kill them

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.010 
low armored guardian you can kill them
in<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.519> 0.67<00:01:05.519> seconds<00:01:06.090> which<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.330> insane

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
in just 0.67 seconds which is insane

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.109 
in just 0.67 seconds which is insane
basically<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.530> two<00:01:07.710> bursts<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.970> only

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
basically in two bursts this is only

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.090 
basically in two bursts this is only
rivaled<00:01:09.450> by<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> three<00:01:10.170> little<00:01:10.350> words<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
rivaled by the three little words in the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.450 
rivaled by the three little words in the
last<00:01:11.340> word<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.060> thorn<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.630> stuff<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:13.080> that

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
last word and thorn and stuff like that

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.429 
last word and thorn and stuff like that
extremely<00:01:14.460> fast<00:01:14.700> time<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.000> kill<00:01:15.360> however<00:01:16.200> it's

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
extremely fast time to kill however it's

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.350 
extremely fast time to kill however it's
not<00:01:16.560> very<00:01:16.799> consistent<00:01:17.220> if<00:01:17.640> you're<00:01:17.939> up<00:01:18.030> against

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
not very consistent if you're up against

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.690 
not very consistent if you're up against
a<00:01:18.450> highly<00:01:18.840> armored<00:01:19.170> Guardian<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:20.250> won't<00:01:20.549> be

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
a highly armored Guardian you won't be

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.399 
a highly armored Guardian you won't be
able<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.939> kill<00:01:21.090> them<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.330> two<00:01:21.479> bursts<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.020> your

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
able to kill them in two bursts and your

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.870 
able to kill them in two bursts and your
time<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.710> kill<00:01:22.860> will<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.130> much<00:01:23.340> closer<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.850> a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
time to kill will be much closer to a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.210 
time to kill will be much closer to a
second<00:01:24.420> however<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.680> still<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> very<00:01:26.100> very

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
second however that is still a very very

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.580 
second however that is still a very very
nice<00:01:26.549> time<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.970> kill<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.810> range<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.259> great

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
nice time to kill the range is great

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.590 
nice time to kill the range is great
it's<00:01:28.860> almost<00:01:29.310> scout<00:01:29.759> rifle<00:01:30.119> range<00:01:30.360> which<00:01:30.570> is

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
it's almost scout rifle range which is

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.899 
it's almost scout rifle range which is
absolutely<00:01:31.320> insane<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:32.220> don't<00:01:32.549> need<00:01:32.759> that

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
absolutely insane you don't need that

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.520 
absolutely insane you don't need that
much<00:01:33.090> range<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.450> PvP<00:01:33.900> unless<00:01:34.229> you're<00:01:34.350> playing

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
much range in PvP unless you're playing

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.560 
much range in PvP unless you're playing
on<00:01:34.680> something<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.130> first<00:01:35.430> slide<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> Bastiaan

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
on something like first slide a Bastiaan

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.660 
on something like first slide a Bastiaan
most<00:01:37.320> crucible<00:01:37.890> maps<00:01:38.070> are<00:01:38.250> not<00:01:38.280> that

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
most crucible maps are not that

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.249 
most crucible maps are not that
long-range<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.270> you're<00:01:39.390> not<00:01:39.630> gonna<00:01:39.840> notice

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
long-range and you're not gonna notice

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.899 
long-range and you're not gonna notice
it<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.650> can<00:01:40.829> safely<00:01:41.070> use<00:01:41.310> something<00:01:41.880> like

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
it so you can safely use something like

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.580 
it so you can safely use something like
handle<00:01:42.360> aid<00:01:42.450> stock<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.960> get<00:01:43.079> extra<00:01:43.439> stability

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
handle aid stock to get extra stability

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.069 
handle aid stock to get extra stability
at<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> cost<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.549> range<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.119> won't<00:01:45.810> be

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
at the cost of range you won't be

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.920 
at the cost of range you won't be
affected<00:01:46.590> too<00:01:46.710> much<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:47.159> PvP<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:48.090> PvE<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.750> does

affected too much in PvP in PvE it does

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.719 
affected too much in PvP in PvE it does
come<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.140> handy<00:01:49.530> sometimes<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.189> overall<00:01:50.490> it

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
come in handy sometimes but overall it

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.480 
come in handy sometimes but overall it
is<00:01:50.880> very<00:01:51.240> very<00:01:51.450> situational<00:01:52.310> usually<00:01:53.310> you

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
is very very situational usually you

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.940 
is very very situational usually you
don't<00:01:53.790> need<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.240> range<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.439> stability

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
don't need that range the stability

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.160 
don't need that range the stability
isn't<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.579> great<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.119> not<00:01:57.270> bad<00:01:57.570> either<00:01:57.840> I

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
isn't that great it's not bad either I

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.690 
isn't that great it's not bad either I
definitely<00:01:58.680> recommend<00:01:58.950> getting<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.430> perk<00:01:59.640> to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
definitely recommend getting a perk to

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.340 
definitely recommend getting a perk to
improve<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.180> though<00:02:00.329> like<00:02:00.540> braced<00:02:00.869> frame<00:02:01.140> or

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
improve it though like braced frame or

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.530 
improve it though like braced frame or
hand<00:02:01.560> laid<00:02:01.740> stock<00:02:02.070> thing<00:02:02.729> about<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
hand laid stock thing about it is that

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.990 
hand laid stock thing about it is that
it's<00:02:03.840> very<00:02:04.110> manageable<00:02:04.380> but<00:02:05.100> even<00:02:05.460> then<00:02:05.670> you

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
it's very manageable but even then you

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.940 
it's very manageable but even then you
are<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.450> relied<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.140> headshot<00:02:07.530> since<00:02:07.829> you

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
are so relied on the headshot since you

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.740 
are so relied on the headshot since you
can<00:02:08.069> potentially<00:02:08.610> get<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.910> 2<00:02:09.149> bar<00:02:09.330> skill<00:02:09.599> with

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
can potentially get a 2 bar skill with

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.690 
can potentially get a 2 bar skill with
this<00:02:09.899> gun<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.649> landing<00:02:11.069> all<00:02:11.280> those<00:02:11.459> headshots

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
this gun so landing all those headshots

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.559 
this gun so landing all those headshots
is<00:02:12.090> gonna<00:02:12.270> be<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:12.660> important<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.319> you

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
is gonna be so important to you

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.599 
is gonna be so important to you
and<00:02:13.659> therefore<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.590> recommend<00:02:15.099> getting<00:02:15.249> great

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:15.609 
and therefore I recommend getting great

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:17.459 
and therefore I recommend getting great
strain<00:02:15.909> on<00:02:16.120> handmade<00:02:16.359> stock<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.959> improve<00:02:17.260> on

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
strain on handmade stock to improve on

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.589 
strain on handmade stock to improve on
the<00:02:17.769> stability<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.790> reload<00:02:19.090> speed<00:02:19.329> is<00:02:19.450> pretty

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
the stability the reload speed is pretty

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.360 
the stability the reload speed is pretty
moderate<00:02:20.019> it's<00:02:20.290> not<00:02:20.469> the<00:02:20.590> fastest<00:02:21.010> it's<00:02:21.129> not

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
moderate it's not the fastest it's not

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.619 
moderate it's not the fastest it's not
the<00:02:21.489> slowest<00:02:21.849> it's<00:02:21.969> somewhere<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.299> the<00:02:22.389> middle

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
the slowest it's somewhere in the middle

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.110 
the slowest it's somewhere in the middle
so<00:02:22.870> some<00:02:23.739> of<00:02:23.769> this<00:02:23.859> gun<00:02:24.069> up<00:02:24.249> in<00:02:24.430> PvP<00:02:24.909> it

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
so some of this gun up in PvP it

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.270 
so some of this gun up in PvP it
performs<00:02:25.599> very<00:02:25.749> similarly<00:02:26.379> to<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:27.010> strange

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
performs very similarly to the strange

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.550 
performs very similarly to the strange
rifle<00:02:27.819> if<00:02:28.329> I<00:02:28.510> significantly<00:02:29.170> faster<00:02:29.349> than

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
rifle if I significantly faster than

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.649 
rifle if I significantly faster than
three<00:02:29.859> little<00:02:30.040> words<00:02:30.219> and<00:02:30.519> it<00:02:30.969> is<00:02:31.090> really<00:02:31.510> good

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
three little words and it is really good

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.690 
three little words and it is really good
for<00:02:31.810> conservative<00:02:32.379> PvP<00:02:32.859> players<00:02:33.129> but<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:33.549> can

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
for conservative PvP players but it can

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.920 
for conservative PvP players but it can
definitely<00:02:33.879> be<00:02:34.150> used<00:02:34.389> in<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.569> more<00:02:34.719> aggressive

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
definitely be used in a more aggressive

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:35.849 
definitely be used in a more aggressive
role<00:02:35.260> as<00:02:35.439> well

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
role as well

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.559 
role as well
it's<00:02:35.980> got<00:02:36.159> really<00:02:36.340> shines<00:02:36.670> at<00:02:36.879> a<00:02:36.969> medium<00:02:37.389> range

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
it's got really shines at a medium range

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.270 
it's got really shines at a medium range
at<00:02:37.959> long<00:02:38.230> distance<00:02:38.650> you're<00:02:38.769> usually<00:02:38.950> gonna

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
at long distance you're usually gonna

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.369 
at long distance you're usually gonna
get<00:02:39.459> outdone<00:02:39.819> by<00:02:39.969> a<00:02:40.000> sniper<00:02:40.299> or<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.569> scout<00:02:40.900> rifle

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
get outdone by a sniper or a scout rifle

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.530 
get outdone by a sniper or a scout rifle
but<00:02:41.829> it<00:02:41.950> can<00:02:42.099> definitely<00:02:42.400> challenge<00:02:43.180> people

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
but it can definitely challenge people

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.839 
but it can definitely challenge people
and<00:02:43.780> in<00:02:44.139> short<00:02:44.409> ranges<00:02:44.799> you<00:02:45.010> usually<00:02:45.280> get<00:02:45.639> out

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
and in short ranges you usually get out

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.849 
and in short ranges you usually get out
gun<00:02:46.090> by<00:02:46.239> shotguns<00:02:46.870> or<00:02:47.109> the<00:02:47.260> new<00:02:47.379> side<00:02:47.680> on

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
gun by shotguns or the new side on

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.440 
gun by shotguns or the new side on
because<00:02:48.189> they<00:02:48.340> kill<00:02:48.549> significantly<00:02:49.180> faster

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
because they kill significantly faster

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.030 
because they kill significantly faster
in<00:02:49.750> close<00:02:49.900> quarters<00:02:50.230> they're<00:02:50.379> a<00:02:50.409> lot<00:02:50.620> easier

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
in close quarters they're a lot easier

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.399 
in close quarters they're a lot easier
to<00:02:51.250> use<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:52.090> gun<00:02:52.269> has<00:02:52.449> a<00:02:52.480> great<00:02:52.719> magazine<00:02:52.959> size

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:53.409 
to use the gun has a great magazine size

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.129 
to use the gun has a great magazine size
of<00:02:53.530> 27<00:02:54.129> however<00:02:54.519> on<00:02:54.760> my<00:02:54.939> personal<00:02:55.419> one<00:02:55.750> here<00:02:55.989> I

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
of 27 however on my personal one here I

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.839 
of 27 however on my personal one here I
do<00:02:56.199> have<00:02:56.349> brace<00:02:56.680> frame<00:02:56.949> basically<00:02:57.280> taking<00:02:57.760> it

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
do have brace frame basically taking it

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.300 
do have brace frame basically taking it
down<00:02:57.969> to<00:02:58.150> 21<00:02:58.480> which<00:02:59.169> I<00:02:59.319> don't<00:02:59.379> notice<00:02:59.739> too<00:03:00.069> much

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
down to 21 which I don't notice too much

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.250 
down to 21 which I don't notice too much
and<00:03:00.639> I'd<00:03:01.000> say<00:03:01.180> this<00:03:01.329> gun<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:01.659> a<00:03:01.689> very<00:03:01.780> worthy

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
and I'd say this gun is a very worthy

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.099 
and I'd say this gun is a very worthy
red<00:03:02.620> death<00:03:02.829> replacement<00:03:03.579> in<00:03:03.760> PvE<00:03:04.689> it<00:03:04.989> does

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
red death replacement in PvE it does

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.020 
red death replacement in PvE it does
nothing<00:03:05.469> too<00:03:05.650> spectacular<00:03:05.889> to<00:03:06.430> wounded<00:03:06.819> being

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
nothing too spectacular to wounded being

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.610 
nothing too spectacular to wounded being

used or a hand cannon or a scout rifle

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.770 
used or a hand cannon or a scout rifle
it's<00:03:09.400> not<00:03:09.579> bad<00:03:09.790> at<00:03:09.939> all<00:03:10.060> it's<00:03:10.329> just<00:03:10.389> not<00:03:10.659> as

these<00:04:41.110> two<00:04:41.349> as<00:04:41.530> I<00:04:42.009> mentioned<00:04:42.340> earlier<00:04:42.669> the

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:42.819 
these two as I mentioned earlier the

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.730 
these two as I mentioned earlier the
range<00:04:43.030> is<00:04:43.180> great<00:04:43.419> too<00:04:43.659> so<00:04:43.689> hand<00:04:44.080> laid<00:04:44.229> stock<00:04:44.530> is

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
range is great too so hand laid stock is

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.290 
range is great too so hand laid stock is
not<00:04:45.009> gonna<00:04:45.189> hurt<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.580> gun<00:04:45.699> very<00:04:45.849> much<00:04:46.090> at<00:04:46.270> all

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
not gonna hurt the gun very much at all

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.149 
not gonna hurt the gun very much at all
in<00:04:46.689> part<00:04:47.169> two<00:04:47.409> you<00:04:47.650> can<00:04:47.830> go<00:04:47.949> for<00:04:48.129> something

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
in part two you can go for something

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.159 
in part two you can go for something
like<00:04:48.430> glass<00:04:48.789> half-full<00:04:49.060> or<00:04:49.419> reactive<00:04:49.900> reload

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
like glass half-full or reactive reload

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.570 
like glass half-full or reactive reload
those<00:04:50.469> two<00:04:50.620> are<00:04:50.710> definitely<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:51.189> optimal

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
those two are definitely the optimal

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.820 
those two are definitely the optimal
perks<00:04:51.819> I<00:04:52.120> roll<00:04:52.719> the<00:04:52.810> reactive<00:04:53.199> reload<00:04:53.530> which

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
perks I roll the reactive reload which

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.990 
perks I roll the reactive reload which
is<00:04:53.979> absolutely<00:04:54.490> insane

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
is absolutely insane

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.179

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:13.839 
PvE version of this gun I recommend

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:15.540 
PvE version of this gun I recommend
going<00:06:13.930> for<00:06:14.199> feeding<00:06:14.500> frenzy<00:06:14.889> algol<00:06:15.339> or

spraying play in the middle here you

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:18.659 
spraying play in the middle here you

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
could go for high-caliber rounds of

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.059 
could go for high-caliber rounds of
speed<00:06:18.879> reload<00:06:19.240> and<00:06:19.449> in<00:06:19.870> the<00:06:19.960> perk<00:06:20.169> 2<00:06:20.349> slot<00:06:20.620> army

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:21.069

if one cloud helpful or secret round

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:25.409 
if one cloud helpful or secret round
basically<00:06:24.069> allowing<00:06:24.370> you<00:06:24.550> to<00:06:24.699> have<00:06:24.849> less

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
basically allowing you to have less

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:27.540 
basically allowing you to have less
downtime<00:06:25.719> or<00:06:26.139> more<00:06:26.560> rounds<00:06:26.889> or<00:06:26.979> more<00:06:27.129> damage

downtime or more rounds or more damage

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.219 
downtime or more rounds or more damage
that's<00:06:28.120> what<00:06:28.300> you<00:06:28.419> want<00:06:28.629> in<00:06:28.750> PvE

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:29.229 
that's what you want in PvE

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:31.140 
that's what you want in PvE
and<00:06:29.349> I<00:06:29.770> recommend<00:06:30.069> going<00:06:30.310> for<00:06:30.550> similar<00:06:30.879> perks

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
and I recommend going for similar perks

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.360 
and I recommend going for similar perks
on<00:06:31.300> all<00:06:31.449> guns<00:06:31.810> basically<00:06:32.349> you<00:06:32.409> know<00:06:32.529> get<00:06:33.190> more

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
on all guns basically you know get more

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.719 
on all guns basically you know get more
rounds<00:06:33.789> get<00:06:34.180> a<00:06:34.210> faster<00:06:34.569> reload<00:06:34.719> speed<00:06:35.139> or

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
rounds get a faster reload speed or

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.100 
rounds get a faster reload speed or
potentially<00:06:36.729> get<00:06:36.969> higher<00:06:37.180> damage<00:06:37.539> which<00:06:37.930> all

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
potentially get higher damage which all

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.140 
potentially get higher damage which all
of<00:06:38.440> these<00:06:38.529> perks<00:06:38.830> will<00:06:39.039> allow<00:06:39.279> you<00:06:39.339> to

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
of these perks will allow you to

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.630 
of these perks will allow you to
some<00:06:40.540> great<00:06:40.810> PvE<00:06:41.170> perks<00:06:41.560> however<00:06:42.280> as<00:06:42.490> I<00:06:42.610> said

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
some great PvE perks however as I said

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.760 
some great PvE perks however as I said
multiple<00:06:43.300> times<00:06:43.360> already<00:06:43.840> I<00:06:44.110> recommend<00:06:44.620> using

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
multiple times already I recommend using

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.220 
multiple times already I recommend using
hand<00:06:45.070> cannons<00:06:45.370> and<00:06:45.490> scout<00:06:45.700> rifles<00:06:46.030> in<00:06:46.150> PvE<00:06:46.450> so

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
hand cannons and scout rifles in PvE so

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.440 
hand cannons and scout rifles in PvE so
to<00:06:47.290> round<00:06:47.620> it<00:06:47.770> off<00:06:47.920> this<00:06:48.220> gun<00:06:48.430> is<00:06:48.610> amazing<00:06:49.360> in

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.900

PvP especially in Rumble and skirmish

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.910 
PvP especially in Rumble and skirmish

want to take this gun into control or

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.460 
want to take this gun into control or
clash<00:06:57.520> it<00:06:58.150> definitely<00:06:58.660> works<00:06:58.900> it's<00:06:59.140> a<00:06:59.260> great

00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.470

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.050 
clash it definitely works it's a great
gun<00:06:59.710> still<00:06:59.950> but<00:07:00.160> it<00:07:00.250> does<00:07:00.400> get<00:07:00.550> clunky<00:07:01.000> in

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.060 
gun still but it does get clunky in

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.760 
gun still but it does get clunky in
close<00:07:01.240> quarters<00:07:01.690> therefore<00:07:02.350> I'd<00:07:02.410> recommend

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:02.770 
close quarters therefore I'd recommend

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.230

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
running a shotgun or a fusion rifle as

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.730 
running a shotgun or a fusion rifle as
your<00:07:04.390> backup<00:07:04.750> weapon<00:07:05.080> so<00:07:05.320> you<00:07:05.410> don't<00:07:05.590> get

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
your backup weapon so you don't get

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.650 
your backup weapon so you don't get
