00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.180
 hello to all a few months ago the 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.040
 peugeot 308 challenge for the first time 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.750
 the golf volkswagen on caradisiac and 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.670
 it was the French who had 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.450
 reported today secondly I 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.380
 the break version 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.180
 is Germany going to take its 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:25.900
 revenge on the French we will see that 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:27.400
 today with cailliot manual so 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.170
 manual one is interested in the novelty of 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.449
 this peugeot 308 sw 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.010
 that's it they come up with version 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.690
 backpack for families that's not it 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.760
 other surprise she takes the face 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.830
 front of the sedan with her 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.659
 overall we will say a look rather 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.159
 nice a nice look more fun 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:43.690
 that the older generation that had a 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:46.449
 back pretty ugly we'll say 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.070
 to be nice is actually 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.260
 classic lines like golf 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.449
 obviously but still a profile 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.400
 very long to stretch 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.360
 I find it rather pretty yes it is 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.309
 clearly more humane it is a 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.250
 generation even more beautiful than the 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.479
 golf that has its public cubic building 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.040
 it is more classic 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.210
 that's fine and it's true that the 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.930
 308 brings a touch 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.770
 originality that was not the rod the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.480
 normal but we are interested now 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.070
 the dimensions of our break 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.630
 and as many say it right away they have 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.940
 grown up they grew up well as you 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.950
 can see it is particularly seen 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.500
 on the profiles the 308 with which I 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.970
 I came so enlarged it by 33 cm 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.590
 since it now measures four 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.180
 meters 50 8 against 4 m 25 for the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.710
 sedan is what you should also note 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.350
 it's that its wheelbase enlarged the eu 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.760
 11 cm also for the benefit of 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.840
 habitability for passengers 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.470
 back which is pretty good because 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.090
 that in the sedan 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.860
 it lacked a little bit of room even 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.070
 finding for golf that measure 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.030
 now 4 m 56 it's 35 10 meters from 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.190
 more than the sedan 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.659
 and as much to say it right now we pass 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.190
 almost to higher categories 1 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.970
 of cinema this gift manual we are interested 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.100
 now to something primordial 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.600
 for brics the load volume 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.190
 and as much to say it right now she is 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.420
 score at the pants he says at 5.8 from 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.820
 difference I'm sitting 110 liters 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.610
 and you at 605 here is something like 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.750
 that and all seats folded when we 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.729
 had the bench we are already a 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.170
 flat floor what comes and one has a thousand 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.549
 six hundred and sixty liters debate I put 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.990
 six years goes liters so that's 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.320
 relatively very very right when I 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.700
 the gotta 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.349
 and we are not far from 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.090
 record of the category that is held on 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.550
 recalls it by the honda civic work at 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.310
 624 liters 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.510
 welcome aboard this golf sw as much the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.310
 to say right away it's the same 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.500
 dashboards that the sedan is 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.930
 well assembled it's serious not super 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.640
 fun the positive side also there are 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.350
 a lot of storage at the level of 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.610
 undercuts under the center console 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.830
 between the two seats 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.760
 so that's fine for a vehicle to 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.260
 family destination 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.570
 we are now interested in the level of 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.920
 the livability back and frankly 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.720
 it's not bad at all it's not in the 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.940
 reference to category but back 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.650
 we are comfortable but golf and was 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.570
 already well- equipped sedan at this level 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.820
 there the 308 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.560
 she enjoys her wheelbase 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.340
 lengthened to give more space to 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.020
 rear passengers 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.840
 but she loses 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.740
 the old generation the possibility 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.520
 to move forward to move back the seats that 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.470
 were independent today 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.880
 now we have a bench and she 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.930
 also loses the opportunity to have the 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.850
 two emergency places in the body 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.740
 in the cockpit of this 308 sw on 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.350
 find this new ea cockpit 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.940
 imagined by peugeot with as in the 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.770
 208 the counters above the small 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.180
 flying with improved readability 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.250
 because they now have a little more 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.510
 up and have they are not hidden by the 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.700
 rim of the steering wheel that's pretty good 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.680
 a very sober atmosphere also everything 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.510
 black a little bit little bit sad 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.489
 also and an ergonomics that is not 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.780
 necessarily as good as in golf 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.580
 because everything is grouped together in this 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.130
 7-inch touch pad that's here 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.350
 including air conditioning and 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.900
 2002 multimedia and it forces to pass 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.790
 by the tablet to activate change the 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.680
 temperature and iv the functions and its 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.600
 bomba that's one more step and that's 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.100
 not necessarily a good thing by 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.810
 relation to golf which she a button a 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.700
 function is easy during the side 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.410
 positive it's still this roof 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.580
 panoramic glass specialty 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.020
 disengage from peugeot 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.140
 that brings a real little in terms of 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.140
 brightness 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:58.409
 then the rod that we have today 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.450
 these are the drawings of the players 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:03.450
 brand new authors designed by volkswagen 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.329
 of course then private engine has clearly 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.859
 says and comfort claims them as 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.439
 to be the most sober of the golf range 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.909
 was not hyper dynamic engine that 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.370
 do well what we have to do is very 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.930
 we will say basic as authorization 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.280
 it's a lot less sound it was 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.780
 before all this is really a plus 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.400
 we still hear it a little bit 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.720
 not let me see what you just 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.940
 the hour that in the 308 it is really 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.099
 very discreet, but overall 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.840
 we will say it's not hyper golf 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.250
 aggressive hyperdynamic why because 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.389
 that there is no adaptive chassis 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.699
 that there may be on this version 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.630
 does not have a job at this risk of being 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.639
 specific rear 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.860
 so it's really a basic golf 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.620
 will say so it's a strong comfort 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.150
 see so that's good behavior but 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.259
 not the most dynamic of the century 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.789
 nor the most friends we can see on 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.169
 the nails and at the level of the 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.570
 olive consumption tournay or with this 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.610
 mill then I'm doing about 200 500 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.650
 6 so it's not bad of course but 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.960
 it's not really optional either 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.690
 so olive this 308 sw she is endowed 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.009
 today duality this blush of 120 which 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.580
 has a brand new engine him also 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.560
 inaugurated in the psa group 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.509
 many couples on this engine 380 m 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.370
 against 250 I believe your mouth you are you 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.350
 do one that was a little bit light 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.139
 I found there instead we only have 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.550
 stay 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.020
 since they are excellent 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.520
 performances that are clearly at 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.449
 above that of golf with 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.150
 horses more is not it 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.770
 necessarily amazing and then I go out 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.719
 do not know how you feel by the 308 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.699
 but I think that peugeot has succeeded 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:26.860
 an excellent compromise between the 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.120
 dynamism of driving more access to 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.539
 little flying I love to drive to 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.520
 308 and the comfort that is to say that the 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.529
 suspensions they take no roll 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.389
 but they absorb the inequalities of 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:38.919
 the road absolutely amazing way 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.529
 the asses are passed we feel them 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.210
 absolutely not almost not and I find 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:44.110
 that it's very very nice so at 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.240
 level of driving 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.639
 for me the 308 is above the 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.110
 mouth or eric lardeur clearly 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.419
 once again easy victory of 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:06:00.729
 the a380 for the left including the side 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:06:03.279
 of eric and olive well you arrived with a 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.360
 desire for revenge with this golf sw I 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.289
 believe it's once again a blow 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.669
 in the water unfortunately but 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.430
 clearly it's really missed why 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.810
 because this 308 sw is more successful 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.439
 aesthetically the golf she is more 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.629
 dynamic 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:14.919
 they make equal play both at the level of 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:17.860
 practical aspects loading volume 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.819
 is included against the 308 sw a 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.740
 weight argument 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.539
 its price since it is cheaper 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.310
 is cheaper on average 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.330
 roughly 2 500 euros compared to the 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:30.029
 golf seen from above 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.029
 easy victory verdict of the 308 sw
