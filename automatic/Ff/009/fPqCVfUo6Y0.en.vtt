00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.650
 Hello everyone, I'm from Miter and this one is more 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.360
 a video about chord formation 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.099
 we saw in the videos so far 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.100
 the formation of major and minor chords 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.410
 but without using the eyelash and will be the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.689
 subject of this video we will learn 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.039
 how to use it in chord training 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.080
 larger 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.330
 I remember we already learned 5 cuts 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.199
 and all of them without the use of 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.109
 eyelash 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.820
 because today we are going to learn both 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.309
 that are missing to complete that 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.370
 seven best known modes creator 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.620
 re mi sunshine there and if these are all stayed 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.290
 only one sofa is missing and the ones are 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.120
 in them we will use the eyelash 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.030
 first of all then what is an eyelash 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.760
 The eyelash is a technique that uses the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.370
 index finger of your left hand to 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.430
 press all the strings of the guitar 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.039
 while you play all the strings in a 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.480
 same house and then we 'll see what 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.820
 the way we are going to look at the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.040
 camera more closely 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.110
 Looking closely here, we will do 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.380
 the formation of the eyelash 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.810
 in the third house just to exemplify and 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.000
 show what this eyelash is that people 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.600
 so much so that the eyelash will tighten 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.490
 all the strings in the same house as me 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.799
 Can I do this? I'll use my finger. 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.990
 so instead of squeezing it just 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.080
 with the tip I'll tighten finger 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.439
 I will position myself on top of the rope 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.930
 and then I make that pressure so that 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.880
 all the strings are tight and then I 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.230
 if I play with my other hand as a 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.530
 Right I'll hear sounds like O 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:47.080
 beauty after positioning our finger 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.240
 so here in our third house 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.580
 I'm walking eyelash formed and people 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.220
 You can do that test by playing rope. 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.570
 wake up to see if all the sounds are 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.990
 coming out sharp 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.990
 come on 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.969
 staff at the beginning is a bit difficult 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.860
 same 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.470
 you will find difficulty until 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.269
 accustom the way and the power to tighten 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.830
 You always have a rope that goes 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.200
 get out a little more choked up 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.180
 but this is normal if you want to 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.239
 many people start with two 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.760
 fingers where the middle finger makes a force 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:29.019
 over the index finger to 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.910
 help tighten all the ropes but 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.890
 remembering that this is not necessary such 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.780
 you can and should achieve with a 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.430
 finger only the indicator 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.920
 and then your middle finger will be free 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.849
 to tighten other houses in the formations 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.150
 of chords 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.120
 now let's form the chords the first 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.130
 of this video is the largest far that appears 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.519
 in the figures indicated by the letter f 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.420
 new here in our camera 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.780
 closer 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.870
 We look there in the corner. 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.180
 drawing of the far greater in the personal cipher in the 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.540
 The eyelash will always appear 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:08.230
 indicated as an integer trace 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.290
 whole stroke it comes and is symbolized 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.810
 here or in the first house then you have 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.269
 in the first house the dash you go 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.160
 use your index finger for this 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.870
 You make an eyelash on the first 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.720
 home and will use the other fingers 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.600
 so you come with 2 to 1 according to 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:31.060
 with drawing he is in the third race 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:35.500
 in house two is the finger 3 is there in 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:39.489
 up on the fifth rope in house three and the 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:43.510
 his little finger of 4 he appears on the 4th 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:46.269
 running in house three also he is like 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.030
 if it were the Sunday position bigger 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.230
 only with an eyelash here and a whole 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.169
 house to front 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.169
 Ok, then it would look like this. 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.490
 now giving note by rope note for 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.590
 rope 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.590
 Let's see, he looks like this. 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.050
 the last chord of today's video is yes 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.780
 bigger 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.739
 with that we will complete from the 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.230
 there are sunshine there and those are all 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.050
 seven best-known chords do not wake up 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.690
 only seven best-known notes and there 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.150
 missing only the sharp and b boys 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.310
 that we will see in another video yes 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.610
 appears in the figures indicated by the 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.300
 letter b on the camera here more than 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.880
 close will form the largest but most were 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.830
 It is here in the second house that has our 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.290
 eyelashes are looking at the drawing there 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:51.240
 We have a lane in the second house. 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:53.610
 we form the eyelash here we inform in the 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:58.280
 other fingers the chord said รณ the second 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:04.380
 finger the middle finger he comes here on the fourth 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:06.510
 house on the fourth rope the finger 3 your gave 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.930
 the third ring finger 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.810
 it will come on the third rope also in the 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.690
 fourth house and also in the fourth house 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.090
 People are going to have their little fingers. 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.400
 Only on the second string, okay? 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.890
 it is as if it were the same formation of the 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:27.060
 just with an eyelash 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:29.070
 There and there I play from the fifth string 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.030
 I just will not play the 6th cup I will not play. 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.360
 a vision is 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.380
 I'll play only from the fifth string 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.380
 the sound is this here 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.100
 Here, therefore, a note by note to the 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.240
 cut by rope, we'll see how the 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.240
 Yes, higher cord 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:54.689
 the people with the class today 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.689
 complete all major chords without 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:59.939
 tell your customers and b boys but the 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:02.099
 People already start using eyelashes 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:04.169
 if you practice well the eyelash that is a 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:05.639
 bit difficult at first but you go 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.919
 this will allow you to touch 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.620
 any cord that appears to you 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.569
 indicated in the cipher even before the videos 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.939
 you will look there the drawing of the sinfra already 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:17.789
 will be able to play and then this can 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:19.349
 increase your repertoire is good. 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.270
 people recognize then this step is 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:22.949
 important that we are giving 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.430
 that you can play any song 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:28.800
 that is of your desire beauty in the next 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.960
 video we see the minor chords with 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.089
 the use of eyelashes and then thereafter 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.539
 that yes you will see how to form 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:38.610
 any flat or sharp cut with the 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:41.029
 use of eyelash beauty 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.029
 speak up
