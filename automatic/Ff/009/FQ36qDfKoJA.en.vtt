start<00:03:28.000> taking<00:03:28.810> your<00:03:28.959> TVP<00:03:29.440> chunks<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.280> just

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
start taking your TVP chunks and just

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.460 
start taking your TVP chunks and just
you're<00:03:31.150> just<00:03:31.329> going<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.540> roll<00:03:31.750> them<00:03:31.989> around<00:03:32.079> in

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
you're just going to roll them around in

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.580 
you're just going to roll them around in
here<00:03:32.709> like<00:03:32.980> this<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:34.630> they<00:03:34.780> get<00:03:34.930> really<00:03:35.170> nice

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
here like this so they get really nice

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.370 
here like this so they get really nice
and<00:03:35.650> coated<00:03:36.570> I'm<00:03:37.570> going<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.840> do<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:37.959> second

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
and coated I'm going to do a second

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.380 
and coated I'm going to do a second
layer<00:03:38.500> in<00:03:38.829> a<00:03:38.920> minute<00:03:39.190> but<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:39.820> don't<00:03:40.030> have<00:03:40.180> to

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
layer in a minute but you don't have to

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.440 
layer in a minute but you don't have to
so<00:03:41.079> once<00:03:41.260> they're<00:03:41.470> coated<00:03:42.060> they<00:03:43.060> look<00:03:43.269> like

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
so once they're coated they look like

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.630 
so once they're coated they look like
that<00:03:43.660> I'm<00:03:44.590> just<00:03:44.650> going<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:44.920> keep<00:03:45.100> going<00:03:45.250> until

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
that I'm just going to keep going until

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.130 
that I'm just going to keep going until
I've<00:03:45.880> done<00:03:46.030> them<00:03:46.180> all<00:03:46.239> but<00:03:46.780> you<00:03:46.870> don't<00:03:47.049> need

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.060 
them in here and then shake them around
this<00:03:58.329> is<00:03:58.480> just<00:03:58.510> going<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.989> make<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.440> outer

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
this is just going to make the outer

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
this is just going to make the outer
coating<00:04:00.549> crispier<00:04:01.350> like<00:04:02.350> that<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.880> it's<00:04:03.880> done

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
coating crispier like that and it's done

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.970 
coating crispier like that and it's done
and<00:04:04.269> then<00:04:05.079> they<00:04:05.230> can<00:04:05.380> get<00:04:05.500> straight<00:04:05.769> in<00:04:05.890> the

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
and then they can get straight in the

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.560 
and then they can get straight in the
pan<00:04:06.160> with<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.370> oil<00:04:06.459> but<00:04:06.940> don't<00:04:07.150> put<00:04:07.329> the<00:04:07.420> heat

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
pan with the oil but don't put the heat

pan with the oil but don't put the heat
on<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.810> oil<00:04:07.930> yet<00:04:08.200> because<00:04:08.380> you<00:04:08.440> want<00:04:08.560> them<00:04:08.680> to

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
on the oil yet because you want them to

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.130 
on the oil yet because you want them to
all<00:04:08.859> cook<00:04:09.040> at<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.250> same<00:04:09.400> now<00:04:10.239> they're<00:04:10.780> in<00:04:11.019> the

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
all cook at the same now they're in the

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.440 
all cook at the same now they're in the
wok<00:04:11.350> they're<00:04:12.280> on<00:04:12.370> a<00:04:12.400> really<00:04:12.700> high<00:04:12.880> heat<00:04:13.180> and

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
wok they're on a really high heat and

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.150 
wok they're on a really high heat and
there's<00:04:13.750> lots<00:04:14.049> of<00:04:14.200> oil<00:04:14.320> in<00:04:14.590> there<00:04:14.739> as<00:04:14.980> you<00:04:15.129> can

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
there's lots of oil in there as you can

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.440 
there's lots of oil in there as you can
see

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
see

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.450 
see
and<00:04:16.570> like<00:04:17.110> I<00:04:17.140> said<00:04:17.410> not<00:04:17.770> particularly<00:04:18.040> healthy

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.460 
and like I said not particularly healthy

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.590 
and like I said not particularly healthy
but<00:04:18.640> that<00:04:18.730> is<00:04:18.880> what's<00:04:19.120> going<00:04:19.210> to<00:04:19.270> make<00:04:19.420> them<00:04:19.540> go

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
but that is what's going to make them go

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.040 
but that is what's going to make them go
really<00:04:19.870> crispy<00:04:20.260> and<00:04:20.500> like<00:04:20.980> the<00:04:21.190> ones<00:04:21.370> from<00:04:21.550> KFC

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 
really crispy and like the ones from KFC

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.840 
really crispy and like the ones from KFC
okay<00:04:23.050> so<00:04:23.110> they're<00:04:23.530> not<00:04:23.830> done<00:04:24.160> yet<00:04:24.400> but<00:04:24.700> they're

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
okay so they're not done yet but they're

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.340 
okay so they're not done yet but they're
about<00:04:25.030> halfway<00:04:25.360> there<00:04:25.570> you<00:04:25.870> can<00:04:26.020> see<00:04:26.200> they're

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
about halfway there you can see they're

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.560 
about halfway there you can see they're
starting<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:26.680> brown<00:04:26.950> on<00:04:27.160> the<00:04:27.250> edges<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.940> you

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
starting to brown on the edges and you

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.820 
starting to brown on the edges and you
basically<00:04:28.810> just<00:04:29.230> need<00:04:29.440> to<00:04:29.560> make<00:04:29.800> sure

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
basically just need to make sure

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.620 
basically just need to make sure
obviously<00:04:30.340> it's<00:04:30.670> not<00:04:30.790> meat<00:04:31.000> so<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.330> doesn't

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
obviously it's not meat so it doesn't

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.660 
obviously it's not meat so it doesn't
really<00:04:31.960> matter<00:04:32.290> if<00:04:32.410> you<00:04:32.650> undercook<00:04:32.920> it<00:04:33.220> but

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
really matter if you undercook it but

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.400 
really matter if you undercook it but
what<00:04:33.820> you<00:04:33.940> do<00:04:34.120> want<00:04:34.330> to<00:04:34.360> make<00:04:34.480> sure<00:04:34.660> you<00:04:34.900> do<00:04:35.110> is

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
what you do want to make sure you do is

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.190 
what you do want to make sure you do is
cook<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:36.010> flour<00:04:36.220> otherwise<00:04:36.730> it<00:04:36.910> we<00:04:37.000> rank<00:04:37.330> okay

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
cook the flour otherwise it we rank okay

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.770 
cook the flour otherwise it we rank okay
so<00:04:38.740> they're<00:04:38.890> done<00:04:39.480> they<00:04:40.480> look<00:04:40.510> like<00:04:40.780> this<00:04:40.960> mmm

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
so they're done they look like this mmm

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.720 
so they're done they look like this mmm
what<00:04:43.780> you<00:04:43.840> can<00:04:43.960> do<00:04:44.110> now<00:04:44.290> is<00:04:44.560> use<00:04:45.070> a<00:04:45.100> swot<00:04:45.550> a

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
what you can do now is use a swot a

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.940 
what you can do now is use a swot a
slotted<00:04:46.090> spoon<00:04:46.420> to<00:04:47.020> put<00:04:47.350> them<00:04:47.440> into<00:04:47.590> another

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
slotted spoon to put them into another

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.140 
slotted spoon to put them into another
bowl<00:04:48.280> which<00:04:48.430> needs<00:04:48.640> to<00:04:48.700> be<00:04:48.760> lined<00:04:49.000> with

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
bowl which needs to be lined with

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.050 
bowl which needs to be lined with
something<00:04:49.600> like<00:04:50.410> kitchen<00:04:50.800> towel<00:04:51.010> or<00:04:51.280> loo<00:04:51.850> roll

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
something like kitchen towel or loo roll

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.610 
something like kitchen towel or loo roll
in<00:04:52.270> my<00:04:52.420> case<00:04:52.660> because<00:04:52.900> I<00:04:53.080> thought<00:04:53.230> I<00:04:53.350> might<00:04:53.500> as

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
in my case because I thought I might as
