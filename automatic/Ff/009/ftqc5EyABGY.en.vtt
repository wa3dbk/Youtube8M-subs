00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.500 

how<00:05:17.900> about<00:05:18.110> we<00:05:18.139> show<00:05:18.440> a<00:05:18.470> bit<00:05:18.710> of<00:05:18.740> a<00:05:18.919> stunter

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:33.460 

fire<00:05:23.510> going<00:05:23.990> there<00:05:31.570> I'm<00:05:32.570> feeling<00:05:32.960> the<00:05:33.260> power

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
fire going there I'm feeling the power

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.340 
fire going there I'm feeling the power
being<00:05:33.889> a<00:05:34.070> bit<00:05:34.250> less<00:05:34.460> than<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.699> battery<00:05:35.060> now<00:05:35.350> so

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
being a bit less than the battery now so

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.810 
being a bit less than the battery now so
