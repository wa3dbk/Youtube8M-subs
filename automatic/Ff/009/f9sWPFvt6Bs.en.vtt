00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.980
 found for the presentation of a 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.049
 new mode 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.719
 so it's up to me who has allowed you 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.280
 to have five new doors and finds 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.800
 on minecraft pc so that's the doors 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.590
 of a mac a pc so it's the stolen 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.020
 of wooden of all kinds of wood that 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.410
 are on pc so let's go for the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.410
 presentation 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:38.970
 she pushes for kraft 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.470
 try it will take for that 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.879
 I'm staying here and that's a six voices 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.370
 laugh not the wood just after in the game 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.860
 and take the a5 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.739
 finally six blocks of wood like those kraft 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.720
 and a door normally will require 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.860
 birch wood fir boards 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.559
 mahogany and acacia woods and 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.250
 black oak like this so finally the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.640
 first door 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.110
 you go to the water you go 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.270
 in the kraft justice table there is 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.539
 will enjoy for example lakafia gold 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.720
 like this is so we see the right m 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:22.200
 in front of that yes it's the same you 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.820
 can open like this so it is 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.610
 really a subject for peace season 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.600
 it's really well done as a fashion 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.429
 less than the beautiful things link of 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.670
 download this bad in the 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:38.700
 description you also have it doe 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.860
 woods which is like those who is the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.000
 carries with lastly yes fir 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.420
 this is the bread box that's the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.520
 wood I know that the consulate in French 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.450
 but we removed south clb where there too 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.009
 others two doors like this one which 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.800
 of course we tell you that with the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.910
 jungle wood or at your cage or in 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.450
 French here in which there is not 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.899
 same account animation as a real 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.970
 door 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:15.180
 it's a shame you have here 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:18.060
 thin more gold copy there is just 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.950
 in front of that there who directly at this 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.660
 novel rank through we really know what 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.370
 which makes them well done this mode one can 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:32.450
 always closed the doors here 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:35.879
 and we at the dark rock we dare though 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.430
 of gold forgiveness and so that is who is 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.319
 autistic and chocolates as if that's 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.840
 how like on pc so it's really 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.569
 a fashion and who did well anyway 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.920
 so I find so that's who you 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:52.409
 shows a small difference compared 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:57.360
 to the real real door in minecraft the 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:58.739
 classic port that we are here so 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.609
 it is she leaves it is that we have 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.950
 So here we go we have the movement 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.739
 when the break while for example 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.660
 its doors there we do not have the movement 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.609
 and when we open we see the hand 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.340
 see the hand a smile we did 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:17.129
 it's the same while there you just have to 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.690
 press the screen to open it 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.730
 so that would be a bit of a pity 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.980
 you can of course it's version 1 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.379
 libaude he build a version 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.970
 more improved in any case I have very 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.400
 quick video you will have liked it is not at 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.989
 measure for these two little videos and 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.239
 of this mode in the comments this is 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.239
 an ipod giver 172 l waking everyone
