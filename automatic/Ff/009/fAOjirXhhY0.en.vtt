00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.800 

all<00:00:00.630> right<00:00:01.079> so<00:00:01.620> with<00:00:02.100> this<00:00:02.250> model<00:00:02.730> all<00:00:03.540> we

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
all right so with this model all we

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.630 
all right so with this model all we
really<00:00:04.049> have<00:00:04.290> are<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.710> two<00:00:04.890> paired<00:00:05.160> kidneys

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
really have are the two paired kidneys

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.419 
really have are the two paired kidneys
otherwise<00:00:06.540> this<00:00:06.870> models<00:00:07.259> not<00:00:07.440> very<00:00:07.740> useful<00:00:08.309> as

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
otherwise this models not very useful as

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.370 
otherwise this models not very useful as
far<00:00:08.610> as<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.820> urinary<00:00:09.210> system<00:00:09.330> is<00:00:09.780> concerned

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
far as the urinary system is concerned

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.570 
far as the urinary system is concerned
okay<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.010> just<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.519> two<00:00:11.670> pair<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:11.910> kidneys

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
okay so just the two pair of kidneys

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.480 
okay so just the two pair of kidneys
with<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:14.759> one<00:00:15.350> it's<00:00:16.350> got<00:00:16.619> some<00:00:16.859> good<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.279> some

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
with this one it's got some good in some

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.599 
with this one it's got some good in some
bad<00:00:17.730> parts<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.289> sense<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.650> this

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
bad parts to it in the sense that this

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.300 
bad parts to it in the sense that this
is<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.880> kidney<00:00:21.090> obviously<00:00:21.900> then<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:22.920> have<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
is the kidney obviously then we have the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.939 
is the kidney obviously then we have the
cortex<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.269> cortex<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.900> outer<00:00:25.140> area<00:00:25.650> I

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
cortex the cortex that outer area I

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.970 
cortex the cortex that outer area I
could<00:00:26.939> use<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.660> for<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:28.170> renal<00:00:28.470> pyramids

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
could use it for the renal pyramids

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.410 
could use it for the renal pyramids
which<00:00:29.550> are<00:00:29.730> here<00:00:30.029> here<00:00:30.240> here<00:00:30.689> here<00:00:30.720> here<00:00:31.590> I

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
which are here here here here here I

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.650 
which are here here here here here I
could<00:00:33.420> use<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.050> minor<00:00:34.380> calyx<00:00:35.660> which

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
could use it for the minor calyx which

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.270 
could use it for the minor calyx which
are<00:00:36.809> these<00:00:36.930> phases<00:00:37.410> here<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.800> drain<00:00:38.040> each

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
are these phases here that drain each

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.810 
are these phases here that drain each
renal<00:00:38.730> pyramid<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:43.070> think<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.430> would<00:00:44.640> use

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
renal pyramid I think that I would use

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.650 
renal pyramid I think that I would use
this<00:00:45.030> maybe<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.230> renal<00:00:46.500> pelvis<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.660> then

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
this maybe for the renal pelvis and then

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.380 
this maybe for the renal pelvis and then
this<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> ureter<00:00:51.980> renal<00:00:52.980> artery<00:00:53.399> renal

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
this for the ureter renal artery renal

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.040 
this for the ureter renal artery renal
Bank<00:00:56.120> to<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.210> honest<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.690> that's<00:00:57.840> about

Bank to be honest with you that's about

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.750 
Bank to be honest with you that's about
all<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.230> like<00:00:58.530> about<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.949> mall<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.460> just<00:00:59.640> an

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
all I like about this mall it's just an

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.969 
all I like about this mall it's just an
older<00:01:00.030> models<00:01:00.510> seen<00:01:01.020> somewhere<00:01:02.030> um<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.870> do<00:01:04.680> like

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
older models seen somewhere um I do like

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.480 
older models seen somewhere um I do like
this<00:01:05.129> mall

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.440 

again<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.450> paired<00:01:08.689> kidneys<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:11.060> we<00:01:11.659> have<00:01:12.310> the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
again the paired kidneys and we have the

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.300 
again the paired kidneys and we have the
descending<00:01:14.450> abdominal<00:01:14.899> aorta<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:15.920> then

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
descending abdominal aorta and then

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.069 
descending abdominal aorta and then
blood<00:01:16.700> is<00:01:16.880> going<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.090> go<00:01:17.240> into<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.750> kidney

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
blood is going to go into the kidney

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.770 
blood is going to go into the kidney
through<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:18.439> renal<00:01:18.829> artery<00:01:19.600> it's<00:01:20.600> going<00:01:20.720> to

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
through the renal artery it's going to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.999 
through the renal artery it's going to
go<00:01:20.869> through<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.140> kidney<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:21.500> come<00:01:21.680> back<00:01:21.799> out

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
go through the kidney and come back out

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.679 
go through the kidney and come back out
the<00:01:22.340> renal<00:01:23.149> vein

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
the renal vein

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.109 
the renal vein
here<00:01:23.869> in<00:01:23.929> the<00:01:24.020> blue<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.530> end<00:01:25.039> up<00:01:25.250> with<00:01:26.000> the

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
here in the blue and end up with the

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.279 
here in the blue and end up with the
inferior<00:01:26.630> vena<00:01:26.810> cava<00:01:27.700> this<00:01:28.700> is<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.509> start<00:01:29.929> of

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
inferior vena cava this is the start of

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.310 
inferior vena cava this is the start of
your<00:01:30.470> reader<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.490> it's<00:01:31.729> going<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:31.880> come<00:01:32.119> down

I'm<00:01:33.320> going<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.560> attach<00:01:33.829> at<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.130> back<00:01:34.399> of<00:01:34.640> the

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
I'm going to attach at the back of the

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.389 
I'm going to attach at the back of the
bladder<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.750> males<00:01:36.470> so<00:01:37.039> this<00:01:37.220> whole

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
bladder and males so this whole

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:38.919 
bladder and males so this whole
structure<00:01:37.729> right<00:01:37.970> here<00:01:38.179> in<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.329> yellow<00:01:38.479> white

structure right here in the yellow white

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.249 
structure right here in the yellow white
yellow<00:01:39.110> is<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.979> bladder<00:01:40.690> if<00:01:41.690> I<00:01:41.810> open<00:01:42.110> that<00:01:42.140> up

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
yellow is the bladder if I open that up

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.039 
yellow is the bladder if I open that up
in<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:43.549> orange<00:01:44.030> right<00:01:44.330> here<00:01:44.659> going<00:01:44.899> through

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
in the orange right here going through

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.660 
in the orange right here going through
the<00:01:45.229> prostate<00:01:45.500> that's<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.130> start<00:01:46.429> of<00:01:46.580> the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
the prostate that's the start of the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.169 
the prostate that's the start of the
urethra<00:01:49.119> that's<00:01:50.119> pretty<00:01:50.420> small<00:01:51.729> now<00:01:52.729> we're

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
urethra that's pretty small now we're

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.520 
urethra that's pretty small now we're
gonna<00:01:53.270> spend<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.539> little<00:01:53.659> time<00:01:53.899> here<00:01:53.959> because

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
gonna spend a little time here because

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.190 
gonna spend a little time here because
this<00:01:54.649> is<00:01:54.740> gonna<00:01:54.830> be<00:01:55.009> complicated<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:55.990> if<00:01:56.990> I

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
this is gonna be complicated and if I

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.899 
this is gonna be complicated and if I
had<00:01:57.500> I'm<00:01:57.890> gonna<00:01:58.130> use<00:01:58.310> a<00:01:58.340> couple<00:01:58.610> of<00:01:58.700> color

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
had I'm gonna use a couple of color

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.570 
had I'm gonna use a couple of color
pencils

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.440 

we're<00:02:03.580> going<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.790> walk<00:02:03.910> through<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.240> blood

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
we're going to walk through the blood

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.820 
we're going to walk through the blood
flow<00:02:06.060> number<00:02:07.060> 14<00:02:07.480> we're<00:02:07.660> starting<00:02:08.020> number<00:02:08.200> 14

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
flow number 14 we're starting number 14

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.600 
flow number 14 we're starting number 14
that's<00:02:09.430> the<00:02:09.640> renal<00:02:09.940> artery<00:02:10.680> and<00:02:11.680> as<00:02:11.860> soon<00:02:12.160> as

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
that's the renal artery and as soon as

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.230 
that's the renal artery and as soon as
an<00:02:12.850> artery<00:02:13.300> or<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.480> vein<00:02:13.570> for<00:02:14.080> its<00:02:14.440> name<00:02:14.650> changes

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
an artery or a vein for its name changes

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.900 
an artery or a vein for its name changes
so<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.360> next<00:02:16.810> vessel<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.980> segmental

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
so the next vessel is the segmental

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
so the next vessel is the segmental
artery<00:02:19.420> between<00:02:19.900> here<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.200> here<00:02:21.930> you'll

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
artery between here and here you'll

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.750 
artery between here and here you'll
notice<00:02:23.140> I've<00:02:23.320> got<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.470> line<00:02:23.740> there<00:02:24.040> underneath

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
notice I've got a line there underneath

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.510 
notice I've got a line there underneath
this<00:02:25.450> minor<00:02:25.780> calyx<00:02:26.290> from<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:26.770> point<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.370> this

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
this minor calyx from this point to this

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.120 
this minor calyx from this point to this
point<00:02:27.810> right<00:02:28.810> here<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.560> lobar<00:02:30.010> artery

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
point right here is the lobar artery

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.670 
point right here is the lobar artery
then<00:02:33.130> we<00:02:33.310> have<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.640> inter<00:02:34.390> lobar<00:02:35.170> artery

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
then we have the inter lobar artery

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.770 
then we have the inter lobar artery
until<00:02:36.220> we<00:02:36.340> get<00:02:36.520> up<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.880> about<00:02:37.120> where<00:02:37.360> we<00:02:37.480> start

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
until we get up to about where we start

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.640 
until we get up to about where we start
to<00:02:37.900> curve<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.850> I<00:02:40.000> like<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.600> I'll<00:02:41.200> show<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.620> to

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
to curve and I like to I'll show it to

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.930 
to curve and I like to I'll show it to
you<00:02:41.770> on<00:02:41.860> this<00:02:42.040> model<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.400> then<00:02:42.550> I'll<00:02:42.640> show<00:02:42.820> it

this start point right here to this one
in<00:03:43.420> between<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.859> renal<00:03:45.189> pyramids<00:03:45.640> this<00:03:45.760> is

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
in between the renal pyramids this is

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.649 
in between the renal pyramids this is
called<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.209> inter<00:03:46.750> low<00:03:47.439> bar<00:03:47.680> artery<00:03:48.400> okay<00:03:49.299> I

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
called the inter low bar artery okay I

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.699 
called the inter low bar artery okay I
come<00:03:50.560> around<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:51.700> top<00:03:51.970> this<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.780> rq8<00:03:53.409> it

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
I do that this little vessel right here

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:16.620 
I do that this little vessel right here
is<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.769> F<00:04:12.400> parent<00:04:13.060> with<00:04:13.180> an<00:04:13.299> A<00:04:13.620> arterial<00:04:15.630> the

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
veins and the arteries is that there are

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.290 
veins and the arteries is that there are
less<00:04:53.409> of<00:04:53.650> them<00:04:53.919> so<00:04:54.159> this<00:04:54.280> inter<00:04:54.639> low<00:04:54.820> bar<00:04:55.030> vein

glomerulus and then the blood and all
the<00:05:25.310> formed<00:05:25.580> elements<00:05:25.729> will<00:05:26.060> come<00:05:26.090> back<00:05:26.389> out

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660

the efferent arteriole but some of the
fluid<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:30.110> filtrate<00:05:30.710> is<00:05:30.889> what<00:05:31.160> it's<00:05:31.280> called

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
fluid the filtrate is what it's called

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.370 
fluid the filtrate is what it's called
when<00:05:31.699> it<00:05:31.789> comes<00:05:31.970> out<00:05:32.180> will<00:05:32.810> actually<00:05:32.960> move

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
when it comes out will actually move

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.890 
when it comes out will actually move
into<00:05:33.800> this<00:05:34.099> structure<00:05:34.550> down<00:05:34.699> here<00:05:35.000> number<00:05:35.180> 35

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
into this structure down here number 35

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.760 
into this structure down here number 35
which<00:05:36.319> is<00:05:36.349> the<00:05:36.590> proximal<00:05:37.310> convoluted<00:05:37.449> tubules

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
which is the proximal convoluted tubules

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.249 
which is the proximal convoluted tubules
this<00:05:39.770> cup<00:05:40.190> that<00:05:40.880> surrounds<00:05:41.509> the<00:05:41.630> glomerulus

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:42.259 
this cup that surrounds the glomerulus

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.600 
this cup that surrounds the glomerulus

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
is called the Bowman's capsule I think

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.050 
is called the Bowman's capsule I think
it<00:05:46.699> doesn't

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
it doesn't

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.290 
it doesn't
okay<00:05:48.460> as<00:05:49.460> far<00:05:49.699> as<00:05:49.849> the<00:05:49.970> reproductive

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
okay as far as the reproductive

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.600 
okay as far as the reproductive
structures<00:05:51.139> are<00:05:51.289> concerned<00:05:51.560> really<00:05:52.069> I<00:05:52.250> have

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
structures are concerned really I have

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.640 
structures are concerned really I have
them<00:05:52.789> out<00:05:52.940> just<00:05:53.270> solely<00:05:53.509> so<00:05:53.870> you<00:05:53.930> can<00:05:54.199> see<00:05:54.470> the

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
them out just solely so you can see the

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.920 
them out just solely so you can see the
bladder<00:05:54.889> placement<00:05:55.490> and<00:05:55.669> males<00:05:55.970> again<00:05:56.810> the

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
bladder placement and males again the

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.540 
bladder placement and males again the
bladder<00:05:57.139> is<00:05:57.319> traditionally<00:05:57.770> larger<00:05:58.159> in<00:05:58.280> males

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
bladder is traditionally larger in males

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.939 
bladder is traditionally larger in males
and<00:05:58.849> males<00:05:59.449> have<00:05:59.870> a<00:05:59.960> longer<00:06:00.440> rethread<00:06:00.800> it's

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
and males have a longer rethread it's

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:01.899 
and males have a longer rethread it's
going<00:06:01.069> to<00:06:01.130> pass<00:06:01.280> all<00:06:01.520> the<00:06:01.580> way<00:06:01.610> through<00:06:01.819> the

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:01.909 
going to pass all the way through the

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:06.270 
going to pass all the way through the
penis<00:06:02.090> right<00:06:02.810> in<00:06:03.220> females<00:06:04.810> bladder<00:06:05.810> is

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
penis right in females bladder is

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.970 
penis right in females bladder is
essentially<00:06:07.280> below<00:06:08.560> the

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.850 

uterus<00:06:13.910> thank<00:06:14.180> you<00:06:14.270> very<00:06:14.420> much<00:06:14.690> I<00:06:14.990> had<00:06:15.830> a

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
uterus thank you very much I had a

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:16.810 
uterus thank you very much I had a
moment<00:06:16.190> where<00:06:16.280> I<00:06:16.340> couldn't<00:06:16.520> think<00:06:16.670> of<00:06:16.760> the

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
moment where I couldn't think of the

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.960 
moment where I couldn't think of the
word<00:06:17.140> below<00:06:18.140> the<00:06:18.320> uterus<00:06:18.710> and<00:06:18.890> again<00:06:19.730> the

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
word below the uterus and again the

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.660 
word below the uterus and again the
urethra<00:06:20.510> and<00:06:21.140> below<00:06:21.590> that<00:06:21.620> where<00:06:22.430> you<00:06:22.520> see

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
urethra and below that where you see

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.550 
urethra and below that where you see
number<00:06:22.910> seven<00:06:23.300> and<00:06:23.480> in<00:06:23.870> females<00:06:24.080> it<00:06:24.440> is

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
number seven and in females it is

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.250 
number seven and in females it is
shorter<00:06:24.950> than<00:06:25.220> in<00:06:25.400> males<00:06:25.640> and<00:06:26.060> in<00:06:26.570> males<00:06:26.810> it's

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
shorter than in males and in males it's

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.890 
shorter than in males and in males it's
also<00:06:27.470> involved<00:06:27.830> in<00:06:28.040> the<00:06:28.130> reproductive<00:06:28.900> system

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
also involved in the reproductive system

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.470 
also involved in the reproductive system
where<00:06:30.830> it's<00:06:31.130> completely<00:06:31.370> separate<00:06:32.150> from<00:06:32.300> the

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.480 
where it's completely separate from the

where it's completely separate from the
reproductive<00:06:32.840> system<00:06:33.050> in<00:06:33.320> females

reproductive system in females

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.220 
reproductive system in females
okay<00:06:34.130> that's<00:06:35.120> it<00:06:35.270> that's<00:06:35.420> it<00:06:35.660> thank<00:06:35.960> you<00:06:36.020> you
