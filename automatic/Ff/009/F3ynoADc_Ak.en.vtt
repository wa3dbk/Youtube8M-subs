 it was Carlos Navarro 

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:05.450
 the secretary of the commission of justice the reputed cam located Pablo 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.979
 federal for sound and accompanies us this morning 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.309
 pure sonorense today to hill tololo mosconi forlán we are invading the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.309
 investors good light nogales sound good very favorable 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:16.710
 on the one hand 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.150
 but very calm lush the kisseron referees palenzuela by cotoperí 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.900
 support it by the laws trains 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.439
 the one of the judicial reform 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.869
 there is a lot of confusion 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.759
 there are many points in this reform we deserve more important than we should 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:31.699
 know 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.700
 the inhabitants of this country 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.250
 then deep transcendental reforms 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.140
 of great draft 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.250
 to me what I like the most but very stimulating to depressurize 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.100
 prisons 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.490
 70% of the people who are in jail even for minor crimes efecom 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.210
 ridiculous but perhaps the most terrifying 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.590
 while only 1% of crimes in Mexico are punished 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.940
 1% of the medical data of castilla we are seeing that one of the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.190
 involved are one step away from the two of us alone or in Mexico 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.950
 two years ago they managed 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.710
 with enough weapons and I do not know how many things 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.610
 he was free other than his brother is a judge who says he has not seen his 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.770
 time to do an honest management and grab me was zelaya's arrest 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.590
 it arrived I do not know how many are like this is 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.350
 2 of what it is about 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.420
 but his wishes to be the Mexican judicial system 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.140
 its modern system 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.140
 practical that does not punish poverty 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.200
 good that even court with anyone who has to compete added to the crime 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.540
 punishes the crime because it promises that the penal system follows the poverty 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.010
 Mexican is a reality when people are in jail 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.900
 the order defines expressing its behavior but our indifference and does not have 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.390
 catch an ovule proposal carlos defense lawyer by trade 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.310
 overloaded by chamba bad unemployed 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.600
 for now do not administer the public that the help or had friends as it is 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.490
 that will help 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.579
 these things happen 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.659
 the truth is that the bad luck of mexico and poverty are punished 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.140
 that is, for a misdemeanor I will not be sent to jail anymore 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.740
 necessarily because we are also privileging the victims 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.850
 spoke hector larios right now in his telephone interview that there will be 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.680
 alternative dispute resolution mechanisms 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.969
 in the countries where these skeptical 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.259
 90% of matters 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:14.369
 they are resolved before the sentence is 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:17.779
 is closed for the social relationship lost between the victim and the 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:21.769
 delinquent if an ultrasound this state estate this is how 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.629
 state bets have to subsidize what can not be agreed to the 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.699
 victim the offender when the victim the least you want that 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:29.939
 it made the boat difficult 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.200
 What I want is for you to repair the damages that the Venezuelan 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.339
 asia is to be on track to three this reform 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:38.909
 among other things is never an example 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.529
 for example at the end that has stolen 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:45.459
 a crime currently possible to achieve in almost all Mexico that I left that is stolen 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.079
 a chicken cutting a meter balance a hit a cord as it is a theft 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:50.789
 violence 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:53.640
 because he knows that violence was exerted on things 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.170
 if it is what they condemn because of not guilty put up for sale of the vote we do not have 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.419
 saved and it's a tragic reality in mexico 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:05.179
 now you will not be able to do that anymore and it will not be considered a serious crime 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:06.220
 if they are going to be able 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.530
 to be able to agree 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.629
 the victim and the 10 and the criminal 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:15.040
 to avoid the grief first to the state of Oscar and five children like that and in 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.619
 general throughout the house is very expensive and second 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:21.609
 it makes it more possible that the victim is desirable to sustain his year in the 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.569
 vassal dog of the queen who returned three hens and to take the help of 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.790
 wheels and space 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.909
 or that I stole a piece of clothing employees a supermarket in the mandalay 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:34.310
 bay hotel three years and that if jesus much more effective than sending it to the 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.970
 jail for eta the recidivism already changed the attitude yes it received it of 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:41.089
 recidivism has to have another treatment to the Gauls 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:44.479
 to the delinquents but good that will be object of the secondary legislations 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:48.150
 that the states and the federation have to get to work from yesterday 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:52.749
 to make it public with this report warns the oral trial 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:58.169
 I had spoken with judges and spoke with lawyer certifiers and they have you 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.310
 dread oral trial fortunately a rebound after being broken but in other 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.440
 you will never see ajalpan see that you are looking for the woman because he sent the 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.569
 jail prison and one hundred percent this sector the court to all work well 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.719
 says no and how to be a lawyer that does not have to know 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.259
 the liquidate yes not know how to dictate 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:21.279
 we see elegant Nazi costumes the sony plan paid its impact because I think so 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.699
 if it's full of tactical alligator coyotes from the telde right litigation 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.579
 criminal as useful matter is arranged the public prosecutor moncloa the codes 

00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:33.400
 criminals as I think you are afraid because this initiative 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.600
 will go through a filter by a sieve to the entire litigating class are going to have to 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.990
 put to study 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.110
 to have that if you want to prepare that transform your paradigms 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.780
 so that those who will keep nothing but the deepest part of their file one 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.100
 same the judges is the same the judges the same the secretaries of agreements the 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.719
 public ministries 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:54.050
 to make these judgments public 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.770
 6% to me what I like when it's public 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.020
 this Thursday 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.589
 the fiscal advocate postal scrutiny of public opinion this is 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:07.079
 public as public as you imagine it in October and you and I are going to 

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:10.030
 to be able to enter although I am not accusing drug trafficker 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.990
 and we are going to promote the eyes to the judge and he wants to let go if he wants to condemn and 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.840
 that's something very important transparency is very important as in the delivery 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.010
 of basic justice that is transformed 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.930
 justice in mexico 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.190
 this how much is the deadline for us to achieve other forms or that is not easy 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.600
 and it requires many resources to transform the two courts that today a society 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.599
 quite unpleasant 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.110
 in an open court for an oral trial 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.719
 Well, you have to do some physical training 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:39.730
 if this construction is like that 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.669
 but he managed ironic destruction or wool cap 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.669
 in the long run it is clear because I am convinced that it will save us money 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.600
 said sentence of pan river plate context up to eight years we have both 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:51.499
 the federation 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:55.959
 as the local legislatures to 2016 you have to wait all expressed to it 

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:59.220
 we have to be at the rhythm of what is what we imagine a reform that 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.569
 we already approved yesterday 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.909
 but what I like the most 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.029
 away from the fact that this one who is going to dignify his handlebar justice and already 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:11.629
 we are not going to judge mountains of paper but human beings 1 stofan we can 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:13.619
 make Mexico a country of laws 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:15.469
 because it has always been a dream 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:19.750
 since demagoguery switzerland in mexico is a country of laws and mechanisms and very 

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:22.159
 sexy arch companies 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:25.919
 sing it applied to the brands well the mountain of papers and 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.339
 but not laws 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:32.189
 If 99% of the crimes in Mexico are punished that you want to synthesize sought 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:33.039
 To be honored 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:34.150
 in this country 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.729
 two hopefully we can 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:39.569
 york I am a trade that more infrastructure more than trying to attract 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:40.400
 investment 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.150
 we have to put even ground for everyone and the table means and education 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.950
 more than anything else the other one of the great reforms and that 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.810
 although Carlos Blasco visit them to recommend them for four people and 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:51.819
 in this country 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:55.360
 is where you have to turn to find out more about this reform 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.389
 with his deputy I believe that the constitution 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:02.530
 in the universities the technical reform difficult to explain has been very rare 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.349
 as being constitucao slow in mexico the parties with the universities 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.349
 but to the pity that people are uninformed 

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:11.869
 if so, like your market opportunities 

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:14.819
 talgo barroso vice secretary of the justice commission the camera 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:15.979

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:18.330
