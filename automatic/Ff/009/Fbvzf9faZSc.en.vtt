00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello, friends, how are you? 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.450
 are putting into practice all 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.770
 tips strategies resources 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.750
 methodologies that I've been sharing with 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.610
 you through these videoblogs 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.949
 As I said, it 's a pleasure for me 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.630
 and a pleasure to be able to share them 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.339
 because it is also part of me 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.919
 growth I have been learning 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:25.289
 I've been applying them I've been watching 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.929
 Which ones work best not like me 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.439
 I have commented on other videoblogs 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.239
 you have to choose which ones 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.070
 methodologies which resources which 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.230
 strategies work best for 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.149
 you and those taking the best and 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.070
 start it to work remember that a 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.769
 Sometimes not everything will work for us 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.290
 same way either for you 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:50.890
 operate more ho'oponopono ft 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.870
 the healing with symbols I do not know the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.610
 healing with magnets you have to 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.610
 choose which of these 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.460
 methodologies go more with you and which 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.010
 you feel that it resonates more and is more 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.710
 easy to work is good for you right now 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.900
 I'm going to share one of the tools 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.490
 that more work in ho'oponopono and 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.010
 that for me the truth is a 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.470
 very powerful and very useful tool and 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.960
 very easy to perform good because this 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.030
 time is the solar water hoisted I got 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.130
 I want this jar to see her 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.470
 very economical price here in the city 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.200
 in the center of Mexico actually me 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.000
 It cost 40 pesos had its glass cap 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.740
 but on one occasion that I was 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.630
 unintentionally washing it broke 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.150
 so now what I do that with a 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.900
 I cover the paper and put a garter or 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.850
 a tied him with a plastic but not 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.670
 touch the water and I put all the 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.800
 mornings to be in the ray of the sun and 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.800
 I'm retiring it like that from 4 o'clock 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.440
 the afternoon and already use is water to take 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.450
 to prepare the food and they will see 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.560
 that without you're going 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.079
 I am sorry, I love you 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.090
 the water already hoisted solar does its job 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.310
 for you because this water goes straight 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.320
 to the unconscious and begins to clean and 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.049
 heal everything we have there trapped 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.450
 It is a very useful and very easy tool 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.640
 to do now we also have another 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.580
 tool that is when you feel 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.800
 very anxious very tired that is the 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.170
 glass of water then you can take a 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.110
 glass of water in this way that does not have 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.269
 No drawing that is preferred 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.140
 ready in this case it has some 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.970
 This grecas but do not know how you what 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.760
 they will fill three quarters of 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.700
 water and when they feel very anxious 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.970
 with fear or annoyance the only thing they do 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.549
 is to put it in your room in 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.799
 the room where you spend more time and 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.870
 when they arrive from their work they empty 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.299
 the water and throw it out and refill it 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.930
 if they still feel very anxious or 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:52.209
 very tired they go and again the strip does not 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.580
 matter how many times you change the 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.140
 water because this makes the mind in the 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.970
 unconscious do you realize that you're 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.720
 throwing away your problems that you're 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.790
 taking out 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.850
 and that will help them a lot to 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.290
 release tensions everything that the 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.690
 stress that comes unloading many 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.730
 Friends of your work day good friends 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.800
 because these two tools I hope that 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.080
 they are very useful and that the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.150
 put into practice are very simple and 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.800
 very easy to do well then we 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.770
 we see in the following blog hybrid 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.110
 have a nice afternoon and have 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:27.330
 a day full of a lot of love I'm sorry you 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.330
