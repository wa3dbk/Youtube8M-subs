don't you get laser treatment but I
don't<00:03:15.920> necessarily<00:03:16.190> really<00:03:17.060> believe<00:03:17.450> in

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
don't necessarily really believe in

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.240 
don't necessarily really believe in
laser<00:03:17.900> treatment<00:03:18.380> I'm<00:03:18.500> not<00:03:18.680> sure<00:03:18.920> how

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
laser treatment I'm not sure how

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.910 
laser treatment I'm not sure how
effective<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:20.030> would<00:03:20.150> be<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.840> I'm<00:03:21.620> not<00:03:21.769> sure

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
effective it would be and I'm not sure

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.960 
effective it would be and I'm not sure
it's<00:03:22.069> just<00:03:22.250> something<00:03:22.519> that<00:03:22.549> I'm<00:03:22.670> willing<00:03:22.819> to

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
it's just something that I'm willing to

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.090 
it's just something that I'm willing to
do<00:03:23.180> just<00:03:23.359> yet<00:03:24.019> but<00:03:24.319> I<00:03:24.380> might<00:03:24.620> change<00:03:24.859> my<00:03:24.980> mind

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
do just yet but I might change my mind

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.640 
do just yet but I might change my mind
about<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:25.670> at<00:03:25.790> some<00:03:26.060> point<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.480> don't<00:03:26.540> know<00:03:26.750> I<00:03:27.139> am

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
about it at some point I don't know I am

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.349 
about it at some point I don't know I am
doing<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.069> at-home<00:03:28.190> was<00:03:28.579> still<00:03:28.760> into<00:03:28.940> my<00:03:29.030> arms

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
doing the at-home was still into my arms

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.440 
doing the at-home was still into my arms
but<00:03:29.540> that's<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.840> different<00:03:29.989> matter<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:31.450> it's

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
but that's a different matter and it's

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.650 
but that's a different matter and it's
very<00:03:32.780> interesting<00:03:33.109> how<00:03:33.590> certain<00:03:34.190> places<00:03:34.910> have

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
very interesting how certain places have

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.449 
very interesting how certain places have
got<00:03:35.870> more<00:03:36.079> of<00:03:36.350> an<00:03:36.470> issue<00:03:36.590> with<00:03:36.920> hair<00:03:37.190> removal

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
got more of an issue with hair removal

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.030 
got more of an issue with hair removal
than<00:03:38.030> others<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:38.630> coming<00:03:39.620> from<00:03:39.739> a<00:03:39.859> hot

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
than others and coming from a hot

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.970 
than others and coming from a hot
country<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.489> feel<00:03:40.850> like<00:03:41.150> we<00:03:41.450> very<00:03:42.290> much<00:03:42.470> had<00:03:42.769> an

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
country I feel like we very much had an

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.590 
country I feel like we very much had an
issue<00:03:43.100> with<00:03:43.370> hair<00:03:43.579> because<00:03:43.910> your<00:03:44.120> skin<00:03:44.450> was

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
issue with hair because your skin was

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.930 
issue with hair because your skin was
more<00:03:44.810> exposed<00:03:45.380> living<00:03:46.190> here<00:03:46.370> it's<00:03:46.519> so<00:03:46.670> cold

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
more exposed living here it's so cold

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.610 
more exposed living here it's so cold
most<00:03:47.690> of<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:47.930> time<00:03:48.109> when<00:03:48.260> you<00:03:48.319> have<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.470> be

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
most of the time when you have to be

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.050 
most of the time when you have to be
bundled<00:03:48.799> up<00:03:49.069> anyway<00:03:49.370> but<00:03:49.519> it<00:03:49.609> doesn't<00:03:49.880> really

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
bundled up anyway but it doesn't really

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.870 
bundled up anyway but it doesn't really
matter<00:03:50.299> as<00:03:50.630> much<00:03:50.660> but<00:03:51.590> coming<00:03:52.160> from<00:03:52.430> somewhere

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
matter as much but coming from somewhere

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.330 
matter as much but coming from somewhere
where<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:53.150> did<00:03:53.389> it's<00:03:54.049> kind<00:03:54.319> of<00:03:54.410> been<00:03:54.650> left<00:03:54.980> in

amazing and smooth which is quite

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.470 
amazing and smooth which is quite
depressing<00:04:30.650> so<00:04:31.520> that's<00:04:31.820> some<00:04:32.000> things<00:04:32.240> that<00:04:32.450> I

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
depressing so that's some things that I

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.130 
depressing so that's some things that I
kind<00:04:32.780> of<00:04:32.870> do<00:04:33.080> struggle<00:04:33.350> with<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:33.860> I<00:04:34.160> feel<00:04:34.700> like

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
kind of do struggle with and I feel like

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.500 
kind of do struggle with and I feel like
we<00:04:36.140> have<00:04:36.440> kind<00:04:36.860> of<00:04:36.920> been<00:04:36.980> made<00:04:37.700> to<00:04:37.970> think<00:04:38.210> that

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
we have kind of been made to think that

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.420 
we have kind of been made to think that
you're<00:04:38.780> supposed<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:39.140> be<00:04:39.320> completely<00:04:39.830> hair

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
you're supposed to be completely hair

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.460 
you're supposed to be completely hair
free<00:04:41.000> and<00:04:41.450> especially<00:04:41.870> when<00:04:42.140> it<00:04:42.230> comes<00:04:42.320> to

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
free and especially when it comes to

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.840 
free and especially when it comes to
like<00:04:42.620> brazilian<00:04:43.070> waxing<00:04:43.400> and<00:04:43.580> things<00:04:43.730> like

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
like brazilian waxing and things like

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.760 
like brazilian waxing and things like
that<00:04:43.910> I<00:04:44.150> think<00:04:44.540> especially<00:04:45.200> thinking<00:04:45.650> you<00:04:45.740> a

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
that I think especially thinking you a

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.350 
that I think especially thinking you a
generation<00:04:46.370> of<00:04:46.460> men<00:04:46.520> who<00:04:46.910> have<00:04:47.060> grown<00:04:47.180> up

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
generation of men who have grown up

believe stems from kind of being used to
that<00:05:34.400> and<00:05:35.110> it's<00:05:36.110> kind<00:05:36.380> of<00:05:36.470> very<00:05:36.890> frowned<00:05:37.370> upon

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
supposed to kind of be completely

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.210 
supposed to kind of be completely
hairless<00:06:45.509> because<00:06:46.020> we're<00:06:46.199> always<00:06:46.320> tackling

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
the hair problem and always making sure

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.499

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
kind of keeping on top of the situation

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.999 
kind of keeping on top of the situation
and<00:06:54.180> it's<00:06:54.570> a<00:06:54.630> really<00:06:54.840> tedious<00:06:55.139> situation<00:06:55.889> to
