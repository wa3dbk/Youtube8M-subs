00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.860
 ap 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.860
 all this 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.890
 and ask today I want to turn 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.200
 my first Christmas video so if a 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.660
 Welsh video and Christmas cards 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.070
 of which one at the bottom I show you that after 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.480
 five six and lots of cards that 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.850
 can do super easily 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.190
 it's still pretty fast and poor 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.440
 it does not take much time it's not 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.270
 expensive and lower and unique so we 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.650
 give something to a loved one who is 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.760
 done by means that I find 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.379
 it's a lot nicer than 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.629
 to buy cards then destiny his 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.580
 name at a time so I give you little 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.280
 close 5 6 lots of cards copÃ© 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.900
 do it yourself so seriously 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.879
 I bought all the smells we have so that's 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.260
 really cheap then it's really 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.820
 nice to do you'll see what 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.140
 you will find yourself - hypnosis and 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.850
 childhood and 4th because I have 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.080
 found that really heal the righteous 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.580
 film this video the court takes to 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.170
 children from 4 for sure I'm going in 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.909
 do others after for christmas is 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.260
 really too much too much I hope 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.270
 really you're going to like the idea and 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.520
 then I let you watch the video 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.900
 by the state 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.909
 so I started by showing how 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.310
 make the cards not easily into 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.470
 get more we get a little shot 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.570
 in the muck and bowed the ball tomorrow 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.130
 card in two way before money 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.200
 even for he captures well past I have everything 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.760
 just cut after then I finished my 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.920
 cut and cardboard found that me 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.630
 gave three cards for each band 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.400
 of cardboard on the say that I cut 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.470
 but it's super easy if you want 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.600
 try so we'll start all over again with 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.240
 the first first so that I have 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.860
 started by talking is this form there 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.170
 I do not know how the person then 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.360
 then I would transcribe on 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.490
 good papy scrapbook paper that I write to 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.250
 dollarama is not bad everything comes from 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.380
 put that back and then I took a 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.580
 little rope I made there money 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.520
 of the card and I 'm just going 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.789
 the 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.770
 these small form beds on the rope like 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.929
 for pardon of clothesline with 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.549
 despatie on it we did not see I had seen 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.979
 one of the two is still something 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.220
 to make August crab but that's 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.750
 still a kind of red orange that 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.610
 that's a lot of young players not 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.709
 myself you'll see suspects five 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.750
 glue projects and you stick this 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.730
 training including high school strike 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.739
 result life for the coupe on the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.930
 worse map sticking it on the map of 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.030
 price a little button to support it 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.310
 and then our funds after that I just 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.319
 balance everything with a little bit more 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.269
 the middle one we see the results 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.849
 and I even made a podium for 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.739
 show you so and here is the 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.660
 second it's really the easiest 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.819
 because when I just took 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.489
 stencil most recently stencils 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.310
 christmas critical mass operating os x 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.319
 the qte and I took and a brush in 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.269
 foam then that's normal it's 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.160
 really the best bros for that I 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.780
 find that a brush then then we 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.530
 the saddam removes are so I tried 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.600
 a long hole if I think the meeting 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.100
 and 1 out of 2 third idea cuche presence 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.530
 is really simple if she likes it done 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.150
 6 at the bo forward I created a hole at 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.329
 middle of the map to insert a 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.010
 purple ribbon with Lord led by a 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.480
 blunder or me I just just did 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.150
 a double-income death per passenger 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.590
 placed as for my good my novel for 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.220
 its phase ball obviously you for that 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.200
 it makes the effect I folded the paper and 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.630
 then I started again in water axis 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.370
 painting so I had done with the gray 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.870
 but you do not know meets curfew their 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.239
 refuse end once the subject prized at 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.730
 village of magic price for laughing it's 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.440
 really the best place she has 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.290
 made two films with a more 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.389
 small it's not good tool and then 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.459
 I had another idea so here with a 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.109
 little bit like styrofoam agent so 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.239
 I was going to buy only last year for 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.370
 my movie decorations stay 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.690
 bigfonds I cut the snowflake halfway 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.430
 then I want to come the body and on my 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.140
 map so simply and that's 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.210
 super easy worse 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.220
 as to squeeze them for the collective or 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.750
 to post your kids that these kinds of 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.069
 shot of a small brain this is the 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.170
 nuncio foam in writing but my fingernail 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.990
 jdc by a bit the same thing with a 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.720
 kind of little placemats and concludes mr 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.280
 to do beta so I went from 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.530
 two ways in which I close the world paul 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.000
 since I stuck them on top then 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.100
 I also took the push mode but for 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.930
 put it under it so in both of those 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.669
 is beautiful and how much your pocket by 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.169
 above it looks like a summer saved 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.140
 at the end of phase iib what I found 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.240
 beautiful and then I decided to paste it from 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.760
 longford does not give children of paul quinn 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.550
 who have macaroons I left 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.020
 their shovels that exceeds and so 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.150
 it gave me these two there play tonight 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.470
 you then sincerely it's sure named 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.830
 because it's probably the best 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.960
 pulsation and for the last 4 but 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.510
 I decided to go way a Santa Claus 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.910
 so with the doing that I traced 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.410
 the map mas so we will cut 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.480
 then if you have scissors done 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.520
 on purpose for them you play board because 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.000
 that little fire is really impossible 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.040
 so there we remember red colimon 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.780
 on the map so if you want to take 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.370
 a red card too could you 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.919
 save time because I know more 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.900
 smart then I took people from 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.430
 do since gp2 and I fired my card 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.470
 board to do it just to make 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.030
 marks in my brother a child on 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.460
 take a band a little big for 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.780
 the sea vertically then it misses a 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.300
 little bit smaller for now 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.010
 the horizontal their passengers caught in 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.840
 sport and established moscow but in the middle 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.520
 to make the loop and that's the 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.180
 result 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.180
 he 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.170
 I hope she refused the video 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.240
 that it will give ideas and that the 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.650
 salary and cards on 7 I tell you 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.190
 to next year only the best 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.190
 brains crime
