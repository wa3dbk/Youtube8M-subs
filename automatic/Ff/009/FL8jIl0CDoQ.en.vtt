a great sight he might have been the one

a great sight he might have been the one
delivering<00:00:39.079> the<00:00:39.470> blow<00:00:39.699> but<00:00:40.699> as<00:00:40.820> a<00:00:40.850> person<00:00:41.390> you

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
delivering the blow but as a person you

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.880 
delivering the blow but as a person you
just<00:00:41.540> don't<00:00:42.050> want<00:00:42.260> to<00:00:42.320> see<00:00:42.559> that<00:00:42.739> happen

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
just don't want to see that happen

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.939 
just don't want to see that happen
through<00:00:43.250> a<00:00:43.280> batsman<00:00:44.079> first<00:00:45.079> one<00:00:45.290> to<00:00:45.680> get<00:00:45.860> away

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
through a batsman first one to get away

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.650 
through a batsman first one to get away
from<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:46.550> action

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.410 

yeah<00:00:52.260> you're<00:00:52.500> right<00:00:52.650> it's<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.670> nasty<00:00:54.180> blow

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
yeah you're right it's it's a nasty blow

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.530 
yeah you're right it's it's a nasty blow
and<00:00:54.720> I<00:00:55.710> think<00:00:55.950> it<00:00:56.070> got<00:00:56.430> him<00:00:56.490> and<00:00:57.060> that<00:00:57.210> gap

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
and I think it got him and that gap

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.440 
and I think it got him and that gap
between<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.890> eye<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.450> and<00:01:00.770> the<00:01:01.770> nose

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
between the eye and and the nose

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.790 
between the eye and and the nose

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
possibly the cheekbone I'm not too sure

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.250 
possibly the cheekbone I'm not too sure
but<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.370> was<00:01:05.550> the<00:01:05.700> third<00:01:06.000> bouncer<00:01:06.660> from<00:01:06.840> Lasith
