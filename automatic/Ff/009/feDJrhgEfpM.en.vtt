teams<00:00:27.800> youtube<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.980> actually<00:00:29.160> use<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.730> web<00:00:29.970> app

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
teams youtube I actually use the web app

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.299 
teams youtube I actually use the web app
not<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.019> native<00:00:31.199> app<00:00:31.410> as<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.769> think<00:00:31.980> it's<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.160> lot

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
not the native app as I think it's a lot

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.270 
not the native app as I think it's a lot
faster<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.850> easier<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.690> use<00:00:33.950> stocks<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.160> know

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
faster and easier to use stocks you know

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.729 
faster and easier to use stocks you know
what<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:36.110> maps<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.350> know<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.710> is

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
what that is maps you know what that is

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.549 
what that is maps you know what that is
the<00:00:38.520> weather<00:00:38.730> channel<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.360> actually<00:00:39.750> use

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the weather channel I actually use

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.440 
the weather channel I actually use
instead<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.579> weather<00:00:41.790> app<00:00:42.000> as<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.270> think

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
instead of the weather app as I think

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.380 
instead of the weather app as I think
it's<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.629> lot<00:00:42.780> more<00:00:42.809> full-featured<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:44.390> again

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390
