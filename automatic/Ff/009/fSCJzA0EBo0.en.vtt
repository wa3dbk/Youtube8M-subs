looking at how to diagnose a back light

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.320 
looking at how to diagnose a back light
or<00:00:26.930> an<00:00:27.380> invert<00:00:27.680> a<00:00:27.710> problem<00:00:28.189> on<00:00:28.369> a<00:00:28.400> laptop<00:00:28.730> so

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
or an invert a problem on a laptop so

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.730 
or an invert a problem on a laptop so
we're<00:00:29.450> just<00:00:29.480> going<00:00:29.689> to<00:00:29.750> power<00:00:30.080> this<00:00:30.230> up<00:00:30.290> and<00:00:30.650> as

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
we're just going to power this up and as

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.280 
we're just going to power this up and as
you<00:00:30.890> can<00:00:30.980> see<00:00:31.070> we're<00:00:31.849> getting<00:00:32.029> no<00:00:32.360> display<00:00:32.960> and

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
you can see we're getting no display and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.979 
you can see we're getting no display and
we've<00:00:34.220> got<00:00:34.400> the<00:00:34.489> actual<00:00:34.730> sony<00:00:35.239> light<00:00:35.629> lighting

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
we've got the actual sony light lighting

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.260 
we've got the actual sony light lighting
up<00:00:36.230> but<00:00:36.440> you<00:00:36.559> can't<00:00:36.830> see<00:00:37.129> much<00:00:37.400> on<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:37.910> screen

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
up but you can't see much on the screen

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.900 
up but you can't see much on the screen
and<00:00:38.510> if<00:00:39.470> you<00:00:39.530> look<00:00:39.770> closely<00:00:40.070> you<00:00:40.370> may<00:00:40.610> see<00:00:40.670> a

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
and if you look closely you may see a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.150 
and if you look closely you may see a
little<00:00:41.239> slight<00:00:41.540> display<00:00:42.080> or<00:00:42.620> a<00:00:42.680> little<00:00:42.920> flash

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
little slight display or a little flash

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.619 
little slight display or a little flash
on<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:43.489> screen<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:44.030> we're<00:00:44.150> going<00:00:44.269> to<00:00:44.330> do<00:00:44.480> is

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
on the screen so we're going to do is

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.080 
on the screen so we're going to do is
turn<00:00:45.050> this<00:00:45.230> off<00:00:45.470> I'm<00:00:46.190> going<00:00:46.370> to<00:00:46.430> boot<00:00:46.610> back<00:00:46.850> up

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
turn this off I'm going to boot back up

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.979 
turn this off I'm going to boot back up
into<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:49.280> actual<00:00:49.640> BIOS<00:00:50.030> here<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:50.720> try<00:00:50.960> and

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
into the actual BIOS here and try and

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.100 
into the actual BIOS here and try and
get<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:51.260> BIOS<00:00:51.650> to<00:00:51.680> boot<00:00:51.890> up<00:00:52.250> on<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.640> screen<00:00:53.110> so

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
get the BIOS to boot up on the screen so

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.430 
get the BIOS to boot up on the screen so
I<00:00:54.140> can<00:00:54.260> see<00:00:54.440> it<00:00:55.510> so<00:00:56.510> I'm<00:00:56.780> going<00:00:56.900> to<00:00:56.930> do<00:00:57.080> here<00:00:57.320> is

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
I can see it so I'm going to do here is

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.320 
I can see it so I'm going to do here is
just<00:00:57.470> get<00:00:57.769> this<00:00:57.890> BIOS<00:00:58.250> up<00:00:58.460> and<00:00:58.670> then<00:00:59.059> I'm<00:00:59.180> going

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
just get this BIOS up and then I'm going

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.229 
just get this BIOS up and then I'm going
to<00:00:59.390> get<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.600> torch<00:00:59.900> and<00:01:00.860> actually<00:01:01.280> flash<00:01:02.000> that

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
to get a torch and actually flash that

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.810 
to get a torch and actually flash that
onto<00:01:02.570> the<00:01:02.690> actual<00:01:03.019> screen<00:01:03.379> here<00:01:03.769> to<00:01:03.949> see<00:01:04.640> if<00:01:04.760> I

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
onto the actual screen here to see if I

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.060 
onto the actual screen here to see if I
can<00:01:05.030> see<00:01:05.239> any<00:01:05.420> sort<00:01:05.659> of<00:01:05.780> display<00:01:06.290> now

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
can see any sort of display now

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.719 
can see any sort of display now
sometimes<00:01:07.610> you<00:01:08.390> don't<00:01:08.570> always<00:01:08.900> see<00:01:09.729> anything

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
sometimes you don't always see anything

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.430 
sometimes you don't always see anything
but<00:01:10.940> sometimes<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:11.540> can<00:01:11.690> just<00:01:11.720> see<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.049> really

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
but sometimes you can just see a really

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.859 
but sometimes you can just see a really
faint<00:01:12.799> picture<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:13.610> that's<00:01:14.299> convenient

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
faint picture and that's convenient

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.060 
faint picture and that's convenient
cleanest<00:01:15.170> you<00:01:15.290> can<00:01:15.409> see<00:01:15.530> when<00:01:15.710> I<00:01:15.740> use<00:01:15.920> the

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
cleanest you can see when I use the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.399 
cleanest you can see when I use the
camcorder<00:01:16.490> here<00:01:16.850> with<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.180> light<00:01:17.390> on<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:17.750> you

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
camcorder here with the light on it you

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.020 
camcorder here with the light on it you
can<00:01:18.619> actually<00:01:18.770> see<00:01:19.010> there<00:01:19.400> is<00:01:19.549> a<00:01:19.580> little<00:01:19.790> bit

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
can actually see there is a little bit

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.240 
can actually see there is a little bit
of<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.150> display<00:01:20.570> there<00:01:20.869> so<00:01:21.799> that's<00:01:21.979> a<00:01:22.100> good

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
of a display there so that's a good

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.740 
of a display there so that's a good
first<00:01:22.460> step<00:01:22.729> to<00:01:22.789> start<00:01:23.149> off<00:01:23.240> with<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:23.630> we're

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
first step to start off with so we're

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.170 
first step to start off with so we're
going<00:01:23.899> to<00:01:23.960> do<00:01:24.109> next<00:01:24.320> is<00:01:24.590> remove<00:01:25.579> all<00:01:25.850> this

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
going to do next is remove all this

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.440 
going to do next is remove all this
actual<00:01:26.810> bezel<00:01:27.200> on<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.409> front<00:01:27.740> here<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.450> be

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
actual bezel on the front here and be

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.330 
actual bezel on the front here and be
very<00:01:29.479> careful<00:01:30.200> you<00:01:30.229> need<00:01:30.560> to<00:01:30.680> do<00:01:30.799> is<00:01:30.920> just<00:01:31.100> pry

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
very careful you need to do is just pry

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.060 
very careful you need to do is just pry
around<00:01:31.640> little<00:01:31.939> there<00:01:32.119> and<00:01:32.590> remove<00:01:33.590> that<00:01:33.799> from

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
around little there and remove that from

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.980 
around little there and remove that from
it<00:01:34.280> will<00:01:34.579> take<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:34.880> bit<00:01:35.090> more<00:01:35.299> force<00:01:35.600> than<00:01:35.840> what

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
it will take a bit more force than what

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.179 
it will take a bit more force than what
I<00:01:36.020> just<00:01:36.109> showed<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:36.679> there<00:01:36.829> but<00:01:37.070> it's<00:01:37.159> just

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
I just showed you there but it's just

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.880 
I just showed you there but it's just
giving<00:01:37.579> an<00:01:37.670> example<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.710> once<00:01:39.710> we've<00:01:39.859> got

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
giving an example and once we've got

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.069 
giving an example and once we've got
inside<00:01:40.399> here<00:01:40.789> we're<00:01:41.479> going<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:41.659> have<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:41.810> look

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
inside here we're going to have a look

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.609 
inside here we're going to have a look
at<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:42.829> actual<00:01:42.979> inverter<00:01:43.490> part<00:01:43.850> here<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:44.619> the

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
at the actual inverter part here and the

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.029 
at the actual inverter part here and the
cable<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.340> goes<00:01:46.609> into<00:01:46.880> that<00:01:47.770> okay<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:48.829> you

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
cable that goes into that okay so you

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.649 
cable that goes into that okay so you
can<00:01:49.249> see<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.579> cable<00:01:49.909> going<00:01:50.060> really<00:01:50.359> outside

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
can see the cable going really outside

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.169 
can see the cable going really outside
and<00:01:50.929> there's<00:01:51.109> no<00:01:51.289> display<00:01:51.799> here<00:01:52.219> so<00:01:52.789> what<00:01:53.030> we

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
and there's no display here so what we

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.239 
and there's no display here so what we
need<00:01:53.359> to<00:01:53.390> do<00:01:53.689> is<00:01:53.929> determine<00:01:54.499> whether<00:01:54.890> it's<00:01:55.070> the

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:55.249 
need to do is determine whether it's the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:57.940 
need to do is determine whether it's the
inverter<00:01:55.609> or<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.450> actual<00:01:56.600> backlight<00:01:57.289> that's

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
inverter or the actual backlight that's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.819 
inverter or the actual backlight that's
gone<00:01:58.249> okay<00:01:58.789> on<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.270> actual<00:01:59.630> laptop<00:01:59.929> itself<00:02:00.530> so

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
gone okay on the actual laptop itself so

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.120 
gone okay on the actual laptop itself so
what<00:02:00.950> we're<00:02:01.130> going<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.340> do<00:02:01.520> use<00:02:02.299> a<00:02:02.329> little<00:02:02.719> kit

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
what we're going to do use a little kit

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.940 
what we're going to do use a little kit
okay<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:05.600> can<00:02:05.719> see<00:02:05.990> here<00:02:06.319> this<00:02:06.590> is<00:02:06.649> the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
okay and you can see here this is the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.850 
okay and you can see here this is the
actual<00:02:07.929> cable<00:02:08.929> that's<00:02:09.050> going<00:02:09.110> into<00:02:09.590> the

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
actual cable that's going into the

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.220 
actual cable that's going into the
inverter<00:02:10.160> right<00:02:10.550> so<00:02:11.510> what<00:02:11.660> we<00:02:11.750> need<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.900> do<00:02:12.110> is

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
inverter right so what we need to do is

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.050 
inverter right so what we need to do is
bypass<00:02:12.470> this<00:02:13.010> inverter<00:02:13.400> just<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.850> make<00:02:14.030> sure

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
bypass this inverter just to make sure

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.720 
bypass this inverter just to make sure
to<00:02:14.810> see<00:02:15.020> whether<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.440> inverters<00:02:15.920> broken<00:02:16.400> now

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
to see whether the inverters broken now

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.890 
to see whether the inverters broken now
we're<00:02:16.880> going<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.060> be<00:02:17.120> using<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.420> little<00:02:17.660> lamp

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
we're going to be using a little lamp

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.770 
we're going to be using a little lamp
kit<00:02:18.200> which<00:02:18.800> is<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:18.980> customization<00:02:19.550> kit<00:02:20.270> for<00:02:20.510> any

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
kit which is a customization kit for any

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.840 
kit which is a customization kit for any
sort<00:02:21.020> of<00:02:21.110> computer<00:02:21.500> which<00:02:22.250> actually<00:02:22.670> has<00:02:22.819> a

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
sort of computer which actually has a

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.760 
sort of computer which actually has a
colored<00:02:23.480> LED<00:02:23.900> lights<00:02:24.140> on<00:02:24.350> them<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.650> stuff

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
colored LED lights on them and stuff

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.710 
colored LED lights on them and stuff
like<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.220> well<00:02:25.790> there's<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.000> little<00:02:26.180> little

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
like that well there's a little little

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.430 
like that well there's a little little
work<00:02:26.870> controller<00:02:27.409> in<00:02:27.590> there<00:02:27.799> and

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
work controller in there and

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.620 
work controller in there and
there's<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.890> power<00:02:29.160> adapter<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:30.150> goes<00:02:30.390> with

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
there's the power adapter that goes with

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.990 
there's the power adapter that goes with
it<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.130> we're<00:02:32.130> going<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.310> be<00:02:32.370> using<00:02:32.700> some<00:02:32.970> of

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
it and we're going to be using some of

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.380 
it and we're going to be using some of
these<00:02:33.120> little<00:02:33.690> connectors<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.680> 12-volt

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
these little connectors and a 12-volt

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.870 
these little connectors and a 12-volt
power<00:02:36.390> source<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.620> actually<00:02:37.950> light<00:02:38.520> up<00:02:38.550> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
power source to actually light up the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.320 
power source to actually light up the
lamps<00:02:39.270> okay<00:02:40.490> so<00:02:41.490> once<00:02:41.670> we<00:02:41.790> got<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.090> all<00:02:42.300> set

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
lamps okay so once we got this all set

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.640 
lamps okay so once we got this all set
up<00:02:42.570> it's<00:02:42.810> pretty<00:02:42.960> straightforward<00:02:43.560> stuff

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
up it's pretty straightforward stuff

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.030 
up it's pretty straightforward stuff
really<00:02:44.930> it'll<00:02:45.930> come<00:02:46.170> more<00:02:46.350> clear<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.710> a<00:02:46.860> little

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
really it'll come more clear in a little

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.230 
really it'll come more clear in a little
bit<00:02:47.130> later<00:02:47.340> but<00:02:47.760> these<00:02:47.910> are<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.120> actual

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
bit later but these are the actual

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.740 
bit later but these are the actual
cables<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:49.650> we'll<00:02:49.830> all<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.010> using<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.820> plug

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
cables that we'll all be using to plug

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.830 
cables that we'll all be using to plug
into<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.290> actual<00:02:52.530> device<00:02:53.420> so<00:02:54.420> what<00:02:54.570> we<00:02:54.690> do

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
into the actual device so what we do

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.870 
into the actual device so what we do
here<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:55.170> we'll<00:02:55.350> take<00:02:55.590> our<00:02:55.830> plug<00:02:56.160> out<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.700> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
here is we'll take our plug out of the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.240 
here is we'll take our plug out of the
inverter<00:02:57.270> here<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.260> plug<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.800> into<00:02:59.010> our

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
inverter here and plug that into our

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.210 
inverter here and plug that into our
little<00:02:59.730> device<00:03:00.060> here<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.570> then<00:03:01.470> from<00:03:01.980> there

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
little device here and then from there

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.240 
little device here and then from there
we'll<00:03:02.490> go<00:03:02.760> into<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.570> 12<00:03:03.900> volt<00:03:04.200> power<00:03:04.770> adapter

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
we'll go into a 12 volt power adapter

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.720 
we'll go into a 12 volt power adapter
into<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.730> wall<00:03:05.910> okay<00:03:07.130> now<00:03:08.130> if<00:03:08.220> we<00:03:08.340> don't<00:03:08.550> get

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
into the wall okay now if we don't get

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.660 
into the wall okay now if we don't get
no<00:03:09.270> display<00:03:09.900> here<00:03:10.320> okay<00:03:10.770> so<00:03:11.160> if<00:03:11.220> we've<00:03:11.370> got<00:03:11.550> no

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
no display here okay so if we've got no

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.020 
no display here okay so if we've got no
display<00:03:12.120> then<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:13.020> lamps<00:03:13.740> are<00:03:13.890> bad<00:03:14.070> but<00:03:14.760> if<00:03:14.850> we

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
display then the lamps are bad but if we

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.570 
display then the lamps are bad but if we
do<00:03:15.240> get<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.510> display<00:03:15.990> then<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.100> will<00:03:17.220> be<00:03:17.400> the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
do get a display then it will be the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.070 
do get a display then it will be the
actual<00:03:17.760> inverter<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:19.020> is<00:03:19.170> bad<00:03:20.780> okay<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:21.840> this

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
actual inverter that is bad okay so this

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.230 
actual inverter that is bad okay so this
is<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.310> put<00:03:23.310> all<00:03:23.400> this<00:03:23.520> together<00:03:23.730> as<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.120> can

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
is a put all this together as you can

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.660 
is a put all this together as you can
see<00:03:24.360> we've<00:03:24.510> got<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.830> power<00:03:25.830> going<00:03:26.250> from<00:03:26.490> the

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
see we've got the power going from the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.480 
see we've got the power going from the
lamp<00:03:27.410> straight<00:03:28.410> into<00:03:28.800> our<00:03:28.980> little<00:03:29.160> where

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
lamp straight into our little where

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.680 
lamp straight into our little where
invert<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.660> device<00:03:31.170> here<00:03:32.450> coming<00:03:33.450> out<00:03:33.540> of

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
invert of device here coming out of

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.060 
invert of device here coming out of
there<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.959> we're<00:03:34.140> going<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.290> go<00:03:34.410> into<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.709> 12

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
there and we're going to go into a 12

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.600 
there and we're going to go into a 12
volt<00:03:35.370> feed<00:03:35.700> into<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.630> wall<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:38.160> once<00:03:38.310> we<00:03:38.459> do

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
volt feed into the wall and once we do

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.300 
volt feed into the wall and once we do
that<00:03:38.640> we<00:03:39.000> can<00:03:39.209> turn<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.570> on<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:39.930> if<00:03:40.740> the<00:03:40.920> lamps

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
that we can turn it on and if the lamps

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.210 
that we can turn it on and if the lamps
illuminate<00:03:42.180> then<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.320> actual<00:03:43.590> inverter<00:03:43.980> is

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
illuminate then the actual inverter is

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.410 
illuminate then the actual inverter is
bad<00:03:45.140> okay<00:03:46.140> so<00:03:46.200> we'll<00:03:46.470> just<00:03:46.500> switch<00:03:47.400> on<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.880> you

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
bad okay so we'll just switch on and you

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.640 
bad okay so we'll just switch on and you
should<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:48.810> might<00:03:48.959> not<00:03:49.110> be<00:03:49.170> able<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.380> see<00:03:49.530> it

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
should you might not be able to see it

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.920 
should you might not be able to see it
very<00:03:49.680> clearly<00:03:50.190> here<00:03:50.580> and<00:03:50.820> but<00:03:51.570> I'll<00:03:51.690> switch<00:03:51.900> it

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
very clearly here and but I'll switch it

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.860 
very clearly here and but I'll switch it
on<00:03:52.110> you<00:03:52.140> should<00:03:52.470> see<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.770> light<00:03:52.980> come<00:03:53.220> on<00:03:53.250> just

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
on you should see the light come on just

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.120 
on you should see the light come on just
very<00:03:54.870> dim<00:03:55.050> there<00:03:55.260> but<00:03:55.440> that's<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.800> actual

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
very dim there but that's the actual

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.400 
very dim there but that's the actual
light<00:03:56.820> coming<00:03:57.180> on<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:57.420> tubes<00:03:57.690> coming<00:03:58.080> on<00:03:58.200> and

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
light coming on the tubes coming on and

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.960 
light coming on the tubes coming on and
I'll<00:03:58.500> show<00:03:58.739> you<00:03:58.800> that<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.100> way<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.370> can<00:03:59.700> see

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
I'll show you that this way you can see

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.520 
I'll show you that this way you can see
the<00:04:00.540> display<00:04:00.810> okay

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
the display okay

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.040 
the display okay
so<00:04:02.310> now<00:04:02.489> we<00:04:02.550> know<00:04:02.730> that<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:03.239> tube<00:04:03.510> is<00:04:03.630> good<00:04:03.900> and

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
so now we know that the tube is good and

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.210 
so now we know that the tube is good and
the<00:04:04.650> actual<00:04:04.950> inverter<00:04:05.280> is<00:04:05.400> bad<00:04:06.830> okay<00:04:07.830> so<00:04:07.890> let's

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
the actual inverter is bad okay so let's

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.280 
the actual inverter is bad okay so let's
take<00:04:08.370> another<00:04:08.700> look<00:04:08.940> at<00:04:09.120> another<00:04:09.930> screen

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
take another look at another screen

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.199 
take another look at another screen
we've<00:04:10.470> got<00:04:10.500> here<00:04:11.100> now<00:04:11.700> remember<00:04:12.090> you<00:04:12.180> don't

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
we've got here now remember you don't

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.150 
we've got here now remember you don't
have<00:04:12.480> to<00:04:12.810> do<00:04:12.959> it<00:04:13.080> this<00:04:13.230> way<00:04:13.470> you<00:04:13.530> can<00:04:13.860> actually

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
have to do it this way you can actually

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.570 
have to do it this way you can actually
use<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.370> known<00:04:14.700> good<00:04:14.970> screen<00:04:15.620> onto<00:04:16.620> another

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
use a known good screen onto another

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.060 
use a known good screen onto another
laptop<00:04:17.850> to<00:04:18.330> see<00:04:18.510> whether<00:04:18.720> you've<00:04:18.959> got<00:04:19.230> display

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
laptop to see whether you've got display

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.110 
laptop to see whether you've got display
there<00:04:20.340> you<00:04:20.520> can<00:04:20.669> also<00:04:20.820> use<00:04:21.120> multimeters<00:04:21.900> for

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
there you can also use multimeters for

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.610 
there you can also use multimeters for
the<00:04:24.120> actual<00:04:24.390> inverter<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:25.110> see<00:04:25.290> if<00:04:25.380> that's

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
the actual inverter to see if that's

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.680 
the actual inverter to see if that's
failed<00:04:25.950> or<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:26.520> can<00:04:26.730> use<00:04:27.090> a<00:04:27.120> known<00:04:27.480> good

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
failed or you can use a known good

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.240 
failed or you can use a known good
invert<00:04:28.020> as<00:04:28.200> well<00:04:28.410> there's<00:04:28.860> many<00:04:29.070> different

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
invert as well there's many different

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.310 
invert as well there's many different
ways<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.580> test<00:04:29.940> it<00:04:30.090> this<00:04:30.270> is<00:04:30.450> just<00:04:30.480> a<00:04:30.810> quick<00:04:31.080> and

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
ways to test it this is just a quick and

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.770 
ways to test it this is just a quick and
simple<00:04:31.710> way<00:04:31.970> when<00:04:32.970> Iola<00:04:33.330> flicked<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.750> switch

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
simple way when Iola flicked the switch

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.230 
simple way when Iola flicked the switch
on<00:04:34.230> here<00:04:34.650> so<00:04:35.160> you<00:04:35.190> can<00:04:35.400> see<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.669> light<00:04:35.910> come<00:04:36.120> on

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
on here so you can see the light come on

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.760 
on here so you can see the light come on
and<00:04:36.419> as<00:04:36.660> you<00:04:36.810> can<00:04:36.900> see<00:04:36.960> it's<00:04:37.229> not<00:04:37.380> a<00:04:37.440> very<00:04:37.500> good

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
and as you can see it's not a very good

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.790 
and as you can see it's not a very good
example<00:04:38.310> it's<00:04:38.370> very<00:04:38.640> bright<00:04:38.940> today<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:40.080> but

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
example it's very bright today and but

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.589 
example it's very bright today and but
you<00:04:40.950> can<00:04:41.220> see<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.729> light

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
you can see the light

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.419 
you can see the light
and<00:04:43.599> I'll<00:04:43.689> just<00:04:43.899> quickly<00:04:44.139> switch<00:04:44.529> on<00:04:44.739> again<00:04:45.069> as

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:45.429 
and I'll just quickly switch on again as

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:47.279 
and I'll just quickly switch on again as
you<00:04:45.579> can<00:04:45.609> see<00:04:45.729> here<00:04:46.179> so<00:04:46.389> we<00:04:46.539> know<00:04:46.689> that<00:04:46.719> the

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
you can see here so we know that the

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.549 
you can see here so we know that the
lamp<00:04:47.469> is<00:04:47.619> good<00:04:47.829> now<00:04:47.979> this<00:04:48.039> is<00:04:48.309> a<00:04:48.339> good<00:04:49.319> LCD<00:04:50.319> so<00:04:50.529> I

00:04:50.549 --> 00:04:50.559 
lamp is good now this is a good LCD so I

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:52.589 
lamp is good now this is a good LCD so I
know<00:04:50.709> it<00:04:50.829> works<00:04:51.039> so<00:04:51.699> it's<00:04:52.119> just<00:04:52.329> an<00:04:52.509> example

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
know it works so it's just an example

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.079 
know it works so it's just an example
really<00:04:53.199> so<00:04:54.009> we<00:04:54.129> know<00:04:54.249> the<00:04:54.369> actual<00:04:54.699> light<00:04:54.939> is

00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:55.089 
really so we know the actual light is

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:58.499 
really so we know the actual light is
going<00:04:55.419> on<00:04:55.569> which<00:04:56.319> is<00:04:56.469> a<00:04:56.499> good<00:04:56.739> sign<00:04:57.419> now<00:04:58.419> if

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
going on which is a good sign now if

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.569 
going on which is a good sign now if
that<00:04:58.659> didn't<00:04:59.079> come<00:04:59.259> on<00:04:59.289> the<00:04:59.889> lamp<00:05:00.129> would<00:05:00.339> be

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:00.579 
that didn't come on the lamp would be

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:04.439 
that didn't come on the lamp would be
bad<00:05:00.849> okay<00:05:01.829> so<00:05:02.829> that's<00:05:03.039> that<00:05:03.489> little<00:05:03.879> test<00:05:04.239> done

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
bad okay so that's that little test done

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.749 
bad okay so that's that little test done
and<00:05:04.599> the<00:05:05.049> kit<00:05:05.289> you<00:05:05.499> can<00:05:05.649> use<00:05:05.709> in<00:05:06.099> these<00:05:06.219> actual

here you can also use the tubes as well
to<00:05:18.339> test<00:05:18.579> inverters<00:05:19.089> and<00:05:19.239> stuff<00:05:19.839> like<00:05:19.989> that<00:05:20.229> or

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:20.459 
to test inverters and stuff like that or

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:24.139 
to test inverters and stuff like that or
plug<00:05:21.459> it<00:05:21.579> in<00:05:21.699> that<00:05:21.879> way<00:05:22.199> but<00:05:23.199> it's<00:05:23.379> pretty<00:05:23.559> good

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:24.149 
plug it in that way but it's pretty good

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:26.879 
plug it in that way but it's pretty good
to<00:05:25.149> test<00:05:25.389> out<00:05:25.599> stuff<00:05:25.779> as<00:05:26.079> well<00:05:26.259> you<00:05:26.409> can<00:05:26.559> set<00:05:26.799> it

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
to test out stuff as well you can set it

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.499 
to test out stuff as well you can set it
up<00:05:26.979> how<00:05:27.189> you<00:05:27.249> like<00:05:27.489> ready<00:05:27.729> but<00:05:28.029> you<00:05:28.149> can<00:05:28.299> see
