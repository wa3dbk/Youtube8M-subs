00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:08.260
 my name of charles dickens and I am 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.759
 private detective during my 30 years of 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.430
 career I have met with all kinds 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.740
 of cases since murders robberies and 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.840
 kidnappings until sighting of beings 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.839
 of the beyond but the case that I'm about 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:25.050
 telling them is something darker sickly and 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:25.050
 exasperating is a personal case 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.810
 it was winter of 2012 December 25 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.910
 to be exact I woke up like everyone 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.730
 years and I ran to the little tree to see what 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.440
 that had brought me so much to direct 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.020
 look at the bottom of the poor and 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.879
 ramshackle christmas tree but for 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.129
 my surprise there was absolutely nothing 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.540
 down there not even a piece of 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.239
 Charcoal Santacles had forgotten about me 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.600
 and that was something I could not forgive myself 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.199
 did lose the right head pp and I ran 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.199
 towards the street 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.420
 they spent two days already with the head a 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.789
 little bit cooler I decided to find him the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.530
 why this forgetfulness of santa was not going to 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.210
 rest until you have an answer that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.490
 please my heart 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.680
 wandering the streets of this malodorous 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.409
 city â€‹â€‹was looking for a clue that would help me 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.270
 to solve this case a detail a 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.900
 light signal that will illuminate my atrophied 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.900
 and old mind 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.020
 I walked through the city square until 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.690
 that a very peculiar man stumbled 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.979
 with me that made me raise suspicions and 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.780
 I ran with all my efforts up 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.210
 reach that dark entity that had 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.040
 called my attention I raised it 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.350
 kindly and interrogate him as much 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.200
 humanly possible where they are line of 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.149
 Gauls where they are is what I repeated to 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.229
 screams to break it and so they gave me 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.229
 a clue that would be of use to me 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.329
 late more than 10 minutes without realizing 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.769
 that this poor boy did not have anything 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.840
 see with the case 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:14.129
 so subtly I stepped away from the scene 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.129
 so as not to attract anyone's attention 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.340
 I came to an alley where they were 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.010
 two guys making some bets that 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.720
 simple eyes seem illegal to me 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.430
 near they saw me with some eyes 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.280
 comparable to those of a stalking tiger 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.260
 before capturing their prey, one 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.720
 pounced on me and with my techniques 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.700
 jaulÃ­n finish with the exploits his heart 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.530
 with the dragon blow and I approached 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.120
 about the other scoundrel who was in 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.240
 shock for what had just happened to him 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.740
 his partner interrogates him screams but his 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.500
 face showed a bit of amazement 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.300
 he seemed to be hallucinating this made me 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.459
 hesitate and replant the situation in my 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.800
 head something was happening in that 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.069
 alley something that I could not explain with 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.530
 words 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.719
 very slowly from those vestiges to which 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.060
 a mirror and what next to my face is not 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:07.129
 I could not believe what was happening to my 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.909
 question had been answered I
