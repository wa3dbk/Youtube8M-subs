00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:13.090
 and the wild gardens emulate the 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.039
 pure nature but are 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.039
 planned and designed to detail 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.170
 the German landscape artist petra pels 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.790
 specialized in wild gardens the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.860
 demand for this type of gardens from 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.860
 Wild appearance is on the rise 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.699
 the world moves faster and faster and 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.399
 everything is technified we work before a 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.350
 computer we move in car the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.989
 longing to return to nature wins 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.300
 force we also have little time for 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.730
 dedicate ourselves to the care of the garden so 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.350
 it has to be easy to maintain they are 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.360
 several reasons that come together to 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.360
 reinforce this trend and gardening 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.790
 for a long time the name ultra in 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.559
 gardening were the surfaces of 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.530
 trimmed grass and flower centers 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.360
 well defined 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.510
 the wild style began 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.340
 develop at the end of the 19th century its 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.500
 main element are the bushes 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.509
 wild animals located so that they can 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.720
 grow freely and without care 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.700
 special the pedra pels garden near 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.470
 of Magdeburg is a clear example of 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.810
 that these gardens maintain their 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.899
 splendor regardless of the season of 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.899
 year 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.750
 in the wild gardens there is no place 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.120
 for handling the plants 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.550
 they need their time since they bloom 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.380
 until they die maybe you can 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.180
 add some fertilizer but in reality 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.790
 it's about learning to live with the 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.860
 natural processes and speeds or 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.930
 press exit 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.420
 piet oudolf is a pioneer of this type 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.250
 of gardening the Dutch is known 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.470
 internationally for his creations 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.370
 who often recreate wild fields in 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.440
 flower 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.420
 your own garden is in the 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.930
 outside the cluster at a time of 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.930
 amsterdam 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.420
 during the summer it is open to 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.420
 public in general 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.750
 20 years ago we ran into many 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.140
 traditionalists who rejected this 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.540
 way of gardening we dared to use 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.940
 herbs something unimaginable in the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.100
 English gardens of the time but with 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.100
 the time the opposition was softening 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.760
 in 2009 piet oudolf turned a 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.550
 old railway line elevated 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.800
 new york in a park next to others 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.630
 international projects in luri garden 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.420
 of chicago launched this 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.040
 69 year old professional 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.349
 Nowadays people feel more 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.510
 attracted by nature and especially 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.819
 for the plants that is never a 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.849
 intimate need we want to do more with 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.040
 our life in a world where many 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.700
 things go wrong the plants are 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.889
 they express this emotion the gardens 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.040
 wild animals tend to reinforce their effect 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:13.719
 the use of large areas petra pels 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.030
 often works with open spaces 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:19.769
 like this garden before a center of 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.769
 telephone service in Magdeburg 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.090
 our life is very linked to look 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:30.239
 a computer work is very 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.880
 demanding and this little natural oasis 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.220
 it helps us at least to relax the view 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.830
 ve travels also designs gardens 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.990
 Private designed the 300 square meters 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.590
 from katharina's garden I was in 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.590
 magdeburg 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.040
 when the sun shines on the grass and 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.689
 the breeze of the plants is simply 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.620
 wonderful 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:59.900
 wow although often in the gardens 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.900
 particular the wild style is only 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.489
 Applies to small bounded areas 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.760
 because many areas are already occupied 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:10.310
 for the classic roses or lawns 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.349
 cut out there is space for elements 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.800
 wild in the gardens of the German 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.120
 average 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.459
 there are always pioneers who bet on 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.560
 the new trends but the German 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.479
 half still loves his gnomes 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.630
 garden so for now there will be no 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.310
 many changes a careful nature 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.590
 wild mind does not like everyone 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.840
 but it highlights a need 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.840
 imperious the longing for nature
