level<00:00:23.029> anyway<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.090> yeah<00:00:24.390> down<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:24.990> go

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240

alright<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.660> quite<00:00:27.840> straightforward<00:00:28.260> I

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
alright it's quite straightforward I

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.710 
alright it's quite straightforward I
think<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.460> one<00:00:29.609> that's<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.179> furthest

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
think it's the one that's the furthest

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.990 
think it's the one that's the furthest
away<00:00:30.840> from<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.830> actually<00:00:32.189> contains<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
away from you that actually contains the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.799 
away from you that actually contains the
plan<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:34.370> now<00:00:35.370> I've<00:00:35.910> been<00:00:35.940> down<00:00:36.480> here<00:00:36.750> before
