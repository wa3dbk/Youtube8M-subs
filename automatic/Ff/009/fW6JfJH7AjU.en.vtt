00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
think it's been kind of waiting for a

think it's been kind of waiting for a
while<00:00:16.289> now<00:00:16.590> but<00:00:17.070> finally<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.180> been<00:00:18.270> agreed

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.380 
couple of times night she played here
but<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:46.200> atmosphere<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:46.710> good<00:01:47.390> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
but the atmosphere is really good the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.609 
but the atmosphere is really good the
last<00:01:48.570> two<00:01:48.780> times<00:01:48.960> I've<00:01:49.170> been<00:01:49.200> here<00:01:49.439> it's

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
last two times I've been here it's

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.469 
last two times I've been here it's
always<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.860> good<00:01:50.220> atmosphere<00:01:50.399> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
always a good atmosphere and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.679 
always a good atmosphere and
yeah<00:01:52.110> hopefully<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.820> get<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> couple

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
yeah hopefully and we can get a couple

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.149 
yeah hopefully and we can get a couple
of<00:01:54.719> big<00:01:54.899> gates<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:55.320> which<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.710> uh<00:01:55.740> which

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
of big gates here which is uh which

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.789 
of big gates here which is uh which
would<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.579> nice

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
would be nice

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.289 
would be nice
originally<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.070> would<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.759> like<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.060> think

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
originally but would you like to think

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.760 
originally but would you like to think
that<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.570> could<00:02:00.719> perhaps<00:02:00.869> spend<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.409> little

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
that you could perhaps spend a little

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.590 
that you could perhaps spend a little
longer<00:02:01.979> here<00:02:02.310> if<00:02:02.429> it<00:02:02.579> all<00:02:02.670> goes<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.210> plan

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
longer here if it all goes to plan

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.690 
longer here if it all goes to plan
yeah<00:02:04.140> if<00:02:04.259> all<00:02:04.409> goes<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.590> plan<00:02:04.740> obviously<00:02:05.130> from

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
yeah if all goes to plan obviously from

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.540 
yeah if all goes to plan obviously from
from<00:02:06.119> playing<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:07.069> stuff<00:02:08.069> like<00:02:08.280> this

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
from playing and stuff like this

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.400 
from playing and stuff like this
obviously<00:02:08.910> comes<00:02:09.360> into<00:02:09.569> consideration<00:02:09.690> but

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
obviously comes into consideration but

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.710 
obviously comes into consideration but
I'm<00:02:11.400> here<00:02:11.610> for<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.790> month<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.150> start<00:02:12.360> with<00:02:12.540> and

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
I'm here for the month to start with and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.739 
I'm here for the month to start with and
we<00:02:12.810> see<00:02:12.959> how<00:02:13.050> things<00:02:13.230> go<00:02:13.319> from<00:02:13.530> there
