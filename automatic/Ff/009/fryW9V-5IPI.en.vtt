and<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.980> lamp<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.789> all<00:00:50.940> plugged<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.360> here

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
and the lamp is it's all plugged in here

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.240 
and the lamp is it's all plugged in here
here<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.190> some<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:54.059> no<00:00:54.390> containers<00:00:54.930> for

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.590 

humidity<00:00:59.250> and<00:01:02.989> hydrometer<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
humidity and hydrometer and the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.700 
humidity and hydrometer and the
thermometer<00:01:07.130> this<00:01:08.130> sides<00:01:08.430> here<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.710> have

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
thermometer this sides here we have

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.800 
thermometer this sides here we have
little<00:01:11.400> air<00:01:11.580> holes<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.939> suggest<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.479> put<00:01:12.659> in

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
little air holes I suggest you put in

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.230 
little air holes I suggest you put in
more<00:01:13.340> because<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:14.610> there's<00:01:14.850> not<00:01:14.939> enough

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
more because if there's not enough

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.090 
more because if there's not enough
ventilation<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.229> gets<00:01:16.380> too<00:01:16.560> hot<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.920> here

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
ventilation and it gets too hot in here

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:27.740 
ventilation and it gets too hot in here
that's<00:01:17.729> why<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.619> this<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:24.080> but<00:01:26.750> yeah

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
that's why I have this in here but yeah

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.569 
that's why I have this in here but yeah
it's<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.320> very<00:01:28.650> easy<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.369> drill

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
it's it's very easy to just drill

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.130 
it's it's very easy to just drill
somewhere<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.420> haven't<00:01:30.810> gotten<00:01:30.990> around

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
somewhere I just haven't gotten around

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.530 
somewhere I just haven't gotten around
to<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.979> then<00:01:32.759> also<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.420> cut<00:01:33.659> out<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> large

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
to it and then also we cut out a large

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.580 
to it and then also we cut out a large
rectangle<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.259> then<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.009> put<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.430> picture

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
rectangle here and then we put a picture

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.710 
rectangle here and then we put a picture
frame<00:01:40.590> glass<00:01:41.070> piece<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.329> little

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
frame glass piece here so it's a little

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.870 
frame glass piece here so it's a little
viewing<00:01:46.200> window<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:47.070> really<00:01:47.280> hatch<00:01:47.460> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
viewing window it's really hatch and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.450 
viewing window it's really hatch and
it's<00:01:48.540> really<00:01:49.079> handy<00:01:49.500> during<00:01:49.649> hatch<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.369> you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
it's really handy during hatch so you

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.819 
it's really handy during hatch so you
don't<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.970> open<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.299> up<00:01:51.500> see<00:01:52.500> if<00:01:52.530> they're

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
don't have to open it up see if they're

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.440 
don't have to open it up see if they're
okay<00:01:53.720> so<00:01:54.720> yeah<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:56.149> tiny<00:01:57.149> little
