00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello yes too many friends 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.190
 thank you for being here I am abrupt and 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.410
 I tell you that during the week 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.019
 released thanks to bryan singer a 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.610
 image about james mcavoy as the 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.639
 Professor Chang Javier are doing 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.190
 the make up to personify this 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.439
 famous mutant the interesting thing is that by 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.410
 so we can see what it will look like 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.900
 no hair so it will be much more 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.400
 attached to what we all know 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.500
 who think they expect this movie 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.590
 will be x-men apocalypse which is 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.899
 will premiere in May 2016 and every time 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.640
 missing less again age of the line 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.440
 manages to sneak into the box office in the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.809
 third place and in the second place 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.530
 we have a comedy called two crazy in 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.149
 leakage 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.710
 this comedy despite having a lot 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.320
 Latin power since one of the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.480
 protagonists is sofÃ­a vergara the truth 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.489
 the trailer does not appeal to me 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.590
 finish convincing me and this 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.420
 we combine the fact that no criticism 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.090
 have been very good and repeating in 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.920
 first place obviously avengers' age of 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.430
 fool throne this movie has already 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.769
 collected worldwide 875 million 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.360
 of dollars and in fact it is expected that for 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.430
 next week 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.230
 the one billion from this 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.510
 moment will start to give some spoilers 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.010
 of the tape avenger station full tron 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.420
 So, if you have not seen it, 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.340
 I recommend you leave this video 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.440
 let's count up to 3 1 2 3 the note if 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.600
 What is required is that I will tell you that 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.880
 one of the most recurrent complaints the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.400
 avengers soft a drone is the change 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.770
 about the origin of the maximum twins 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.660
 apparently marvel wants everything to be 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.910
 synchronized both his universe 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.220
 cinematic like comics so 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.830
 that has decided to change the origin 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.600
 also in comics it has been leaked that 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.210
 in the next issue of a cani 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.770
 avengers' the maximum twins will have the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.990
 revelation that they are not children of 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.390
 magnetto but they are results their 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.610
 powers of an experiment that was performed 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.860
 when they were babies made this by hai 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.290
 evolutionary is really amazing 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.570
 because this contradicts some events 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.610
 past of marvel for example house of m 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.020
 but the marvel strategy like them 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.910
 I say is to have all your universe 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.100
 fully synchronized 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.479
 unfortunately, in my opinion, this 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.580
 obey more 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.739
 a commercial that to an end of history to 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.989
 an end of entertainment you what 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.629
 Please leave your comments below 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.670
 I'm rough and by the way some 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.220
 ask my opinion about avengers the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.530
 soft ultra so much I went to the rose this 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.780
 I raised it to mine and I can 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.910
 say they are very very different from 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.920
 links I leave in the description we 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.170
 we see in the next video to follow 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.170
 talking about movies without excess
