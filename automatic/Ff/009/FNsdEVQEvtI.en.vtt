triple<00:00:28.630> threat<00:00:29.349> fixed<00:00:29.710> blade<00:00:30.660> design<00:00:31.660> was

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
triple threat fixed blade design was

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.380 
triple threat fixed blade design was
stolen<00:00:32.920> by<00:00:33.100> China<00:00:33.430> and<00:00:33.760> now<00:00:33.850> right<00:00:34.000> now<00:00:34.149> it's

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
stolen by China and now right now it's

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.459 
stolen by China and now right now it's
being<00:00:34.570> reproduced<00:00:35.230> there<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.930> basically<00:00:38.230> what

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
being reproduced there so basically what

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.619 
being reproduced there so basically what
we<00:00:38.620> did<00:00:38.800> was<00:00:38.859> I<00:00:39.519> took<00:00:39.579> the<00:00:39.789> design<00:00:40.089> back<00:00:40.359> to<00:00:40.539> the

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
we did was I took the design back to the

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.689 
we did was I took the design back to the
drawing<00:00:40.899> board<00:00:41.230> and<00:00:41.469> tried<00:00:42.309> to<00:00:42.399> come<00:00:42.519> up<00:00:42.550> with

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
drawing board and tried to come up with

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.209 
drawing board and tried to come up with
ways<00:00:43.000> to<00:00:43.059> improve<00:00:43.660> the<00:00:43.989> knife<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.589> design<00:00:44.949> the

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
ways to improve the knife the design the

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.540 
ways to improve the knife the design the
function<00:00:45.699> the<00:00:45.940> cutting<00:00:46.300> ability<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:48.460> know

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
function the cutting ability you know

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.290 
function the cutting ability you know
just<00:00:48.789> everything<00:00:49.210> in<00:00:49.329> general<00:00:49.539> so<00:00:50.999> here<00:00:51.999> we<00:00:52.179> go

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
just everything in general so here we go

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.989 
just everything in general so here we go
we'll<00:00:52.480> take<00:00:52.659> a<00:00:52.690> quick<00:00:52.960> look<00:00:53.170> this<00:00:54.010> is<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.519> the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
we'll take a quick look this is the the

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:59.430 
we'll take a quick look this is the the
satin<00:00:55.390> version<00:00:56.789> as<00:00:57.789> you<00:00:57.850> can<00:00:58.030> see<00:00:58.480> it<00:00:59.019> still

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
satin version as you can see it still

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.029 
satin version as you can see it still
has<00:00:59.469> the<00:01:00.010> three<00:01:00.309> grind<00:01:00.640> edge<00:01:00.940> there<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.890> we

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
has the three grind edge there what we

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.189 
has the three grind edge there what we
did<00:01:03.280> was<00:01:03.640> we<00:01:03.670> left<00:01:04.300> this<00:01:04.479> grinding<00:01:04.839> the<00:01:04.960> same

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
did was we left this grinding the same

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.770 
did was we left this grinding the same
and<00:01:05.530> this<00:01:05.979> one<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.310> same<00:01:06.550> but<00:01:07.300> what<00:01:07.450> we<00:01:07.570> did

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
and this one the same but what we did

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.920 
and this one the same but what we did
here<00:01:08.260> instead<00:01:09.040> of<00:01:09.270> starting<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.360> new<00:01:10.390> grind

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
here instead of starting a new grind

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.190 
here instead of starting a new grind
going<00:01:11.440> down<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:12.100> over<00:01:12.850> what<00:01:13.630> we<00:01:13.750> did<00:01:13.960> was<00:01:14.170> we

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
going down and over what we did was we

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.470 
going down and over what we did was we
left<00:01:14.530> it<00:01:14.620> at<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.800> same<00:01:15.040> angle<00:01:15.610> so<00:01:15.910> it's<00:01:16.150> cut

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
left it at the same angle so it's cut

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.560 
left it at the same angle so it's cut
here<00:01:16.960> all<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:18.010> way<00:01:18.100> past<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.760> then<00:01:18.910> rotated

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
here all the way past and then rotated

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.140 
here all the way past and then rotated
and<00:01:19.750> cut<00:01:20.320> like<00:01:20.530> that<00:01:20.590> at<00:01:20.980> the<00:01:21.100> same<00:01:21.130> height<00:01:21.850> and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
and cut like that at the same height and

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.100 
and cut like that at the same height and
the<00:01:22.690> same<00:01:22.720> angle<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:24.520> it's<00:01:24.760> actually<00:01:25.330> can<00:01:26.020> be

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
the same angle so it's actually can be

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.060 
the same angle so it's actually can be
considered<00:01:26.590> more<00:01:26.830> of<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:27.130> tanto<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:29.470> wish<00:01:29.890> I<00:01:29.980> had

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
considered more of a tanto I wish I had

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.260 
considered more of a tanto I wish I had
another<00:01:30.280> one<00:01:30.490> here<00:01:30.700> I<00:01:30.730> could<00:01:30.970> actually<00:01:31.120> show

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
another one here I could actually show

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.130 
another one here I could actually show
you<00:01:31.480> guys<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:32.040> comparison<00:01:33.040> but<00:01:33.660> and<00:01:34.660> also<00:01:35.020> we

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
you guys the comparison but and also we

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.930 
you guys the comparison but and also we
did<00:01:35.320> a<00:01:35.350> nice<00:01:35.560> wedge<00:01:35.890> up<00:01:36.100> here<00:01:36.370> and<00:01:36.580> ass<00:01:36.670> wedge

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
did a nice wedge up here and ass wedge

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.510 
did a nice wedge up here and ass wedge
up<00:01:37.210> there<00:01:37.450> I<00:01:37.660> think<00:01:38.620> it<00:01:38.740> kind<00:01:38.950> of<00:01:39.010> gives<00:01:39.220> a<00:01:39.370> real

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
up there I think it kind of gives a real

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.770 
up there I think it kind of gives a real
cool<00:01:39.820> effect<00:01:40.330> to<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.410> knife<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:43.210> grind<00:01:43.540> is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
cool effect to the knife this grind is

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.120 
cool effect to the knife this grind is
very<00:01:44.530> very<00:01:44.830> difficult<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.430> do<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.950> not<00:01:47.950> only

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
very very difficult to do it's not only

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.250 
very very difficult to do it's not only
hard<00:01:48.370> to<00:01:48.520> do<00:01:48.670> but<00:01:48.910> it's<00:01:49.060> hard<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.510> match<00:01:50.050> it

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
hard to do but it's hard to match it

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
hard to do but it's hard to match it
perfectly<00:01:50.620> on<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.920> backside<00:01:52.620> but<00:01:53.620> here<00:01:54.130> you

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
perfectly on the backside but here you

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.640 
perfectly on the backside but here you
can<00:01:54.430> get<00:01:54.550> a<00:01:54.580> pretty<00:01:54.820> good<00:01:54.910> idea<00:01:55.060> that<00:01:55.690> you<00:01:56.560> know

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
can get a pretty good idea that you know

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.810 
can get a pretty good idea that you know
they<00:01:56.830> came<00:01:56.980> out<00:01:57.040> pretty<00:01:57.190> damn<00:01:57.610> nice<00:01:59.580> the<00:02:00.580> steel

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
they came out pretty damn nice the steel

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.620 
they came out pretty damn nice the steel
is<00:02:01.060> d2<00:02:01.570> tool<00:02:01.990> steel<00:02:02.260> of<00:02:02.590> course<00:02:02.650> and<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
is d2 tool steel of course and the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.639 
is d2 tool steel of course and the
handle<00:02:04.900> material<00:02:04.990> is<00:02:05.560> black<00:02:06.430> g10<00:02:06.730> and<00:02:07.470> as<00:02:08.470> you

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
handle material is black g10 and as you

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.919 
handle material is black g10 and as you
can<00:02:08.769> see<00:02:09.039> we<00:02:09.250> did<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:09.519> we<00:02:10.390> stuck<00:02:10.660> with<00:02:10.690> the

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
can see we did the we stuck with the

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.500 
can see we did the we stuck with the
maze<00:02:11.110> pattern<00:02:11.910> we<00:02:12.910> went<00:02:13.150> with<00:02:13.300> a<00:02:13.330> little

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
maze pattern we went with a little

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.830 
maze pattern we went with a little
smaller<00:02:13.989> end<00:02:14.319> mill<00:02:14.530> cutting<00:02:15.159> the<00:02:15.280> design<00:02:15.840> and

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
smaller end mill cutting the design and

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.349 
smaller end mill cutting the design and
we<00:02:17.140> went<00:02:17.349> a<00:02:17.409> little<00:02:17.620> shallower<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:19.060> what<00:02:19.239> this

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
we went a little shallower and what this

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.869 
we went a little shallower and what this
does<00:02:19.599> is<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:20.499> gives<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.920> really<00:02:21.189> nice<00:02:21.430> grip

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:06.279 
plenty of jumping here on the top which

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:09.360 
plenty of jumping here on the top which
gives<00:03:06.879> you<00:03:07.090> really<00:03:07.329> great<00:03:07.599> grip<00:03:08.129> this<00:03:09.129> thing

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
gives you really great grip this thing

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.269 
gives you really great grip this thing
will<00:03:09.549> never<00:03:09.819> ever<00:03:10.029> slip<00:03:10.359> out<00:03:10.480> of<00:03:10.599> your<00:03:10.689> hand<00:03:11.279> we

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:12.279 
will never ever slip out of your hand we

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:15.780 
will never ever slip out of your hand we
went<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.549> little<00:03:12.760> shallower<00:03:13.450> this<00:03:13.779> time<00:03:14.049> so<00:03:14.790> you

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
went a little shallower this time so you

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.309 
went a little shallower this time so you
know<00:03:15.879> we<00:03:16.029> only<00:03:16.150> went<00:03:16.420> like<00:03:16.659> a<00:03:16.689> quarter<00:03:17.109> of<00:03:17.230> the

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
know we only went like a quarter of the

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.800 
know we only went like a quarter of the
way<00:03:17.469> deep<00:03:17.769> instead<00:03:18.519> of<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:19.150> know<00:03:19.180> half<00:03:19.510> the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
way deep instead of you know half the

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.199 
way deep instead of you know half the
way<00:03:20.040> because<00:03:21.040> we<00:03:21.189> didn't<00:03:21.370> want<00:03:21.549> it<00:03:21.639> to<00:03:21.670> be<00:03:21.879> too

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
way because we didn't want it to be too

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.390 
way because we didn't want it to be too
aggressive<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:23.260> then<00:03:23.950> we<00:03:24.040> hit<00:03:24.189> it<00:03:24.310> with

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
aggressive and then we hit it with

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.000 
aggressive and then we hit it with
scotch-brite<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:25.810> couple<00:03:26.680> different

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
scotch-brite a couple different

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.440 
scotch-brite a couple different
scotch-brite<00:03:27.340> wheels<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.939> we<00:03:27.999> just<00:03:28.209> kind<00:03:28.389> of

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
scotch-brite wheels and we just kind of

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.119 
scotch-brite wheels and we just kind of
smooth<00:03:28.719> it<00:03:28.930> out<00:03:29.019> a<00:03:29.079> little<00:03:29.319> bit<00:03:29.590> so<00:03:29.799> it's<00:03:29.980> not

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
smooth it out a little bit so it's not

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.459 
smooth it out a little bit so it's not
too<00:03:30.400> rough<00:03:30.670> but<00:03:31.419> it<00:03:31.540> still<00:03:31.779> gives<00:03:31.989> you<00:03:32.139> enough

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:32.469 
too rough but it still gives you enough

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:38.580 
too rough but it still gives you enough
grip<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:33.359> really<00:03:34.359> feel<00:03:34.629> the<00:03:34.779> traction<00:03:35.049> there

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.830 

we<00:03:38.860> also<00:03:39.010> change<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.150> screws<00:03:40.390> up<00:03:40.569> a<00:03:40.689> little

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
we also change the screws up a little

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.330 
we also change the screws up a little
bit<00:03:42.540> as<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:43.659> can<00:03:43.719> see<00:03:44.079> they're<00:03:44.319> kind<00:03:45.099> of<00:03:45.219> like

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
bit as you can see they're kind of like

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.830 
bit as you can see they're kind of like
chained<00:03:45.670> bolt<00:03:46.260> screws<00:03:48.030> because<00:03:49.030> another

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
chained bolt screws because another

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.300 
chained bolt screws because another
change<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.290> we<00:03:50.500> made<00:03:50.530> that<00:03:50.739> I<00:03:50.950> didn't<00:03:51.189> forget

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
change that we made that I didn't forget

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.520 
change that we made that I didn't forget
that<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:51.790> forgot<00:03:52.150> to<00:03:52.269> mention<00:03:52.500> was<00:03:53.500> the

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
that I forgot to mention was the

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.640 
that I forgot to mention was the
thickness<00:03:54.040> of<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.400> blade<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.900> original<00:03:56.409> ones

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
thickness of the blade the original ones

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.839 
thickness of the blade the original ones
were<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:57.010> quarter-inch<00:03:57.459> thick

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
were a quarter-inch thick

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.349 
were a quarter-inch thick
these<00:03:58.060> are<00:03:58.239> 3/16<00:03:59.220> so<00:04:00.220> now<00:04:00.579> they<00:04:00.879> make<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.209> edge

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
these are 3/16 so now they make the edge

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.830 
these are 3/16 so now they make the edge
a<00:04:01.390> lot<00:04:01.959> thinner<00:04:02.319> and<00:04:02.939> this<00:04:03.939> thing<00:04:04.150> just<00:04:04.480> cuts

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
a lot thinner and this thing just cuts

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.379 
a lot thinner and this thing just cuts
unbelievable

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
unbelievable

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.429 
unbelievable
so<00:04:07.389> we<00:04:07.480> basically<00:04:07.599> kind<00:04:08.019> of<00:04:08.079> fixed<00:04:08.349> the

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:08.439 
so we basically kind of fixed the

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.729 
so we basically kind of fixed the
cutting<00:04:09.010> geometry<00:04:09.189> so<00:04:09.989> it<00:04:10.989> cuts<00:04:11.260> really<00:04:11.530> well

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
cutting geometry so it cuts really well

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.940 
cutting geometry so it cuts really well
now<00:04:12.989> which<00:04:13.989> is<00:04:14.109> also<00:04:14.260> another<00:04:14.439> reason<00:04:14.530> why<00:04:14.829> we

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
now which is also another reason why we

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.249 
now which is also another reason why we
had<00:04:15.069> to<00:04:15.159> change<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.669> screws<00:04:15.970> we<00:04:16.930> couldn't<00:04:17.199> do

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:17.259 
had to change the screws we couldn't do

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.259 
had to change the screws we couldn't do
the<00:04:17.349> same<00:04:17.590> screw<00:04:17.889> on<00:04:18.070> each<00:04:18.190> side<00:04:18.489> and<00:04:18.789> then

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
the same screw on each side and then

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.849 
the same screw on each side and then
have<00:04:19.449> a<00:04:19.479> barrel<00:04:19.959> in<00:04:20.079> the<00:04:20.139> middle<00:04:20.440> because<00:04:20.739> it

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859
