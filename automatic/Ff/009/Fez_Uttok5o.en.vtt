00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.020 
I pretty much put I wear my heart on my
sleeve<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.189> how<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.400> fight<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.790> go<00:01:17.909> in

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
sleeve and that's how I fight I go in

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.190 
sleeve and that's how I fight I go in
there<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.270> I'm<00:01:18.360> like<00:01:18.509> let's<00:01:18.689> bang<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
there and I'm like let's bang it out to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.960 
there and I'm like let's bang it out to
see<00:01:19.350> who<00:01:19.409> wins<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.890> don't<00:01:20.220> go<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> decision<00:01:20.670> much

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
see who wins I don't go to decision much

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.520 
see who wins I don't go to decision much
I<00:01:21.210> actually<00:01:21.630> know<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:21.990> he<00:01:22.049> doesn't<00:01:22.170> go<00:01:22.500> to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
I actually know that he doesn't go to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.710 
I actually know that he doesn't go to
the<00:01:22.680> decision<00:01:23.040> at<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.420> think<00:01:24.570> it's

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the decision at all so I think it's

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.570 
the decision at all so I think it's
