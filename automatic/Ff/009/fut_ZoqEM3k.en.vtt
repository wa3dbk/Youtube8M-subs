limb technician so I've come here and I

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.719 
limb technician so I've come here and I
also<00:02:06.240> now<00:02:06.540> do<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.930> lot<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.170> orthotics<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:07.979> my

specialist is

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.720 
specialist is
of<00:02:10.360> inflation<00:02:11.110> but<00:02:11.320> there<00:02:11.500> was<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.620> big<00:02:11.950> career
