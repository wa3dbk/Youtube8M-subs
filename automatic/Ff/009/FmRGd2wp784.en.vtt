00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
and get out play fast I thought we

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.600 
and get out play fast I thought we

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
played a little too fast to be honest

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.270 
played a little too fast to be honest
looking<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:56.969> first

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
looking that first

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.710 
looking that first
you<00:01:57.580> know<00:01:57.670> we<00:01:57.760> just<00:01:57.909> we<00:01:58.090> really<00:01:58.119> got<00:01:58.510> out<00:01:58.690> I

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
you know we just we really got out I

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.620 
you know we just we really got out I
thought<00:01:59.049> took<00:01:59.229> some<00:01:59.440> out<00:01:59.530> of<00:01:59.560> character<00:01:59.950> shots

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
thought took some out of character shots

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.960 
thought took some out of character shots
you<00:02:01.630> know<00:02:01.750> my<00:02:01.869> second<00:02:02.229> half<00:02:02.350> just<00:02:02.880> told<00:02:03.880> our

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
you know my second half just told our

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.700 
you know my second half just told our
cars<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.270> quit<00:02:04.510> over<00:02:04.600> penetrate<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.470> know<00:02:05.560> we

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
cars to quit over penetrate you know we

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.010 
cars to quit over penetrate you know we
just<00:02:05.830> that<00:02:06.220> cost<00:02:06.670> us<00:02:06.880> in<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.540> first<00:02:07.750> 20

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
just that cost us in the first 20

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.270 
just that cost us in the first 20
minutes<00:02:08.050> we're<00:02:08.350> getting<00:02:08.590> there<00:02:08.709> too<00:02:08.860> deep<00:02:09.069> and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
minutes we're getting there too deep and

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.770 
minutes we're getting there too deep and
throttle<00:02:09.580> either<00:02:09.729> a<00:02:09.819> wild<00:02:10.119> shot<00:02:10.300> or<00:02:10.509> are<00:02:10.660> they

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
throttle either a wild shot or are they

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.180 
throttle either a wild shot or are they
were<00:02:10.869> get<00:02:11.020> their<00:02:11.140> hand<00:02:11.319> and<00:02:11.470> get<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.770> turnover

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
were get their hand and get the turnover

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.250 
were get their hand and get the turnover
so<00:02:13.180> second<00:02:13.480> half<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.720> thought<00:02:13.840> we<00:02:13.930> did<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:14.080> much

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
so second half I thought we did a much

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.390 
so second half I thought we did a much
better<00:02:14.290> job<00:02:14.560> taking<00:02:14.709> care<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.280> basketball

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
better job taking care of the basketball

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.670 
better job taking care of the basketball
and<00:02:15.880> then<00:02:16.420> once<00:02:16.600> we<00:02:16.720> did<00:02:16.870> get<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.080> rebound<00:02:17.470> you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
and then once we did get the rebound you

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.930 
and then once we did get the rebound you
know<00:02:17.770> where<00:02:17.890> spacing<00:02:18.280> was<00:02:18.340> outstanding<00:02:18.910> in

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
know where spacing was outstanding in

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.670 
know where spacing was outstanding in
the<00:02:19.030> second<00:02:19.330> half<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:20.200> know<00:02:20.319> getting<00:02:20.500> out

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
the second half and you know getting out
