00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.740 
the cool tax squares because they're
kind<00:01:39.220> they're<00:01:39.490> super<00:01:39.850> sticky<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.330> I<00:01:40.420> just<00:01:40.570> get

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
kind they're super sticky and I just get

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.660 
kind they're super sticky and I just get
and<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.290> I<00:01:41.320> end<00:01:41.680> up<00:01:41.770> getting<00:01:42.100> them<00:01:42.220> stuck<00:01:42.520> all

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
and the I end up getting them stuck all

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.640 
and the I end up getting them stuck all
over<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.940> place<00:01:43.120> so<00:01:43.330> I<00:01:43.510> just<00:01:44.050> took<00:01:44.200> some<00:01:44.410> glue

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
over the place so I just took some glue

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.620 
over the place so I just took some glue
dots<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.190> bald<00:01:45.400> those<00:01:45.700> up<00:01:45.940> rolled<00:01:46.240> them<00:01:46.390> up<00:01:46.480> in

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
dots and bald those up rolled them up in

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.300 
dots and bald those up rolled them up in
my<00:01:46.780> fingertips<00:01:47.320> and<00:01:47.500> then<00:01:47.770> put<00:01:47.980> them<00:01:48.070> in<00:01:48.130> the

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
my fingertips and then put them in the

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.950 
my fingertips and then put them in the
areas<00:01:48.610> of<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:48.790> die<00:01:49.000> that<00:01:49.150> were<00:01:49.270> more<00:01:49.420> delicate

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
areas of the die that were more delicate

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.730 
areas of the die that were more delicate
and<00:01:50.230> too<00:01:50.770> small<00:01:51.130> for<00:01:51.370> those<00:01:51.520> clear<00:01:52.740> square

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
and too small for those clear square

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.400 
and too small for those clear square
foams<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.510> then<00:01:55.510> I'm<00:01:55.840> going<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.020> take<00:01:56.170> some

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
foams and then I'm going to take some

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.080 
foams and then I'm going to take some
pattern<00:01:56.770> paper<00:01:56.980> this<00:01:57.220> is<00:01:57.370> from<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.610> heritage

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
pattern paper this is from the heritage

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.530 
pattern paper this is from the heritage
collection<00:01:58.690> by<00:01:58.840> project<00:01:59.380> life<00:02:00.220> and<00:02:00.760> I<00:02:01.510> just

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
collection by project life and I just

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.330 
collection by project life and I just
thought<00:02:01.810> this<00:02:02.050> pattern<00:02:02.440> paper<00:02:02.800> would<00:02:03.130> look

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
thought this pattern paper would look

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.130 
thought this pattern paper would look
really<00:02:03.640> pretty<00:02:03.940> and<00:02:04.090> help<00:02:04.330> set<00:02:04.630> off<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:05.020> whole

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
really pretty and help set off the whole

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.260 
really pretty and help set off the whole
design<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:05.770> I'll<00:02:05.860> just<00:02:05.920> trim<00:02:06.400> that<00:02:06.580> strip<00:02:07.060> off

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
design so I'll just trim that strip off

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.570 
design so I'll just trim that strip off
it's<00:02:07.810> going<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.110> be<00:02:08.200> flush<00:02:08.590> with<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.920> card<00:02:09.310> and

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
it's going to be flush with the card and

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.809 
it's going to be flush with the card and
then<00:02:10.149> I'm<00:02:10.270> going<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.479> run<00:02:10.630> a<00:02:10.690> bead<00:02:11.080> of<00:02:11.110> mono

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
then I'm going to run a bead of mono

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.080 
then I'm going to run a bead of mono
multi<00:02:12.819> glue

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
multi glue

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.420 
multi glue
to<00:02:14.300> adhere<00:02:14.870> more<00:02:15.050> strips<00:02:15.800> from<00:02:16.129> that

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
to adhere more strips from that

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.210 
to adhere more strips from that
collection<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.540> pattern<00:02:17.870> papers<00:02:18.319> I<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:18.860> love

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
collection of pattern papers I just love

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.729 
collection of pattern papers I just love
the<00:02:19.519> way<00:02:19.640> this<00:02:19.910> these<00:02:20.810> colors<00:02:21.080> look<00:02:21.349> together

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
the way this these colors look together

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.680 
the way this these colors look together
and<00:02:22.160> I<00:02:22.190> think<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.489> just<00:02:22.519> really<00:02:22.910> lends<00:02:23.330> itself

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
and I think it just really lends itself

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.500 
and I think it just really lends itself
very<00:02:23.810> well<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.620> whole<00:02:24.860> overall<00:02:25.790> effect<00:02:26.390> i
