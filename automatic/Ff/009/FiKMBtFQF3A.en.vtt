minecraft eat this one is going to be
relatively<00:00:06.839> small<00:00:07.230> because<00:00:07.620> there's<00:00:07.980> only

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
relatively small because there's only

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.339 
relatively small because there's only
one<00:00:08.550> desert<00:00:08.940> temple<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.599> that's<00:00:10.080> basically

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
one desert temple and that's basically

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.589 
one desert temple and that's basically
it<00:00:10.679> when<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.610> first<00:00:11.880> spawn<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.330> spawn

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
it when you first spawn you spawn

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.709 
it when you first spawn you spawn
actually<00:00:13.170> right<00:00:13.380> next<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.769> jungle<00:00:14.420> biome<00:00:15.420> as

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
actually right next to a jungle biome as

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.660 
actually right next to a jungle biome as
well<00:00:15.929> as<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:17.150> for<00:00:18.150> stockpile<00:00:18.960> anyways<00:00:19.890> this

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
well as a for stockpile anyways this

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.400 
well as a for stockpile anyways this
would<00:00:21.090> be<00:00:21.240> great<00:00:21.420> for<00:00:21.539> like<00:00:21.960> an<00:00:22.170> island

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
would be great for like an island

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.830 
would be great for like an island
survival<00:00:22.859> seed<00:00:23.699> or<00:00:23.970> whatever<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.420> guys<00:00:24.600> want
