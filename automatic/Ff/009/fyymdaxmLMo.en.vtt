 in other ways than it is 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.260
 giving much conflict mainly 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.000
 commodity group is not working 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.400
 right in version 1.1 18 at one point 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.300
 17 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:54.470
 good let's look here is 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:01.930
 weak labor or better work 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.930
 I got a quick one here where I am. 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:15.670

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:18.170
 bad faith gives not said holding with 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.900
 commented on the profile still with the truck 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.820
 employee but the trailers are 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.010
 operating separately 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.459
 this is possibly a burden that 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.250
 also have the right trailer then 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.459
