00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.160 
bottle comes with two dyes as it's kind
of<00:01:57.430> obvious<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:58.149> would<00:01:58.330> come<00:01:58.600> with<00:01:58.780> two<00:01:59.020> days

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
of obvious it would come with two days

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.980 
of obvious it would come with two days
but<00:01:59.799> one<00:02:00.009> of<00:02:00.070> them's<00:02:00.250> a<00:02:00.460> base<00:02:00.640> tune<00:02:00.939> so<00:02:01.509> they

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
but one of them's a base tune so they

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.469 
but one of them's a base tune so they
should<00:02:02.259> work<00:02:02.470> well<00:02:02.799> together<00:02:03.240> hopefully<00:02:04.240> and

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
should work well together hopefully and

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.870

the<00:02:04.930> other<00:02:05.049> is<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.289> complementing<00:02:06.070> turn<00:02:06.340> it

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
the other is a complementing turn it
