00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:17.699
 ah ah ah ea ea ro rob beauty is the motto 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.949
 All right, man, look, this is my side. 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.800
 It's the hobby robot winner of the contest 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.320
 cultural mediates ice and I mad scientist 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.430
 lemur looks only hobby road 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.099
 We are going to make an experiment today. 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.020
 very cool, and which is it? 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.739
 We are going to do a laser experiment. 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.780
 knows that the laser 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.360
 so tell me what's the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.059
 laser is the extra toy a is a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.250
 toy with strong cca that can not 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.079
 to boot exactly can not point 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.320
 in the eye because it can actually hurt 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.989
 so please people do not point the laser 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.120
 in other people's eyes can be 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.340
 first I would like to know how 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.070
 does the laser work the bridge here please 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.910
 It's only with this button hold that looks 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.920
 cool 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.809
 Look under the robot, I think we can 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.000
 make a very cool experience that 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.979
 think you point your laser here 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.770
 not see what happens 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.070
 everything is already seeing what is 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.049
 happening it's not, you can not see it 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.030
 But let's do the following I have here. 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.290
 on the table a little bit of such and I go 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.509
 put a little bit of such that we go 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.340
 see what will happen but for this I 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.390
 I will ask the production to decrease one 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.400
 little light 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.320
 I'm going to put some talc now and 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:35.250
 Let's see what happens. It could be the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:38.909
 3 1 and 2 and 3 is all looks nice now 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.530
 exactly mirrored robot when people 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.899
 puts a little here as 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.159
 when one focuses the light it here 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.490
 reflects 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.340
 but she's line is curve is straight is 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.110
 exactly the light hits here and back in the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.240
 sense of retina is true 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.700
 Look, I have an experiment one. 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.460
 scientific challenge to show and what is 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.890
 Look, I just want to know if there's a 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.810
 possibility for us to make the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.880
 light make a curve 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.910
 I think it's pointed at the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.009
 Mirror, let's try, let's go, I'll go 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.330
 put some talc and again 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.890
 Let's see what happens can be 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.350
 It's a little jig is making curves. 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.760
 not and continue straight 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.860
 photo ae is the only look at the globe 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.320
 This way it was not cool, it did not 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.390
 the curve that we wanted but I have 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.530
 here is something we can do 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.630
 with which the light makes curves and looks 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.790
 if you want to know what it is and want to do 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.580
 in your home to watch this experiment 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.830
 for materials 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.600
 I'm going to need a jar. 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.200
 transparent 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:54.070
 I also need a laser 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:58.030
 I'll need a little milk and 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.980
 Finally a wooden ruler now 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.860
 We have to set up our experiment. 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:11.830
 First we will put water. 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:13.240
 in our transparent pot and now I go 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.070
 need your help 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:20.410
 I'll ask you to put a 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:23.110
 a little milk in our water and 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.410
 Now we'll see if he makes the tub. 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.450
 you will point out that the laser and the laser 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.670
 have to leave the hole we made 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.530
 O here and safe and you can here people 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.290
 ask your father to your mother help you 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.489
 Okay , let's go, robot now. 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.930
 people are going to draw there 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:43.470
 the tape that is covering our 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.470
 13 to 12 and 13 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:55.389
 is really cool right is like the 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:57.159
 yes Marital experiment that did tub is yes 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:00.370
 truth do you know why carlos did 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:04.420
 curve because that's how it mirrored 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.299
 also reflects exactly why 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.590
 as in the mirror the light hits the water and goes 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.799
 to one side and the other and go there 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:16.090
 and here and pink is the very cool curve , right? 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:18.130
 this is also the principle of optical fiber 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.680
 are wires as it passes under the sea 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.190
 and carries very cool information and light 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.979
 huh 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:28.800
 and you can also do this at home is 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.800
 very channel o is the tchan
