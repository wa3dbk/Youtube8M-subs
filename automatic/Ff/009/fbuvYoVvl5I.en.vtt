hate<00:01:35.990> it<00:01:37.899> stand<00:01:38.899> the<00:01:39.079> black<00:01:39.289> dude<00:01:41.229> so<00:01:42.229> if<00:01:42.289> we

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
hate it stand the black dude so if we

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.559 
hate it stand the black dude so if we
lose<00:01:42.709> the<00:01:42.920> bottom<00:01:43.399> it<00:01:43.640> doesn't<00:01:44.060> really<00:01:44.209> matter

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
lose the bottom it doesn't really matter

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.899 
lose the bottom it doesn't really matter
what<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.530> mean<00:01:45.739> difference<00:01:46.099> between<00:01:46.729> I

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
what the mean difference between I

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.510 
what the mean difference between I
forget<00:01:48.849> so<00:01:49.849> it<00:01:50.630> would<00:01:50.959> be<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.200> good<00:01:51.380> idea<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:52.130> get

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
forget so it would be a good idea to get

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.569 
forget so it would be a good idea to get
it<00:01:56.110> see<00:01:57.110> and<00:01:57.349> don't<00:01:57.530> let<00:01:57.739> that<00:01:57.799> turn<00:01:58.250> touch
