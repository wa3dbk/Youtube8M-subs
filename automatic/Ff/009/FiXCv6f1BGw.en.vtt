read goran dragic because he's very

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.479 
read goran dragic because he's very
slippery<00:02:18.150> compromising<00:02:18.900> Manu<00:02:19.050> Ginobli<00:02:19.500> could

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
slippery compromising Manu Ginobli could

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.430 
slippery compromising Manu Ginobli could
be<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.880> next<00:02:21.030> Steve<00:02:21.300> Nash<00:02:21.540> but<00:02:22.200> he's<00:02:22.319> probably

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
be the next Steve Nash but he's probably

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.960 
be the next Steve Nash but he's probably
more<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.860> scorer<00:02:23.160> than<00:02:23.340> Steve<00:02:23.580> Nash<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:23.940> I

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
more of a scorer than Steve Nash so I

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.050 
more of a scorer than Steve Nash so I
guess<00:02:24.150> it's<00:02:24.330> not<00:02:24.420> really<00:02:25.010> Greg<00:02:26.010> Monroe<00:02:26.220> great

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
guess it's not really Greg Monroe great

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.690 
guess it's not really Greg Monroe great
center<00:02:27.420> great<00:02:27.840> passing<00:02:28.140> big<00:02:28.530> man<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.980> think

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
center great passing big man I think

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.920 
center great passing big man I think
it'd<00:02:29.790> be<00:02:29.819> really<00:02:29.880> fun<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.330> play<00:02:30.540> with<00:02:30.780> his

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
it'd be really fun to play with his

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.240 
it'd be really fun to play with his
passing<00:02:31.170> ability<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.860> then<00:02:31.950> his<00:02:32.040> mid-range

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
passing ability and then his mid-range

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.420 
passing ability and then his mid-range
game<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.230> his<00:02:34.230> post<00:02:34.500> up<00:02:34.709> game<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:34.920> think<00:02:35.069> I

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
game and his post up game I think I

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.130 
game and his post up game I think I
think<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.030> would<00:02:36.120> be<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.269> most<00:02:36.510> fun<00:02:36.810> young

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
think that would be the most fun young

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.440 
think that would be the most fun young
center<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.650> use<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.519> he's<00:02:38.730> an<00:02:38.880> option<00:02:39.209> if<00:02:39.360> you

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
center to use so he's an option if you

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.180 
center to use so he's an option if you
guys<00:02:39.569> want<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.810> see<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.959> big<00:02:40.170> man<00:02:40.349> and<00:02:41.099> then

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
Gordon Hayward he's a quick athletic

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.130 
Gordon Hayward he's a quick athletic
guard<00:02:44.040> he<00:02:44.730> can<00:02:44.910> shoot<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.239> ball<00:02:45.540> he's<00:02:46.080> a

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
guard he can shoot the ball he's a

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.660 
guard he can shoot the ball he's a
really<00:02:46.530> low<00:02:46.680> rated<00:02:47.010> player<00:02:47.250> but<00:02:47.549> he's

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
really low rated player but he's

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.150 
really low rated player but he's
underrated<00:02:48.330> in<00:02:48.569> my<00:02:48.720> opinion<00:02:49.019> he's<00:02:49.260> my<00:02:49.680> second

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
underrated in my opinion he's my second

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.100 
underrated in my opinion he's my second
favorite<00:02:50.459> player<00:02:50.640> in<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.880> league<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.870> that's

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
favorite player in the league so that's

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.600 
favorite player in the league so that's
why<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.290> put<00:02:52.620> him<00:02:52.709> on<00:02:52.830> this<00:02:52.950> list<00:02:53.280> because<00:02:53.580> I

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
why I put him on this list because I

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.670 
why I put him on this list because I
would<00:02:53.850> like<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.209> see<00:02:54.720> him<00:02:54.900> get<00:02:55.080> up<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.440> become

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
would like to see him get up and become

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.860 
would like to see him get up and become
the<00:02:55.709> next<00:02:56.010> Larry<00:02:56.160> Bird<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.670> think<00:02:57.569> that's<00:02:57.720> a

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
the next Larry Bird I think that's a

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.600 
the next Larry Bird I think that's a
possibility<00:02:58.049> for<00:02:58.620> him<00:02:58.769> that's<00:02:59.160> probably<00:02:59.459> how

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
possibility for him that's probably how

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.150 
possibility for him that's probably how
I<00:02:59.640> would<00:02:59.910> try<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.120> develop<00:03:00.840> him<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.860> that's<00:03:02.040> an

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
I would try to develop him so that's an

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.270 
I would try to develop him so that's an

dunks a lot of athletic plays a little

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.080 
dunks a lot of athletic plays a little
bit<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:15.959> shooting<00:03:16.349> but<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.250> do<00:03:17.340> like<00:03:17.609> him<00:03:17.850> he
