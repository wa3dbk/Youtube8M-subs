00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.670
 i 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.099
 hello how are my dear friends 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.289
 good as you saw at the beginning you know 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.180
 what is this video going to be about, I hope 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.480
 that is to your liking and good we are going to 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.480
 start 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.420
 the number 10 is for the Japanese monkey is 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.340
 the only monkey originating in the country of 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.890
 rising sun are in the 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.230
 northern mountains a very cold place that 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.120
 he has developed his intelligence 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.489
 group to look for water wells 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.260
 thermal and submerge in them and so 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.920
 get to stabilize its temperature 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.920
 bodily 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.130
 good in the ninth place we have the 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.710
 pig despite being considered one of 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.630
 the dirtiest species actually this 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.640
 way to clean themselves when wallowing in the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.250
 Mud removes parasites that lodge in 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.110
 his skin besides being the cleanest 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.300
 the farm animals is also the most 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.640
 smart since you can from the same 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.850
 way that dogs learn different 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.850
 lots 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500
 to 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.079
 in the eighth place we have our 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.720
 best friend our most precious pet 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.520
 for the most clear and it's the dog its 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.979
 closeness to humans have done 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.229
 a species that learns easily is 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.420
 able to learn not only tricks but also 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.399
 solve problems of bonding 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.170
 affective with their owner or their offspring and 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.170
 even respond to certain words 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.480
 at number 7 we have one of the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.090
 animals that I consider most beautiful and is 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.740
 the horse its main characteristic 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.810
 is to have a great capacity 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.030
 psychomotor can coordinate movements 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.190
 and can also solve problems 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.520
 develops affective bonds with his 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.520
 owner 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:41.480
 and 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.180
 in number 6 we have one of the birds 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.800
 that the city inhabits the body the most 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.510
 Although the birds are not 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.090
 cataloged as animals very 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.590
 smart this specific species 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.599
 has one of the biggest brains 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.269
 between the birds allowing it 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.190
 solve some problems it is known that 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.290
 they are good observers and they learn in 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.930
 where some other animals keep the 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.470
 food to later be able to steal ha ha 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.470
 ja poor 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.840
 look at who we have here in the fifth 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.750
 place 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.970
 sorry the elephants these mammals are 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.890
 famous for their good memory this is 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.050
 because they are actually able to 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.209
 remember many things like the grunt of 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.430
 100 individuals of your species have 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.470
 also a very special sense about 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.720
 of death what makes them aware 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.060
 of its own finitude is one of the few 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.510
 species capable of recognizing themselves before a 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.510
 mirror 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.590
 this is an animal that gives me a bit of 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.379
 disgust the octopus is the invertebrate animal 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.629
 smarter they start their learning 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.579
 from scratch since before they CeNARD 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.739
 the egg his parents have died so 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.540
 that all learning is done for their 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.360
 own account and it is not transmitted by 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.060
 generations your nervous system is very 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.159
 similar to human is able to solve 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.780
 problems and imitate other behaviors 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.780
 animals to avoid danger 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.470
 here at number 3 we have one of the 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.450
 more friendly animals the dolphin is a 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.310
 animal very close to man life in 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.470
 communities and have an organization 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.690
 complex social what explains how to 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.700
 through sounds has managed to establish 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.180
 a communication code of the 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.180
 species 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.189
 and the silver medal for the animal more 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.710
 smart is for the chimpanzee 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:05:00.080
 share 96% of human DNA 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.240
 they are able to boil themselves and walk in 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.789
 the hind legs by distances not very 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.949
 long their ability to solve 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:10.539
 problems is great and they also have a 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.539
 complex social structure 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.790
 but the gold trophy to the animal more 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.760
 intelligent only from behind the man 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.220
 is for the parrot despite having the 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.020
 brain the size of a walnut has a 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.690
 wide capacity to imitate the sounds 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.550
 of humans is able to recognize 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.220
 people and to learn words in 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.110
 various languages the best-known parrot 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.700
 was Ã¡lex that served to help the 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.550
 research work on this 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.740
 kind kind friends thanks for watching 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.330
