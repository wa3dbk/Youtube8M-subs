guess is going to show you how this
looks<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.720> based<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.140> pop<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> bottom<00:01:13.710> out<00:01:15.950> few

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
looks is based to pop the bottom out few

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.170 
looks is based to pop the bottom out few
slides<00:01:17.250> out<00:01:17.400> here<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.759> actually<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.090> to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
slides out here and you actually have to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.170 
slides out here and you actually have to
trim<00:01:18.450> around<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> edge<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.409> pop<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.070> open<00:01:20.180> it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
trim around the edge to pop it open it

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.789 
trim around the edge to pop it open it
basically<00:01:21.420> comes<00:01:21.630> open<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.170> undo<00:01:22.680> all
