is that it's mostly bug fixes and that

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.830 
is that it's mostly bug fixes and that
they<00:01:15.479> made<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.810> even<00:01:15.930> quicker<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:17.400> terms<00:01:17.670> of

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
they made it even quicker in in terms of

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.480 
they made it even quicker in in terms of
speed<00:01:19.580> because<00:01:20.580> from<00:01:20.729> what<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.330> see<00:01:21.479> here<00:01:21.689> I

question yeah yeah i mean the castillo
program<00:02:50.360> i<00:02:50.480> think<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.810> they<00:02:50.900> may<00:02:51.049> be

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
program i think that they may be

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.539 
program i think that they may be
inferred<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.560> little<00:02:51.769> bit<00:02:51.890> in<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:52.610> new<00:02:52.730> update

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
inferred a little bit in this new update

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.530 
inferred a little bit in this new update
maybe<00:02:55.660> hmm<00:02:56.829> interesting<00:02:57.829> I<00:02:58.250> think<00:02:59.180> they<00:02:59.269> might

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
maybe hmm interesting I think they might

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.330 
maybe hmm interesting I think they might
have<00:02:59.569> been<00:02:59.810> able<00:02:59.989> been<00:03:00.680> doing<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.160> a<00:03:01.220> little

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
have been able been doing that a little

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.460 
have been able been doing that a little
bit<00:03:01.519> but<00:03:01.730> they<00:03:01.849> I<00:03:02.060> still<00:03:02.510> feel<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:03.049> it<00:03:03.170> could

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
bit but they I still feel that it could

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:11.199 
bit but they I still feel that it could
be<00:03:03.500> way<00:03:04.040> better<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.670> mean<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.620> feel<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:10.209> it

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
be way better I mean I feel it that it

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.530 
be way better I mean I feel it that it
feels<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.540> little<00:03:11.720> bit<00:03:11.900> like<00:03:12.079> there<00:03:12.760> ya<00:03:13.760> go<00:03:13.790> from

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
feels a little bit like there ya go from

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.390 
feels a little bit like there ya go from
definitely<00:03:14.840> means<00:03:15.319> we<00:03:15.590> fix<00:03:15.829> our<00:03:15.980> think<00:03:16.220> though

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
definitely means we fix our think though

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.729 
definitely means we fix our think though
that<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.819> could<00:03:17.000> be<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.150> little<00:03:17.299> bit<00:03:17.420> better

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
that it could be a little bit better

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.340 
that it could be a little bit better
