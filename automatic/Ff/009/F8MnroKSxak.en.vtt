00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
so I'm doing it two times a week now and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.780 
so I'm doing it two times a week now and
I<00:00:37.020> actually<00:00:37.230> switched<00:00:37.770> clothes<00:00:38.280> script<00:00:38.610> which

I actually switched clothes script which
I<00:00:38.910> normally<00:00:38.969> used<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.570> do<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.809> my<00:00:39.930> shoulder<00:00:40.290> day

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
I normally used to do on my shoulder day

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.920 
I normally used to do on my shoulder day
I<00:00:40.710> move<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.910> chest<00:00:42.210> day<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:42.570> I'm<00:00:42.660> not

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
I move that to chest day but I'm not

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.450 
I move that to chest day but I'm not
going<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.410> doing<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.920> shoulder<00:00:44.370> day

going to be doing it on shoulder day

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.400 
going to be doing it on shoulder day
anymore<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.300> reasoning<00:00:45.719> behind<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.170> is

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
anymore the reasoning behind that is

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.950 
anymore the reasoning behind that is
because<00:00:46.680> i<00:00:46.770> believe<00:00:47.100> doing<00:00:47.640> incline<00:00:48.510> twice<00:00:48.930> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
because i believe doing incline twice a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.590 
because i believe doing incline twice a
week<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.500> going<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.800> benefit<00:00:50.250> me<00:00:50.399> more<00:00:50.700> towards

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
week is going to benefit me more towards

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600 
week is going to benefit me more towards
my<00:00:51.780> bench<00:00:52.110> press<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.649> my<00:00:52.949> shoulder<00:00:53.309> strength

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
my bench press in my shoulder strength

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.000 
my bench press in my shoulder strength
than<00:00:54.000> doing<00:00:54.329> close<00:00:54.600> grip<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.379> shoulder<00:00:55.829> day

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
than doing close grip on shoulder day

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.529 
than doing close grip on shoulder day
and<00:00:56.280> then<00:00:56.539> incline<00:00:57.539> once<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.260> chest<00:00:58.920> day<00:00:59.129> so<00:01:00.059> I

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
and then incline once on chest day so I

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.889
