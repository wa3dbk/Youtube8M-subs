 but you watch wait and wait 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.260
 then cutters measure with it and not 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.240
 then the ball calmly 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:54.370
 blocks and pick up 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.720
 Farsi them could keep oudenaarde 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.580
 from only to that buddha in it 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.140

 very red for blondel 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.670
 delivery still needs 35 minutes with a man 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.670
 less 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:38.990

 corner and that yields 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.630
 to 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.830
 go crazy and then some bag like 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:28.040
 real striker in the turn around past him 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.780

 have waasland-beaver fancy with the 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.860
 before his death 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:54.020
 a city is wet 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.349
 but second of two minutes before 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.349
 the end 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.849
 column okay 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.879
 don't go an ounce to better the book 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:11.400
 splash and can play soccer 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:13.789
 it that man whole that was apparently one 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.789
 benefit 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.169
 were sleeping in defense of 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.539
 parsi 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:25.430
 municipality and the input ago stijn 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:29.080
 smet throws himself against the ball and fired 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.080
 good goal 2 0 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.509
 end of the party 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.240
 a great win for Waasland-Beveren and 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:42.389
 sheet more and yet the interrogations ohl 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.889
 that 35 minutes because bear had on the field 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.349
 but still loses 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.250
 zoal 11 white watch it managed to 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:50.009
 to win 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.759
 waasland-beren oud-heverlee leuven 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.090
 final position 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:53.090
 twiddle 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.509
 the already playing football is 70 percent 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.770
 ears spelled of course you have the 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.600
 qualities and you need to be physically in 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.430
 are orderly but the mental aspect is 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.680
 certainly important when you see you already 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.330
 you make that rock art the dick 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.190
 yes then it starts running the minus 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.660
 the football in the think we all in all 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.370
 or do you earn hundreds that one anyway 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.000
 very heavy disappointment, I must say 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.100
 so i can feel up to the moment 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.910
 we eleven against eleven playing 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.310
 goods 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.780
 until they were given a red card 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.580
 we control the game well 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.470
 And yes then you run into a deadly one 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.600
 counter and there are still two zeros 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.660
 expensive and shameful result for before 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.520
 especially when you watch the match 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.760
 so we should never have 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.760
 to lose
