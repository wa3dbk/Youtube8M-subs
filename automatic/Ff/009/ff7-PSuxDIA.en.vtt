00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.990
 splinter cell blacklist marks around the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.450
 we always come to the fields of 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.900
 battle in a conflict that will decide the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.730
 future of the United States in charge of 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.279
 an elite group known as for 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.109
 action is for the hero to travel the world to 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.980
 order to stop the activities of a group 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.570
 terrorist known as vi engineer's 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.820
 In this video you can check our 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.550
 impressions of which is one of the main 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.550
 ubisoft launches in 2013 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.469
 black list marks a return to the roots 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.570
 stealth of the series opting for a rhythm 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.629
 different from conviction chapter 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.730
 although it is possible to leave 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.829
 shooting at everything that comes in front of you 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.320
 now the game allows you to pass 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.359
 unnoticed by the environments or if it is gay 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.660
 for dark corners while slaughtering 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.970
 enemies silently what else 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.830
 attention in Egypt is the fact that it 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.930
 allow you to change between 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.799
 different styles as 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.020
 missions 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.210
 thus silently integrating 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.730
 for a while to take out later 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.360
 a machine gun 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.790
 the opponent in a more direct way to the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.010
 end of each mission the game shows the 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.760
 analysis of the different types of action 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.520
 you did 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.680
 grouping them into the categories ghost center 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.500
 and soft that yields different 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.660
 amounts of money to the player as 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.670
 the game allows you to revisit each 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.500
 its infinite times 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.420
 this means that you can test the 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.880
 will have different ways of coping 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.880
 the obstacles that come your way 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.870
 another point that draws attention to black 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.100
 list are the customization options 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.960
 offered by the title 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.610
 in addition to being able to increase the 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.310
 plane serving as headquarters 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.410
 for sancha it is possible to invest in 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.790
 purchase of various equipment that 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.600
 improve the different characteristics 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.760
 from the hero 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.770
 this system is quite large 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.960
 allowing you to purchase items that go 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.300
 from boots to camouflage equipment 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.050
 and guedes used to distract or 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.150
 stun on friends when investing in buying 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.250
 options that combine 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.560
 the player can adapt the hero to the style 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.410
 game that suits you the most 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.410
 to make more fun adventure 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.410
 main 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.140
 splinter cell backlit quit almost 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.790
 the less traditional fully to 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.770
 concentrate all your options 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.970
 layoffs with others 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.250
 characters 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.110
 this not only makes you do not need 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.420
 more be inventing with dozens of 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.070
 complicated windows as it results in a 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.989
 more natural experience 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.770
 when accessing the multiplayer options 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.770
 of title 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.269
 as soon as the player fulfilled the mission 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.580
 initial phase can already be accessed 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.200
 secondary complement the narrative 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.940
 main game 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.860
 besides marking the return of the classic 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.750
 way parents versus max 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.849
 the game has a kind of module 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.430
 approach in which it is necessary to survive the 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:20.530
 several rounds of enemies that grow 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.530
 in difficulty as you progress 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.920
 there are also missions in which the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.660
 player takes on the role of agent sec 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.170
 brics that work similarly 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.269
 to single player missions in this case is 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.190
 need to have good communication with your 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.620
 since an error of any 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.880
 one of the participants may lose 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.880
 all its advancement 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.350
 9 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.080
 if it was released two years ago splinter 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.370
 cell backlit would be a game with a visual 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.680
 flashy 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.390
 however today the game seems 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.950
 simply dated 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.810
 even when running on a computer 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.850
 powerful 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.470
 This is especially evident in the 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.960
 scenarios that despite having 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.060
 high resolution textures are formed 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.650
 for a relatively low amount 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.630
 of polygons the same can be said of the 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.820
 characters that have lots of 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.130
 pretty low details 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.830
 The only exception to this rule is the 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.600
 fischer whose model I many 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.040
 the members of his squadron and the 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.040
 enemies that appear along the way 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.960
 although far from being a game 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.570
 ugly blacklist no surprise moments 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.950
 with your looks something that looks strange 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.110
 especially when you take in 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.900
 ubisoft has done with the 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.560
 satisfied 3 photo ae three at the end of 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.560
 2012 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.600
 regardless of the path you follow and 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.670
 intercel blacklist inevitably you 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.120
 have some frustration with intelligence 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.710
 artificial title 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.440
 unfortunately the game counts on enemies 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.060
 behave in a manner that 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.950
 random and it is not uncommon for 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.750
 that one of them will be able to see 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.030
 his character even when he is 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.160
 hidden 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.680
 moreover often opponents 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.690
 they can see and react 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.220
 even when they are out of the 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.590
 your field of vision 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.240
 on other occasions the soldiers 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.150
 enemies seem to completely ignore 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.840
 the shares of 100 fischer running out of 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.910
 reaction 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.890
 even when the surrounding characters are 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:36.870
 slaughtered as mosquitoes in one 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:38.730
 blacklisting mosquito net 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.710
 only a change in the aspect of the 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.210
 main character that seems to have 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.790
 rejuvenated in relation to the game 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.080
 as well as the presence of 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:50.550
 a new donor for the hero 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.860
 unfortunately more than the voice and without 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.200
 we have to deal with a character 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.990
 whose attitudes cause him to lose 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.450
 good dose of charisma 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.250
 instead of the ironic agent of the past 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.070
 we have to deal with a soldier who 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.380
 seems annoyed at all times 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.720
 although the performance of erick jhonson is 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.970
 that it is clear that it has not yet 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.040
 captured all the nuances that 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.000
 they made Fischer a character so 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.440
 interesting 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.440
 in previous chapters of the franchise 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.650
 incorporating some missing elements 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.510
 in his predecessor 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.060
 splinter cell black list is a game that 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.100
 should please all fans of the series 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.680
 at the same time as it stimulates action 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.110
 stealth who is not afraid to let 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.090
 you go to action and adopt a mode 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.460
 to act more directly 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.230
 no black list is not exactly 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.610
 a perfect game 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.470
 besides the title count on a 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.840
 artificial intelligence with quality 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:57.840
 inconsistent and visual display 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.550
 dated to different voiceover 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.780
 record heroes of the 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.970
 characteristics that made 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:06.980
 so charismatic character in the games 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.980
 previous franchise the buildings 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.390
 counting on a competent campaign and 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.340
 assorted multiplayer modes 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.470
 the title coexist with the mission to deliver 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.150
 an experience involving the player in 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.490
 every moment 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.210
 although the plot appeals to some 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.580
 cliches 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.920
 it is difficult not to be satisfied to see the 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.640
 the final credits of the title 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.860
 screen 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.180
 check the downside analysis of 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.180
 games and until the next
