00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.129
 they can engage the player by their 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.530
 style your touching story and 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.109
 exciting and in his own way somewhat 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.500
 how innovative to portray a war 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.960
 if the first world war 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.600
 war is something cruel and very hard something 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.760
 completely inhumane and ubisoft 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.010
 managed to rescue this in brave 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.650
 leaving aside the stereotype of 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.229
 war game where it all comes down to 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.750
 network shots without disease and maybe the point 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.560
 the strongest of the game the present humanity 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.450
 in history is your greatest triumph. 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.540
 scenarios consist of the vast majority of 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.790
 in trenches or sites devastated by 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.369
 war the soundtrack and the effects 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.049
 sounds are very good and combine 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.000
 perfectly with what's happening 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.400
 in these locations 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.960
 able to bring the player the moment 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.960
 of pure involvement 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.799
 the dollar 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.460
 inspired by facts and real letters 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.800
 shared during the war that for 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.930
 signal can be beautiful during the game on 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.450
 menu valente hearts is a game where 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.630
 We will solve puzzles for

 progress in narrative scenarios in 2d 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.070
 in which we have to overcome the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.370
 present obstacles 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.870
 the game does not have a level of difficulty 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.390
 on the contrary it arrives at 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.970

 explain what the player should do more 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.440
 This does not detract from the game or the 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:37.230
 makes it less captivating despite being a 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:39.840
 negative point when you first start 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.940

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.830
 some are stronger and more heroic 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.989
 but the combination of all is what brings the 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.989
 desired result history 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.530

 five hours for the player to
