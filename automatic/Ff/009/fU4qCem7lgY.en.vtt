00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.160 

but<00:02:39.310> in<00:02:39.760> terms<00:02:39.820> of<00:02:40.300> holding<00:02:40.780> my<00:02:40.900> brows<00:02:41.140> in

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
but in terms of holding my brows in

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.090 
but in terms of holding my brows in
place<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.920> really<00:02:42.310> does<00:02:42.520> I<00:02:43.320> mean<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.620> says<00:02:44.830> make

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
place it really does I mean it says make

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.160 
place it really does I mean it says make
braces<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:45.850> makes<00:02:46.060> brows<00:02:46.450> look<00:02:46.690> more<00:02:46.900> fuller

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
braces it makes brows look more fuller

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.070 
braces it makes brows look more fuller
and<00:02:47.560> thicker<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:48.760> doesn't<00:02:49.060> do<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.660> in<00:02:49.960> my

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
and thicker it doesn't do that and in my

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.660 
and thicker it doesn't do that and in my
case<00:02:50.140> I'm<00:02:50.470> actually<00:02:50.620> glad<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.160> doesn't<00:02:51.370> do

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
case I'm actually glad it doesn't do

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.690 
case I'm actually glad it doesn't do
that<00:02:51.850> because<00:02:52.120> my<00:02:52.330> browser<00:02:52.630> too<00:02:52.930> thick<00:02:53.230> anyway

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
that because my browser too thick anyway
