00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.619
 to perform the last test of 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.470
 classification and the best 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.790
 specialists in synchronized swimming 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.680

 Last places available this summer 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.390

 hope of being able to fulfill his dream 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.059
 olympic with Great Britain already classified 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.400
 as an organizing country the big disappointment 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.770
 was the absence of the local team for a 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.780
 injury but the public was equally 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.239
 excited about the show offered 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.949
 as the Russian team and 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.629
 couples for whom they were already 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.040
 classified and those who expected 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.830
 be it this test was the opportunity 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.910
 perfect to test the atmosphere of 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.190
 center 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.870
 it's great to be able to swim in this pool 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.030
 before the games you can already notice 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.100
 certain olympic flavor here is a 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.100
 Great experience to be able to taste the arts 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.980
 one of the surprises of this summer 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.570
 it could be japan chisa kobayasi and 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.670
 takai maricos put things 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.240
 difficult to favorite with this great 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.380
 exercise that would give them 184 points and the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.380
 fourth final position 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.510
 another country that could give the 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.310
 surprise in the games is ukraine though 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.800
 has always been in the shadow of 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.330
 Russian the Ukrainian gave samples 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.340
 enough that in London they could 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.470
 be in the head group with this 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.550
 exercise would give iushko and ksenya 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.660
 sydorenko totaled 184 points what they 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.660
 gave the bronze medal 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.190
 a great performance that leaves the team 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.590
 Ukrainian with very good prospects 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.210
 for london although they are very conscious 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.610
 of the absence of the Chinese and the 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.610
 continuous dominance of its Russian neighbors 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.099
 we have waited a long time for this 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.140
 we have waited all morning until the 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.489
 late and now we are very happy with 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.489
 the result very happy 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.010
 but in this competition there was much more 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.110
 in game that some medals the couple 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.020
 Brazilian formed by naiara the law of 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.760
 figueira and lara teixeira public not only 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.590
 aimed at the Olympic Games 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.890
 this summer but also the next 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.630
 in rio de janeiro in 2016 here they could 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.700
 get an idea of â€‹â€‹what it means 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.930
 competing in houses is amazing to see 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.240
 all these people cheering the 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.310
 British we hope to get that 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.310
 also in brazil in 2016 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.590
 for the others this was his last 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.440
 opportunity to participate in games 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.050
 Olympic this summer 165 points 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.520
 were enough for the Swiss others 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.530
 teams that also celebrated the 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.700
 classification for london were israel 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.700
 austria and hungary 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.360
 it was a great experience and never the 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.940
 I will forget 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.940
 that was step for the next competition 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.910
 the objective of the Spanish couple 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.670
 formed by ona carbonell and andrea 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.470
 sources was much more ambitious put 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.390
 that many people point them out as 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.860
 favorites to get gold 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.290
 the Spanish made a magnificent 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.210
 exercise again making clear the 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.400
 great level of the Spanish synchronized to 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.770
 despite the absence of the Chinese with 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.750
 193 points won the medal 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.760
 silver but they were again overcome 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.840
 for the Russians that will be your biggest threat 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.840
 in london-2012 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.150
 Natalia Ischenko and Svetlana Romashina 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.900
 they made a magnificent exhibition and 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.820
 added 195 points with this routine and 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.820
 they did so with the gold medal 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.280
 we are very happy with the result 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.900

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.960
 what we do not know what we have 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.729
 to improve but we are happy 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.919
 with the last Olympic places already 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.479

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.430
 train with an eye on the 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.020
 future in which it will be an exciting 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.630
 competition this coming August 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.310
 in this fantastic pool judging by 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.229
 seen here the Russians will be the 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.449
 great favorites while Chinese and 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:51.039
 Spanish companies also enter into all 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.039
