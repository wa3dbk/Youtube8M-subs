the day of Iraq now 200 easy hits labor
for<00:00:15.140> Tom<00:00:15.440> Hall<00:00:15.650> construction<00:00:16.160> to<00:00:16.280> in<00:00:16.400> Dublin

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
for Tom Hall construction to in Dublin

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.690 
for Tom Hall construction to in Dublin
there<00:00:17.390> was<00:00:17.600> 52<00:00:18.110> meters<00:00:18.380> of<00:00:18.560> tower<00:00:19.100> and<00:00:19.400> then

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
there was 52 meters of tower and then

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.790 
there was 52 meters of tower and then
the<00:00:19.850> kippah<00:00:20.150> cabin<00:00:20.570> airframe<00:00:20.960> so<00:00:21.200> there<00:00:21.650> have

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
the kippah cabin airframe so there have

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.249 
the kippah cabin airframe so there have
a<00:00:21.830> hook<00:00:22.010> a<00:00:22.130> 256<00:00:22.790> meters<00:00:25.540> there<00:00:26.540> be<00:00:26.810> a<00:00:26.840> section

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
a hook a 256 meters there be a section

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.980 
a hook a 256 meters there be a section
of<00:00:27.349> 16<00:00:27.710> bolts<00:00:28.119> for<00:00:29.119> you<00:00:29.210> on<00:00:29.360> your<00:00:29.390> first<00:00:29.689> change

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
of 16 bolts for you on your first change

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.710 
of 16 bolts for you on your first change
so<00:00:30.230> easily<00:00:30.640> today<00:00:31.640> that<00:00:31.910> taught<00:00:32.090> us<00:00:32.119> about<00:00:32.360> 25

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
so easily today that taught us about 25

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.270 
so easily today that taught us about 25
members<00:00:33.020> to<00:00:33.290> tighten<00:00:33.590> all<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:33.739> bolts<00:00:33.980> to

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
members to tighten all the bolts to

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.940 
members to tighten all the bolts to
track<00:00:34.790> torque<00:00:35.120> he's<00:00:35.570> not<00:00:35.810> evil<00:00:36.350> torque<00:00:36.620> tool

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
track torque he's not evil torque tool

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.850 
track torque he's not evil torque tool
usually<00:00:37.910> you're<00:00:38.300> talking<00:00:38.660> maybe<00:00:38.900> an<00:00:39.350> hour

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
usually you're talking maybe an hour

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.430 
usually you're talking maybe an hour
maybe<00:00:40.190> an<00:00:40.760> hour<00:00:40.880> and<00:00:40.940> 10<00:00:41.270> using<00:00:42.020> the<00:00:42.170> normal

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
maybe an hour and 10 using the normal

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.220 
maybe an hour and 10 using the normal
hydraulic<00:00:43.390> multiplier<00:00:44.390> with<00:00:44.600> a<00:00:44.630> pump<00:00:44.930> on<00:00:45.110> the

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
hydraulic multiplier with a pump on the

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.860 
hydraulic multiplier with a pump on the
on<00:00:45.380> the<00:00:45.680> head<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.700> it's<00:00:46.850> a<00:00:46.910> very<00:00:47.120> easy<00:00:47.180> tool<00:00:47.840> to

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
on the head so it's a very easy tool to

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.410 
on the head so it's a very easy tool to
use<00:00:48.080> the<00:00:48.530> Eva<00:00:48.770> toxics<00:00:49.190> tells<00:00:49.460> us<00:00:49.640> is<00:00:50.090> when<00:00:50.330> they

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
use the Eva toxics tells us is when they

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.360 
use the Eva toxics tells us is when they
reach<00:00:50.630> their<00:00:50.810> talk<00:00:51.080> there's<00:00:51.770> a<00:00:51.860> tick<00:00:52.040> similar

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
reach their talk there's a tick similar

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.830 
reach their talk there's a tick similar
comes<00:00:52.550> up<00:00:52.700> in<00:00:52.820> a<00:00:52.910> very<00:00:53.150> physical<00:00:53.510> screen

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
comes up in a very physical screen

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.990 
comes up in a very physical screen
there's<00:00:54.530> no<00:00:54.620> vibration<00:00:54.860> from<00:00:55.280> this<00:00:55.430> tool<00:00:55.640> it's

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
there's no vibration from this tool it's

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.719 
there's no vibration from this tool it's
very<00:00:56.540> quite<00:00:56.780> tool<00:00:56.990> to<00:00:57.170> use<00:00:57.320> also

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.820 

plus<00:01:05.479> it's<00:01:05.690> probably<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.140> best<00:01:06.260> gearbox<00:01:06.710> you

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
plus it's probably the best gearbox you

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.830 
plus it's probably the best gearbox you
can<00:01:06.950> get<00:01:07.100> out<00:01:07.250> there<00:01:07.550> it's<00:01:07.790> occurs<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:08.630> it's

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
can get out there it's occurs and it's

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.330 
can get out there it's occurs and it's
calibrated<00:01:09.440> before<00:01:09.500> leaves<00:01:09.950> know<00:01:10.130> of<00:01:10.220> our

thousand nine hundred Newton meters but

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.260 
thousand nine hundred Newton meters but
one<00:01:21.890> advantage<00:01:22.009> is<00:01:22.400> you<00:01:22.430> can<00:01:22.550> carry<00:01:22.910> the<00:01:23.030> evil

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
one advantage is you can carry the evil

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.880 
one advantage is you can carry the evil
torque<00:01:23.479> from<00:01:23.600> joint<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:23.990> joint<00:01:24.020> rather<00:01:24.680> than

torque from joint to joint rather than

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.290 
torque from joint to joint rather than
having<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.250> get<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:25.610> cream<00:01:25.850> two<00:01:26.090> left

hydraulic<00:01:26.780> multiplier<00:01:27.229> up<00:01:27.380> its<00:01:27.710> joint<00:01:28.009> so

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
hydraulic multiplier up its joint so

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.219 
hydraulic multiplier up its joint so
it's<00:01:28.550> also<00:01:28.880> freeing<00:01:29.360> up<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.509> mulberry<00:01:29.750> Korean

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
it's also freeing up the mulberry Korean

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.710 
it's also freeing up the mulberry Korean
it<00:01:31.190> means<00:01:31.400> that<00:01:31.580> two<00:01:31.729> men<00:01:31.940> can<00:01:32.180> work<00:01:32.300> away<00:01:32.450> on

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
it means that two men can work away on

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.800 
it means that two men can work away on
the<00:01:33.590> guitar<00:01:33.770> and<00:01:34.250> torque<00:01:34.820> up<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.119> tower<00:01:35.330> way

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
the guitar and torque up the tower way

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.450 
the guitar and torque up the tower way
it's<00:01:35.990> not<00:01:36.140> holding<00:01:36.380> up<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.710> mobile<00:01:36.979> leaving

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
it's not holding up the mobile leaving

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.279 
it's not holding up the mobile leaving
it<00:01:37.550> free<00:01:37.640> to<00:01:37.729> do<00:01:37.850> other<00:01:37.880> stuff<00:01:41.080> yeah<00:01:42.080> we'd

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
it free to do other stuff yeah we'd

it free to do other stuff yeah we'd
recommend<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.830> evil<00:01:43.070> tool<00:01:43.250> for<00:01:43.580> doing<00:01:43.759> our

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
recommend the evil tool for doing our

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.320 
recommend the evil tool for doing our
job

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
job

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.900 
job
I'd<00:01:44.390> say<00:01:44.600> it's<00:01:45.229> handy<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.680> use<00:01:45.710> it<00:01:46.250> seems<00:01:46.610> to

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
I'd say it's handy to use it seems to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.650 
I'd say it's handy to use it seems to
speed<00:01:47.240> up<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.539> job<00:01:48.310> seems<00:01:49.310> reliable<00:01:49.580> so<00:01:50.390> at

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
speed up the job seems reliable so at

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.660 
speed up the job seems reliable so at
the<00:01:50.780> moment<00:01:50.929> we're<00:01:51.530> happy<00:01:51.830> enough<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.610> the
