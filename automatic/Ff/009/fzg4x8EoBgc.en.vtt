00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
don't really see the point of them I

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.679 
don't really see the point of them I
have<00:00:20.460> lots<00:00:20.759> of<00:00:20.910> spare<00:00:21.179> batteries<00:00:21.509> for<00:00:21.660> my

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.620 
now the reason i haven't got a backpack
is<00:00:28.589> it<00:00:28.829> does<00:00:29.159> add<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.460> fair<00:00:29.909> bit<00:00:29.999> of<00:00:30.060> bulk<00:00:30.359> i<00:00:30.480> have

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
is it does add a fair bit of bulk i have

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.610 
is it does add a fair bit of bulk i have
an<00:00:30.749> LCD<00:00:30.960> screen<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.210> if<00:00:33.210> i<00:00:36.050> if<00:00:37.050> i<00:00:37.170> show<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.380> this

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
an LCD screen so if i if i show you this

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.710 
an LCD screen so if i if i show you this
one<00:00:37.830> you<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.010> see<00:00:38.160> how<00:00:38.670> much<00:00:38.850> bigger<00:00:39.150> the<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
one you can see how much bigger the the

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.510 
one you can see how much bigger the the
LCD<00:00:40.440> screen<00:00:40.680> makes<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.010> back<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.310> the<00:00:41.370> camera

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
LCD screen makes the back of the camera

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.880 
LCD screen makes the back of the camera
now<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.300> battery<00:00:42.690> bacpac<00:00:43.140> i<00:00:43.260> believe<00:00:43.650> is

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
now the battery bacpac i believe is

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.620 
now the battery bacpac i believe is
exactly<00:00:44.490> the<00:00:44.640> same<00:00:44.910> size<00:00:45.420> as<00:00:45.900> the<00:00:46.200> LCD<00:00:46.920> BacPac

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
exactly the same size as the LCD BacPac

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.700 
exactly the same size as the LCD BacPac
don't<00:00:48.630> quote<00:00:48.840> me<00:00:48.990> on<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.140> if<00:00:49.350> someone<00:00:49.530> has

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
don't quote me on that if someone has

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.800 
don't quote me on that if someone has
both<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.280> them<00:00:50.400> can<00:00:50.580> they<00:00:50.610> please<00:00:50.970> boss<00:00:51.300> let<00:00:51.690> us

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810 
both of them can they please boss let us

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.480 
both of them can they please boss let us
give<00:00:52.350> us<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> comment<00:00:52.680> here<00:00:52.950> and<00:00:53.100> let<00:00:53.190> us<00:00:53.220> know

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
give us a comment here and let us know

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.760 
give us a comment here and let us know
but<00:00:54.240> I<00:00:54.420> believe<00:00:54.810> that<00:00:55.230> they<00:00:55.380> are<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.590> same

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
but I believe that they are the same

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.250 
but I believe that they are the same
size<00:00:55.950> and<00:00:56.250> because<00:00:56.790> of<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.970> I<00:00:57.270> have<00:00:57.720> not<00:00:57.870> seen

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
size and because of that I have not seen

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.620 
size and because of that I have not seen
the<00:00:58.350> point<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.860> picking<00:00:59.850> one<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.180> because<00:01:00.330> it

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
the point in picking one up because it

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.120 
the point in picking one up because it
doesn't<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.079> fair<00:01:01.260> bit<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.410> bulk<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.890> adds<00:01:02.040> a

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
doesn't a fair bit of bulk it adds a

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.620 
doesn't a fair bit of bulk it adds a
fair<00:01:02.340> bit<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.490> weight<00:01:02.700> you<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.240> can't<00:01:03.450> really

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
fair bit of weight you you can't really

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.390 
fair bit of weight you you can't really
see<00:01:03.810> the<00:01:03.840> weight<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.170> video<00:01:04.409> but<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.829> does

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
see the weight in the video but it does

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.020 
see the weight in the video but it does
add<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.610> fair<00:01:05.850> bit<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.000> weight<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:08.610> LCD

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
add a fair bit of weight and the LCD

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.090 
add a fair bit of weight and the LCD
screen<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.570> me<00:01:09.720> has<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> big<00:01:10.230> benefit<00:01:10.620> but<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
screen to me has a big benefit but the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.990 
screen to me has a big benefit but the
battery<00:01:11.370> bacpac<00:01:11.970> does<00:01:12.180> not<00:01:12.420> because<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:14.000> can

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
battery bacpac does not because I can

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.180 
battery bacpac does not because I can
change<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.300> battery<00:01:15.750> quite<00:01:16.200> quickly<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.860> take<00:01:17.159> a

they're raining it is a bit of
disadvantage<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:42.920> most<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.100> time<00:01:44.250> if<00:01:44.370> I'm

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
disadvantage but most of the time if I'm

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.240 
disadvantage but most of the time if I'm
skiing<00:01:44.970> one<00:01:45.869> battery<00:01:46.290> gets<00:01:46.740> me<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.040> lunch

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250

experience with my batteries I have not
had<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:57.360> reason<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.200> go<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.470> purchase<00:01:58.619> a

had a reason to go and purchase a

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.039 
had a reason to go and purchase a
battery<00:01:59.100> bacpac<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.000> did<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.570> would<00:02:00.780> be<00:02:00.869> more

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
battery bacpac if I did I would be more

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.260 
battery bacpac if I did I would be more
than<00:02:01.080> happy<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.500> go<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.740> get<00:02:01.830> one<00:02:01.979> but<00:02:02.280> for<00:02:03.150> me

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
than happy to go and get one but for me

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.420 
than happy to go and get one but for me
right<00:02:03.600> now<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.170> battery<00:02:04.500> bacpac<00:02:04.979> does<00:02:05.189> not

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
right now the battery bacpac does not

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.399 
right now the battery bacpac does not
seem<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.909> be<00:02:06.060> something<00:02:06.330> I<00:02:06.540> need<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.990> average

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
seem to be something I need the average

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.080 
seem to be something I need the average
battery<00:02:07.650> on<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> GoPro<00:02:08.039> i<00:02:08.250> think<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.759> good<00:02:08.909> for

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
battery on the GoPro i think is good for

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.089 
battery on the GoPro i think is good for
like<00:02:09.179> two<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.479> half<00:02:09.629> hours<00:02:09.929> which<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.860> more

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
like two and a half hours which is more

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.260 
like two and a half hours which is more
than<00:02:11.130> enough<00:02:11.370> shooting<00:02:11.550> time<00:02:11.790> especially<00:02:11.940> if

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
than enough shooting time especially if

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.640 
than enough shooting time especially if
you're<00:02:12.420> just<00:02:12.599> shooting<00:02:12.780> one<00:02:13.170> run<00:02:13.380> which<00:02:13.560> is

you're just shooting one run which is
about<00:02:13.770> eight<00:02:13.980> minutes<00:02:14.190> long<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.730> turn<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.000> off

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
about eight minutes long you turn it off

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.840 
about eight minutes long you turn it off
chair<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:16.680> up<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.830> top<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.340> stood<00:02:17.580> again

that the place I do see the battery pack
type<00:02:23.580> being<00:02:23.820> useful<00:02:24.000> would<00:02:24.270> be<00:02:24.390> if<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.540> were

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
type being useful would be if you were

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.780 
type being useful would be if you were
doing<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:25.110> longer<00:02:25.710> like<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.890> permanent<00:02:26.160> mount<00:02:26.490> or

period of time without disturbance and
something<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:34.830> would<00:02:35.160> be<00:02:35.190> a

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
something like that that would be a

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.430 
something like that that would be a
point<00:02:35.670> where<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.000> would<00:02:36.270> see<00:02:36.540> using<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.200> battery

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
point where I would see using a battery

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.860 
point where I would see using a battery
bacpac<00:02:37.830> but<00:02:38.040> for<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.730> average<00:02:38.880> user<00:02:39.300> of

bacpac but for the average user of
everyday<00:02:40.560> use<00:02:40.920> where<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.220> just<00:02:41.400> are<00:02:41.580> using<00:02:41.850> it

really like about and I've part about
Game<00:02:51.810> one<00:02:51.990> because<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:52.710> is<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.070> charging

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
Game one because of it is the charging

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.750 
Game one because of it is the charging
capabilities<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.980> with<00:02:55.980> six<00:02:56.250> batteries

capabilities of it with six batteries

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.790 
capabilities of it with six batteries
and<00:02:57.090> three<00:02:57.480> GoPros<00:02:57.900> it's<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.200> bit<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.560> pain<00:02:58.740> to

and three GoPros it's a bit of a pain to
charge<00:02:59.430> all<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.670> batteries<00:02:59.820> because<00:03:00.180> you

for<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.500> GoPro<00:03:10.890> batteries<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.370> think<00:03:11.850> I've

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
for the GoPro batteries I think I've

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.690 
for the GoPro batteries I think I've
seen<00:03:12.300> one<00:03:12.480> around<00:03:12.600> if<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.740> do<00:03:13.800> I'll<00:03:14.190> pick<00:03:14.430> one<00:03:14.580> up

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
seen one around if I do I'll pick one up

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.610 
seen one around if I do I'll pick one up
and<00:03:14.880> let<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.120> guys<00:03:15.240> know<00:03:15.420> how<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:15.690> works<00:03:15.900> that

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
and let you guys know how it works that

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.350 
and let you guys know how it works that
is<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.920> only<00:03:17.070> thing<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.670> do<00:03:17.760> finds<00:03:18.240> a

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
is the only thing that I do finds a

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.940 
is the only thing that I do finds a
disadvantage<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.020> switching<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.560> batteries

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
disadvantage to switching the batteries

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.949 
disadvantage to switching the batteries
in<00:03:20.130> doubt<00:03:20.850> instead<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.360> using<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.690> battery

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
in doubt instead of using a battery

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.260 
in doubt instead of using a battery
bacpac<00:03:22.380> but<00:03:22.530> apart<00:03:22.860> from<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:23.459> like<00:03:24.120> the

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
bacpac but apart from that I like the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.240 
bacpac but apart from that I like the
fact<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.630> camera<00:03:24.959> smaller<00:03:25.290> without<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:26.070> I

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
fact the camera smaller without it I

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.980 
fact the camera smaller without it I
like<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.610> fact<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.970> weighs<00:03:27.270> less<00:03:27.540> without<00:03:27.690> it

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
like the fact it weighs less without it

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.650 
like the fact it weighs less without it
so<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.950> me<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.400> haven't<00:03:30.000> seen<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.209> point<00:03:30.420> getting

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
so to me I haven't seen a point getting

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.570 
so to me I haven't seen a point getting
a<00:03:30.690> battery<00:03:30.900> bacpac<00:03:31.320> if<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.680> do<00:03:31.860> leave<00:03:32.340> me<00:03:32.520> a

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580
