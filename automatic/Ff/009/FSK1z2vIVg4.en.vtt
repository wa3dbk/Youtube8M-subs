Gwendoline<00:03:21.000> Christie<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.330> don't<00:03:21.480> think<00:03:21.630> also

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
Gwendoline Christie I don't think also

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.630 
Gwendoline Christie I don't think also
doesn't<00:03:22.200> get<00:03:22.290> enough<00:03:22.470> credit<00:03:22.500> for<00:03:23.220> being<00:03:23.370> you

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
doesn't get enough credit for being you

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.250 
doesn't get enough credit for being you
know<00:03:23.700> really<00:03:24.000> an<00:03:24.209> attractive<00:03:24.420> actress<00:03:25.110> you

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
know really an attractive actress you

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.070 
know really an attractive actress you
know<00:03:25.290> very<00:03:25.800> pretty<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:27.060> know<00:03:27.090> very<00:03:27.420> striking

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
know very pretty you know very striking

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.840 
know very pretty you know very striking
and<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.860> know<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:28.980> think<00:03:29.280> there<00:03:29.430> was<00:03:29.520> that<00:03:29.640> one

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
and you know I think there was that one

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.280 
and you know I think there was that one
scene<00:03:30.150> with<00:03:30.300> Jamie<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.750> course<00:03:30.989> in<00:03:31.170> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
scene with Jamie of course in the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.380 
scene with Jamie of course in the
bathtub<00:03:31.500> or<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.280> baths<00:03:32.520> whatever<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.209> call

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
bathtub or the baths whatever you call

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.590 
bathtub or the baths whatever you call
it

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
it

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.240 
it
that<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:34.200> think<00:03:34.380> was<00:03:34.500> supposed<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:34.890> try<00:03:35.130> and

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
that I think was supposed to try and

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.460 
that I think was supposed to try and
show<00:03:35.640> that<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.330> know<00:03:36.450> you<00:03:36.810> know<00:03:36.900> she

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
show that you you know you know she

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.990 
show that you you know you know she
didn't<00:03:37.650> have<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.770> physical<00:03:38.250> attractiveness<00:03:38.550> to

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
didn't have a physical attractiveness to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.400 
didn't have a physical attractiveness to
her<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.330> mean<00:03:39.660> they<00:03:39.720> kind<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:39.930> dropped<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.380> on

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
her I mean they kind of dropped that on

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.380 
her I mean they kind of dropped that on
the<00:03:40.650> show<00:03:40.830> so<00:03:41.310> Gwendoline<00:03:41.790> Christie<00:03:41.820> I<00:03:42.120> hope

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
the show so Gwendoline Christie I hope

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.120 
the show so Gwendoline Christie I hope
that<00:03:42.540> she<00:03:42.690> continues<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:43.110> show<00:03:43.350> how<00:03:43.500> diverse<00:03:43.680> a

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
that she continues to show how diverse a

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.490 
that she continues to show how diverse a
performer<00:03:44.640> she<00:03:44.820> is<00:03:44.880> with<00:03:45.450> this<00:03:45.600> opportunity

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
performer she is with this opportunity

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.590 
performer she is with this opportunity
but<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.220> looks<00:03:47.430> very<00:03:47.610> cool<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:48.060> we'll<00:03:48.180> see<00:03:48.330> how

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
but it looks very cool and we'll see how

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.110 
but it looks very cool and we'll see how
how<00:03:49.080> badass<00:03:49.350> her<00:03:49.680> character<00:03:50.130> really<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:50.910> but

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
how badass her character really is but

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.150 
how badass her character really is but
I'm<00:03:51.239> excited<00:03:51.450> for<00:03:51.600> Gwendoline<00:03:52.110> Christie<00:03:52.160> but

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
I'm excited for Gwendoline Christie but

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.680 
I'm excited for Gwendoline Christie but
I<00:03:53.190> think<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.640> we<00:03:54.060> want<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.270> see<00:03:54.390> her<00:03:54.510> move

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
I think that we want to see her move

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.180 
I think that we want to see her move
beyond<00:03:55.050> her<00:03:55.200> Game<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.410> Thrones<00:03:55.560> role<00:03:56.010> as

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.479 
beyond her Game of Thrones role as
Brienne<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.900> not<00:03:58.080> just<00:03:58.320> do<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.500> space<00:03:59.040> version

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
Brienne and not just do a space version

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.250
