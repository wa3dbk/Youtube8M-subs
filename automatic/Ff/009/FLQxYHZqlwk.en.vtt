00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
little spin at enmity which I think was

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.020 
little spin at enmity which I think was
a<00:01:36.990> good<00:01:37.680> 20<00:01:38.100> miles<00:01:38.250> an<00:01:38.400> hour<00:01:38.550> he<00:01:38.730> left<00:01:38.940> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
a good 20 miles an hour he left the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.140 
a good 20 miles an hour he left the
track<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:40.250> you<00:01:41.250> know<00:01:41.370> fast<00:01:41.760> enough<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
track so that you know fast enough to

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.940 
track so that you know fast enough to
get<00:01:42.270> his<00:01:42.360> attention<00:01:42.480> and<00:01:44.300> I<00:01:45.300> think<00:01:45.920> with<00:01:46.920> what

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
get his attention and I think with what

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.650 
get his attention and I think with what
he<00:01:47.280> was<00:01:47.310> able<00:01:47.550> to<00:01:47.700> do<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.240> wouldn't<00:01:48.570> be

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
he was able to do it so I wouldn't be

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.100 
he was able to do it so I wouldn't be
surprised<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:50.270> not<00:01:51.270> much<00:01:51.510> never<00:01:51.870> see<00:01:52.020> him

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
surprised if it's not much never see him

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.710 
surprised if it's not much never see him
