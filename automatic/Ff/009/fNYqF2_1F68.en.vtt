me coach and that's that's who I am but

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.440 
me coach and that's that's who I am but
this<00:00:11.040> was<00:00:11.219> done<00:00:11.400> during<00:00:11.580> his<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.090> chases

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
this was done during his and chases

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.390 
this was done during his and chases
stream<00:00:13.259> we're<00:00:13.410> trying<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.769> raise<00:00:13.889> funds<00:00:14.190> so

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
stream we're trying to raise funds so

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.860 
stream we're trying to raise funds so
they<00:00:14.730> could<00:00:14.880> both<00:00:14.969> go<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.360> revelations

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
they could both go to the revelations

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.939 
they could both go to the revelations
tournament<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.529> Los<00:00:16.800> Angeles<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.670> that's<00:00:18.390> cool

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
tournament in Los Angeles so that's cool

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.670 
tournament in Los Angeles so that's cool
and<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.340> there<00:00:20.609> was<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:21.619> approximately<00:00:22.619> a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
and so there was like approximately a

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.109 
and so there was like approximately a
hundred<00:00:22.800> people<00:00:23.070> watching<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.609> which<00:00:23.820> was

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
hundred people watching that which was

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.220 
hundred people watching that which was
kind<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.480> neat<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:26.180> here<00:00:27.180> he's<00:00:27.630> got<00:00:27.779> Abomasnow

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
kind of neat so here he's got Abomasnow

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.050 
kind of neat so here he's got Abomasnow
I've<00:00:28.439> got<00:00:28.680> Magnezone<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.490> know<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.849> Obama

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
I've got Magnezone I know that Obama

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.820 
I've got Magnezone I know that Obama
stones<00:00:30.330> like<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.630> be<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:30.990> mixie<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.619> stuff

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
stones like to be really mixie and stuff

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.850 
stones like to be really mixie and stuff
so<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.809> figured<00:00:33.809> if<00:00:33.930> he<00:00:34.050> wants<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> be<00:00:34.440> scarfed

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
so I figured if he wants to be scarfed

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.860 
so I figured if he wants to be scarfed
and<00:00:35.100> mixed<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.850> can<00:00:36.270> probably<00:00:36.540> live<00:00:36.750> in

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
and mixed I can probably live in

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.090 
and mixed I can probably live in
earthquake<00:00:36.989> which<00:00:37.320> actually<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.770> because<00:00:38.010> my

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
earthquake which actually do because my

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.119 
earthquake which actually do because my
max<00:00:38.430> HP<00:00:38.640> investment<00:00:39.350> in<00:00:40.350> fact<00:00:40.620> if<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.920> wasn't

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
max HP investment in fact if I wasn't

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.560 
max HP investment in fact if I wasn't
that<00:00:41.340> if<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.579> was<00:00:41.700> anything<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.059> max<00:00:42.270> HP<00:00:42.450> I

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
that if I was anything but max HP I

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.540 
that if I was anything but max HP I
probably<00:00:42.780> would<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.020> died<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.469> i<00:00:43.550> managed

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
probably would have died and i managed

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.889 
probably would have died and i managed
to<00:00:44.579> get<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> T<00:00:44.879> wave<00:00:45.030> off<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.480> I'm<00:00:45.600> expecting

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
to get a T wave off on it I'm expecting

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.990 
to get a T wave off on it I'm expecting
him<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.649> be<00:00:46.739> scarf<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.219> don't<00:00:47.399> know<00:00:47.489> why<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:47.730> I

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
him to be scarf I don't know why but I

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.209 
him to be scarf I don't know why but I
just<00:00:48.030> AM<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.960> I'm<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> fire<00:00:50.010> off<00:00:50.129> some

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
just AM so I'm going to fire off some

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.040 
just AM so I'm going to fire off some
t-bolts<00:00:50.579> because<00:00:50.760> i<00:00:50.850> don't<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.390> if<00:00:51.750> he's<00:00:51.870> not

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
t-bolts because i don't like if he's not

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.720 
t-bolts because i don't like if he's not
scarfed<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.590> don't<00:00:52.890> want<00:00:53.070> him<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.280> throw<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
scarfed I don't want him to throw it a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.400 
scarfed I don't want him to throw it a
blizzard<00:00:54.120> because<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> blizzard<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:54.899> probably

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
blizzard because a blizzard but probably

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.139 
blizzard because a blizzard but probably
kill<00:00:55.739> my<00:00:55.920> magnezone<00:00:56.309> at<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.520> point<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.940> don't

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
kill my magnezone at this point I don't

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.610 
kill my magnezone at this point I don't
want<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.510> throw<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.660> blizzard<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.289> me<00:00:58.440> go<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
want to throw a blizzard and me go to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.619 
want to throw a blizzard and me go to
gliscor<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.460> get<00:00:59.760> wrecked<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.539> would

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
gliscor and get wrecked so that would

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.599 
gliscor and get wrecked so that would
kind<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.840> suck<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:02.219> going<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.399> try<00:01:02.550> to

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
kind of suck so I'm going to try to

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.799 
kind of suck so I'm going to try to
avoid<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.879> situation<00:01:03.090> as<00:01:03.449> much<00:01:03.570> as<00:01:03.690> possible

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
avoid that situation as much as possible

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.479 
avoid that situation as much as possible
hit<00:01:04.470> him<00:01:04.559> with<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> couple<00:01:04.830> t-bolts<00:01:05.250> he<00:01:05.309> doesn't

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
hit him with a couple t-bolts he doesn't

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.750 
hit him with a couple t-bolts he doesn't
have<00:01:05.580> left<00:01:05.729> easy<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.060> I'm<00:01:06.180> late<00:01:06.360> for<00:01:06.890> sash<00:01:07.890> I'm

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
have left easy as I'm late for sash I'm

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.609 
have left easy as I'm late for sash I'm
assuming<00:01:09.720> scar<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:09.990> he<00:01:10.080> didn't<00:01:10.260> switch<00:01:10.439> any

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
assuming scar if he didn't switch any

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.859 
assuming scar if he didn't switch any
moves<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.909> think<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.570> safe<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> assume

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
moves so I think it's safe to assume

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.490 
moves so I think it's safe to assume

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.870 
it now he's got his own magnezone so I
know<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.650> no<00:01:31.950> other<00:01:32.100> steel<00:01:32.369> types<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.759> know

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
know and no other steel types so I know

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.730 
know and no other steel types so I know
that<00:01:32.970> my<00:01:33.210> mechanism<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:33.780> my<00:01:34.259> most<00:01:34.439> useless

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
that my mechanism was my most useless

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.560 
that my mechanism was my most useless
guy<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.280> that's<00:01:35.490> why<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.820> kinda<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.240> let<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.540> go

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
guy so that's why I kinda just let it go

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.929 
guy so that's why I kinda just let it go
super<00:01:37.200> easy<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.680> did<00:01:38.369> manage<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.610> take<00:01:38.729> out<00:01:38.880> a

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
super easy I did manage to take out a

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.450 
super easy I did manage to take out a
scarf<00:01:39.240> or<00:01:39.360> essentially<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.829> 55<00:01:41.220> game

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
scarf or essentially so it's a 55 game

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.969 
scarf or essentially so it's a 55 game
I'll<00:01:41.729> take<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:43.049> useless<00:01:43.380> magnezone<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
I'll take that my useless magnezone and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.280 
I'll take that my useless magnezone and
his<00:01:44.100> hail<00:01:44.310> inducer<00:01:44.700> I'll<00:01:44.820> take<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.170> know

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
his hail inducer I'll take it so I know

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.510 
his hail inducer I'll take it so I know
scissor<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> be<00:01:47.220> able<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.399> live

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.400 
against akele do so I feel safe enough
going<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.489> Haxorus<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:07.180> uh<00:03:07.209> I<00:03:07.600> decided<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.350> go

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
going to Haxorus that uh I decided to go

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.810 
going to Haxorus that uh I decided to go
for<00:03:08.530> a<00:03:08.590> plus<00:03:08.739> it's<00:03:08.920> kind<00:03:09.100> of<00:03:09.160> useless<00:03:09.310> anyway

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
for a plus it's kind of useless anyway

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.430 
for a plus it's kind of useless anyway
so<00:03:09.880> if<00:03:10.180> i<00:03:10.270> can<00:03:10.390> get<00:03:10.480> any<00:03:10.720> kills<00:03:10.989> with<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.320> it'd

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
so if i can get any kills with it it'd

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.990 
so if i can get any kills with it it'd
be<00:03:11.470> great<00:03:11.890> I'm<00:03:12.550> just<00:03:12.670> gonna<00:03:12.820> go<00:03:12.910> for

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
be great I'm just gonna go for

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.370 
be great I'm just gonna go for
earthquake<00:03:13.360> this<00:03:13.450> start<00:03:13.660> hoping<00:03:13.900> he<00:03:14.020> stays<00:03:14.050> in

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
earthquake this start hoping he stays in

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.780 
earthquake this start hoping he stays in
like<00:03:14.500> if<00:03:14.590> he<00:03:14.650> stays<00:03:14.830> in<00:03:14.980> that'd<00:03:15.100> be<00:03:15.190> great<00:03:15.489> but

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
like if he stays in that'd be great but

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.370 
like if he stays in that'd be great but
uh<00:03:15.850> if<00:03:16.299> he<00:03:16.450> doesn't<00:03:16.810> like<00:03:16.930> I'm<00:03:17.170> fully

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
uh if he doesn't like I'm fully

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.479 
uh if he doesn't like I'm fully
expecting<00:03:17.799> something<00:03:17.980> else<00:03:18.100> is<00:03:18.250> coming<00:03:18.430> I

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
expecting something else is coming I

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.910 
expecting something else is coming I
don't<00:03:18.640> think<00:03:18.970> he<00:03:19.120> had<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.239> levitator<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.930> his

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
don't think he had a levitator and his

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.070 
don't think he had a levitator and his
ruse<00:03:21.100> has<00:03:21.700> resistant<00:03:22.299> Abomasnow<00:03:22.810> it's<00:03:22.930> gone

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
ruse has resistant Abomasnow it's gone

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.050 
ruse has resistant Abomasnow it's gone
so<00:03:23.350> I'm<00:03:23.590> very<00:03:24.100> surprised<00:03:24.580> that<00:03:24.700> he<00:03:24.820> stayed<00:03:25.030> in

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
so I'm very surprised that he stayed in

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.699 
so I'm very surprised that he stayed in
for<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:25.870> earthquake<00:03:26.320> maybe<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.590> thought

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
for that earthquake maybe you thought

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.080 
for that earthquake maybe you thought
I'd<00:03:26.860> dragon<00:03:27.220> dance<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:27.640> then<00:03:27.700> he<00:03:27.760> could<00:03:28.000> to

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
I'd dragon dance and then he could to

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.539 
I'd dragon dance and then he could to
get<00:03:28.180> an<00:03:28.390> ice<00:03:28.480> beam<00:03:28.720> off<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.250> maybe<00:03:30.250> that's<00:03:30.430> why

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
get an ice beam off and maybe that's why

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.240 
get an ice beam off and maybe that's why
he<00:03:30.640> stayed<00:03:30.820> in<00:03:30.970> but<00:03:31.209> that's<00:03:32.170> really<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:33.220> only

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
he stayed in but that's really the only

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.030 
he stayed in but that's really the only
explanation<00:03:33.610> that<00:03:33.880> I<00:03:34.000> have<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.840> in<00:03:35.230> comes<00:03:35.410> the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
explanation that I have so in comes the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.800 
explanation that I have so in comes the
sizer<00:03:36.430> again<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.209> know<00:03:37.269> that<00:03:37.600> thing<00:03:37.780> that

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
sizer again and I know that thing that

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.180 
sizer again and I know that thing that
thing<00:03:38.080> wants<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.560> bullet<00:03:38.799> punch<00:03:38.950> i'm

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
thing wants the bullet punch i'm

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.000 
thing wants the bullet punch i'm
expecting<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.000> be<00:03:40.090> banded<00:03:40.510> be<00:03:41.470> easy<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.739> go<00:03:41.829> for

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
expecting to be banded be easy to go for

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.970 
expecting to be banded be easy to go for
you<00:03:42.070> turn<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.310> first<00:03:42.489> turn<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:43.799> him<00:03:44.799> going

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
you turn the first turn and him going

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.289 
you turn the first turn and him going
for<00:03:45.070> bullet<00:03:45.310> punt<00:03:45.459> there<00:03:45.610> yeah<00:03:45.820> that<00:03:46.000> damage

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
for bullet punt there yeah that damage

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.539 
for bullet punt there yeah that damage
tells<00:03:46.570> me<00:03:46.720> it's<00:03:46.870> definitely<00:03:47.500> banded<00:03:47.799> plus<00:03:48.190> the

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
tells me it's definitely banded plus the

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:49.860 
tells me it's definitely banded plus the
fact<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:48.790> he<00:03:48.880> just<00:03:49.060> flat-out<00:03:49.299> switches<00:03:49.720> this

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
fact that he just flat-out switches this

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.479 
fact that he just flat-out switches this
turn<00:03:50.019> rather<00:03:50.290> than<00:03:50.470> going<00:03:51.040> for<00:03:51.220> you<00:03:51.310> turn

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
turn rather than going for you turn

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.270 
turn rather than going for you turn
confirms<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.269> he's<00:03:52.420> banded<00:03:52.750> but<00:03:53.560> uh<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:54.040> just

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
confirms that he's banded but uh I just

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.710 
confirms that he's banded but uh I just
went<00:03:54.579> for<00:03:54.700> toxic<00:03:55.030> on<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.209> switch<00:03:55.420> because<00:03:55.600> I

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
went for toxic on the switch because I

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.539 
went for toxic on the switch because I
knew<00:03:55.900> he<00:03:56.079> was<00:03:56.650> pretty<00:03:56.920> sure<00:03:57.010> he'd<00:03:57.130> switch<00:03:57.340> like

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
knew he was pretty sure he'd switch like

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:58.800 
knew he was pretty sure he'd switch like
nobody<00:03:57.880> stays<00:03:58.060> into<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.360> size<00:03:58.510> organ

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
nobody stays into the size organ

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.120 
nobody stays into the size organ
cyclists<00:03:59.049> core<00:03:59.290> especially<00:03:59.650> what's<00:03:59.769> banded

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
cyclists core especially what's banded

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.850 
cyclists core especially what's banded
so<00:04:00.850> I<00:04:01.180> get<00:04:01.780> this<00:04:01.870> toxic<00:04:02.260> on<00:04:02.350> the<00:04:02.500> these

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
so I get this toxic on the these

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.780 
so I get this toxic on the these
Mamoswine<00:04:03.700> here<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.180> that's<00:04:04.900> actually<00:04:05.790> huge

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
Mamoswine here and that's actually huge

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.729 
Mamoswine here and that's actually huge
so<00:04:07.540> I'm<00:04:07.600> going<00:04:07.630> to<00:04:07.750> protect<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.170> first<00:04:08.380> turn<00:04:08.560> I

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
so I'm going to protect the first turn I

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:09.780 
so I'm going to protect the first turn I
don't<00:04:08.890> know<00:04:08.980> if<00:04:09.040> he's<00:04:09.130> going<00:04:09.220> to<00:04:09.310> be<00:04:09.370> banded<00:04:09.700> or

and stuff but uh I know what that is I

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.250

fighter<00:06:31.860> punch<00:06:32.070> is<00:06:32.190> going<00:06:32.430> to<00:06:32.520> kill<00:06:32.669> it<00:06:32.820> I

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540 
fighter punch is going to kill it I

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.330 
fighter punch is going to kill it I
could<00:06:33.930> run<00:06:34.020> for<00:06:34.200> overheat<00:06:34.530> but<00:06:34.710> I<00:06:34.890> decided<00:06:35.190> not

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
could run for overheat but I decided not

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.370 
could run for overheat but I decided not
to<00:06:35.460> risk<00:06:35.580> it<00:06:35.760> because<00:06:36.419> I<00:06:36.510> would<00:06:36.630> have<00:06:36.690> missed

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
to risk it because I would have missed

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.990 
to risk it because I would have missed
so<00:06:37.890> the<00:06:37.980> entire<00:06:38.190> match<00:06:38.460> comes<00:06:38.730> down<00:06:38.880> to

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
so the entire match comes down to

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.250 
so the entire match comes down to
whether<00:06:39.090> or<00:06:39.270> not<00:06:39.390> he<00:06:39.570> crits<00:06:39.810> me<00:06:39.930> with<00:06:40.020> bullet

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
whether or not he crits me with bullet

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.470 
whether or not he crits me with bullet
punch<00:06:40.380> here<00:06:40.650> in<00:06:41.340> frame<00:06:41.580> is<00:06:41.700> obviously<00:06:42.000> faster

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
punch here in frame is obviously faster

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.800 
punch here in frame is obviously faster
so<00:06:42.810> i<00:06:43.680> can't<00:06:44.190> go<00:06:44.310> for<00:06:44.460> anything<00:06:44.610> else<00:06:44.880> and<00:06:45.330> he's

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810 
so i can't go for anything else and he's

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.450 
so i can't go for anything else and he's
got<00:06:45.930> nothing<00:06:46.200> else<00:06:46.320> left<00:06:46.560> on<00:06:46.710> his<00:06:46.830> team<00:06:47.100> does
