little<00:00:19.949> rubber<00:00:20.189> thing<00:00:20.520> up<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.029> think<00:00:21.560> we're

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
little rubber thing up I think we're

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.550 
little rubber thing up I think we're
here<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.480> believe<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:25.109> made<00:00:25.350> out<00:00:25.529> of

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
here I believe that is just made out of

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.620 
here I believe that is just made out of
soft<00:00:25.859> rubber<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.849> believe<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.269> would<00:00:27.420> come

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
soft rubber and I believe it would come

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.390 
soft rubber and I believe it would come
off<00:00:27.840> if<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.199> heated<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.830> little<00:00:29.039> bit<00:00:29.220> it's

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
off if I heated it a little bit it's

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.830 
off if I heated it a little bit it's
probably<00:00:29.730> just<00:00:29.820> because<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.330> cold<00:00:30.630> that

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
probably just because it's so cold that

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.350 
probably just because it's so cold that
it's<00:00:31.050> kind<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.349> stuck<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.920> there<00:00:32.270> that's<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
it's kind of stuck on there that's the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.130 
it's kind of stuck on there that's the
only<00:00:33.510> thing<00:00:33.660> keeping<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:34.079> hub<00:00:34.410> coming<00:00:34.980> off<00:00:35.130> I

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
only thing keeping that hub coming off I

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.740 
only thing keeping that hub coming off I
could<00:00:37.140> cut<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.790> kind<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.879> ruin<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.329> get<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.600> off

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
could cut it kind of ruin it get it off

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.420
