going to kind of the wake up it's just
going<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.690> beat<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:41.360> so<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> things<00:00:42.629> like

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
going to beat it and so the things like

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.139 
going to beat it and so the things like
cyrix<00:00:43.050> can't<00:00:43.410> hurt<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.860> from<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.460> distance<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
cyrix can't hurt you from a distance and

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.360 
cyrix can't hurt you from a distance and
I<00:00:45.719> think<00:00:45.989> Helen<00:00:46.200> knows<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.739> think<00:00:47.100> it's

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
I think Helen knows that so I think it's

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.220 
I think Helen knows that so I think it's
gonna<00:00:47.460> even<00:00:48.420> address<00:00:48.510> any<00:00:48.960> signs<00:00:49.140> of

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
gonna even address any signs of

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.240 
gonna even address any signs of
aggression<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:49.920> spurts<00:00:50.129> of

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
aggression you can have spurts of

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.380 
aggression you can have spurts of
aggression<00:00:50.610> but<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.789> think<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.090> most<00:00:51.239> part

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
aggression but I think of most part

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.910 
aggression but I think of most part
machines<00:00:51.750> anyway<00:00:52.050> even<00:00:52.199> matchup<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.649> let's

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
machines anyway even matchup so let's

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.889 
machines anyway even matchup so let's
see<00:00:53.039> how<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.160> goes<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.640> many<00:00:54.539> but<00:00:54.690> yeah<00:00:54.780> I'm
