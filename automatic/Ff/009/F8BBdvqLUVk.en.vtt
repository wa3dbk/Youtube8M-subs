 led star he looked 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.930
 because all partners who participate and 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.050
 hope to make data sets available 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.570
 we that the hackers or developers do things 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.800
 will make that impossible otherwise 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.380
 have been 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.030
 so yes we hope that it will be whole 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.890

 that is precisely against itself 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.510
 quite often you should probably 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.070
 that again for our skippers 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.290

 its so hang out with you i like it 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.660
 quite a challenge to an application 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.890
 from nothing to do within 30 hours 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.890
 tall world in a bowl

 half past five 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.940
 what we have made is an application 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.700
 which allows someone to look after someone 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.250
 different and what to buy a package 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.439
 then at the airport 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.700
 deliver prices and that the package 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.500
 is very big they names so then know 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.240
 exactly for it and get an answer 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.429
 text the light and surprises in a row 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.429
