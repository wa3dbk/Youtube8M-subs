00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
thought it was going to be really bitter

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.140 
thought it was going to be really bitter
to<00:02:47.270> actually<00:02:47.870> go<00:02:48.650> with<00:02:49.100> how<00:02:49.280> strong<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.940> is

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150

would<00:04:11.420> prefer<00:04:11.600> good<00:04:12.200> but<00:04:12.860> again<00:04:12.950> it<00:04:13.280> might

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
would prefer good but again it might

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.530 
would prefer good but again it might
have<00:04:13.519> to<00:04:13.640> give<00:04:13.790> them<00:04:13.880> benefit<00:04:14.299> of<00:04:14.420> doubt

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
have to give them benefit of doubt

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.330 
have to give them benefit of doubt
because<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:14.989> might<00:04:15.110> be<00:04:15.320> an<00:04:15.410> old<00:04:15.590> bottle<00:04:15.950> I<00:04:16.220> mean

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
because it might be an old bottle I mean

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.819 
because it might be an old bottle I mean
it's<00:04:16.489> definitely<00:04:16.640> skunked<00:04:17.359> but<00:04:17.709> you<00:04:18.709> know

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
it's definitely skunked but you know

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.090 
it's definitely skunked but you know
that<00:04:19.130> might<00:04:19.250> have<00:04:19.370> affected<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.880> flavor

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
that might have affected the flavor

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.980 
that might have affected the flavor
aside<00:04:22.100> from<00:04:22.220> that<00:04:22.310> it's<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:22.880> it's<00:04:23.240> a<00:04:23.450> good<00:04:23.690> beer

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
aside from that it's a it's a good beer

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.409 
aside from that it's a it's a good beer
I<00:04:24.110> think<00:04:24.500> that<00:04:24.740> if<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:25.669> was<00:04:25.790> drinking<00:04:26.120> this<00:04:26.210> as

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
I think that if I was drinking this as

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.600 
I think that if I was drinking this as
fresh<00:04:26.780> as<00:04:27.020> you<00:04:27.169> guys<00:04:27.380> are<00:04:27.650> maybe<00:04:27.950> like<00:04:28.160> on<00:04:28.310> tap

fresh as you guys are maybe like on tap

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.020 
fresh as you guys are maybe like on tap

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
it'd probably be like amazing but I

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.540 
it'd probably be like amazing but I
think<00:04:32.270> as<00:04:32.390> of<00:04:32.720> like<00:04:33.080> this<00:04:33.380> surfing<00:04:33.979> right<00:04:34.220> here

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
think as of like this surfing right here

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.540 
think as of like this surfing right here
and<00:04:34.700> now<00:04:34.760> it's<00:04:35.270> like<00:04:35.540> a<00:04:35.570> six<00:04:36.440> you<00:04:37.220> know<00:04:37.340> it's

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
and now it's like a six you know it's

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.940 
and now it's like a six you know it's
okay<00:04:37.880> i<00:04:37.910> can<00:04:38.270> give<00:04:38.390> it<00:04:38.479> a<00:04:38.540> thumbs<00:04:38.780> up<00:04:38.990> but<00:04:39.289> it's

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
okay i can give it a thumbs up but it's
