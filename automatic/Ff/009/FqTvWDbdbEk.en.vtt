00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
the the spinning of the crown does

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.010 
the the spinning of the crown does
absolutely<00:02:41.810> nothing<00:02:42.250> which<00:02:43.270> would<00:02:44.270> make<00:02:44.810> you

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
absolutely nothing which would make you

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.690 
absolutely nothing which would make you
wonder<00:02:45.230> why<00:02:45.470> they<00:02:45.710> allow<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:45.980> crown<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.460> spin

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
wonder why they allow the crown to spin

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.990 
wonder why they allow the crown to spin

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
to begin with but I'm not sure why but

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.180 
to begin with but I'm not sure why but
it<00:02:53.000> does<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.960> it<00:02:54.260> does<00:02:54.530> absolutely<00:02:54.740> nothing

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
it does and it does absolutely nothing

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.760 
it does and it does absolutely nothing

actually will show time once you hit the
stop<00:03:58.780> so<00:03:59.780> in<00:04:00.020> this<00:04:00.170> case<00:04:01.150> it's<00:04:02.150> at<00:04:02.530> 25<00:04:03.530> seconds

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
stop so in this case it's at 25 seconds

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.190 
stop so in this case it's at 25 seconds
and<00:04:06.310> 25.5<00:04:07.310> 3<00:04:07.700> is<00:04:07.850> this<00:04:08.090> number<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.810> one<00:04:08.990> tenth

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
and 25.5 3 is this number the one tenth

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.070 
and 25.5 3 is this number the one tenth
is<00:04:09.350> out<00:04:09.470> of<00:04:09.560> 5<00:04:09.770> and<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.490> 1<00:04:10.670> 1<00:04:10.700> is<00:04:10.970> 100<00:04:11.420> set<00:04:11.720> of<00:04:11.840> 3

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
is out of 5 and the 1 1 is 100 set of 3

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.100 
is out of 5 and the 1 1 is 100 set of 3
so<00:04:12.320> it's<00:04:12.850> 25<00:04:13.850> point<00:04:14.209> five<00:04:14.510> three<00:04:14.690> seconds

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
so it's 25 point five three seconds

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.680 
so it's 25 point five three seconds
