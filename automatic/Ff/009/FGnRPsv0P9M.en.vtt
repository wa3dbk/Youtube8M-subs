00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hey people are watching is following a video 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.000
 full of irony and really bad 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.710
 joke it is again comments 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.840
 comments on time like some men 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.730
 asked in the comments to this Hadary 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.619
 I'm really back on one 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.119
 comments commented video why 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.369
 Do not you make one another again ? 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.710
 before the irony arrives one more 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.570
 small note from today begins my 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.119
 video week say it is there 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.710
 next video in two days so on the 15th 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.960
 who speaks the three sentences today 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.390
 Tuesday 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.309
 And that goes until the end of April so and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.110
 I hope you are up for it then 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.960
 I would say I leave me 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.620
 bombard comments and have a look 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.600
 how it all changes then until after 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:53.629
 The attack where I started 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:01:00.800
 skin to wear the pants I was 13 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:07.740
 and not everyone has exposed that 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:09.600
 Now almost everyone speaks to me 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.230
 from the soul brother you wanted one 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.660
 make angels or what I knew 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.090
 she did not even thank her 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.220
 you showed me because 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.830
 by Your comment is targeting a 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.380
 youtube and a few months for 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.260
 looks at their police and I love them 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.610
 So thank you very much for that but me 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.560
 she could not do it because she did 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.050
 did not know yet 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.050
 the site costs a fixed budget 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:57.540
 outgoing for really horny I am 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.770
 overwhelmed in the breaks compliments 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.080
 I am always happy to write 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.630
 over it and is always total 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.580
 Build up motivation and just so cool 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.470
 to give if the fair many 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.890
 compliments makes since'll help all 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.890
 red 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:36.120
 I have to say partly the focus 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.430
 really unbelievably bad set 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.510
 maybe rather natural and not 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.220
 placed 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.530
 in the commentary , I really do not have 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.690
 understood what the person meant by that 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.610
 So the focus is incredible 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.930
 set bad now meant the focus 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.700
 if I am before if I of course 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.310
 Blurred which goes behind because also 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.490
 I's or focal length lens 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.710
 settings camera lens wrong 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.350
 article used at the beginning 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.850
 but if you so says my themes 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.530
 then I do not understand that so if 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.420
 still like to write the video 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.120
 what are you with the bad focus 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.860
 I'm not that usually 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.470
 I'm always so I win too 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:19.180
 completely damaged 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:22.060
 it does not mean anything 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.070
 I know that myth does not mean tired 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.050
 I feel sorry for you when I introduce you 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.540
 but promise that just slips like that 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.070
 Out because I'm not such a robot 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.519
 I am human and people make mistakes 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:38.200
 and then I say myth or me 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:40.120
 say once I do not know cappuccinos 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.610

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:56.070
 example 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:04:01.090

 not convincing but hey it is 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.000
