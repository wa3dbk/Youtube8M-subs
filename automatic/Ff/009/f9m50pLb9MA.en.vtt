00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.330
 Hello everyone today I whistler Arseniy 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.759
 tell you about 11 numbered sneakers 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.919
 michael jordan 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:26.829
 sneakers with a retro note which means 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:29.169
 what is before you reissues and in this 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.570
 the case of 2014 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.879
 and then there is a low mark which 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.329
 means the height of the sneakers that is before 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.640
 you low version 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.280
 This is the most legendary model you can 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.770
 say even 1 basketball sneakers in 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.320
 which patent leather is used 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.700
 well, that's why many have loved them 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.400
 many people off the court 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.660
 I'd add that I already have enough 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.649
 enough informative and complete 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.260
 reviews 11 of them on the peace on the channel where i 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.769
 Of course, and talked about the designer 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.960
 tinker hatfield 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.229
 whom he inspired by 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.700
 creating this model and about various 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.360
 innovative and technological solutions 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.090
 those years that were introduced in this 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.939
 model so everyone can find 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.850
 this video is on the channel but by the way is not so 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:28.469
 far in all this tell the list 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.140
 so well, and in this video, I guess you 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.539
 just show these sneakers closer 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.049
 I focus your attention on used 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.789
 materials well, I think because of this 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.329
 video maybe someone will help 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:45.239
 decide on the purchase but although I think 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.509
 time you so watch this video you and so 

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:52.079
 you know that 11 concord is enough 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.270
 desired by many model so well and 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.789
 sneakers as you see steel below 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.030
 but also the logo and accordingly 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.939
 used high version in their 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.030
 the queue has moved and moved 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.970
 they are in the back of the sneaker I would even 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.690
 said that they were stuffed right there and 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.209
 personally, again, I think that this area 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.950
 because of this some kind has become 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.130
 saturated here you see now 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.920
 these small logos can be said well and 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.250
 I think it would be better if for example 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.850
 this is the smallest logo jab mono transferred 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.030
 on the tongue but by itself something like this 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:38.130
 here combat well how to say increased 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:41.010
 but designers as you can see they did everything 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.250
 as it is, then show you 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.620
 lacquered black leather which is like you 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.450
 see around here sneakers from all 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.980
 parties 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.920
 Well, it is possible to say this 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.330
 element of two kinda separate 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.800
 parts one strip of patent leather 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.160
 round this model from the heel 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.950
 then you see on the outside and here 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:10.200
 it ends in the middle and 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:12.300
 internal here is a shevchik that is how are you 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.340
 understood all this solid material on 2 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.240
 varnished piece is here 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.470
 from the heel to the middle here you see how 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.270
 time I am connecting the seams 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:29.760
 also used in these sneakers 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:31.530
 and ballistic net but about and about 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.090
 her in more detail as I said 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.400
 told the video before but I'll show you 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.890
 this material is also closer but already a hole 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:47.940
 string us sneakers also you are here 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.410
 see nylon such strips which 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.810
 first are the holes for the laces 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.050
 well and show you the tongue boundaries 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:03.180
 and you see that it is attached to the sides 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:08.590
 such straps inside this model still 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.690
 black insole with heel logo 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.500
 I'll show you ballistic one more time 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.500
 mesh closer 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.229
 now the sole 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.810
 white middle part ie midsole 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:26.229
 made of foam called 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.520
 Philo but inside by the way there too 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.680
 air tank 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.380
 he is here along the length of these sneakers 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.690
 which of course provides comfort and 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.030
 depreciation 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.540
 Now we move to the bottom of the sole here 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.150
 we are completely of such an ice color 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:47.250
 clear gel is present you see 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.450
 him under which else you observe 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.090
 carbon borders are visible 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.880
 plate it all prevents 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.530
 twisting them all for responsiveness 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.120
 Well, there is still a gel 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.710
 logo can be seen well, for another 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.440
 the sole can be seen such 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.680
 islands such elements of rubber by 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.210
 my purple they are well and drawing 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.229
 on these elements is represented as 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:18.580
 Christmas trees but from logos perhaps I once again 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:22.479
 I remind you the stripes on the tongue here and us 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.039
 which many do not know how to read but 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.530
 she really is very simple 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:30.639
 turn the sneaker on its side and here 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:33.940
 read jump maine here in the middle logo 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:36.340
 and then the words jordan that's enough all 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.940
 just about the rest of the logo I already 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.669
 mentioned and think you are without me by the way 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.010
 you know how desirable the desired 11 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.320
 numbered especially in such loved ones 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.800
 colors so if there is a possibility 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.800
