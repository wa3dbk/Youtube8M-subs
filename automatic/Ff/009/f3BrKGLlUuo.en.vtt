00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.680
 photographed 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.660
 in classical to her puts the clocks back to 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.129
 the time today and the big track 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.780
 did not scare him quite 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.860
 it's true that I was sure of my 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.030
 mare great track now it takes 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.650
 prove it and here today it was 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.570
 perfect by a lot better and more 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.559
 freely believe that this is the phase 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.050
 descendant who arrange it with his 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.120
 look then we'll tell everyone 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.620
 Netizens yesterday I meet you I got you 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.600
 said the filly like me how to go 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.589
 for tomorrow on jose not pronounce myself 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.530
 what were you doing 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.519
 not say precisely in relation to a 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.780
 classic ah no no it is taken 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.980
 So many signs when we are two 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.210
 or three with horses that are estimated 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.770
 better than others is that I 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.210
 did not want to be in the unknown 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.160
 I think she is able to do 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.960
 big track better than small track but 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.070
 I was not sure I did not want to say 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.530
 that we are never sure 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.210
 there she took the lead is what 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.960
 the best like that by practicing the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.280
 race in the lead 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.229
 at home I always work hidden 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.850
 to invite him but we do not feel a 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.590
 blazing progress aside fate of a 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.840
 back so in front of view the amplitude she 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.970
 take I think that to waste time the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.250
 descent this enemy took the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.850
 chronos it was voluntary for you to 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.560
 to leave very quickly 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.910
 yeah well that's what is done very 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.130
 easily so we lose yet dany 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.710
 scratch the same they do not know forced 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.420
 so for them it's easy they are they 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.030
 are in these ideas are in the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.960
 facilitate it has chic in more yeah 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.250
 maybe more beautiful than his sister 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.570
 stop late for her sister her cousin 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.159
 and and blondel 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.440
 she's a little stronger a little bit more 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.960
 old well following his program 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.280
 obviously we continue in them in 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.990
 semi classic but the goal 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.490
 priority is what with her despite 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.680
 that they stay calm enough because there 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.000
 in the end she is 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.580
 and tense one goes covered and semi classic 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.600
 then go go criteria like demont think about it 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.750
 in the trunks comes nothing so I think 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.360
 that I will have access to take care filippi 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.320

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.680
 annoying like that and we did not put any 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.060
 bush would have said I think I have some 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.130

 design it's a real small 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.960
 American flat track but what 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.430
 is that's fine what she 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.530

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.130
 is delighted quality of near curvature 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.270
 immediately it has not held a dress 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.800
 she is a real speed mare but 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.250
 she has little job too with three 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.470
 meter races 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.000
 wen is not a job but we feel and a 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.740
 greater speed than a fair 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.970
