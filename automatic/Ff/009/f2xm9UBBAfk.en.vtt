ojala<00:02:23.630> because<00:02:24.110> i<00:02:24.350> knew<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.370> there<00:02:25.730> was<00:02:25.910> a

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
ojala because i knew that there was a

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.750 
ojala because i knew that there was a
lot<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.690> people<00:02:27.050> out<00:02:27.320> there<00:02:27.680> who<00:02:27.980> would<00:02:28.130> like<00:02:28.490> a

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
lot of people out there who would like a

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.970 
lot of people out there who would like a
mind<00:02:29.060> cheese<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.840> who<00:02:30.260> would<00:02:30.470> still<00:02:30.710> like<00:02:30.950> a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
mind cheese and who would still like a

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.730 
mind cheese and who would still like a
rather<00:02:31.280> distinctive<00:02:31.970> farmhouse<00:02:32.510> cheese<00:02:32.780> so

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
rather distinctive farmhouse cheese so

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.160 
rather distinctive farmhouse cheese so
with<00:02:33.950> that<00:02:34.100> in<00:02:34.340> mind<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.910> saw<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.450> head<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:36.080> a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
with that in mind I saw the head of a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.860 
with that in mind I saw the head of a
French<00:02:36.500> expert<00:02:37.460> on<00:02:37.670> cheese<00:02:37.910> making<00:02:38.180> and

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
French expert on cheese making and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.570 
French expert on cheese making and
together<00:02:39.110> we<00:02:39.500> walked<00:02:39.800> on<00:02:39.980> guessing<00:02:40.490> a<00:02:40.550> tree

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
together we walked on guessing a tree

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.360 
together we walked on guessing a tree
that<00:02:40.790> would<00:02:41.210> be<00:02:41.330> truly<00:02:41.720> consistent<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.560> I

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
that would be truly consistent and I

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.340 
that would be truly consistent and I
think<00:02:43.760> we<00:02:43.940> have<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.150> pretty<00:02:44.420> good<00:02:44.570> trees<00:02:44.990> now<00:02:45.170> in

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
think we have a pretty good trees now in

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.290 
think we have a pretty good trees now in

has a very nice mild texture that

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.360 
has a very nice mild texture that
dissolves<00:03:08.990> very<00:03:09.080> well<00:03:09.500> in<00:03:09.680> your<00:03:09.830> ma<00:03:10.040> in<00:03:10.220> your

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
mouth mmm and you can see that it's the

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.550 
mouth mmm and you can see that it's the
same<00:03:13.760> texture<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:14.840> color<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.170> whole<00:03:15.380> way

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
same texture and color the whole way

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.780 
same texture and color the whole way
through<00:03:15.800> so<00:03:15.980> that's<00:03:16.130> obviously<00:03:16.250> from<00:03:16.640> when

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
through so that's obviously from when

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.090 
through so that's obviously from when
you're<00:03:16.910> turning<00:03:17.300> it<00:03:17.420> and<00:03:17.630> absolutely<00:03:18.380> the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
you're turning it and absolutely the

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.640 
you're turning it and absolutely the
color<00:03:19.310> goes<00:03:19.580> right<00:03:19.850> its<00:03:20.090> its<00:03:20.600> its<00:03:20.840> its<00:03:21.080> its<00:03:21.440> its

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
color goes right its its its its its its

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.510 
color goes right its its its its its its
natural<00:03:22.130> color<00:03:22.310> yeah<00:03:22.670> but<00:03:23.120> it<00:03:23.360> develops<00:03:23.840> that

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
natural color yeah but it develops that

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.590 
natural color yeah but it develops that
texture<00:03:25.520> and<00:03:25.730> it<00:03:25.790> develops<00:03:26.180> that<00:03:26.300> color

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
texture and it develops that color

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.300 
texture and it develops that color
purely<00:03:27.200> from<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.470> point<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:27.830> view<00:03:27.890> of<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.190> way

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
purely from the point of view of the way

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.360 
purely from the point of view of the way
it's<00:03:28.459> made<00:03:28.610> that<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:30.100> maturing<00:03:31.100> of<00:03:31.100> the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
it's made that the maturing of the

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.220 
it's made that the maturing of the
cheese<00:03:31.580> after<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:32.030> majority<00:03:32.420> rules<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:33.050> it's

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
cheese after the majority rules and it's

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.300 
cheese after the majority rules and it's
got<00:03:33.410> like<00:03:33.560> even<00:03:33.770> though<00:03:33.860> it's<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.130> know<00:03:34.160> it's

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
got like even though it's you know it's

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.100 
got like even though it's you know it's
a<00:03:34.820> soft<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:35.209> sort<00:03:35.390> of<00:03:35.420> just<00:03:35.510> melts<00:03:35.930> in<00:03:35.989> your

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
a soft it sort of just melts in your

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.410 
a soft it sort of just melts in your
mouth<00:03:36.170> really<00:03:36.620> like<00:03:36.830> creamy<00:03:37.700> texture<00:03:38.060> brain

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
mouth really like creamy texture brain

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.199 
mouth really like creamy texture brain
is<00:03:38.630> in<00:03:38.989> it<00:03:39.080> he's<00:03:39.230> a<00:03:39.260> very<00:03:39.650> very<00:03:39.950> very<00:03:40.340> nice

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
is in it he's a very very very nice

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.420 
is in it he's a very very very nice
after<00:03:41.900> flavor<00:03:42.140> it<00:03:42.500> does<00:03:42.739> i<00:03:42.920> could<00:03:43.070> just<00:03:43.160> like

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
after flavor it does i could just like

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.680 
after flavor it does i could just like
you<00:03:43.580> say<00:03:43.760> i<00:03:43.790> think<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.090> could<00:03:44.239> drop<00:03:44.360> it<00:03:44.540> into

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
you say i think you could drop it into

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.630 
you say i think you could drop it into
like<00:03:44.900> a<00:03:44.930> nice<00:03:45.140> Mornay<00:03:45.650> or<00:03:45.830> a<00:03:45.860> bechamel<00:03:46.400> sauce

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
like a nice Mornay or a bechamel sauce

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.190 
like a nice Mornay or a bechamel sauce
and<00:03:46.880> it<00:03:46.940> would<00:03:47.090> just<00:03:47.120> just<00:03:47.870> really

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
and it would just just really

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.050 
and it would just just really
full-bodied<00:03:48.830> very<00:03:49.130> very<00:03:49.370> nice<00:03:49.550> cheese<00:03:49.790> now

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
full-bodied very very nice cheese now
