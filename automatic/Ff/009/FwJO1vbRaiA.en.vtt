00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.420
 and the remains remain because it is the truth 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.640
 it was a very complicated tour but 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.160
 good if they learn a lot are careers in 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.779
 those that one goes came to make a good 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.240
 tour and at the end it came out a very tour 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.230
 very bad for me a tour let's say bad in 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.390
 the sense that it could not be done 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.640
 no good result but what 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.050
 important is that we end up in 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.850
 accidents for me is important 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.240
 finish a tour without a fall without anything 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.010
 and very important and good that is still 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.710
 make here from the pot new york now not 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.330
 is going to fall one here on this sheet 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.160
 but you have to get up if obviously 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.680
 obviously the most important thing is one 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.140
 be fine and keep working this is 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.270
 a sport is a job one has years 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.650
 good and bad years the most important thing is 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.750
 learn from the bad years and follow 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.550
 working is obviously alien to us as 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.800
 Colombian and ask him what of what 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.120
 that could live the whole country and yesterday 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.710
 the country was very expectant, so 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.559
 happened how to analyze it from nayra you 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.560
 from the good platoon I knew he was coming to 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.390
 make a good tour 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.750
 he was seen very very very well last 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.420
 days but very well already ten seconds 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.619
 because it's the second time and what else 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.960
 Glad my this to the amount of 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.880
 Colombians you see one every day that 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.280
 increases each time and it is the energy that 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.689
 they put him and so we get back or 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.049
 go ahead but they are always there 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.580
 that I want to thank all of you 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.970
 who were here those who followed us 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.159
 through in Colombia that amount of 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.610
 encourage that amount of nationalism that 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.040
 we have because really 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.750
 you live, you live a lot, yesterday your life in 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.600
 the art Thursday to 20 minutes of the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.510
 first take people with that with 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.080
 that passion really that motivates you 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.080
 much much 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:00.770
 and for the streets I still do not have 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.320
 some classic the other week in 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.880
 Spain and now look to see if it has already returned to 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.950
 Colombia rest a few days then the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.280
 world championship and some classic 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.280
 Canada 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.750
 even the other Colombian comrades 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.880
 there was no 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.230
 usually happens in sports so is life 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.240
 we tried several times and continue 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.550
 forward to use a leak but hey do not know 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.870
 could and continue to work and continue 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:32.620
 giving him 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.599
 we continue with these colors we do not know the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.209
 employer has not said anything you have to be 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.550
 here the boss has not done anything good and 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.819
 today that the packaging has to work 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.819
 much 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.370
 eye that today is a very complicated day already 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.720
 that already the second round already neutralized 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.489
 because today it can be very dangerous in 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.500
 Paris in the Elysian fields with that 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.040
 who we really say this is 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.020
 soaps or soap 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.760
 we have a great sprinter and so 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.760
 the idea is to go win the table with him
