take<00:00:38.710> a<00:00:38.739> look<00:00:38.950> at<00:00:39.040> the<00:00:39.100> actual<00:00:39.309> macro<00:00:39.730> and<00:00:39.880> then

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
take a look at the actual macro and then

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.240 
take a look at the actual macro and then
look<00:00:40.239> at<00:00:40.360> it<00:00:40.450> at<00:00:40.630> work<00:00:40.930> this<00:00:41.559> easy<00:00:41.770> macro<00:00:42.100> was

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
look at it at work this easy macro was

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.560 
look at it at work this easy macro was

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
actual one-shot macro as I applied on

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.450 
actual one-shot macro as I applied on
multiple<00:01:08.290> different<00:01:08.470> opponents<00:01:09.010> in<00:01:09.100> multiple

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
different situations and let's look at

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.570 
different situations and let's look at
the<00:01:11.110> bursts<00:01:11.320> that<00:01:11.440> I<00:01:11.530> can<00:01:11.680> achieve<00:01:11.770> symbol<00:01:12.490> of

the bursts that I can achieve symbol of

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.850 
the bursts that I can achieve symbol of
a<00:01:12.730> spamming<00:01:13.180> one<00:01:13.630> single<00:01:14.050> button<00:01:14.260> hopefully

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
a spamming one single button hopefully

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.020 
a spamming one single button hopefully
