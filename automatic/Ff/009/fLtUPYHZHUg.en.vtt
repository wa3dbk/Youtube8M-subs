00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.120
 it is at the same time elapsing as a chance for them today 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.100
 give your people 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.999
 with time the power 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:10.999
 play this kind of match 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:15.980
 so much so that it is difficult then what will serve this dream 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.470
 the action that was very stirring in the first half one of the few the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.890
 player 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.140
 be careful though 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.810
 the clearest opportunity 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.619
 the banking sector 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.220
 everywhere the same source 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.829
 the sun 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.519
 the relay of the fronts with the frosts patibular to cut down by autumn 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160
 the article in question 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.370
 valérie boned play on his site is the disappointment 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.370
 the record is similar 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.620
 a document is a document 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.370
 they respond to djakarta messages that send them from the game the biarrots that 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.370
 Pleased to do it right now with loud 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.130
 maurice sinet 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.680
 like google com 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.680
 the cross too much her shot 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.650
 the return of the deschamps league 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.650
 the freshness we see 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.880
 after a license rally with 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.880
 dublin - the needy 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.260
 with the help of his teammates jérôme thion 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.000
 Saracens 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.090
 actually separate them 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.580
 dimitri yashvili 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.210
 now it means 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.470
 easy to find who had felt the blow 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.150
 very experienced 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.400
 the second place is to relativize 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.440
 very difficult for the Irish 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.780
 more widely these laboratories 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.869
 why nothing seems to go for the better if the pierrots hurry 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.210
 because you never know 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.979
 for the most part the hostile policy on the Canadian uts 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.769
 it's very easy to 6-3 and 6-1 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.189
 that's still 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.559
 reading of it he recalled that balloon still in possession of 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:20.930
 offices the civilians render at this time there to testify 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.410
 same for marc walder author of the second test both on the roof 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.410
 for the other and well done of the years that are expected 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.649
 thanks to the garden of aguilera 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:44.399
 superb 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:47.479
 the release of all for biarrots 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.899
 the program for the biarrots them 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:53.299
 it should be remembered that at the 2010 edition under these conditions 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.249
 now we see these actions that swept the whole terrain because this 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:58.639
 under the direction 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.859
 we ask for shots on goal 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.969
 to turn academically right to miss 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:06.409
 prison ants 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.510
 hero of the series that has just been signed and all our courses in this forum 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.510
 for the future 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.339
 publication of relationships between expectations holders and 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:20.219
 replacements who have 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:21.629
 I do not understand this match 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.459
 this is it is an essay 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.699
 European could say
