 certain level of ability to be able 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.000
 climb descend jump to see how you were going to 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.370
 fall out 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.169
 etcetera and good simply by creating 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.600
 a track to which it is even if only 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.760

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.400
 incredible the truth is that it is a game 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.860
 that requires a lot of creativity and 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.050
 also patience and simply to 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.270
 appear when creating a new world with the 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.639
 seed x that comes to mind 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.919
 he just showed up he was hitting his a 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:05.960
 tree or an oak and you would appear this 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:08.810
 managed to collect wood 2 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.090
 wow the truth can not be left behind 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.550
 great great just very good 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.840
 this title limbo the truth is that this 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.900
 game totally changes your perspective 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.699
 of game and those things that you can not 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.130
 really imagine what you could do 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.139
 then limbo is a game totally 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.330
 very experimental very different 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.150
 alternative that I really recommend 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.949
 very much if you did not play them and this 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.110
 game consisted of one of the most successful 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:35.360
 simple when you start your campaign and it was 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.310
 just go back and find a 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.630
 object and unlocked the achievement of 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.630
 wrong way 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.360
 I doubt 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.560
 and so we come to our first apostle 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.050
 with this functional title 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.060
 James when tackling this game is 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.880
 just great and let me tell you something 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.830
 if you are one of those who say it is not for 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.260
 girls but the truth is that you're 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.930
 totally wrong because this title 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.970
 it's just great who believes that 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.500
 that title is for girls or something like that 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.450
 I know I have the mind but really 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.400
 they have to try the game is very 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.650
 good is a matter quite of 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.990
 zombies very curious very funny with 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.389
 quite comedy and also very much 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.930
 blood and a protagonist that really 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:24.000
 He loves very sexy and very beautiful the great 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.710
 starling golero and the time is that it 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.630
 can is great and when you unlock 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.250
 that achievement just happened something for me 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.130
 mind and were the following words 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.960
 I swear it unintentionally because 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.360
 simply that is the title of our 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.040
 unlocked achievement in lollipop that's what 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.889
 I swear it was without wanting that achievement that 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.660
 unlock by looking under the skirt of 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:44.010
 juliette so the truth is that no 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.350
 I know how is what the achievement is 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.870
 simply health from nothing but good 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.330
 I hope you can play this game and it's 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:55.430
 our first position the law pop without 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.430
 shows with I swear by inadvertently 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.090
 and then that was all very good band 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.940
