wouldn't<00:03:28.280> own<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.580> brute<00:03:28.960> might<00:03:29.960> have<00:03:30.140> two<00:03:30.440> of

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
wouldn't own the brute might have two of

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.140 
wouldn't own the brute might have two of
these<00:03:30.710> but<00:03:31.070> I<00:03:31.340> like<00:03:32.270> it<00:03:32.420> squats<00:03:32.690> nice<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.840> yeah

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
small low-profile box is probably the

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.330 
small low-profile box is probably the
gas<00:03:45.350> can<00:03:45.590> all<00:03:46.220> that<00:03:46.550> you<00:03:46.970> know<00:03:47.060> great<00:03:47.990> quad

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
gas can all that you know great quad

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.410 
gas can all that you know great quad
definitely<00:03:49.340> getting<00:03:49.550> a<00:03:49.610> winch<00:03:49.850> for<00:03:50.180> it<00:03:50.270> all

because<00:03:55.700> we<00:03:55.820> put<00:03:56.110> I<00:03:57.110> did<00:03:58.000> purposely<00:03:59.560> I<00:04:01.060> was<00:04:02.060> out

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
because we put I did purposely I was out

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.610 
because we put I did purposely I was out
of<00:04:02.240> gas<00:04:02.330> and<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:02.930> just<00:04:03.110> want<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.320> take<00:04:03.470> a<00:04:03.500> couple

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.800 
of gas and I just want to take a couple
spins<00:04:03.890> so<00:04:04.040> I<00:04:04.100> put<00:04:04.310> mixed<00:04:04.730> gas<00:04:04.910> in<00:04:05.090> there<00:04:05.239> and

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
spins so I put mixed gas in there and

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.180 
spins so I put mixed gas in there and
obviously<00:04:06.110> with<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.290> carbureted<00:04:06.800> quad<00:04:07.010> you

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
obviously with the carbureted quad you

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.850 
obviously with the carbureted quad you
can<00:04:07.340> do<00:04:07.489> that<00:04:07.670> no<00:04:07.850> problems<00:04:08.470> well<00:04:09.470> fuel

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
can do that no problems well fuel

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.150 
can do that no problems well fuel
injection<00:04:10.519> doesn't<00:04:11.209> really<00:04:11.360> like<00:04:11.600> that<00:04:11.810> so

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
injection doesn't really like that so

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.520 
injection doesn't really like that so
it's<00:04:13.160> got<00:04:13.489> a<00:04:13.519> late<00:04:14.209> trigger<00:04:14.480> response<00:04:14.840> but<00:04:15.140> her

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
it's got a late trigger response but her

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:55.220 
it's got a late trigger response but her
response
