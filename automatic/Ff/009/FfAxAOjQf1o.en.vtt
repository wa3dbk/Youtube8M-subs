00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.200 

the<00:01:09.979> reason<00:01:10.250> I'm<00:01:10.310> doing<00:01:10.340> this<00:01:10.670> I'm<00:01:10.850> trying<00:01:11.090> to

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
the reason I'm doing this I'm trying to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.279 
the reason I'm doing this I'm trying to
create<00:01:11.810> this<00:01:11.960> 3d<00:01:12.170> vision<00:01:13.100> of<00:01:13.369> a<00:01:13.759> look<00:01:14.210> on<00:01:15.140> the

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
create this 3d vision of a look on the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.230 
create this 3d vision of a look on the
Dow<00:01:15.469> so<00:01:15.770> I'm<00:01:15.890> really<00:01:16.189> hitting<00:01:16.430> this<00:01:16.729> side<00:01:16.969> and

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
Dow so I'm really hitting this side and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.389 
Dow so I'm really hitting this side and
the<00:01:17.329> readouts<00:01:17.810> my<00:01:18.409> fund<00:01:18.680> I<00:01:18.799> was<00:01:18.920> pretty<00:01:19.130> strong

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
the readouts my fund I was pretty strong

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.340 
the readouts my fund I was pretty strong
because<00:01:19.640> they<00:01:19.759> get<00:01:19.880> hit<00:01:20.149> with<00:01:20.329> chest<00:01:21.020> as<00:01:21.200> well

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
because they get hit with chest as well

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.770 
because they get hit with chest as well
so<00:01:22.130> I<00:01:22.159> one<00:01:22.610> exercise<00:01:22.939> for<00:01:23.119> that<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:23.539> I<00:01:23.659> mean

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
so I one exercise for that and I mean

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.630 
so I one exercise for that and I mean
like<00:01:24.140> I<00:01:24.229> said<00:01:24.350> we<00:01:24.439> did<00:01:24.590> two<00:01:24.770> exercises<00:01:25.189> for<00:01:25.490> the

another FST seven obviously that's ball
and<00:02:53.000> my<00:02:53.269> protein<00:02:53.780> are<00:02:54.590> going<00:02:54.799> to<00:02:54.860> push<00:02:55.010> big
