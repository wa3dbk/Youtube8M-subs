boy and this is a cat eye it's where
it's<00:00:24.090> kind<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.300> like<00:00:24.390> an<00:00:24.539> isolation<00:00:25.170> right

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
it's kind of like an isolation right

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.750 
it's kind of like an isolation right
there<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.460> front<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:28.340> what<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.460> doing

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
that instead so save our arms doing a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.600 
that instead so save our arms doing a
circle<00:00:37.550> it's<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:42.260> yeah<00:00:43.260> okay<00:00:43.680> arms

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
circle it's going to yeah okay arms

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.240 
circle it's going to yeah okay arms
doing<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> circle<00:00:45.239> as<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:46.410> circle<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.829> going<00:00:47.070> up

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
doing a circle as the circle is going up

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.450 
doing a circle as the circle is going up
the<00:00:47.670> poi<00:00:47.910> goes<00:00:48.239> up<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.920> that<00:00:49.920> helped<00:00:50.309> my

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the poi goes up and that helped my

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.939 
the poi goes up and that helped my
circle<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.899> pool<00:00:52.170> way<00:00:52.260> start<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> go<00:00:52.710> down

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
circle the pool way start to go down

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:02.310 
circle the pool way start to go down
like<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.940> it's

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.810 

like<00:01:02.920> so<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:05.130> maybe<00:01:06.130> just<00:01:06.370> follow<00:01:06.670> that

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
like so and maybe just follow that

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.980 
like so and maybe just follow that
pattern<00:01:07.890> real<00:01:08.890> quick<00:01:12.300> not<00:01:13.300> the<00:01:13.479> best<00:01:13.660> of<00:01:13.810> these

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
pattern real quick not the best of these

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.030 
pattern real quick not the best of these
but<00:01:15.060> they're<00:01:16.060> doing<00:01:17.100> all<00:01:18.100> right<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.560> there's

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
but they're doing all right so there's

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.020 
but they're doing all right so there's
your<00:01:21.160> cat<00:01:21.490> eye<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:23.229> just<00:01:23.500> a<00:01:23.820> good<00:01:24.820> way<00:01:24.970> to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
your cat eye so just a good way to

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.210 
your cat eye so just a good way to
practice<00:01:25.240> this<00:01:25.690> is<00:01:26.220> kind<00:01:27.220> of<00:01:27.840> maybe<00:01:28.840> at<00:01:29.020> first

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
practice this is kind of maybe at first

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.950 
practice this is kind of maybe at first
to<00:01:30.220> get<00:01:30.340> into<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.640> normal<00:01:30.880> swing<00:01:31.300> then<00:01:31.600> kind<00:01:31.840> of

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
to get into a normal swing then kind of

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.950 
to get into a normal swing then kind of
raise<00:01:32.770> your<00:01:32.979> hand<00:01:33.190> as<00:01:33.400> your<00:01:34.240> ploy<00:01:34.420> goes<00:01:34.660> up

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
raise your hand as your ploy goes up

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.570 
raise your hand as your ploy goes up
this<00:01:35.380> way<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.729> notice<00:01:37.440> my<00:01:38.440> hand<00:01:38.770> as<00:01:39.039> my<00:01:39.340> hand

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
this way so notice my hand as my hand

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.550 
this way so notice my hand as my hand
goes<00:01:39.729> up<00:01:39.910> I'm<00:01:40.240> pose<00:01:40.450> going<00:01:40.660> to<00:01:40.750> go<00:01:40.840> up<00:01:40.990> but<00:01:41.229> the

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
goes up I'm pose going to go up but the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.010 
goes up I'm pose going to go up but the
tether<00:01:42.130> is<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:44.190> horizontal<00:01:45.190> so<00:01:46.030> I'll<00:01:46.960> just

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
tether is a horizontal so I'll just

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:56.249 
tether is a horizontal so I'll just
regular<00:01:47.710> swing<00:01:47.979> then<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:54.149> alright<00:01:55.259> so

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
regular swing then like that alright so

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.480 
regular swing then like that alright so
when<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.649> goes<00:01:56.800> up<00:01:56.979> and<00:01:57.780> then<00:01:59.039> you<00:02:00.039> see<00:02:00.220> it<00:02:00.250> this

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
when it goes up and then you see it this

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.419 
when it goes up and then you see it this
way<00:02:00.869> now<00:02:01.869> you're<00:02:02.140> going<00:02:02.259> to<00:02:02.350> have<00:02:03.070> it<00:02:03.190> fall

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
way now you're going to have it fall

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:10.020 
way now you're going to have it fall
down<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:04.780> so<00:02:06.150> so<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:08.320> goes<00:02:08.470> up<00:02:08.769> down<00:02:09.369> up<00:02:09.729> and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
down like so so it goes up down up and

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.900 
down like so so it goes up down up and
down<00:02:10.299> and<00:02:10.600> just<00:02:10.840> repeat<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.260> as<00:02:11.799> a<00:02:12.549> real

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
down and just repeat that as a real

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:21.880 
down and just repeat that as a real
bouncy<00:02:13.810> feel<00:02:14.049> to<00:02:14.290> it

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.429 

that<00:02:23.299> takes<00:02:24.299> a<00:02:24.420> lot<00:02:24.569> of<00:02:24.629> practice<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.260> really

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
that takes a lot of practice to really

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:33.030 
that takes a lot of practice to really
get<00:02:25.890> these<00:02:26.099> down

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.360 

and<00:02:33.129> you<00:02:33.760> might<00:02:33.939> want<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.269> actually<00:02:34.329> imagine

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
and you might want to actually imagine

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.429 
and you might want to actually imagine
say<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.730> have<00:02:36.879> your<00:02:37.090> left<00:02:37.269> arm<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.780> your

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
say you have your left arm and your

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:52.949 
say you have your left arm and your
other<00:02:38.530> arm<00:02:38.709> here<00:02:42.209> so<00:02:44.969> it<00:02:45.969> goes<00:02:46.560> circle<00:02:47.560> go<00:02:51.959> down

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
other arm here so it goes circle go down

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.220 
other arm here so it goes circle go down
my<00:02:53.140> right<00:02:53.319> arms<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:53.799> back<00:02:54.010> up<00:02:54.220> my<00:02:54.400> left<00:02:55.230> down

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
my right arms and back up my left down

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:05.940 
my right arms and back up my left down
right<00:02:56.260> back<00:02:56.709> up<00:02:56.859> lift<00:03:01.019> like<00:03:02.019> sue

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.150 

if<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:06.730> can<00:03:06.849> really<00:03:06.970> get<00:03:07.150> used<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:07.989> these<00:03:08.170> you

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
if you can really get used to these you

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.680 
if you can really get used to these you
can<00:03:09.340> really<00:03:09.610> start<00:03:09.970> doing<00:03:10.209> some<00:03:10.330> creative

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
can really start doing some creative

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.040 
can really start doing some creative
things<00:03:11.019> with<00:03:11.170> them<00:03:11.410> as<00:03:12.040> such<00:03:12.730> as<00:03:13.050> isolations

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
things with them as such as isolations

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.119 
things with them as such as isolations

tune<00:03:32.470> up<00:03:32.620> with<00:03:32.769> this

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.420 

try<00:03:40.840> to<00:03:40.900> learn<00:03:41.049> in<00:03:41.200> both<00:03:41.379> directions<00:03:44.250> which<00:03:45.250> I

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
try to learn in both directions which I

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:56.660 
try to learn in both directions which I
have<00:03:45.640> practice<00:03:46.269> too<00:03:46.510> much<00:03:50.489> like<00:03:51.489> that

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:06.090

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.160 

this<00:04:06.760> is<00:04:06.880> probably<00:04:07.120> not<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:07.360> best<00:04:07.450> tutorial

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
this is probably not the best tutorial

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.040 
this is probably not the best tutorial
again<00:04:08.440> but<00:04:09.070> I'm<00:04:09.190> hoping<00:04:09.550> you<00:04:10.540> get<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.840> general

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
again but I'm hoping you get the general

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.860 
again but I'm hoping you get the general
idea<00:04:12.600> how<00:04:13.600> you're<00:04:13.780> supposed<00:04:13.990> to<00:04:14.170> do<00:04:14.320> this<00:04:15.870> all

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
idea how you're supposed to do this all

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.930
