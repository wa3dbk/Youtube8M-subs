about a foot and then doc it gives you a
little<00:04:51.080> bit<00:04:53.050> there's<00:04:54.050> a<00:04:54.139> difference<00:04:54.560> because

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
little bit there's a difference because

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.340 
little bit there's a difference because
the<00:04:55.100> Rockets<00:04:55.430> of<00:04:55.490> course<00:04:55.729> bigger<00:04:55.990> this<00:04:56.990> part

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
the Rockets of course bigger this part

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.750 
the Rockets of course bigger this part
of<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.650> duck<00:04:57.860> is<00:04:58.600> removable<00:04:59.600> I<00:05:00.610> don't<00:05:01.610> have

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
of the duck is removable I don't have

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.740 
of the duck is removable I don't have
any<00:05:01.930> other<00:05:02.930> things<00:05:03.410> to<00:05:03.560> switch<00:05:03.770> it<00:05:03.889> out<00:05:04.010> with

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
any other things to switch it out with

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.050 
any other things to switch it out with
and<00:05:05.889> I<00:05:06.889> guess<00:05:07.610> that's<00:05:08.240> it

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
and I guess that's it

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.060 
and I guess that's it
peace
