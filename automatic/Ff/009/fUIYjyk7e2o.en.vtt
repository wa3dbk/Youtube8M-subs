13 hundred and one wins 659 loss so it's

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.140 
13 hundred and one wins 659 loss so it's
pretty<00:01:02.370> good<00:01:02.640> win-loss<00:01:03.170> ratio<00:01:04.909> rounds<00:01:05.909> played

pretty good win-loss ratio rounds played
rounds<00:01:06.840> 1<00:01:07.049> my<00:01:07.860> rounds<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:09.080> 1200<00:01:10.080> or<00:01:10.820> 12,000

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
rounds 1 my rounds one is 1200 or 12,000

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.760 
rounds 1 my rounds one is 1200 or 12,000
actually<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.240> my<00:01:12.330> rounds<00:01:12.630> losses<00:01:12.990> 7,000<00:01:13.650> so

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
actually in my rounds losses 7,000 so

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.910 
actually in my rounds losses 7,000 so
you<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.640> see<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.420> only<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> hundred<00:01:16.590> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
you can see I only have a hundred and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.800 
you can see I only have a hundred and
thirty-one<00:01:17.280> revives<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:18.090> guess<00:01:18.270> I'm<00:01:18.450> not<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
thirty-one revives I guess I'm not a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.590 
thirty-one revives I guess I'm not a
very<00:01:18.930> good<00:01:19.170> team<00:01:19.500> player<00:01:20.060> no<00:01:21.060> that's<00:01:21.270> not<00:01:21.420> true

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
very good team player no that's not true

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.060 
very good team player no that's not true
the<00:01:21.810> only<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.229> reason<00:01:22.560> for<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:23.040> because

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the only the reason for that is because

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.490 
the only the reason for that is because
we<00:01:23.400> play<00:01:23.610> five-second<00:01:24.330> bleed<00:01:24.509> out<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.960> most<00:01:25.350> of

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
we play five-second bleed out so most of

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.899 
we play five-second bleed out so most of
the<00:01:25.590> time<00:01:25.860> you're<00:01:26.250> either<00:01:26.369> going<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.640> die<00:01:26.729> or

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the time you're either going to die or

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.090 
the time you're either going to die or
you're<00:01:27.479> just<00:01:27.509> going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.409> know<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.770> up<00:01:28.829> by

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
you're just going to you know get up by

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.130 
you're just going to you know get up by

think I played yeah sash nation six and

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.310 
think I played yeah sash nation six and
six<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.850> pretty<00:02:42.030> much<00:02:42.120> says<00:02:42.480> for<00:02:42.750> itself<00:02:43.020> i

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
six that pretty much says for itself i

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.020 
six that pretty much says for itself i
think<00:02:43.350> i<00:02:43.680> only<00:02:43.920> played<00:02:44.190> one<00:02:44.520> game<00:02:44.820> of

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
sniper of course um ok so i invert why

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.890 
sniper of course um ok so i invert why
access<00:03:29.970> no<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:31.070> I'm<00:03:32.070> not<00:03:32.400> really<00:03:33.060> sure<00:03:33.239> I'm

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
access no I I'm not really sure I'm

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.740 
access no I I'm not really sure I'm
pretty<00:03:34.200> sure<00:03:34.320> what<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:34.799> does<00:03:35.250> is<00:03:35.489> instead<00:03:36.480> of

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
pretty sure what that does is instead of

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.140 
pretty sure what that does is instead of
aiming<00:03:37.049> down<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.920> holding<00:03:38.580> down<00:03:38.790> the

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
aiming down and holding down the

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.729 
aiming down and holding down the
thumbstick<00:03:39.660> I<00:03:39.810> think<00:03:40.019> you<00:03:40.140> show<00:03:40.320> us<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.560> aim

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
thumbstick I think you show us the aim

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.100 
thumbstick I think you show us the aim
up<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.519> it<00:03:41.640> goes<00:03:41.820> down<00:03:42.030> like<00:03:42.330> back<00:03:42.540> in<00:03:42.570> Halo

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
up and it goes down like back in Halo

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.259 
up and it goes down like back in Halo
days<00:03:43.320> when<00:03:43.620> halo<00:03:43.980> 1<00:03:44.280> first<00:03:44.580> game<00:03:44.790> i<00:03:44.910> played

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
days when halo 1 first game i played

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.460 
days when halo 1 first game i played
inverted<00:03:46.400> and<00:03:47.400> it's<00:03:48.390> it's<00:03:48.690> kind<00:03:49.019> of<00:03:49.080> hard<00:03:49.350> to

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
inverted and it's it's kind of hard to

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.789 
inverted and it's it's kind of hard to
switch<00:03:49.920> i<00:03:50.330> actually<00:03:51.330> when<00:03:52.140> i<00:03:52.170> first<00:03:52.500> started

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
switch i actually when i first started

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.039 
switch i actually when i first started
playing<00:03:52.920> halo<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.670> then<00:03:53.910> I<00:03:54.209> tried<00:03:54.720> switch

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
playing halo and then I tried switch

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.289 
playing halo and then I tried switch
into<00:03:55.410> regular<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:56.130> was<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:56.519> messed<00:03:56.820> up<00:03:57.030> like

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
into regular it was so messed up like

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.550 
into regular it was so messed up like
you<00:03:57.420> kind<00:03:57.630> of<00:03:57.690> got<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:57.959> switch<00:03:58.230> your<00:03:58.380> brain

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
you kind of got to switch your brain

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.920 
you kind of got to switch your brain
your<00:03:58.980> brain<00:03:59.010> used<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.610> it<00:03:59.700> again<00:03:59.880> but<00:04:00.570> all<00:04:00.810> this

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
your brain used to it again but all this

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.170 
your brain used to it again but all this
3<00:04:01.200> sensitivity

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
3 sensitivity

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.789 
3 sensitivity
and<00:04:02.269> I<00:04:02.510> play<00:04:02.719> on<00:04:02.780> high<00:04:02.989> of<00:04:03.170> course<00:04:03.230> because<00:04:03.709> the

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
and I play on high of course because the

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.470 
and I play on high of course because the
sensitivity<00:04:04.370> is<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.459> very<00:04:04.730> high<00:04:04.939> in<00:04:05.120> this<00:04:05.239> game

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
sensitivity is a very high in this game

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.979 
sensitivity is a very high in this game
anyways<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:06.489> vibration<00:04:07.489> on<00:04:08.079> arm<00:04:10.569> so<00:04:11.569> yeah
