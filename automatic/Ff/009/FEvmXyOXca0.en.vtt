00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:12.150
 Well then let's start with the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.820
 supreme maryland start that you need 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.670
 supreme chicken directly a 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.070
 supreme but oil cut or 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.480
 achieved with the bone is because that 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.599
 is one of the characteristics of this 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.240
 dish that is super classic cut 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.630
 classic classic so here's the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.360
 chicken breast with the bone then 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.820
 the turn here was the skin 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.220
 lower the turn you take the skin 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.790
 course but from the inner side of the side 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.540
 do not think about it, you're going to do a 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.390
 tajito yes and you're going to start opening 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.340
 one side and the other as much as possible with a 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.990
 knife that cut not like in this case 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.260
 not fulfill it 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:59.640
 it seems like that of props so what 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.640
 we are cutting as we can from one side 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 notice 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.119
 then there we go opening and we're going 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:24.369
 opening in this way knows for what 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.289
 just to give surface the 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.229
 Largest chicken breast chicken more 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.570
 boy without skin only with the little bone of 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.729
 wing you have to do well skinny 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.190
 this is going to turn into a milanesa 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.240
 if you leave the breast as it comes 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.240
 even now 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.580
 this if you leave it and as well inclusive 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.440
 with the tender or filÃ© mignon of the 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.780
 breast that seals its chest and is that 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.210
 has is very thick and this has a 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.270
 Typical breaded at Milanese so 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.460
 I insist you die and very good knife 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.600
 they take out the skin you get to understand what 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.600
 you keep in the freezer 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.390
 which is on the inner side of the breast 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.340
 and I opened it side and side things from 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.700
 expand it to make it a little bit more 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.680
 this as it is called the more it is flatter and 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.840
 Now then we are going to go through 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.560
 a well-deserved to do it to the Milanese 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.680
 that we have flour there we have eggs and 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.560
 we have bread crumbs the classic triptych 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.160
 of the whole Milanese so the first thing 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.650
 what we do is start spicing up 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.830
 one side a little chicken breast and 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.950
 intensely especially the eggs 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.830
 apart from salt apart from a little bit of 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.590
 garlic and apart from parsley and put everything 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.670
 that we are going to put a very good jet 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.680
 generous of canola oil to the 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.240
 eggs because because you know that the 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.920
 canola oil is very healthy is very 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.900
 Healthy helps you lower your cholesterol 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.330
 but apart it comes in versions 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.880
 flavored and in this case we have 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.430
 put a canola oil that has a 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.010
 scent a little basil there are also 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.030
 with lemon so you can use it or 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.830
 you can also use it 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.770
 with olive oil any of those 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.880
 excellent then let's go to the 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.880
 work that happens to you guys 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:32.050
 you are things that happen to follow 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.940
 that follows his courtship that is well 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.860
 blessed 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.860
 with miss wool 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.510
 seriously 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.730
 if something went red colorado 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.730
 colorado cabrera 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.810
 well let's go then let's pass the 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.150
 breast that we cut into paper or the 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.610
 we passed like this for flour we passed through 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.700
 beaten egg flavored me in this 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.400
 case I would like a matter of time 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.790
 that we do not have but today at home he does 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.190
 leave the egg left in the seasoning 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.569
 there you have flavored canola oil 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.530
 they have the options but you can 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.510
 put a squirt of lemon juice 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.030
 etcetera etcetera a teaspoon of 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.370
 mustard if you want to leave an average 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.050
 Horita that chicken meat in the me 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.440
 cell of the mixture of the eggs for 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.139
 I take to make it taste if after 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.919
 you're going to end up going through this 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:36.450
 case by a as it calls a batter if 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.450
 you had a little music out there 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.410
 no no no please but put a little 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.480
 of music or it came to be with me 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.480
 I feel tired it's okay 

00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:08.009
 along the coast of La Rioja but good 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.080
 won people with the restaurant mother 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.729
 I shared with my mom supreme Maria very 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.219
 well you have to do that for nothing 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.910
 we recommend then leave it now yes 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:20.300
 about 20 minutes 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.490
 so that the shutdown is good 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.550
 and after 20 minutes it's cool 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.730
 you're going to cook it in a hot oil 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.600
 ma non troppo as in this case is like this 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.000
 what are you going to leave 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.430
 remember that the only option is going to be 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.530
 that opening so the oil has to 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.530
 be hot but not too 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.540
 good 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:04.440
 it's a more atypical one to make donuts 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:06.240
 a leg is a paste a paste that 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.970
 makes with milk with eggs with salt 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.210
 etcetera etcetera has to be left 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.820
 more or less like this he sees well paste so 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.350
 do not burn the supreme my dear 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.510
 favor 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.280
 then it puts better whole eggs 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.340
 he puts a little salt pepper 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:27.600
 he puts flour and milk makes this paste 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:30.780
 and in this paste is going to put bananita 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:34.140
 a peeled banana cut into segments 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:36.270
 he puts it there in the egg and we're going to 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.340
 fish you take me out the pint the cute 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.890
 who are watching the visit for this one 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.990
 the clamp so we go here 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.210
 this paste well paste is so 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.270
 important that the mass is dense my 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.740
 dear part so that of course I ask 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.220
 that the patches and so that it is still 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.220
 surrounds 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.940
 Of course that does not mean that the 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.950
 hit 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.110
 and then throw it directly to the 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:06.910
 banana leaves to channel per share 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:08.440
 him and that crust of the donut paste 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.600
 will be attached 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.770
 and that 's the famous fried banana that they go 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.640
 to take out when it is golden 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.910
 awesome dear that is what I 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.730
 is missing at this time the appointment of 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.860
 I cook a white sauce with the corn 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.740
 nothing else the only thing that we lack then 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.900
 is to unify that supreme chicken well 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:32.560
 soloists know you delicious and well 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:34.720

 We're going to plant them here 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.950
 to eat all together give him vastly
