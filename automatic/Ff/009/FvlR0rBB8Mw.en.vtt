looked<00:03:48.019> down<00:03:48.230> and<00:03:48.469> I<00:03:48.560> realized<00:03:48.799> that<00:03:49.569> my

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
looked down and I realized that my

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.030 
looked down and I realized that my
nipples<00:03:50.810> had<00:03:51.290> come<00:03:51.530> out<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:52.220> so<00:03:53.739> when<00:03:54.739> I<00:03:54.859> had

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
nipples had come out and so when I had

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:03.500
