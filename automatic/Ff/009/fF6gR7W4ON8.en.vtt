actually I'm jumped up and down about it
but<00:01:42.090> I'm<00:01:42.180> quite<00:01:42.450> comfortable<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:43.500> Fox<00:01:43.770> is

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
but I'm quite comfortable that Fox is

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.980 
but I'm quite comfortable that Fox is
involved<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.060> assassins<00:01:45.509> creed<00:01:45.659> movie

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990
