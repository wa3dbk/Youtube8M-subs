00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.700
 - I think we have already passed here ... 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.960
 - Personally, I do not remember these places 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.880
 And in general, it seems to me that the whole world appears under our feet. 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.500
 It's all your fault! 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.580
 If we didn’t run after that dude to the mountains, we would have been home a long time ago. 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.500
 - Damn it, we have been wandering for half a year already ... 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.980
 - Never mind. 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.940
 Did you notice anything strange while we were walking here? 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.080
 - Nope. 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.900
 - But now I see that this clearing is very good for the house. 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.000
 - Wait a minute! 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.840
 - Do you really want to just take it and build a house? 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.740
 - Well ... 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.940
 - Yes... ? 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.980
 - You see, a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since we built the last house. 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.100
 Have you seen how everything has changed? 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.820
 The northern regions are covered with snow, 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.360
 somewhere a desert has formed 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.760
 and now we are standing in the middle of a wild forest 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.720
 Previously, we could build at random, but now, we simply cannot act without a plan! 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.740
 Therefore, hold the paper and draw a plan of the house. 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.520
 - Hmm. 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.020
 Then we will need more time ... 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.960
 It is necessary to consider the location of resources, future extensions, resistance to cracking, visibility from the side ... 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.100
 “And we will need to cut a couple of trees.” 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.260
 - Well, or you can take out that house for an indefinite, unpaid rent. 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.980
 - Yes of course! Just wear my ninja costume! 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.860
 - This is not needed. 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.100
 Just distract the owner, and I will climb over the wall and hang my lock on the door. 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.600
 - That sounds silly ... but ... why not? 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.040
 - For the cause! 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.440
 - Hey, man! 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.580
 I'm friends! 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.760
 - Okay. 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.240
 But still do not come to the house. 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.680
 - Um. I wanted to ask you ... a ... 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.240
 ... what is this dog statue? 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.260
 - Would you leave here, man. 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.360
 - Well, now we have all the main things! 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.640
 - Yes! 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.160
 And that means we're back in business! 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.760
 - Do you want to revenge your offenders?
