to start animating them so first of all
I'll<00:00:15.839> just<00:00:15.870> make<00:00:16.350> sure<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.710> Alison<00:00:17.070> figures

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
I'll just make sure the Alison figures

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.900 
I'll just make sure the Alison figures
legs<00:00:17.820> are<00:00:18.180> using<00:00:18.930> AI<00:00:19.050> K<00:00:19.220> so<00:00:20.220> I'll<00:00:20.400> come<00:00:20.609> down<00:00:20.730> to

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
legs are using AI K so I'll come down to

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.240 
legs are using AI K so I'll come down to
use<00:00:21.210> inverse<00:00:21.570> kinematics<00:00:22.199> entry<00:00:22.769> here<00:00:22.980> on<00:00:23.010> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
use inverse kinematics entry here on the

figure menu and yes the left leg on the
right<00:00:25.650> leg<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.039> ticked<00:00:26.340> that's<00:00:26.910> exactly<00:00:27.420> what

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
right leg is ticked that's exactly what

body<00:00:39.540> part<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.649> see<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.070> highlight

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
body part you can see the highlight

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.639 
body part you can see the highlight
happening<00:00:41.910> there<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.390> hover<00:00:42.690> over<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
happening there and I hover over the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.069 
happening there and I hover over the
body<00:00:43.890> parts<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.430> want<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.789> move<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.750> I'll<00:00:45.899> just

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
body parts I want to move so I'll just

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.470 
body parts I want to move so I'll just
carefully<00:00:46.530> select<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> right<00:00:47.370> foot<00:00:47.969> here<00:00:48.329> and

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
carefully select the right foot here and

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.290 
carefully select the right foot here and
move<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.410> into<00:00:49.620> position<00:00:50.000> just<00:00:51.000> move<00:00:51.180> it

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
move that into position just move it

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.119 
move that into position just move it
across<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.629> little<00:00:52.050> bit<00:00:52.170> more<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.800> tweak

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
across a little bit more just to tweak

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.380 
across a little bit more just to tweak
it<00:00:53.160> slightly<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.879> then<00:00:54.000> I'll<00:00:54.120> use<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
it slightly and then I'll use the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.900 
it slightly and then I'll use the
properties<00:00:55.379> palette<00:00:55.590> here<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.129> actually

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
properties palette here to actually

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.330 
properties palette here to actually
rotate<00:00:57.360> or<00:00:57.870> twist<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.469> right<00:00:58.590> foot<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:58.949> I'll

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
rotate or twist the right foot so I'll

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.090 
rotate or twist the right foot so I'll
bring<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.670> into<00:01:00.059> position<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:01.800> see

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
bring that into position so you can see

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.709 
bring that into position so you can see
now<00:01:02.280> that's<00:01:02.520> virtually<00:01:02.730> matching<00:01:03.390> up<00:01:03.539> with

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
now that's virtually matching up with

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.990 
now that's virtually matching up with
the<00:01:03.809> feet<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.110> Hazel<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.860> video<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.909> I'll

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the feet of Hazel in the video so I'll

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.760 
the feet of Hazel in the video so I'll
do<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> same<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> other<00:01:06.900> foot<00:01:07.140> just

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
do the same for the other foot just

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.070 
do the same for the other foot just
carefully<00:01:08.189> drag<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.580> over<00:01:08.790> then<00:01:09.600> rotate<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
carefully drag that over then rotate it

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.780 
carefully drag that over then rotate it
into<00:01:10.380> position<00:01:10.700> using<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.909> twist<00:01:12.420> dial

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
into position using the twist dial

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.640 
into position using the twist dial
so<00:01:13.970> that's<00:01:14.150> starting<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:15.080> move<00:01:15.200> things<00:01:15.470> into

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
so that's starting to move things into

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.980 
so that's starting to move things into
position<00:01:16.130> I<00:01:16.280> can<00:01:16.850> see<00:01:17.030> there<00:01:17.330> that<00:01:17.510> her<00:01:17.660> hips

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
position I can see there that her hips

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.220 
position I can see there that her hips
and<00:01:18.260> slightly<00:01:18.980> off<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:19.760> I'll<00:01:20.060> just<00:01:20.450> grab<00:01:20.990> hold

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
and slightly off so I'll just grab hold

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.020 
and slightly off so I'll just grab hold
of<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.590> head<00:01:21.800> model<00:01:22.160> here<00:01:22.400> just<00:01:22.700> make<00:01:22.880> sure

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
of the head model here just make sure

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.970 
of the head model here just make sure
it's<00:01:23.180> highlighted<00:01:23.300> in<00:01:23.810> red<00:01:23.870> then<00:01:24.560> I'll<00:01:24.740> pull

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
it's highlighted in red then I'll pull

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.130 
it's highlighted in red then I'll pull
it<00:01:25.010> all<00:01:25.190> this<00:01:25.370> slightly<00:01:25.820> that's<00:01:26.330> blinder<00:01:26.990> up

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
it all this slightly that's blinder up

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.540 
it all this slightly that's blinder up
just<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.470> little<00:01:27.500> bit<00:01:27.920> better<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:28.280> begin<00:01:28.400> with

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
just a little bit better to begin with

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.830 
just a little bit better to begin with
so<00:01:29.210> that's<00:01:29.360> my<00:01:29.690> first<00:01:30.350> keyframe<00:01:31.090> virtually<00:01:32.090> so

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
so that's my first keyframe virtually so

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.350 
so that's my first keyframe virtually so
I<00:01:33.410> just<00:01:33.740> need<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:33.920> pose<00:01:34.160> the<00:01:34.340> arms<00:01:34.670> as<00:01:34.820> well<00:01:35.000> so

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
I just need to pose the arms as well so

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.120 
I just need to pose the arms as well so
come<00:01:35.540> over<00:01:35.660> to<00:01:35.900> my<00:01:35.990> editing<00:01:36.410> tools<00:01:36.680> here<00:01:36.950> I'll

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
come over to my editing tools here I'll

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.190 
come over to my editing tools here I'll
move<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:37.490> window<00:01:37.730> over<00:01:37.880> slightly<00:01:38.510> so<00:01:38.930> I<00:01:38.960> can

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
move the window over slightly so I can

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.770 
move the window over slightly so I can
see<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.500> ones<00:01:39.680> I<00:01:39.800> want<00:01:40.040> to<00:01:40.160> use<00:01:40.430> so<00:01:41.300> I'll<00:01:41.510> use

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
see the ones I want to use so I'll use

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.640 
see the ones I want to use so I'll use
the<00:01:42.020> rotate<00:01:42.650> tool<00:01:42.950> then<00:01:44.140> bring<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.260> arm<00:01:45.410> into

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
the rotate tool then bring the arm into

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.400 
the rotate tool then bring the arm into
position<00:01:46.120> and<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:47.240> same<00:01:47.450> for<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:47.990> left<00:01:48.200> arm

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
position and the same for the left arm

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.830 
position and the same for the left arm
you<00:01:49.070> can<00:01:49.220> see<00:01:49.400> that<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.670> way<00:01:49.820> that<00:01:50.060> Hazel's

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
you can see that the way that Hazel's

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.280 
you can see that the way that Hazel's
arms<00:01:51.200> are<00:01:51.430> hanging<00:01:52.430> there<00:01:52.729> her<00:01:53.060> answer<00:01:53.570> in<00:01:53.720> a

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
arms are hanging there her answer in a

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.690 
arms are hanging there her answer in a
slightly<00:01:54.530> different<00:01:55.040> position<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.550> the

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
slightly different position to the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.760 
slightly different position to the
Alison<00:01:56.030> figures<00:01:56.360> so<00:01:57.050> I'll<00:01:57.140> just<00:01:57.350> use<00:01:57.590> the

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
Alison figures so I'll just use the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.640 
Alison figures so I'll just use the
twist<00:01:58.250> tools<00:01:58.670> to<00:01:58.940> kind<00:01:59.090> of<00:01:59.240> duplicate<00:01:59.990> motion

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
twist tools to kind of duplicate motion

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.500 
twist tools to kind of duplicate motion
it's<00:02:01.070> a<00:02:01.130> little<00:02:01.640> bit<00:02:01.820> more<00:02:01.970> like<00:02:02.180> it<00:02:02.330> I<00:02:02.390> won't

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
it's a little bit more like it I won't

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.880 
it's a little bit more like it I won't
take<00:02:02.660> it<00:02:02.840> too<00:02:02.960> far<00:02:03.229> because<00:02:03.410> of<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.650> way<00:02:03.770> that

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
take it too far because of the way that

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.980 
take it too far because of the way that
the<00:02:04.010> hands<00:02:04.250> are<00:02:04.370> posed<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.360> I'll<00:02:05.450> just<00:02:05.630> twist

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
the hands are posed so I'll just twist

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.469 
the hands are posed so I'll just twist
that<00:02:06.170> out<00:02:06.380> as<00:02:06.710> well<00:02:07.010> and<00:02:07.310> then<00:02:08.000> again<00:02:08.300> I'll<00:02:08.450> use

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
that out as well and then again I'll use

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.020 
that out as well and then again I'll use
the<00:02:08.990> rotate<00:02:09.440> tool<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.950> bring<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.490> arms<00:02:10.760> into

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
the rotate tool to bring the arms into

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.350 
the rotate tool to bring the arms into
the<00:02:11.120> body<00:02:11.300> slightly<00:02:12.190> so<00:02:13.190> as<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.910> can<00:02:14.030> see<00:02:14.209> I'm

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
the body slightly so as you can see I'm

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.449 
the body slightly so as you can see I'm
not<00:02:14.600> slavishly<00:02:15.260> following<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.980> video<00:02:16.190> it's

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
not slavishly following the video it's

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.220 
not slavishly following the video it's
just<00:02:16.550> approximating<00:02:17.450> really<00:02:17.750> as<00:02:17.840> long<00:02:17.870> as<00:02:18.140> the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
just approximating really as long as the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.260 
just approximating really as long as the
shoulder<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.070> hip<00:02:19.340> relationship<00:02:20.090> is

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
shoulder and hip relationship is

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.600 
shoulder and hip relationship is
approximately<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.290> same<00:02:21.470> then<00:02:21.830> hopefully

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
approximately the same then hopefully

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.490 
approximately the same then hopefully
your<00:02:22.760> figure<00:02:23.030> will<00:02:23.150> just<00:02:23.360> follow<00:02:23.570> also<00:02:24.230> you

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
your figure will just follow also you

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.470 
your figure will just follow also you
can<00:02:24.709> see<00:02:24.920> that<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.190> Alison<00:02:25.640> figure<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.180> not

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
can see that the Alison figure is not

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.170 
can see that the Alison figure is not
perfectly<00:02:27.020> proportioned<00:02:27.709> her<00:02:28.520> hands<00:02:28.940> are<00:02:29.060> not

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
in the same place as Hazel's that

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.190 
in the same place as Hazel's that
doesn't<00:02:31.760> matter<00:02:31.910> really<00:02:32.180> we<00:02:32.420> just<00:02:32.450> want<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:33.050> be

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
doesn't matter really we just want to be

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.199 
doesn't matter really we just want to be
able<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.410> follow<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:34.160> motion<00:02:34.760> of<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.940> video

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
able to follow the motion of the video

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.780 
able to follow the motion of the video
as<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.510> progresses<00:02:36.290> frame<00:02:36.560> by<00:02:36.739> frame<00:02:36.769> and<00:02:37.670> I've

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
as it progresses frame by frame and I've

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.400 
as it progresses frame by frame and I've
deliberately<00:02:38.180> chosen<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.840> video<00:02:39.080> here

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
deliberately chosen the video here

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.920 
deliberately chosen the video here
that's<00:02:39.650> virtually<00:02:40.250> working<00:02:40.910> on<00:02:41.000> one<00:02:41.239> plane<00:02:41.540> so

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
that's virtually working on one plane so

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.840 
that's virtually working on one plane so
that<00:02:42.080> I<00:02:42.110> can<00:02:42.350> use<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.530> fixed<00:02:43.010> camera<00:02:43.220> position

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
that I can use a fixed camera position

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.120 
that I can use a fixed camera position
to<00:02:43.970> copy<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.420> movement<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:44.959> there's<00:02:45.860> not<00:02:46.100> a

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
to copy the movement and there's not a

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.520 
to copy the movement and there's not a
lot<00:02:46.400> of<00:02:46.430> leg<00:02:47.180> or<00:02:47.420> foot<00:02:47.450> motion<00:02:48.050> in<00:02:48.230> this

lot of leg or foot motion in this

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.949 
lot of leg or foot motion in this
animation<00:02:48.920> either<00:02:49.250> it'll<00:02:49.700> just<00:02:49.970> be<00:02:50.239> a<00:02:50.510> zl--

you'll<00:03:07.040> see<00:03:07.280> Hazel<00:03:07.880> waving<00:03:08.209> in<00:03:08.300> the

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
you'll see Hazel waving in the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.540 
you'll see Hazel waving in the
background<00:03:08.830> but<00:03:09.830> I<00:03:09.860> want<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.190> be<00:03:10.340> able<00:03:10.400> to

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
background but I want to be able to

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.440 
background but I want to be able to
match

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
match

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.140 
match
Hazel's<00:03:12.350> hip<00:03:12.590> motions<00:03:13.280> here<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:14.030> could

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
Hazel's hip motions here and that could

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.759 
Hazel's hip motions here and that could
be<00:03:14.269> a<00:03:14.300> little<00:03:14.450> bit<00:03:14.660> difficult<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.200> see<00:03:15.290> where

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
be a little bit difficult to see where

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.170 
be a little bit difficult to see where
the<00:03:15.890> extremes<00:03:16.340> are<00:03:16.519> happening<00:03:16.850> at<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.060> moment

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
the extremes are happening at the moment

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.840 
the extremes are happening at the moment
so<00:03:17.720> what<00:03:17.900> I'll<00:03:18.019> do<00:03:18.260> is<00:03:18.470> stop<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.430> video<00:03:19.640> for

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
so what I'll do is stop the video for

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.220 
so what I'll do is stop the video for
the<00:03:19.910> moment<00:03:20.239> I'll<00:03:20.450> change

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
the moment I'll change

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.379 
the moment I'll change
Alison<00:03:21.680> into<00:03:21.950> an<00:03:22.070> outline<00:03:22.370> view<00:03:22.579> and<00:03:22.730> then

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
Alison into an outline view and then

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.930 
Alison into an outline view and then
I'll<00:03:23.810> turn<00:03:24.500> off<00:03:24.739> skip<00:03:25.280> frames<00:03:25.519> and<00:03:25.850> what

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
I'll turn off skip frames and what

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.559 
I'll turn off skip frames and what
you'll<00:03:26.120> see<00:03:26.209> will

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
you'll see will

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.569 
you'll see will
happen<00:03:26.810> out<00:03:26.989> as<00:03:27.170> it<00:03:27.319> will<00:03:27.499> try<00:03:27.739> to<00:03:27.799> display<00:03:28.340> all

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
happen out as it will try to display all

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.220 
happen out as it will try to display all
the<00:03:28.849> frames<00:03:29.090> of<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.269> video<00:03:29.540> as<00:03:29.719> it's<00:03:29.959> playing

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
the frames of the video as it's playing

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.190 
the frames of the video as it's playing
so<00:03:31.099> if<00:03:31.219> I<00:03:31.340> click<00:03:31.579> on<00:03:31.609> play

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
so if I click on play

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.770 
so if I click on play
it<00:03:33.590> appears<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.040> slow<00:03:34.280> down<00:03:34.610> but<00:03:35.390> it's<00:03:35.540> now

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
it appears to slow down but it's now

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.100 
it appears to slow down but it's now
showing<00:03:36.760> all<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:38.150> frames<00:03:38.450> of<00:03:38.629> the<00:03:38.720> video<00:03:39.050> a

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
showing all the frames of the video a

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.390 
showing all the frames of the video a
little<00:03:39.319> bit<00:03:39.500> more<00:03:39.650> slowly<00:03:39.950> so<00:03:40.220> that's

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
little bit more slowly so that's

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.850 
little bit more slowly so that's
enabling<00:03:40.940> me<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.150> pick<00:03:41.870> up<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.140> frames<00:03:42.410> I<00:03:42.590> want

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
enabling me to pick up the frames I want

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.580 
enabling me to pick up the frames I want
to<00:03:42.980> use<00:03:43.220> for<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.640> extremes<00:03:44.150> of<00:03:44.410> asel<00:03:45.410> hit

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
to use for the extremes of asel hit

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.730 
to use for the extremes of asel hit
motion<00:03:46.010> here

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
motion here

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.590 
motion here
so<00:03:48.370> because<00:03:48.610> I'm<00:03:48.730> just<00:03:48.970> working<00:03:49.300> in<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.420> one

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
so because I'm just working in the one

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.060 
so because I'm just working in the one
plane<00:03:49.840> it's<00:03:50.080> going<00:03:50.110> to<00:03:50.290> be<00:03:50.350> fairly<00:03:50.590> easy<00:03:50.740> to

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
plane it's going to be fairly easy to

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.400 
plane it's going to be fairly easy to
bend<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.880> parts<00:03:52.180> of<00:03:52.270> the<00:03:52.360> body<00:03:52.510> into<00:03:52.750> position

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
bend the parts of the body into position

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.890 
bend the parts of the body into position
so<00:03:54.980> again<00:03:55.520> I'll<00:03:55.640> stop<00:03:55.880> the<00:03:56.030> video<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.480> if<00:03:56.810> I

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
so again I'll stop the video and if I

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.630 
so again I'll stop the video and if I
play<00:03:57.080> it<00:03:57.110> again<00:03:57.410> I'll<00:03:57.590> try<00:03:57.920> and<00:03:58.220> match<00:03:58.610> the

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
play it again I'll try and match the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.330 
play it again I'll try and match the
motions<00:03:59.360> of<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.540> hips<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.960> start<00:04:00.050> with<00:04:00.440> it's

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
motions of the hips to start with it's

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.320 
motions of the hips to start with it's
an<00:04:01.430> extreme<00:04:01.940> there<00:04:02.680> so<00:04:03.680> if<00:04:03.830> I<00:04:03.950> just<00:04:04.190> pull<00:04:04.850> video

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
an extreme there so if I just pull video

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.380 
an extreme there so if I just pull video
through<00:04:05.870> it's<00:04:06.830> one<00:04:07.130> extreme<00:04:07.310> if<00:04:07.940> I<00:04:08.030> just<00:04:08.240> try

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
through it's one extreme if I just try

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.710 
through it's one extreme if I just try
and<00:04:08.510> estimate<00:04:08.600> that<00:04:08.990> by<00:04:09.140> playing<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.620> video

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.910 

so<00:04:13.930> I'll<00:04:13.990> just<00:04:14.170> wait<00:04:14.440> for<00:04:14.530> that<00:04:14.620> to<00:04:14.770> come

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
so I'll just wait for that to come

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.920 
so I'll just wait for that to come
through<00:04:15.130> again<00:04:15.250> watch<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.090> cycle<00:04:16.420> a<00:04:16.510> second

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
through again watch the cycle a second

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.560 
through again watch the cycle a second
time

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.880 

mean<00:04:19.660> their<00:04:19.960> roundabouts<00:04:20.950> frame<00:04:21.760> 30<00:04:22.770> as<00:04:23.770> you

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
mean their roundabouts frame 30 as you

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.410 
mean their roundabouts frame 30 as you
can<00:04:24.010> see<00:04:24.130> not<00:04:24.280> a<00:04:24.340> lot<00:04:24.430> happening<00:04:24.910> here<00:04:24.970> until

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
can see not a lot happening here until

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.980 
can see not a lot happening here until
about<00:04:25.930> frame<00:04:26.200> 20<00:04:26.830> so<00:04:27.040> what<00:04:27.220> I'll<00:04:27.340> do<00:04:27.700> is<00:04:28.030> set

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
about frame 20 so what I'll do is set

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.200 
about frame 20 so what I'll do is set
another<00:04:29.470> keyframe<00:04:29.770> there<00:04:30.340> just<00:04:30.850> by<00:04:31.000> clicking

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
another keyframe there just by clicking

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.420 
another keyframe there just by clicking
on<00:04:31.450> the<00:04:31.510> plus<00:04:31.690> button<00:04:31.920> and<00:04:32.920> all<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.100> action

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
on the plus button and all the action

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.850 
on the plus button and all the action
starts<00:04:33.790> to<00:04:33.910> happen<00:04:34.030> after<00:04:34.660> frame<00:04:34.870> 20<00:04:35.380> you<00:04:35.650> can

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
starts to happen after frame 20 you can

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.260 
starts to happen after frame 20 you can
see<00:04:36.040> frame<00:04:36.280> 21<00:04:36.820> there

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
see frame 21 there

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.390 
see frame 21 there
Hazel's<00:04:38.140> armature<00:04:38.560> starting<00:04:38.950> to<00:04:39.040> move<00:04:39.160> at<00:04:39.370> a

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
Hazel's armature starting to move at a

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.290 
Hazel's armature starting to move at a
position<00:04:40.030> so<00:04:40.870> let's<00:04:41.770> come<00:04:41.980> up<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:42.280> frame<00:04:42.550> 46

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
position so let's come up to frame 46

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.260 
position so let's come up to frame 46
that's<00:04:43.840> one<00:04:44.260> extreme<00:04:44.500> for<00:04:44.950> her<00:04:45.100> hips<00:04:45.310> so<00:04:46.090> what

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
that's one extreme for her hips so what

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.200 
that's one extreme for her hips so what
I'll<00:04:46.390> do<00:04:46.630> is<00:04:46.680> tweak<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.980> hips<00:04:48.580> of<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:48.850> Alison

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
I'll do is tweak the hips of the Alison

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.570 
I'll do is tweak the hips of the Alison
figure<00:04:49.480> over<00:04:50.080> I'll<00:04:50.260> just<00:04:50.500> grab<00:04:50.800> hold<00:04:51.040> of<00:04:51.280> the

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
figure over I'll just grab hold of the

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.420 
figure over I'll just grab hold of the
hip<00:04:51.760> element<00:04:52.270> here<00:04:52.510> and<00:04:52.660> pull<00:04:53.620> that<00:04:53.860> over<00:04:54.160> and

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
hip element here and pull that over and

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.790 
hip element here and pull that over and
then<00:04:54.520> I'll<00:04:54.670> tweak<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:55.480> down<00:04:55.750> slightly<00:04:56.350> so<00:04:56.770> that

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
then I'll tweak it down slightly so that

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.400 
then I'll tweak it down slightly so that
legs<00:04:57.400> are<00:04:57.610> bending<00:04:58.060> then<00:04:58.810> I'll<00:04:58.960> set<00:04:59.230> another

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
legs are bending then I'll set another

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.100 
legs are bending then I'll set another
keyframe<00:04:59.980> there<00:05:00.550> and<00:05:01.480> again<00:05:01.660> I'll<00:05:01.810> let<00:05:01.990> the

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
keyframe there and again I'll let the

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.250 
keyframe there and again I'll let the
video<00:05:02.230> play<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:04.240> there's<00:05:04.420> another<00:05:04.750> extreme

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
video play and there's another extreme

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.690 
video play and there's another extreme
they're<00:05:05.470> happening<00:05:06.330> roundabouts<00:05:07.330> frame<00:05:08.700> 65

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
they're happening roundabouts frame 65

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.450 
they're happening roundabouts frame 65
I'd<00:05:10.030> say<00:05:10.330> yes<00:05:10.810> they<00:05:11.080> go<00:05:11.260> hips<00:05:11.560> coming<00:05:12.220> over

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
I'd say yes they go hips coming over

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.520 
I'd say yes they go hips coming over
there<00:05:12.610> again<00:05:12.970> so<00:05:13.450> what<00:05:13.600> I'll<00:05:13.720> do<00:05:13.900> is<00:05:13.930> pull<00:05:14.500> the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
there again so what I'll do is pull the

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.340 
there again so what I'll do is pull the
hips<00:05:14.770> over<00:05:14.980> and<00:05:15.490> then<00:05:15.700> I'll<00:05:16.140> rotate<00:05:17.140> them

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
hips over and then I'll rotate them

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.580 
hips over and then I'll rotate them
slightly<00:05:18.040> on<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.790> z<00:05:18.970> plane<00:05:19.290> that's<00:05:20.290> also

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
slightly on the z plane that's also

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.710 
slightly on the z plane that's also
making<00:05:20.920> her<00:05:21.130> legs<00:05:21.400> bend<00:05:21.850> slightly<00:05:22.090> as<00:05:22.450> well

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
making her legs bend slightly as well

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.530 
making her legs bend slightly as well
and<00:05:23.410> if<00:05:23.530> I<00:05:23.680> play<00:05:24.040> the<00:05:24.460> video<00:05:25.090> again

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.730 

if<00:05:29.750> I<00:05:29.930> just<00:05:30.080> pull<00:05:30.380> up<00:05:30.410> to<00:05:30.530> frame<00:05:30.950> 80

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.350 

so<00:05:33.830> again<00:05:34.130> I'll<00:05:34.280> just<00:05:34.310> bring<00:05:34.850> the<00:05:35.000> hips<00:05:35.150> over

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
so again I'll just bring the hips over

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.629 
so again I'll just bring the hips over
and<00:05:35.780> then<00:05:35.960> I'll<00:05:36.110> reset<00:05:37.040> the<00:05:37.460> z-rotation

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
and then I'll reset the z-rotation

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.070 
and then I'll reset the z-rotation
then<00:05:40.389> I<00:05:40.479> rotate<00:05:40.900> it<00:05:41.129> slightly<00:05:42.129> more<00:05:42.340> that<00:05:42.789> way

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
then I rotate it slightly more that way

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.290 
then I rotate it slightly more that way
I'll<00:05:44.080> set<00:05:44.379> another<00:05:44.499> keyframe<00:05:44.860> and<00:05:45.610> then<00:05:46.180> I'll

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
I'll set another keyframe and then I'll

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.020 
I'll set another keyframe and then I'll
play<00:05:46.509> the<00:05:46.659> video<00:05:46.900> again

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
play the video again

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.670 
play the video again
and<00:05:49.330> there<00:05:49.480> was<00:05:49.570> another<00:05:49.810> extreme<00:05:50.410> then

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
and there was another extreme then

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.030 
and there was another extreme then
around<00:05:51.220> about<00:05:51.720> 3<00:05:52.720> 1<00:05:52.930> to<00:05:53.080> 6<00:05:53.380> so<00:05:53.590> again<00:05:53.860> I'll<00:05:54.010> just

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
around about 3 1 to 6 so again I'll just

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.550 
around about 3 1 to 6 so again I'll just
grab<00:05:54.640> the<00:05:54.820> hips<00:05:54.970> bring<00:05:55.780> them<00:05:55.930> over<00:05:56.170> a<00:05:56.200> little

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
grab the hips bring them over a little

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.440 
grab the hips bring them over a little
bit<00:05:56.770> and<00:05:57.750> then<00:05:59.100> set<00:06:00.100> the<00:06:00.250> z-rotation<00:06:00.670> the

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
bit and then set the z-rotation the

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.810 
bit and then set the z-rotation the
other<00:06:01.630> way<00:06:01.870> and<00:06:02.590> I'll<00:06:03.160> set<00:06:03.340> another<00:06:03.580> keyframe

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
other way and I'll set another keyframe

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.240 
other way and I'll set another keyframe
there<00:06:04.300> now<00:06:05.170> I'll<00:06:05.350> come<00:06:05.560> up<00:06:05.680> toward<00:06:05.890> the<00:06:06.010> end<00:06:06.130> of

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
there now I'll come up toward the end of

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.070 
there now I'll come up toward the end of
the<00:06:06.340> animation

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
the animation

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.540 
the animation
and<00:06:08.229> again<00:06:08.500> as<00:06:08.650> an<00:06:08.770> extreme<00:06:09.129> there<00:06:09.340> so<00:06:09.460> I'll

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
and again as an extreme there so I'll

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.839 
and again as an extreme there so I'll
just<00:06:09.699> pull<00:06:10.090> the<00:06:10.590> hips<00:06:11.590> over<00:06:11.889> and<00:06:12.310> rotate<00:06:12.639> them

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
just pull the hips over and rotate them

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:14.510 
just pull the hips over and rotate them
the<00:06:12.970> other<00:06:13.120> way

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
the other way

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.430 
the other way
virtually<00:06:15.060> back<00:06:15.270> to<00:06:15.389> the<00:06:15.509> middle<00:06:15.750> and<00:06:15.870> then

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
virtually back to the middle and then

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.620 
virtually back to the middle and then
there's<00:06:16.680> one<00:06:17.009> more<00:06:17.120> stream<00:06:18.120> to<00:06:18.240> check<00:06:18.419> out

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
there's one more stream to check out

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.189 
there's one more stream to check out
just<00:06:18.900> as<00:06:19.530> Hazel's<00:06:20.310> coming<00:06:20.610> to<00:06:20.819> a<00:06:21.199> standstill

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 
just as Hazel's coming to a standstill

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.680 
just as Hazel's coming to a standstill
here<00:06:22.650> so<00:06:23.190> I'll<00:06:23.310> just<00:06:23.460> bring<00:06:23.849> the<00:06:24.000> hips<00:06:24.419> over

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
here so I'll just bring the hips over

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.589 
here so I'll just bring the hips over
and<00:06:25.259> up<00:06:25.500> slightly<00:06:26.099> and<00:06:26.580> then<00:06:27.090> I<00:06:27.210> set<00:06:27.389> another

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 
and up slightly and then I set another

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:30.830 
and up slightly and then I set another
keyframe<00:06:27.870> so<00:06:28.710> this<00:06:29.130> is<00:06:29.280> just<00:06:29.610> animating<00:06:30.539> the

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
keyframe so this is just animating the

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.559 
keyframe so this is just animating the
hip<00:06:30.990> motion<00:06:31.410> really<00:06:31.650> so<00:06:32.099> if<00:06:32.280> I<00:06:32.490> change<00:06:33.240> the

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:33.569 
hip motion really so if I change the

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:37.129 
hip motion really so if I change the
display<00:06:33.930> back<00:06:34.229> to<00:06:35.419> text<00:06:36.419> to<00:06:36.509> shaded<00:06:36.750> I'll<00:06:36.990> just

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 
display back to text to shaded I'll just

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:39.409 
display back to text to shaded I'll just
bring<00:06:37.349> the<00:06:37.440> hips<00:06:37.590> back<00:06:37.830> up<00:06:38.069> into<00:06:38.310> position<00:06:38.520> and

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 
bring the hips back up into position and

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:41.300 
bring the hips back up into position and
I'll<00:06:39.630> reset<00:06:40.319> that<00:06:40.440> keyframe<00:06:40.919> I'll<00:06:41.099> just

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
I'll reset that keyframe I'll just

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.540 
I'll reset that keyframe I'll just
change<00:06:41.880> that<00:06:42.060> to<00:06:42.330> another<00:06:43.139> keyframe<00:06:43.410> and<00:06:43.800> if<00:06:44.490> I

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
change that to another keyframe and if I

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.529 
change that to another keyframe and if I
come<00:06:44.729> back<00:06:44.849> to<00:06:45.000> the<00:06:45.090> beginning<00:06:45.300> of<00:06:45.449> the

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
come back to the beginning of the

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.390 
come back to the beginning of the
animation<00:06:45.660> let's<00:06:46.259> see<00:06:46.440> how<00:06:46.590> that<00:06:46.650> looks<00:06:47.039> if<00:06:47.280> I

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
animation let's see how that looks if I

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.550 
animation let's see how that looks if I
just<00:06:47.610> play<00:06:48.060> it<00:06:48.210> there

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.210 

I'm<00:06:52.280> getting<00:06:52.580> some<00:06:52.910> of<00:06:53.240> the

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
I'm getting some of the

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.130 
I'm getting some of the
motion<00:06:54.640> there<00:06:54.850> some<00:06:55.090> of<00:06:55.210> its<00:06:55.360> not<00:06:55.630> quite<00:06:55.870> right

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:56.140 
motion there some of its not quite right

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.680 
motion there some of its not quite right
so<00:06:56.350> I<00:06:56.380> just<00:06:56.740> need<00:06:56.980> to<00:06:57.190> adjust<00:06:57.760> some<00:06:58.300> of<00:06:58.630> the

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
so I just need to adjust some of the

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.880 
so I just need to adjust some of the
frames<00:06:58.900> again<00:06:59.230> so<00:06:59.800> if<00:07:00.040> I<00:07:00.190> come<00:07:00.970> up<00:07:01.000> to<00:07:01.270> about

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:01.890 
frames again so if I come up to about

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.230 
frames again so if I come up to about
and<00:07:02.890> she's<00:07:03.310> really<00:07:03.790> dropped<00:07:04.030> right<00:07:04.180> down

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
and she's really dropped right down

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.429 
and she's really dropped right down
there<00:07:04.630> so<00:07:04.750> I<00:07:04.810> come<00:07:05.020> up<00:07:05.170> to<00:07:05.350> that<00:07:05.380> position

00:07:07.429 --> 00:07:07.439 
there so I come up to that position

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:10.189 
there so I come up to that position
again<00:07:08.339> bring<00:07:08.699> the<00:07:08.819> hips<00:07:08.969> up<00:07:09.179> into<00:07:09.569> position

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 
again bring the hips up into position

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:13.010 
again bring the hips up into position
and<00:07:11.099> adjust<00:07:11.459> the

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 
and adjust the

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.460 
and adjust the
rotation<00:07:13.500> this<00:07:14.430> slightly

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:16.470 
rotation this slightly

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.650 
rotation this slightly
bring<00:07:17.070> them<00:07:17.190> over<00:07:17.280> set<00:07:17.730> another<00:07:17.940> keyframe<00:07:18.210> you

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 
bring them over set another keyframe you

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.060 
bring them over set another keyframe you
can<00:07:19.080> do<00:07:19.200> this<00:07:19.350> as<00:07:19.530> you<00:07:19.650> go<00:07:19.800> all<00:07:19.920> the<00:07:20.040> way

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070 
can do this as you go all the way

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.800 
can do this as you go all the way
through<00:07:20.550> the<00:07:20.790> animation<00:07:21.060> everything<00:07:21.540> can<00:07:21.690> be

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810 
through the animation everything can be

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.570 
through the animation everything can be
adjusted<00:07:22.290> and<00:07:22.440> keyframes<00:07:22.950> can<00:07:23.160> be<00:07:23.280> tweaked

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 
adjusted and keyframes can be tweaked

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.660 
adjusted and keyframes can be tweaked
and<00:07:23.820> moved<00:07:24.600> as<00:07:24.810> you<00:07:24.960> want<00:07:25.170> to<00:07:25.350> really<00:07:25.680> so<00:07:26.340> I'm

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:26.670 
and moved as you want to really so I'm

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.270 
and moved as you want to really so I'm
just<00:07:26.910> following<00:07:27.450> the<00:07:27.750> animation<00:07:28.440> keyframe<00:07:29.040> by

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 
just following the animation keyframe by

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.160 
just following the animation keyframe by
keyframe<00:07:29.940> I'm<00:07:30.180> following<00:07:30.570> the<00:07:30.660> video<00:07:30.960> as

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:31.170 
keyframe I'm following the video as

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.890 
keyframe I'm following the video as
closely<00:07:31.440> as<00:07:31.620> I<00:07:31.800> can<00:07:32.120> this<00:07:33.120> can<00:07:33.390> take<00:07:33.570> quite<00:07:33.630> a

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:33.900 
closely as I can this can take quite a

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.390 
closely as I can this can take quite a
long<00:07:34.110> time<00:07:34.260> to<00:07:34.320> setup<00:07:34.650> so<00:07:34.950> what<00:07:35.070> I'll<00:07:35.190> do<00:07:35.370> now

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 
long time to setup so what I'll do now

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.700 
long time to setup so what I'll do now
I'll<00:07:35.730> just<00:07:35.970> pause<00:07:36.300> the<00:07:36.600> recording<00:07:36.630> and<00:07:37.320> then

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:37.710 
I'll just pause the recording and then

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.470 
I'll just pause the recording and then
I'll<00:07:37.860> set<00:07:38.250> up<00:07:38.280> the<00:07:38.460> rest<00:07:38.760> of<00:07:38.940> the<00:07:39.030> keyframes

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:39.480 
I'll set up the rest of the keyframes

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.390 
I'll set up the rest of the keyframes
and<00:07:39.720> what<00:07:39.870> I<00:07:39.900> think<00:07:40.260> is<00:07:40.350> suitable<00:07:40.680> in<00:07:40.860> betweens

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 
and what I think is suitable in betweens

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.270 
and what I think is suitable in betweens
and<00:07:41.850> then<00:07:42.090> we'll<00:07:42.450> start<00:07:42.810> again<00:07:42.960> so<00:07:43.800> that's<00:07:43.980> the

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 
and then we'll start again so that's the

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.490 
and then we'll start again so that's the
animation<00:07:45.000> finished<00:07:45.600> after<00:07:45.870> about<00:07:46.260> an<00:07:46.410> hour

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:46.500 
animation finished after about an hour

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.250 
animation finished after about an hour
of<00:07:46.710> key<00:07:47.220> framing<00:07:47.520> so<00:07:47.940> if<00:07:48.090> I<00:07:48.270> just<00:07:48.600> play<00:07:48.900> the

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:49.260 
of key framing so if I just play the

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.740 
of key framing so if I just play the
animation<00:07:49.680> back<00:07:50.160> now<00:07:50.370> and<00:07:50.790> see<00:07:51.090> that<00:07:51.120> Alison

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:51.750 
animation back now and see that Alison

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.710 
animation back now and see that Alison
is<00:07:51.900> following<00:07:52.800> fairly<00:07:53.310> closely<00:07:53.580> the<00:07:54.090> motion

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 
is following fairly closely the motion

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.170 
is following fairly closely the motion
of<00:07:54.840> hazel<00:07:55.260> and<00:07:55.410> all<00:07:56.280> that<00:07:56.670> needs<00:07:56.850> to<00:07:56.940> be<00:07:56.970> done

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.180 
of hazel and all that needs to be done

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.560 
of hazel and all that needs to be done
now<00:07:57.390> is<00:07:57.420> just<00:07:57.900> one<00:07:58.410> or<00:07:58.560> two<00:07:58.590> little<00:07:59.400> tweaks<00:08:00.030> to

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:00.570 
now is just one or two little tweaks to

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.110 
now is just one or two little tweaks to
movement<00:08:01.530> of<00:08:01.620> the<00:08:01.710> head<00:08:01.860> but<00:08:02.040> that<00:08:02.220> is<00:08:02.430> pretty

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 
movement of the head but that is pretty

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.950 
movement of the head but that is pretty
much<00:08:03.680> matching<00:08:04.680> the<00:08:04.770> video<00:08:05.010> fairly<00:08:05.370> closely

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:05.960 
much matching the video fairly closely

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.360 
much matching the video fairly closely
so<00:08:06.960> there<00:08:07.110> you<00:08:07.200> are<00:08:07.350> that's<00:08:07.530> the<00:08:07.860> wave<00:08:08.070> using

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:08.370 
so there you are that's the wave using

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:13.040 
so there you are that's the wave using
keyframes<00:08:08.940> to<00:08:09.210> match<00:08:09.420> your<00:08:09.780> motion<00:08:10.620> capture
