and<00:00:33.340> in<00:00:33.790> a<00:00:33.850> way<00:00:34.000> it's<00:00:34.149> not<00:00:34.329> surprising<00:00:34.540> that

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
and in a way it's not surprising that

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.989 
and in a way it's not surprising that
this<00:00:36.610> low-grade<00:00:37.320> flicker<00:00:38.320> on<00:00:38.530> FOMA<00:00:39.040> can<00:00:39.579> very

this low-grade flicker on FOMA can very

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:42.919 
this low-grade flicker on FOMA can very

so<00:00:49.890> immunohistochemistry<00:00:50.890> is<00:00:51.329> particularly

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
so immunohistochemistry is particularly

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.649 
so immunohistochemistry is particularly

diagnosis<00:00:56.289> out<00:00:57.179> we<00:00:58.179> can<00:00:58.329> stay<00:00:58.510> at<00:00:58.600> low

pattern<00:01:01.149> and<00:01:01.499> here<00:01:02.499> you<00:01:02.589> see<00:01:02.800> that<00:01:02.949> all<00:01:03.219> the

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
pattern and here you see that all the

pattern and here you see that all the
follicles<00:01:04.239> are<00:01:04.570> strongly<00:01:05.199> positive<00:01:05.440> for

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
follicles are strongly positive for

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.370 
follicles are strongly positive for
bcl-2<00:01:06.550> protein<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.240> we<00:01:07.360> know<00:01:07.540> that<00:01:07.960> by

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
bcl-2 protein and we know that by

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.830 
bcl-2 protein and we know that by
contrast<00:01:09.000> reactive<00:01:10.000> follicles<00:01:10.540> are

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
contrast reactive follicles are

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.249 
contrast reactive follicles are
selectively<00:01:11.490> negative<00:01:12.490> for<00:01:12.700> bcl-2<00:01:13.360> so<00:01:14.049> this

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
selectively negative for bcl-2 so this

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.219 
selectively negative for bcl-2 so this
is<00:01:14.619> very<00:01:15.070> strong<00:01:15.430> evidence<00:01:15.670> that<00:01:16.180> this<00:01:16.990> is

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
is very strong evidence that this is

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.969 
is very strong evidence that this is
follicular<00:01:18.070> lymphoma<00:01:19.439> another<00:01:20.439> marker<00:01:20.829> we

follicular lymphoma another marker we
have<00:01:21.100> found<00:01:21.369> to<00:01:22.299> be<00:01:22.450> very<00:01:22.930> valuable<00:01:23.110> as<00:01:23.649> well

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070

you<00:01:31.570> will<00:01:31.689> come<00:01:31.899> upon<00:01:32.200> this<00:01:32.460> differential

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
you will come upon this differential

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.090 
you will come upon this differential
many<00:01:33.820> times<00:01:34.149> in<00:01:34.539> your<00:01:34.950> residency<00:01:35.950> training

many times in your residency training

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.450 
many times in your residency training
program<00:01:36.729> and<00:01:37.000> as<00:01:37.689> you<00:01:37.869> can<00:01:37.990> see<00:01:38.049> this<00:01:38.710> marker

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
program and as you can see this marker

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.670 
program and as you can see this marker
and<00:01:39.670> this<00:01:39.850> application<00:01:40.659> shows<00:01:41.229> a<00:01:41.259> low

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
and this application shows a low

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.670 
and this application shows a low
labeling<00:01:42.420> totally<00:01:43.420> unlike<00:01:43.750> that<00:01:43.960> of<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.320> nine

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
labeling totally unlike that of the nine

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.039 
labeling totally unlike that of the nine
follicular<00:01:45.640> hyperplasia<00:01:46.180> which<00:01:46.600> four

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
follicular hyperplasia which four

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.690 
follicular hyperplasia which four
follicles<00:01:47.500> this<00:01:47.649> size<00:01:47.890> would<00:01:48.100> be<00:01:48.159> very<00:01:48.460> high

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
follicles this size would be very high

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.480 
follicles this size would be very high
so<00:01:49.479> now<00:01:49.689> we<00:01:49.750> have<00:01:49.990> two<00:01:50.229> lines<00:01:50.679> of<00:01:51.009> very<00:01:51.250> strong

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
so now we have two lines of very strong

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.060 
so now we have two lines of very strong
evidence<00:01:51.750> allowing<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.929> definitive<00:01:53.469> diagnosis

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
evidence allowing a definitive diagnosis

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.840 
evidence allowing a definitive diagnosis
in<00:01:54.219> this<00:01:54.310> case<00:01:54.549> of<00:01:54.899> liquid<00:01:55.899> or<00:01:56.049> in<00:01:56.320> foam
