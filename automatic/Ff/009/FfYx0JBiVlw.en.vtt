00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:15.959
 Plan to sell the admission ticket I saw first 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:17.490
 It was 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.599
 For Matsuo, one shot &amp; performance model 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.769
 I was a student who majored in 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.729
 Then, when you enter the company, the person who worked in your own work 

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:30.199
 The weak and the first 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.060
 I have a choice 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.219
 In terms of performance 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:34.540
 Good model 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.390
 After the bus 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.480
 Well there were up to three roles in 6009001200, but 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.050
 It's not like I'm talking about an-base, so I can't beat it 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.120
 I have a minute to shine 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.120
 I feel like being a model 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.050
 strongest 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.910
 First of all 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.150
 It was the fastest and the fastest until dyeing. 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.490
 But it has been sold 300 kg and is said to be the strongest horse 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.570
 Oh, it changed once, but 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.620
 It is quite arguable in the place of saying what is the strongest 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.540
 I think there is 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.219
 If now 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.310
 You will reach that 300km 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.490
 The biggest one is the strongest 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.280
 Among them, the cornering property is good. 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.450
 The strongest as a different performance 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.450
 I think that I will seek in the future 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.200
 After all I want to make such a car in my own 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.910
 Childcare charges for this year 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.260
 It was dismantling 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.900
 That's why 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.700
 I think it is Naito 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.159
 Toward what you want 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.210
 While listening to everyone's opinion of making that, 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.370
 Run but 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.160
 It's a part of a mile of app scaler development 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.650
 You 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.830
 After all I have to get my heart 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.830
 Hold the place firmly 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.739
 I think that it will be the place to seek while angry 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.739
 is 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:26.649
 True strongest 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:27.929
 Better place 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:31.039
 1 First of all, what should be the strongest 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.879
 I discussed in the comics, but 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.849
 After all I think that acceleration made more than I can sing that highest speed 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.139
 By the way 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:41.379
 Also multiple 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.430
 I can do this but I will 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.989
 After all that 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.169
 It was easy to use for everyday use and easy to ride on rainy days 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.399
 Where to go 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.309
 I think it will be self-catering and form 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:54.459
 so 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.679
 Before that more good than that ninja is 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.150
 Of course it can be used for 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.799
 Because there is 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.799
 Well such a place while raising a book 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.279
 Is that traveling 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:08.739
 Visit a farmer 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.749
 The best of spring against 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:12.699
 In a place called school 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:16.109
 Where do you take that drop? 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.759
 In fact, it is hard to say that we will balance in 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:21.759
 Did 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:29.769
 This is also before I get under the meeting 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.909
 It's an image on the left but 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.150
 After all, it's a true hall 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:39.749
 Does it mean to move between customers in a certain sense? 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.819
 If you can do it, it will have the best sound 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.799
 I think it was on the top end model of Marriott 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:49.689
 Yes 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.439
 Go around like a hall 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.579
 The character is also so 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.409
 It is so with Michael and the moon. 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.469
 You say that you are very fond of 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:00.619
 That place 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:03.519
 Targeted as that castella 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:04.590
 I want to go away
