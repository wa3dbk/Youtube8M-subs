00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.450
 this good here my sealer I 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.980
 made 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.630
 I'll show her how it works later. 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:16.170
 I give an explanation about how she 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:21.660
 it works only here in the open just put 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:56.539
 here wait wait a while that goes 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:56.539
 be there one more time 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:28.040
 good to be a caretaker there I have 38cm 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.040
 medium 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:58.050
 the zipper actor 14 good to warm 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:02.370
 resistances that have a resistance to 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:09.500
 On top of it is this Teflon ribbon that 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:16.400
 plastic does not stick when melt 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.400
 resistance is 32 centimeters 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:29.330
 more or less to show in this case with 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:38.270
 that two balls I found in iron 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:40.789
 old ii and here is good for her basis 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.050
 I used a piece of mdf from a 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.050
 one and a half thick 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.830
 here on the sides that makes the joint 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.979
 I used two brackets in l format 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:08.889
 this way to do the articulation 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.639
 here also have two balls to make the 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.639
 return 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.200
 here I learned from the rivet 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.879
 which makes the resistance try this 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:47.069
 computer ac source 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:51.029
 I have a video teaching how you 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:55.520
 is to use it in a case that I 12 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:55.520
 volts which is black and yellow 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:12.870
 here where I made the amendment between 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:14.300
 resistance and the source is good here has a 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:24.389
 light switch 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:26.789
 it is he who binds the senator only when 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:31.999
 this point was pressed to lower this 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:31.999
 here the source gaga 

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:42.180
 then I turn it off then the 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:44.849
 resistance always cold season and she only 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.680
 starts operating when it is below 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:50.389
 on here 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.389
 off when it returns 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:58.219
 You can see the car running when 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:08.629
 below 

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:08.629
 it was hung here 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.560
 good just to close the video leaves the 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.840
 clearer explanation 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.450
 I did a schematic drawing of how 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.120
 the senator is working 

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:33.350
 the fifth of the power supply of 12 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:37.920
 volts where computer 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:43.220
 then you will get a black wire and a wire 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.220
 green and put the switch on them 2 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.950
 Does it have an engine that will power on and 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:54.000
 turn off the senator 

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:58.530
 then you will get the black wire and the 

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:03.830
 yellow to turn on resistance both 

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:03.830
 make order is black and yellow 

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:11.400
 the resistance will warm up and go 

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:14.900
 melt plastic and make stick to the 

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.900
 another closing the bag
