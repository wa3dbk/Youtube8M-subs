00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.910
 not four mix10 so with a record 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.770
 interchangeable we took different 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.529
 targets so has a ferrous a ring in 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.640
 money a small area one could 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.200
 add taxes eventually 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.320
 could do after and a beautiful 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.420
 of aluminum so the 4 mx who pays for his 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.660
 two-story double disc 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.540
 discrimination so there it is settled on 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.220
 a discrimination of ferrous so in 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:49.680
 first discrimination on the first 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:52.050
 advantage that takes aluminum a little 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.550
 Trigger taste the trigger is not 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.649
 obvious stopped to have it's until 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.130
 fingertip a little trigger 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:03.809
 we will eliminate aluminum and keep 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:07.020
 the signal on the gold and will leave on 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:11.899
 the money so here we will do baltÃ¨s de 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:16.200
 the board with a small area 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:25.380
 discrimination at the bottom of ferrous 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:27.860
 minimum so on leucate enix we are not 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.630
 at full power 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.630
 yes no worries about the young girl 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.630
 makes sweaters or will be monstration 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.920
 we can go faster to laugh not 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.610
 from which there is no problem to a device 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.610
 who very responsive 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:59.280
 proof is to put the different 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.479
 targets here like this 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:14.310
 this may be adding another 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:18.180
 here is the cooked here is my discrimination 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.520
 on the serious about aluminum first 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.060
 floor is not discriminate on 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.060
 pull the trigger 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.560
 that's no problem 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.290
 the 4 mx down as his big brother on the 6th 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.070
 mx so it's always a cane 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.450
 in two parts a double disc of 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.440
 sensitivity settings rare august it's 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.140
 here the discrimination one that we will settle 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.060
 here a discrimination 2 that is not 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.090
 obvious in detection since we have to 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.430
 of voice to switch to the 2nd district 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.120
 like this and here we have the pinpointe 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:02.700
 and setting the ground effect in 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:05.040
 automatic or by counting so in 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.739
 turning here as a rule in the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.920
 sector is on a setting between 5 and 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.220
 6 about 1 the detachable housing 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.720
 possibility to put the belt 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.810
 the negative point it will seem a little 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.920
 little heavy 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.989
 my by cons with wearing at the 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.790
 belt and yoka worries and the can who gets 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.890
 dismounts when two parts the big 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.600
 advantage 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.870
 here it is enough to do that we can 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:35.549
 change disc and possibly m 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:39.299
 so the concentrics instead so 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:42.209
 it's a device worth less than 550 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.220
 17 kg very responsive with two 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.700
 floors and discrimination it's pretty much 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.910
 near the equivalent of tesoro tj11 or 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.380
 theron in the same frequency here at 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.380
 soon on the forum tec 59
