00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 to make this paper flower there is 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:14.490
 need a paper towel a 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:18.720
 three veils a pair of scissors and one 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.439
 stapler fold the napkin of 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:27.650
 paper 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:27.650
 in this way we repeat it again 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:37.890
 we fold it once again arrived at 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:42.079
 this point we turn it and fold the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.480
 limbo to the outside 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.480
 taking our scissors 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:55.550
 we cut in an arc 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.550
 our handkerchief creating the petal 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.420
 once this is done we eliminate the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:12.479
 excess paper and open ours 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:16.170
 flower that will turn out so now 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:20.130
 let's take close down 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.190
 let's take the stapler and we think the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.830
 bottom 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:31.580
 once this is done we reopen the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:36.119
 flower and we try very patiently to 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:43.619
 open all the petals you are 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:45.320
 formed one at a time done the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.280
 our flower 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.280
 the card then I put the candidate in a joke 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.320
 will be terminated 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.320
 here is the final result
