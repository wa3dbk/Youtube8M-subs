one<00:06:12.129> of<00:06:12.159> the<00:06:12.370> reasons<00:06:12.819> I<00:06:12.969> got<00:06:13.210> this<00:06:13.419> new<00:06:13.659> phone

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
one of the reasons I got this new phone

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.230 
one of the reasons I got this new phone
was<00:06:14.259> so<00:06:14.469> that<00:06:14.649> I<00:06:14.680> could<00:06:14.770> do<00:06:15.099> YouTube<00:06:15.520> videos<00:06:15.969> on

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
was so that I could do YouTube videos on

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.230 
was so that I could do YouTube videos on
the<00:06:16.270> fly<00:06:16.629> but<00:06:17.020> I<00:06:17.229> can't<00:06:17.889> be<00:06:18.129> on<00:06:18.339> the<00:06:18.520> fly<00:06:18.789> if<00:06:19.029> I'm

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
the fly but I can't be on the fly if I'm

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.879 
the fly but I can't be on the fly if I'm
like<00:06:19.509> at<00:06:20.169> the<00:06:20.500> USS<00:06:21.129> Intrepid<00:06:21.159> and<00:06:22.149> I<00:06:23.020> gotta

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 
like at the USS Intrepid and I gotta

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.159 
like at the USS Intrepid and I gotta
wait<00:06:24.189> until<00:06:24.550> I<00:06:24.580> get<00:06:24.699> a<00:06:24.879> Wi-Fi<00:06:25.539> signal<00:06:25.839> to

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
wait until I get a Wi-Fi signal to

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.320 
wait until I get a Wi-Fi signal to
upload<00:06:26.589> the<00:06:26.830> video<00:06:27.159> which<00:06:27.399> sucks<00:06:28.000> because

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
upload the video which sucks because

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.860 
upload the video which sucks because
it's<00:06:28.689> not<00:06:28.960> on<00:06:29.289> the<00:06:29.439> fly<00:06:29.680> it's<00:06:29.949> not<00:06:30.189> live

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
it's not on the fly it's not live

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.629 
it's not on the fly it's not live
basically

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.249 

all<00:06:35.639> right<00:06:35.789> I<00:06:36.090> think<00:06:36.270> that's<00:06:36.659> everything

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259 
all right I think that's everything

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:40.309
