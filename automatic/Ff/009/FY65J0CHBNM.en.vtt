00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.720 

I'm<00:00:07.200> ready<00:00:08.809> it's<00:00:09.809> been<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.080> while<00:00:10.349> since<00:00:10.769> I've

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
I'm ready it's been a while since I've

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.460 
I'm ready it's been a while since I've
had<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.940> video<00:00:12.240> put<00:00:13.080> up<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> deal<00:00:13.820> truck<00:00:15.470> the

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
had a video put up the deal truck the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.260 
had a video put up the deal truck the
last<00:00:16.710> one<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.580> test<00:00:17.940> drive<00:00:18.920> and<00:00:19.920> I'd<00:00:20.850> realized

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
last one was test drive and I'd realized

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.910 
last one was test drive and I'd realized
that<00:00:21.570> was<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> round<00:00:22.170> four<00:00:22.410> wheel<00:00:22.560> Jamboree

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
that was a round four wheel Jamboree

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.740 
that was a round four wheel Jamboree
time<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.730> didn't<00:00:24.000> really<00:00:24.119> have<00:00:24.269> time<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.539> get

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
time so I didn't really have time to get

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.120 
time so I didn't really have time to get
into<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.250> but<00:00:26.250> uh<00:00:26.810> since<00:00:27.810> then<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.349> have

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
into it but uh since then I have

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.060 
into it but uh since then I have
installed<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.150> Holley<00:00:30.720> Dominator<00:00:31.070> single

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
installed a Holley Dominator single

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.940 
installed a Holley Dominator single
single<00:00:33.059> plane<00:00:33.239> intake<00:00:33.540> manifold<00:00:34.530> instead<00:00:34.829> of

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
single plane intake manifold instead of

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.639 
single plane intake manifold instead of
the<00:00:35.010> dual<00:00:35.160> plane<00:00:35.899> what<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.930> discovered<00:00:37.469> when<00:00:37.590> I

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the dual plane what I discovered when I

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.790 
the dual plane what I discovered when I
was<00:00:37.920> changing<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.000> take<00:00:39.629> manifolds

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
was changing and take manifolds

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.740 
was changing and take manifolds
the<00:00:41.250> other<00:00:41.370> one<00:00:41.520> was<00:00:41.640> leaking<00:00:42.090> severely<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.960> I

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
the other one was leaking severely and I

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.090 
the other one was leaking severely and I
wasn't<00:00:45.750> getting<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.989> whole<00:00:46.140> lot<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.440> vacuum<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
wasn't getting a whole lot of vacuum to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.090 
wasn't getting a whole lot of vacuum to
the<00:00:47.210> brake<00:00:48.210> system<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.680> was<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.950> main

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the brake system and that was the main

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.819 
the brake system and that was the main
reason<00:00:50.460> for<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.789> change<00:00:51.320> also<00:00:52.320> with<00:00:52.680> this

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
reason for that change also with this

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.520 
reason for that change also with this
intake<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.370> put<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> one<00:00:54.180> inch<00:00:54.360> spacer<00:00:55.350> in

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
intake I put a one inch spacer in

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.869 
intake I put a one inch spacer in
between<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:57.949> intake<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.370> carburetor

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
between it the intake in the carburetor

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.560 
between it the intake in the carburetor
give<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.059> 10<00:01:03.329> degrees<00:01:03.629> advance<00:01:05.299> how<00:01:06.299> well<00:01:06.479> you

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
give it 10 degrees advance how well you

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.929 
give it 10 degrees advance how well you
can<00:01:06.689> see<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.900> since<00:01:07.110> everything's<00:01:07.530> black<00:01:07.939> but

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
can see it since everything's black but

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.690 
can see it since everything's black but
uh<00:01:08.970> yeah<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.409> world<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.040> difference<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
uh yeah it's a world of difference the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.460 
uh yeah it's a world of difference the
response<00:01:12.390> time<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.350> off<00:01:13.770> idle<00:01:14.040> position

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
response time and the off idle position

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.200 
response time and the off idle position
is<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.530> lot<00:01:16.770> better<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.610> also<00:01:17.880> hear

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
is a lot better and you can also hear

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.020 
is a lot better and you can also hear
the<00:01:18.360> cam<00:01:18.810> profile<00:01:19.320> better<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.040> also<00:01:20.640> discovered

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
the cam profile better I also discovered

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.719 
the cam profile better I also discovered
when<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.659> took<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.080> intake<00:01:22.439> manifold<00:01:23.009> off<00:01:23.250> that

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
when I took the intake manifold off that

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.560 
when I took the intake manifold off that
one<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.570> my<00:01:24.780> lifters<00:01:25.530> had<00:01:26.159> jumped<00:01:26.610> out<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.000> I

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
one of my lifters had jumped out and I

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.410 
one of my lifters had jumped out and I
had<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> bent<00:01:28.049> pushrod<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.850> one<00:01:29.850> intake<00:01:30.150> valve

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
had a bent pushrod so one intake valve

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.520 
had a bent pushrod so one intake valve
was<00:01:30.780> not<00:01:30.810> working<00:01:31.409> at<00:01:31.530> all<00:01:31.729> which<00:01:32.729> left<00:01:33.000> me<00:01:33.210> a

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
was not working at all which left me a

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:41.090 
was not working at all which left me a
v7<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:35.400> uh<00:01:36.470> that<00:01:37.470> also<00:01:37.799> was<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:40.650> reason<00:01:40.950> why<00:01:41.070> I

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
v7 but uh that also was the reason why I

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.920 
v7 but uh that also was the reason why I
barely<00:01:41.490> had<00:01:41.729> any<00:01:41.880> brakes

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.090 

because<00:01:47.930> that<00:01:48.110> intake<00:01:48.439> valve<00:01:48.649> is<00:01:48.829> the<00:01:48.950> one

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
because that intake valve is the one

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.830 
because that intake valve is the one
that<00:01:49.280> provided<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.149> vacuum<00:01:50.509> to<00:01:50.720> the

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.480 

the<00:01:53.960> vacuum<00:01:54.619> for<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:54.859> bricks

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:40.339 

thank<00:01:58.729> you

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.220 

to<00:02:40.829> give<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.159> a<00:02:41.189> tag<00:02:41.640> here

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:03:13.370 

it's<00:02:44.920> roughly<00:02:45.220> idling<00:02:45.790> around<00:02:46.470> 500

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:37.600 

get<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.680> up<00:03:13.770> here<00:03:13.920> into<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.130> Cameron

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:58.530 

as<00:03:38.090> you<00:03:38.330> can<00:03:38.480> still<00:03:38.630> still<00:03:39.050> quite<00:03:39.650> cold

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.530 

that's<00:03:59.080> about<00:03:59.319> it

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
that's about it

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.660 
that's about it
that's<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.650> only<00:04:01.739> upgrades<00:04:02.129> I've<00:04:02.280> done<00:04:02.459> so

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
that's the only upgrades I've done so

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.820 
that's the only upgrades I've done so
far<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:03.150> really<00:04:03.659> had<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.840> whole<00:04:04.050> time<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.440> really

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
far I really had a whole time to really

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.170 
far I really had a whole time to really
play<00:04:05.069> with<00:04:05.250> it<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.489> get<00:04:05.580> it<00:04:05.670> out<00:04:05.790> on<00:04:05.819> the<00:04:05.940> road

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
play with it and get it out on the road

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.300 
play with it and get it out on the road
yet<00:04:06.420> too<00:04:06.720> much<00:04:07.640> overtime<00:04:08.640> will<00:04:08.909> do<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:10.310> and

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
yet too much overtime will do that and

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.160 
yet too much overtime will do that and
