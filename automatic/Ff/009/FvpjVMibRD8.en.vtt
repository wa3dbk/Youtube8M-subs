things i own which is two blushes and a
concealer<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.430> one<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> cream<00:00:17.940> blush<00:00:18.090> and

concealer and one is a cream blush and

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.759 
concealer and one is a cream blush and
was<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> powder<00:00:19.770> blush<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.820> cream<00:00:21.060> blush<00:00:21.300> is

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
was a powder blush so the cream blush is

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.900 
was a powder blush so the cream blush is
called<00:00:22.769> beaming<00:00:23.720> and<00:00:25.279> this<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.430> what<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.609> looks

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
called beaming and this is what it looks

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.370 
called beaming and this is what it looks
like<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.269> thought<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.570> would<00:00:27.660> be<00:00:27.750> fun<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:27.990> own<00:00:28.289> a

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
like I thought it would be fun to own a

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.260 
like I thought it would be fun to own a
cream<00:00:28.680> blush<00:00:28.800> because<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.869> don't<00:00:30.869> own<00:00:30.960> any<00:00:31.219> and

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
cream blush because I don't own any and

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.639 
cream blush because I don't own any and
so<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.300> don't<00:00:33.600> really<00:00:33.630> have<00:00:33.809> very<00:00:33.989> much<00:00:34.380> to

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
so I don't really have very much to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.190 
so I don't really have very much to
compare<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:36.360> nice<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.870> creamy

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
compare it to but it's nice and creamy

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.400 
compare it to but it's nice and creamy
and<00:00:38.149> here's<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.270> little<00:00:39.300> swatch<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.200> here

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
and here's a little swatch of it here

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.750 
and here's a little swatch of it here
that's<00:00:43.410> what<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.649> looks<00:00:43.829> like<00:00:44.070> except<00:00:44.610> of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
that's what it looks like except of

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.869 
that's what it looks like except of
course<00:00:44.789> even<00:00:45.390> blend<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.789> a

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
course even blend it in it's just like a

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.389 
course even blend it in it's just like a
nice<00:00:48.180> soft<00:00:49.170> pink<00:00:49.620> shade<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:52.129> think<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.280> would

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
nice soft pink shade I think it would

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.900 
nice soft pink shade I think it would
work<00:00:53.430> for<00:00:53.910> most<00:00:54.120> people<00:00:54.829> so<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.280> nice<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.520> it

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
work for most people so it's nice and it

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.049 
work for most people so it's nice and it
blends<00:00:57.180> well<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:58.079> everything<00:00:58.760> I've<00:00:59.760> only

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.020 
blends well and everything I've only
used<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.829> handful<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.920> times<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.520> i<00:01:02.579> like<00:01:02.850> it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.640 
it's just too sparkly or the particular
sparkle<00:02:46.280> in<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:46.790> cuz<00:02:47.150> i<00:02:47.299> love<00:02:47.840> sparkly<00:02:48.350> brush

sparkle in this cuz i love sparkly brush
blushes<00:02:49.549> i<00:02:49.850> have<00:02:50.360> quite<00:02:50.569> a<00:02:50.630> few<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.260> wear

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.440 
blushes i have quite a few and I wear
them<00:02:51.650> regularly<00:02:52.130> so<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:52.700> think<00:02:53.060> it's<00:02:53.180> just<00:02:53.269> the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
them regularly so I think it's just the

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.050 
them regularly so I think it's just the
sparkle<00:02:54.080> in<00:02:54.260> this<00:02:54.530> it's<00:02:54.830> like<00:02:54.980> too<00:02:55.250> big<00:02:55.670> or

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
sparkle in this it's like too big or

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.940 
sparkle in this it's like too big or
something<00:02:56.290> something<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.410> wrong<00:02:57.620> with<00:02:57.830> it

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
something something is wrong with it

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.000 
something something is wrong with it
that<00:02:58.190> makes<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:58.640> hard<00:02:59.269> to<00:02:59.480> wear<00:02:59.690> for<00:03:00.470> me<00:03:00.650> so

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
that makes it hard to wear for me so

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.539 
that makes it hard to wear for me so
that's<00:03:01.370> that<00:03:01.640> is<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:02.120> surreal<00:03:03.310> pressed<00:03:04.310> powder

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
that's that is a surreal pressed powder

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.979 
that's that is a surreal pressed powder
blush<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.590> last<00:03:06.799> one<00:03:07.130> I<00:03:07.160> have<00:03:07.430> is<00:03:07.989> the

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
blush and the last one I have is the

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.800

all-over brightener fast fix concealer

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.110 
all-over brightener fast fix concealer
and<00:03:12.459> it's<00:03:13.459> just<00:03:13.640> like<00:03:13.820> a<00:03:13.850> nice<00:03:14.150> light<00:03:14.660> purple

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
and it's just like a nice light purple

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.020 
and it's just like a nice light purple
kind<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.209> a<00:03:17.329> lavender<00:03:17.720> color<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.880> it's<00:03:19.880> the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
kind of a lavender color and it's the

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.180 
kind of a lavender color and it's the
same<00:03:20.329> texture<00:03:20.840> as<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.350> cream<00:03:21.590> blush<00:03:21.829> it's

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
same texture as the cream blush it's

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.870 
same texture as the cream blush it's
it's<00:03:22.549> creamy<00:03:23.090> it's<00:03:23.440> not<00:03:26.500> it's<00:03:27.500> not<00:03:27.530> very<00:03:27.890> thick

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
it's creamy it's not it's not very thick

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.090 
it's creamy it's not it's not very thick
or<00:03:29.390> pigmented<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:30.290> know<00:03:30.380> this<00:03:30.590> is<00:03:30.739> kind<00:03:30.950> of<00:03:30.980> like

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
or pigmented I know this is kind of like

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.500 
or pigmented I know this is kind of like
a<00:03:31.160> lot<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.579> product<00:03:32.000> but<00:03:33.730> if<00:03:34.730> i<00:03:34.910> were<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.209> put<00:03:35.390> it

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
a lot of product but if i were to put it

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.729 
a lot of product but if i were to put it
on<00:03:35.630> and<00:03:36.579> kind<00:03:37.579> of<00:03:37.700> blend<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.690> blend<00:03:39.220> right<00:03:40.220> out

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
on and kind of blend and blend right out

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.470 
on and kind of blend and blend right out
so<00:03:42.739> this<00:03:43.220> is<00:03:43.250> not<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:43.700> kind<00:03:43.880> of<00:03:43.940> concealer

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
so this is not the kind of concealer

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.810 
so this is not the kind of concealer
that<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.750> use<00:03:44.989> to<00:03:45.019> like<00:03:45.470> cover<00:03:46.250> up<00:03:46.519> something

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
that you use to like cover up something

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
that you use to like cover up something
major<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:48.519> for<00:03:49.519> that<00:03:49.640> reason<00:03:49.700> probably<00:03:50.359> not

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
major and for that reason probably not

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.880 
major and for that reason probably not
great<00:03:51.319> for<00:03:51.799> underneath<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:53.390> eye<00:03:53.420> area

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
great for underneath the eye area

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.069 
great for underneath the eye area
because<00:03:54.890> it's<00:03:55.100> just<00:03:55.160> too<00:03:55.400> sheer<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.150> also<00:03:56.959> the

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
because it's just too sheer and also the

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.920 
because it's just too sheer and also the
fact<00:03:57.319> that<00:03:57.500> it's<00:03:57.739> purple<00:03:58.220> i<00:03:58.459> think<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.480> know<00:03:59.510> a

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
fact that it's purple i think you know a

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.140 
fact that it's purple i think you know a
lot<00:04:00.319> of<00:04:00.380> times<00:04:00.680> under<00:04:01.040> eye<00:04:01.069> circles<00:04:01.160> that

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
lot of times under eye circles that

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.490 
lot of times under eye circles that
you're<00:04:02.329> trying<00:04:02.569> to<00:04:02.630> cover<00:04:02.810> up<00:04:02.959> tent<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.380> be

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
you're trying to cover up tent to be

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.069 
you're trying to cover up tent to be
purple<00:04:03.889> to<00:04:04.069> begin<00:04:04.250> with<00:04:04.549> so<00:04:04.930> probably<00:04:05.930> don't

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
purple to begin with so probably don't

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.319 
purple to begin with so probably don't
want<00:04:06.230> to<00:04:06.260> use<00:04:06.319> that<00:04:06.650> color<00:04:06.859> there<00:04:07.220> but<00:04:07.489> it<00:04:08.030> does

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
want to use that color there but it does

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.420 
want to use that color there but it does
make<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.569> nice<00:04:08.840> brightener<00:04:09.440> if<00:04:09.739> you<00:04:10.100> want<00:04:10.310> to

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
you know put it in the corn

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.429
