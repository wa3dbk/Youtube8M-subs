00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
good Costa Rican side that in my

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.530 
good Costa Rican side that in my

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
a lot of guys pretty quick so i think we

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.170 
a lot of guys pretty quick so i think we
fell<00:03:18.200> apart<00:03:18.470> mentally<00:03:19.340> i<00:03:19.580> think<00:03:19.940> once<00:03:20.090> we

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
fell apart mentally i think once we

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.150 
fell apart mentally i think once we
scored<00:03:20.510> once<00:03:20.660> they<00:03:20.810> scored<00:03:21.110> we<00:03:21.800> let<00:03:21.980> down<00:03:22.130> a

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
little bit and give credit to them they

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.370 
little bit and give credit to them they
finish<00:03:25.610> opportunities<00:03:26.120> troy<00:03:26.870> made<00:03:27.050> some<00:03:27.260> nice

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
finish opportunities troy made some nice

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.900 
finish opportunities troy made some nice
saves<00:03:27.680> back-to-back<00:03:28.310> in<00:03:28.460> a<00:03:28.520> row<00:03:28.610> but<00:03:28.730> looked

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
saves back-to-back in a row but looked

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.370 
saves back-to-back in a row but looked
like<00:03:29.000> there<00:03:29.120> was<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.240> little<00:03:29.390> confusion<00:03:29.480> on<00:03:30.290> the

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
like there was a little confusion on the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.350 
like there was a little confusion on the
offside<00:03:30.680> trap

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
offside trap

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.230

yeah<00:03:33.400> we<00:03:34.400> just<00:03:34.490> got<00:03:34.700> opened<00:03:35.000> up<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:35.300> I<00:03:35.360> think

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
yeah we just got opened up and I think

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.580 
yeah we just got opened up and I think
maybe<00:03:38.240> lack<00:03:38.480> of<00:03:38.600> experience<00:03:38.870> in<00:03:39.230> some<00:03:39.440> big

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
maybe lack of experience in some big

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.700 
maybe lack of experience in some big
games<00:03:39.800> that<00:03:40.960> you<00:03:41.960> know<00:03:42.050> we<00:03:42.170> kind<00:03:42.320> of<00:03:42.350> lost<00:03:42.500> our
