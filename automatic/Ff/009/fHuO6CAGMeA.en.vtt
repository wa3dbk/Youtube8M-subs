all day and night and can just play and
relive<00:00:48.360> my<00:00:48.510> childhood<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.469> think<00:00:50.280> about

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
relive my childhood and think about

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.720 
relive my childhood and think about
times<00:00:51.480> when<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.930> had<00:00:52.170> no<00:00:52.530> responsibilities<00:00:53.430> at

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
times when I had no responsibilities at

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.770 
times when I had no responsibilities at
all<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.360> life<00:00:55.039> and<00:00:56.090> as<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.149> previously

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
all in life and as I previously

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.170 
all in life and as I previously
mentioned<00:00:58.109> I'm<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.890> graduate<00:00:59.370> student<00:00:59.969> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
mentioned I'm a graduate student and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.299 
mentioned I'm a graduate student and
would<00:01:00.690> not<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:01.050> able<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.320> afford<00:01:01.829> this

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
would not be able to afford this

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.039 
would not be able to afford this
otherwise<00:01:03.030> unless<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.989> was<00:01:04.110> given<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.500> me<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
otherwise unless it was given to me and

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.140 
otherwise unless it was given to me and
the<00:01:07.049> second<00:01:07.409> reason<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:08.100> actually<00:01:08.880> kind<00:01:09.060> of

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
the second reason is actually kind of

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.609 
the second reason is actually kind of
funny<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.450> you're<00:01:09.750> having<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.170> contest

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
funny that you're having this contest

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.149 
funny that you're having this contest
now<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.700> my<00:01:11.939> best<00:01:12.180> guy<00:01:12.450> friend<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.200> college<00:01:13.530> had

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159

not<00:01:55.560> really<00:01:55.770> into<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.189> type<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.670> stuff<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
not really into that type of stuff and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.020 
not really into that type of stuff and
didn't<00:01:58.590> realize<00:01:59.009> he<00:01:59.280> was<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.820> or

problem<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.299> do<00:02:03.360> feel<00:02:03.689> bad<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.680> think<00:02:04.979> it

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
problem but I do feel bad so I think it

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.370 
problem but I do feel bad so I think it
would<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.189> great<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.820> get<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.090> n64<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.079> then

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
would be great if I get the n64 and then

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.580 
would be great if I get the n64 and then
I<00:02:07.710> could<00:02:08.750> invite<00:02:09.750> him<00:02:09.899> over<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.319> can<00:02:10.379> play
