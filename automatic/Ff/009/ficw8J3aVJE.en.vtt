store<00:02:09.320> so<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:09.950> wanted<00:02:10.310> something<00:02:10.369> that<00:02:10.850> was

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
store so I wanted something that was

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.020 
store so I wanted something that was
actually<00:02:11.800> portable<00:02:12.800> enough<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.340> make<00:02:13.670> sense

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
actually portable enough to make sense

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.390 
actually portable enough to make sense
for<00:02:14.210> it<00:02:14.240> to<00:02:14.360> be<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.660> multi-tool<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.710> second

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
for it to be a multi-tool and second

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.500 
for it to be a multi-tool and second
when<00:02:16.520> I<00:02:16.550> was<00:02:16.760> checking<00:02:17.030> out<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.390> different

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
when I was checking out the different

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.620 
when I was checking out the different
models<00:02:18.140> like<00:02:18.350> some<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:18.830> them<00:02:19.040> had<00:02:19.580> like<00:02:19.910> just

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
models like some of them had like just

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.280 
models like some of them had like just
janky<00:02:21.290> like<00:02:22.120> like<00:02:23.120> packet<00:02:23.690> would<00:02:23.840> handle

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
janky like like packet would handle

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.940 
janky like like packet would handle
scales<00:02:24.700> like<00:02:25.700> uneven<00:02:26.450> uneven<00:02:26.660> wood<00:02:27.530> scales

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
its size so that peaked my interest so I

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.210 
its size so that peaked my interest so I
got<00:02:52.400> one<00:02:52.610> of<00:02:52.760> these<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:54.440> is<00:02:54.500> actually<00:02:55.190> a

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
got one of these and it is actually a

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.810 
got one of these and it is actually a
good<00:02:55.550> usable<00:02:56.239> little<00:02:56.750> mini<00:02:57.020> hammer<00:02:57.820> tool

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
good usable little mini hammer tool

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.180 
good usable little mini hammer tool
mainly<00:02:59.300> because<00:02:59.600> it<00:02:59.780> just<00:03:00.050> it's<00:03:00.620> just<00:03:00.770> more

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
mainly because it just it's just more

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.030 
mainly because it just it's just more
solid<00:03:01.840> it's<00:03:02.840> more<00:03:03.080> solid<00:03:03.620> than<00:03:03.739> you<00:03:03.890> would

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
solid it's more solid than you would

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.270

think<00:03:04.570> so<00:03:05.570> yeah<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:05.840> can<00:03:06.050> recommend<00:03:06.650> this<00:03:06.980> now

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
think so yeah I can recommend this now

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.070 
think so yeah I can recommend this now
it's<00:03:07.489> still<00:03:07.820> you<00:03:08.090> know<00:03:08.120> it's<00:03:08.390> not<00:03:08.510> like<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.780> huge

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080

to repair I had a little like cheapo it
was<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.250> multi-tool<00:03:20.030> not<00:03:20.390> this<00:03:20.600> one<00:03:20.930> but<00:03:21.140> just

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
was a multi-tool not this one but just

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.370 
was a multi-tool not this one but just
for<00:03:21.590> an<00:03:21.650> example<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:22.400> little<00:03:23.209> uh<00:03:23.380> whatever

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
things that lock into place two of them

things that lock into place two of them
like<00:03:30.519> like<00:03:31.930> sprung<00:03:32.930> out<00:03:33.260> of<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.620> multi-tool

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
like like sprung out of the multi-tool

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.550 
like like sprung out of the multi-tool
and<00:03:34.340> we're<00:03:34.670> just<00:03:34.910> out<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:35.510> I<00:03:36.019> had<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.380> like

janky-ass ones so yeah you know it's
mainly<00:05:25.760> good<00:05:26.150> as<00:05:26.389> a<00:05:26.450> mini<00:05:27.320> hammer<00:05:28.099> oh<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:28.880> it

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
mainly good as a mini hammer oh and it

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.690 
mainly good as a mini hammer oh and it
has<00:05:29.000> a<00:05:29.090> nail<00:05:29.389> pull<00:05:29.660> there<00:05:29.960> but<00:05:30.680> that<00:05:31.220> stuff<00:05:31.550> in

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
has a nail pull there but that stuff in

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.240 
has a nail pull there but that stuff in
the<00:05:31.789> handle<00:05:32.150> is<00:05:32.270> pretty<00:05:32.570> useful<00:05:32.900> so<00:05:33.380> overall<00:05:33.740> I

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
the handle is pretty useful so overall I

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.839 
the handle is pretty useful so overall I
do<00:05:34.880> think<00:05:35.300> that<00:05:35.419> this<00:05:35.690> probably<00:05:36.050> is<00:05:36.560> the<00:05:37.010> one

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
do think that this probably is the one

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.629 
do think that this probably is the one
of<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.120> few<00:05:38.479> mini<00:05:39.229> hammers<00:05:39.770> that<00:05:40.340> could

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
of the few mini hammers that could

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.589 
of the few mini hammers that could
actually<00:05:40.910> be<00:05:41.599> usable<00:05:42.530> and<00:05:42.710> useful<00:05:43.539> for<00:05:44.539> the

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
actually be usable and useful for the

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:47.850 
actually be usable and useful for the
price<00:05:44.930> all<00:05:45.199> right<00:05:45.349> so<00:05:45.530> the<00:05:45.680> delq<00:05:45.970> mini<00:05:46.970> hammer

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860
