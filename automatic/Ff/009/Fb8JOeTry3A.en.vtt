00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.360
 It's serious. 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.160
 5. 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.360
 Let's talk about what you can do. 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.559
 And that's what it's all about 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.709
 A man without talent is devoting himself to Jesus 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.630
 He was speaking. 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.570
 Regardless of Kukdong construction 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.139
 I created it. 

00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:22.989
 mosi 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.570
 I'm looking for a flat one that's been called a genius. 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.919
 I should have called 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:29.509
 They think a little 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:30.960
 Receive a lot 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.500
 Not particularly common 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.649
 Value Iso 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.649
 The idea I need is 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.980
 Something is missing. 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.050
 Incheon is strengthened 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.570
 Only recently 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.570
 Gangwon soaring hurt sooma 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.900
 People without r do not 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.210
 Hey, let's just say that we have fun 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.500
 It's part of it. 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.559
 It is a plan. But the exile government struggle will continue 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.720
 Be a girl high school team 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.110
 For example, in the case of me 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.110
 Interest in getting out of Gore shooting 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.440
 Not worth about 30 trillion won 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.670
 I was caught 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.670
 I do not think so. 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.420
 I think that's hard. 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.420
 Something like that and card problems 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.570
 Because he is a man. Endless 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.060
 It's one day. 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.060
 The woman model was targeted. 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.140
 Bikini swimsuit feature 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.400
 r for children 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.749
 Because I am a man, I see how I see the inside of something like that. 

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:50.630
 Scene across the valley 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.540
 It seems natural to sell 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.900
 It may not be possible to amend the Articles of Incorporation. 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.900
 I have a little personality 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.510
 ... 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.510
 Especially people. In this case 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.970
 Well, all right. 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.199
 It is good for people. 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.209
 There's a guy who's doing Harry, and he's a maker. 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:15.480
 I'm shooting. 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.320
 The model 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.729
 I respect him. 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:20.429
 I took a good look at it. 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.429
 From the perspective of the model, 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:27.189
 A portrait like a portrait 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.120
 There are natural events, 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.069
 Things can be talent 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.069
 So many people say that 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.109
 Working hard 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.159
 You can take advantage of that. 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.159
 Those who speak in that way 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.209
 One of the dangerous points is the fundamental 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.100
 Effort 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.129
 Talent. 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.139
 In the case of me 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.509
 I want to work the day before the rain 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:57.639
 Smoking cessation rates. Not 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.650
 For August 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.339
 Nothing to aim for 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:04.559
 For example, if you are currently in school with a mobile 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.389
 Study hard and go to Seoul Station 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.389
 I can get a good job and eat a lot 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.209
 I can live more comfortably than others. 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.519
 You knew. 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.459
 I knew that when I pressed it. 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:19.749
 I shot it in abundance. 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:22.749
 There was no talent in May. 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.140
 Vocabulary shatter 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.219
 Be a drama 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.269
 I do not know 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.689
 The second one. 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.689
 You might have thought of one here. 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.239
 Can pull out the thorns 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.239
 There are separate acts. 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.659
 In the case of me, 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.659
 In the last decade or so 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.299
 Oh Sang-Jin 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.859
 I saw the 27 shares that had a good feeling. 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.499
 National treasure 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:54.549
 Without knowing 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.549
 I tried so hard, 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:00.829
 I heard hair loss. 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:01.809
 17 places 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:03.139
 if so 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:03.969
 18 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:07.549
 It has a lot of disadvantages than the talent for taking pictures. 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:08.139
 like this 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.589
 There is no one to think about. 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:14.279
 Even like that 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:15.679
 Accountability and Trap 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:19.680
 When I am a child, I am not responsible for it. Especially 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.839
 The impact of Dunn Jones College points over 

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:25.409
 This is so much more here that the joints are weak 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.409
 It's spreading continuously from Mars. 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.870
 This law is enacted to be a teacher. 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.980
 There will be no peninsula. 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.129
 So now 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.139
 I'm not serious enough to say that. 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.029
 No, yes. 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:43.900
 I shake my hand 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.560
 When shooting 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.560
 I do not like the heart. 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.389
 Financial institution 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:55.449
 deployment 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.620
 I take a tripod very much because I shoot 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.539
 That's what I thought. 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.339
 I've got 57 in the first half. 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:03.789
 And 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.949
 I started with the shake correction device before anyone else. 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.930
 Other people do not know 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.340
 We also have technologies that make use of shake correction devices 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.259
 This brand is not wearing glasses. I'm wearing glasses. 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:20.509
 Not only 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:21.610
 3.6 Gigabit ... 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.639
 I will. 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:24.650
 Science 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.890
 According to this general criterion, in the same case 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:31.080
 Related industries 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.059
 Take this as a guide. 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:36.020
 do. I think he is now 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.089
 Become a federal factor 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:41.089
 Thanks to that, I can say that Photoshop 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.189
 Calibration or 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:44.639
 Blade related thing 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.349
 You were very human. 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.970
 Not sensitive, but consciously 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.239
 That's what I'm paying attention to. 

00:05:51.239 --> 00:05:53.530
 It is not. I do not see myself. 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.840
 The same thing that I got from Photoshop 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.210
 pc-own 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.159
 Like a sentence 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:00.840
 I'm not asking for the drawback of not seeing the color. 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.319
 In the case of me 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:06.779
 I was globally weak, so I was making it look good. 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:09.240
 So when it comes to industry strength, 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.579
 Now hope 

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:13.610
 The police use black and white 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.490
 I'm not sure I'm always looking 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.490
 Such an order also 

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:23.939
 I have to do a few things. 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:27.490
 I have not told you so far, and most have already 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.900
 In the beginning 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.099
 For those who are on camera 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:34.930
 Billion 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.270
 Interesting thing 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.749
 It's very important. 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:40.159
 fun 

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:43.309
 Welfare to visit 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:45.749
 I have my cheongyang 

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:47.800
 Weak ways to develop into talent
