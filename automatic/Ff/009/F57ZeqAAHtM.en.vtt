00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.180
All who have ever played bowling have noticed that the balls used 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.079
for this sport have some special features, the most notable is that they are heavy,

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.870
and since shot after shot these bowling balls hit the bowling pins, we could think 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.620
these balls are really resistant.
But how much strength should they resist

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.650
to ensure a long life for this balls? What materials are they made of?

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.730
In this chapter, we will solve these doubts.

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.199
For this test we use an Instron compression machine and 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.900
a Struers metallographic cutting machine.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.900
Let's test it!

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.950
The result of applying a load of 50.64 tonnes to the bowling ball was 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.370
the one shown on screen. Even after having applied this force, the bowling ball

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.939
was not completely destroyed. However, at this point it is hard to think that the object

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.840
seen on screen was once a bowling ball.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.599
The interior of the Roto Grip Ball Outcry contains a counterweight in the center that allows

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.420
the player to throw the bowling ball with more spin than those without this weight inside.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.980
This allows players to throw the ball strategically so

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.720
they can knock over more bowling pins easier.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.700

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.680
because we could use your idea in the next video of Let's test it.
