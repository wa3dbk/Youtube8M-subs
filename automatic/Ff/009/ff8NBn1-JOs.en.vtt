00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.409
 some stressful printing uses only cartridges with a 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:22.220
 microchip 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.840
 on these printers the microchip is indispensable on 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.840
 all cartridges and in particular compatible cartridges 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:33.420
 most compatible cartridges we offer are equipped with the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.230
 chip 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.230
 10% electronics for smooth operation 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.750
 when the cartridge comes with its chip 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.740
 this one is ready to study if it is said the exit of its packing 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.280
 however m on some his early childhood 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.440
 especially the most recent 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.860
 the chip is relatively expensive 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.460
 it can represent more than half the cost of the cartridge 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.650
 complete 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.210
 lexibook always anxious to offer you good deals 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.860
 to find an alternative solution 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.260
 this solution is for those who use their printers in such a way 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.470
 intensive who are they willing to invest a little time to prepare their 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.130
 compatible cartridges before using 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.380
 this solution will really allow you to make big 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.180
 savings on your print budget 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.420
 here is the solution we offer you 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.740
 the product consists of 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.960
 several batches of compatible cartridges without more 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.060
 for example August 15 four cartridges 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.060
 one of each color 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.010
 each cartridge and supplied with a transparent adhesive label 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.230
 next to these cartridges no more two big parties a game of 4 plus 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990
 one chip per color after a series of automatic stations 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.340
 here is the procedure 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.340
 take a color cartridge of your choice 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.369
 take the chip corresponding to the color of the cartridge you have 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.340
 selected 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.170
 that everyone can identify by number and each number corresponds to 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.120
 a very specific color for example the reference 700 roms intersect for 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.300
 at the color black the reference 712 corresponds to the color knowingly the 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.259
 quick reference is the color magenta 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.259
 the reference is 114 votes, the yellow color 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.259
 positioned the chip on the cartridge 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:26.049
 on the picture 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.329
 take an adhesive label transparency 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.339
 supplied with the cartridge 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:36.329
 pixar the support on the cartridge by means of the adhesive label transparency 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.539
 being careful not to cover the electrical contacts this is the part 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.999
 golden chip 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:48.609
 your cartridge is almost ready we just need to remove the goal c 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.649
 is orange 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.619
 as well as the stubble tickets on the upper part of the 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:54.809
 cartridge 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:58.619
 to power so use the after-sales ink cartridge and started to 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:00.319
 to print 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.809
 when your printer and will indicate that your cartridge and military 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:07.399
 you have to remove the cartridge to the siblings sale and above all had to 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:10.839
 recover the most you previously had attached to the cartridge at 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:14.129
 medium of the transparent adhesive label 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.429
 the chip automatically resets 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:20.989
 then you just need to take new cartridges without more of the 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.559
 good color 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:25.339
 and a new transparent adhesive label 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:29.769
 you must then you will then have to fix the chip recover from throwing because all 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.529
 on the new cartridge exactly the same way as before
