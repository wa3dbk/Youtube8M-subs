00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello friends today i will show you 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.720
 an app called duolingo 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.040
 In my opinion this is the best application with 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.190
 by which you can learn 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.880
 foreign languages on your iphone and so 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.880
 go 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.180
 chic 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.670
 not long ago I stumbled upon it 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.430
 The application on the shoot review is not just like that 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.960
 I use it myself almost every day but 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.970
 unfortunately not lately 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.460
 it turns out to keep a given pace 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.309
 by the way the percentage you need to choose the most 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.760
 easy it is five minutes a day then normal 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.129
 10 minutes austere 20 minutes and frantic 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.320
 half an hour a day can also be turned off 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.480
 this very pace but i am imperative 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.370
 I recommend to choose the best for you 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.070
 pace and maintain it over 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:07.920
 learning this way you won't 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.909
 forget the words of bullying you will 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.740
 learn words 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.140
 choose the translation of the sentence from 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.630
 suggested words translate application 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.600
 voice and choose a picture of a given 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.430
 words in general everything is very simple everywhere 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.950
 there are tips translation for 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.590
 elementary word learning and multiple 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.440
 repetition in subsequent exercises on 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.159
 one section is given three lives i.e. three 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.380
 mistakes 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.460
 if you make more than three mistakes 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.460
 will have to start over 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.439
 the application is very beautiful extremely 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.189
 simple absolutely free and without 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.130
 advertising 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.780
 besides english i'm learning is 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.689
 also french german spanish 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.850
 Italian and others strongly 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.789
 I recommend to try this application 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.280
 very much I liked it again 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:04.649
 the main thing is to keep the pace 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.340
 so that new words are not forgotten on this 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.960
 That's all I wanted to say 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.390
 leave your opinion about it 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.640

 until 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.190
