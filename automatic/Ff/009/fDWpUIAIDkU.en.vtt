00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.800
 hi people we are in the mystic forge 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.230
 of the lion's bow and I'll show you the 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.019
 recipe to be able to ascend concretely 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.219
 the fractal prototype capacitor no longer 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.690
 you know there are several types with 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:20.140
 different attributes cost 1350 plates 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.770
 and good this to get this not 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.020
 you need to invest a lot of money but if 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.340
 there is time because we need the veneers 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.590
 of fractals and the only way to 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.770
 getting your badges is doing 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.039
 fractals and then we have the gift to the 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.530
 extension that are 500 sheets we have the 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.480
 essence vial of condensed fog 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.690
 that we will need only one and that is why 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.699
 drop 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.300
 and then we have the crystals and the 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.640
 Philosopher's stones are worth 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.489
 the recipe are two types of recipe but 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.239
 according to the according to that if you use crystals 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.850
 or philosophical stones because you will get what 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.769
 which is the offensive infusion slot or 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.379
 defensive we do not use crystals 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.920
 will go offensive and if we use the 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.420
 Philosopher's stones defensive 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.830
 we will need 40 crystals for the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.450
 offensive that is what I am going to do and 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.280
 240 philosophical stones for 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.250
 defensive 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.740
 and good the differences are the stones 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.510
 we are in the infusions that also already 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.310
 You know that apart from buy us because 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.430
 apart fractals can also be created 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.450
 in what is in the form then there is 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.930
 some that are or are defensive and 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.020
 offensive or are versatile not that anymore 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.640
 It depends obviously each one asks for more 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.549
 material less material than one thing 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.759
 then it is according to what you want good 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.580
 Well, I'm going to put the condenser here 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:52.130
 the gift the vial 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.210
 good in this case the crystals 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.210
 let's forge 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.360
 and you see here we have the capacitor and 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.640
 you have seen that it has the slot 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.920
 offensive infusion to use the 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.750
 crystals and good and we get there the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.440
 attributes and already we can put what 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.290
 We want to see that it is simple 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.110
 that is a little bit I would spend less 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.520
 money unless ye not much 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.810
 time and you have a lot of money and you say 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.370
 I prefer to buy the 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.070
 materials and make me loads that I 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.040
 like more than the extra back because 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.180
 you know here you have the recipe and until 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.180
 the video and until next time
