one<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> thing<00:00:53.460> we've<00:00:53.730> learned<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.629> that

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
one of the thing we've learned is that

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.990 
one of the thing we've learned is that
there's<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.050> common<00:00:56.010> mechanism<00:00:56.250> that's

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
there's a common mechanism that's

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.939 
there's a common mechanism that's
occurring<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.660> all<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.989> these<00:00:58.140> disorders<00:00:58.559> and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
occurring in all of these disorders and

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.920 
occurring in all of these disorders and
that's<00:00:59.100> what<00:00:59.460> I've<00:00:59.579> named<00:00:59.850> immuno<00:01:00.420> excited

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
that's what I've named immuno excited

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.349 
that's what I've named immuno excited

that are in the peer-reviewed journal

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.570 
that are in the peer-reviewed journal
about<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.720> process<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.680> what<00:01:08.010> triggers<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
about this process and what triggers it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.870 
about this process and what triggers it
is<00:01:08.939> anything<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:09.960> triggers<00:01:10.439> inflammation

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
is anything that triggers inflammation

metals like aluminum and mercury cadmium

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.090 
metals like aluminum and mercury cadmium
lead<00:01:27.180> could<00:01:27.869> produce<00:01:28.200> chronic<00:01:28.799> brain

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
lead could produce chronic brain

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.700 
lead could produce chronic brain
inflammation<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:30.060> produce<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.990> changes<00:01:31.530> we

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
inflammation and produce the changes we

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.460 
inflammation and produce the changes we
see<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.100> these<00:01:32.310> diseases<00:01:33.200> exposure<00:01:34.200> to

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
read a lot about free radicals what are

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.200 
read a lot about free radicals what are
they<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.310> what<00:02:05.430> are<00:02:05.579> some<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.850> ways<00:02:06.000> that

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
they and what are some of the ways that

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.089 
they and what are some of the ways that
we<00:02:06.299> can<00:02:06.450> prevent<00:02:07.049> them<00:02:07.259> from<00:02:07.500> destroying<00:02:07.829> our

causing<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.750> lot<00:02:15.960> of<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.260> damage<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.910> that's

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
causing a lot of this damage and that's

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.820 
causing a lot of this damage and that's
one<00:02:18.240> of<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.450> things<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.930> immuno<00:02:19.350> excite<00:02:19.680> of

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
enormous numbers of free radicals now

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.140 
enormous numbers of free radicals now
these<00:02:25.320> are<00:02:25.560> just<00:02:25.740> chemical<00:02:26.550> elements<00:02:27.030> that

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
these are just chemical elements that

are highly reactive and they tend to

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.780 
are highly reactive and they tend to

damage the proteins the DNA all the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.670 
damage the proteins the DNA all the
membranes<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.540> cells<00:02:33.600> so<00:02:34.170> they<00:02:34.290> do<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.440> lot<00:02:34.650> of

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
membranes of cells so they do a lot of

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.190 
membranes of cells so they do a lot of
damage<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.760> higher<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.330> level<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.720> more<00:02:37.020> the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
damage the higher the level the more the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.370 
damage the higher the level the more the
damage<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.830> done<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.280> longer<00:02:38.760> they're<00:02:38.970> there

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
damage is done the longer they're there

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.680 
damage is done the longer they're there
the<00:02:40.380> more<00:02:40.530> damage<00:02:40.980> that's<00:02:41.220> done<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:42.180> we<00:02:42.420> find

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
the more damage that's done so we find

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.660 
the more damage that's done so we find
that<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.110> lot<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.440> these<00:02:43.590> diseases<00:02:44.070> if<00:02:44.490> you

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
that in a lot of these diseases if you

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.330 
that in a lot of these diseases if you
use<00:02:44.940> antioxidants<00:02:45.570> in<00:02:46.320> combination<00:02:47.160> and

use antioxidants in combination and

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.260

that's<00:02:47.880> important<00:02:48.480> in<00:02:48.660> combination<00:02:49.970> we<00:02:50.970> find

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
that's important in combination we find

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.390 
that's important in combination we find

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
talked about how important low

talked about how important low
cholesterol<00:03:13.830> levels<00:03:14.190> can<00:03:14.370> be<00:03:14.400> when<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.820> comes

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
cholesterol levels can be when it comes

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.060

to<00:03:15.180> combating<00:03:15.510> Alzheimer's<00:03:16.170> but<00:03:16.680> some<00:03:16.860> people

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
to combating Alzheimer's but some people

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.710 
to combating Alzheimer's but some people
might<00:03:17.190> be<00:03:17.280> just<00:03:17.460> surprised<00:03:18.240> to<00:03:18.450> learn<00:03:18.480> the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
might be just surprised to learn the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.240 
might be just surprised to learn the
drugs<00:03:19.050> like<00:03:19.290> statins<00:03:19.590> meant<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.070> keep

drugs like statins meant to keep
cholesterol<00:03:20.760> levels<00:03:21.030> low<00:03:21.209> could<00:03:21.900> also<00:03:22.020> be

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
cholesterol levels low could also be

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.350 
cholesterol levels low could also be
part<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.590> problem<00:03:23.010> what<00:03:23.880> we<00:03:24.030> used<00:03:24.239> to

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
part of the problem what we used to

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.840 
part of the problem what we used to
think<00:03:24.600> was<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.780> normal<00:03:25.230> cholesterol<00:03:25.410> was<00:03:25.980> 220

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850

150 or below well we know that if you

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.540 
150 or below well we know that if you
lower<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.390> cholesterol<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.470> low<00:03:35.010> it

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
lower the cholesterol that low it

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.490 
lower the cholesterol that low it
interferes<00:03:36.120> with<00:03:36.209> brain<00:03:36.600> function<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:37.410> you

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
interferes with brain function and you

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.740 
interferes with brain function and you
actually<00:03:37.980> increase<00:03:38.270> memory<00:03:39.270> problem

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
actually increase memory problem

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.080 
actually increase memory problem
learning<00:03:40.050> problems<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:40.860> even<00:03:40.970> appearance<00:03:41.970> of

learning problems and even appearance of
amnesia<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.959> that's<00:03:43.380> what<00:03:43.530> happens<00:03:43.830> with<00:03:43.950> the

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
amnesia and that's what happens with the

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.620 
amnesia and that's what happens with the
statin<00:03:44.459> drugs<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:44.940> they<00:03:45.090> lower<00:03:45.420> the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
statin drugs is they lower the

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.800 
statin drugs is they lower the
cholesterol<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:46.650> low<00:03:46.920> that<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.880> increases<00:03:48.630> the

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
cholesterol so low that it increases the

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.990 
cholesterol so low that it increases the
