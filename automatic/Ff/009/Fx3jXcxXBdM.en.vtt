00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
play the game with zapper so you have to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.599 
play the game with zapper so you have to
set<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.319> up<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.129> choose<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.339> game

difficult<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.329> things<00:00:57.749> like<00:00:57.839> that<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.829> you

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
difficult in things like that and you

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.099 
difficult in things like that and you
can<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.370> basically<00:00:59.519> choose<00:00:59.940> screen<00:01:00.839> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
can just basically choose screen and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.680 
can just basically choose screen and
other<00:01:01.710> sound<00:01:02.370> stops<00:01:02.760> or<00:01:02.969> basic<00:01:03.359> options

other sound stops or basic options

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.280 
other sound stops or basic options
really<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:06.240> whole<00:01:06.270> point<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.780> la<00:01:06.960> sorcière

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
really so the whole point is la sorcière

the<00:01:24.360> co-op<00:01:24.600> mode<00:01:24.810> i<00:01:24.840> believe<00:01:25.170> by<00:01:25.380> simply

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
the co-op mode i believe by simply

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.410 
the co-op mode i believe by simply
beaten<00:01:26.159> every<00:01:26.430> mission<00:01:26.700> when<00:01:26.820> extrano

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
beaten every mission when extrano

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.149 
beaten every mission when extrano
something<00:01:27.689> like<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.200> i<00:01:28.829> think<00:01:29.070> it

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
something like that and i think it

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.709 
something like that and i think it
includes<00:01:29.490> all<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.759> missions<00:01:30.119> are<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.539> sub

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
includes all the missions are just a sub

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.689 
so you do get music here while there but
not<00:04:31.729> much<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.210> it<00:04:32.770> voice<00:04:33.770> acting<00:04:34.220> wise<00:04:34.400> it's

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
not much of it voice acting wise it's

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.219 
not much of it voice acting wise it's
pretty<00:04:34.910> much<00:04:35.030> standard<00:04:35.419> rising<00:04:35.720> able<00:04:35.960> store

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
pretty much standard rising able store

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.500 
pretty much standard rising able store
so<00:04:37.010> pretty<00:04:37.520> much<00:04:37.610> nothing<00:04:37.940> left<00:04:38.240> to<00:04:38.360> say

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
so pretty much nothing left to say

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.150 
so pretty much nothing left to say
really<00:04:38.750> all<00:04:39.050> of<00:04:39.169> them<00:04:39.260> but<00:04:39.320> if<00:04:39.710> you<00:04:39.740> like<00:04:39.949> this

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
really all of them but if you like this

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.560 
really all of them but if you like this
type<00:04:40.340> of<00:04:40.400> game<00:04:40.699> I<00:04:40.880> think<00:04:41.180> it's<00:04:41.270> one<00:04:41.389> of<00:04:41.419> the

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
type of game I think it's one of the

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.810 
type of game I think it's one of the
better<00:04:41.720> ones<00:04:41.810> on<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.229> way<00:04:42.380> however<00:04:42.979> house<00:04:43.610> of

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
better ones on the way however house of

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.900 
better ones on the way however house of
the<00:04:43.880> dead<00:04:44.090> overkill<00:04:44.270> is<00:04:44.840> definitely<00:04:45.350> bad<00:04:48.910> so

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
the dead overkill is definitely bad so

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.580 
the dead overkill is definitely bad so
there<00:04:50.090> we<00:04:50.210> go<00:04:50.240> them<00:04:50.510> that's<00:04:50.810> been<00:04:51.020> um<00:04:51.110> of<00:04:51.229> you<00:04:51.380> I
