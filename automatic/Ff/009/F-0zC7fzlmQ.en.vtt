that great writing isn't a huge plus
obviously<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.909> without<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.240> story

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
obviously it is but without a story

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.530 
obviously it is but without a story
great<00:02:04.409> writing<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:05.399> sits<00:02:05.700> there<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.180> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
great writing just sits there like a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.070 
great writing just sits there like a
beautifully<00:02:07.170> rendered<00:02:07.409> ball<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.979> waxed<00:02:08.520> fruit

so<00:02:10.080> what<00:02:10.890> are<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.489> brains<00:02:11.730> expectations<00:02:12.599> when

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
so what are the brains expectations when

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.090 
so what are the brains expectations when
it<00:02:12.750> comes<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.170> story<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.590> how

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
it comes to story and how

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.280 
it comes to story and how
