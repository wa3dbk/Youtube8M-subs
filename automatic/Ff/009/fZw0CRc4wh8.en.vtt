00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.889 
that you're paying for and you can see
in<00:02:06.009> this<00:02:06.130> set<00:02:06.399> yeah<00:02:06.970> I<00:02:07.000> think<00:02:07.149> it<00:02:07.420> kind<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:07.690> does

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
in this set yeah I think it kind of does

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.650 
in this set yeah I think it kind of does
yeah<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:08.920> so<00:02:09.369> that's<00:02:09.849> the<00:02:10.090> first<00:02:10.270> thing<00:02:10.450> now

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
yeah and so that's the first thing now

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.780 
yeah and so that's the first thing now
recognize<00:02:11.349> this<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:11.650> just<00:02:11.830> a<00:02:11.950> teaser<00:02:12.250> this<00:02:12.610> may

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
recognize this is just a teaser this may

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.470 
recognize this is just a teaser this may
not<00:02:12.970> be<00:02:13.270> what<00:02:13.540> actually<00:02:13.959> runs<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.650> Sunday<00:02:15.480> but

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
not be what actually runs on Sunday but

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.020 
not be what actually runs on Sunday but
