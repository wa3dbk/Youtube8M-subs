00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
it's actually better than I expected I

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.020 
it's actually better than I expected I

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
figure ease kind of glossy marble light

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.109 
figure ease kind of glossy marble light
yellow<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:22.080> not<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.439> actually<00:01:22.970> just<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
yellow but it's not it's actually just a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.310 
yellow but it's not it's actually just a
reflective<00:01:24.869> almost<00:01:25.650> metallic<00:01:25.950> look<00:01:26.340> yellow

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.700

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
so maybe they were talking about the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.890 
so maybe they were talking about the
Pearl<00:01:37.710> mirror<00:01:38.100> version<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.570> pearl
