00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.540
 Sennheiser presents The Oracle 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.580
 You arrive just in time. 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.440
 Come with me. 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.500
 I have reason to think that now he will wake up from one minute to the next. 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.700
 He only wakes up once every 10 years. 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.800
 I hope you are aware of the responsibility I entrust to you. 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.080
 Obviously. 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.120
 Ok, go away! Step aside ! 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.160
 We can only ask him one question about the future before he goes back to sleep. 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.680
 So is he really predicting the future? 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.620
 That's why we call him ... 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.620
 ... the Oracle. 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.120
 You have to hurry! 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.600
 And the sound will be good? 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.120
 Yes ! 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.720
 Relax, it's an AVX! 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.380
 AVX. The wireless audio system for video.
