00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:28.650
 king three drops of essence of 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.650
 vanilla 6-3

 and now a little bit of 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:44.370
 yeast only for growing and the apple 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:47.450
 the brand that is great if you want to 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.220
 snack in the morning was like 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.410
 snack before training 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.300
 is a great option since it needed to 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.200
 I work with you and that's you. 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.860
 eats 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.770
 before the leader was a monster 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.560
 chance to train now I'll put a 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.900
 tablespoon I'm using walnuts 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.850
 you can use the almond you have 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.220
 of Brazil nuts, what you have to 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:16.650
 seed in the currency case then here I 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:19.560
 I have it with a tablespoon of walnuts 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.450
 ground I'll leave a little bit goes 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.430
 a little left over for me to put reinforcement 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.430
 as done alone upon the other 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.830
 and now I'll put it in the dishes 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:41.060
 I have beautiful ones here I'll put 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:46.160
 in the form of maffei nothing indicates why 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.080
 I put this here with the 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.500
 pretty tough consciousness 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.250
 Then put your half of the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.250
 it will grow a lot 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:03.019
 now I'll put in the heated oven 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.750
 190 degrees celsius and hence 10 and 15 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:09.230
 minutes and returns to show you with 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.090
 who was paying attention to what I am 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.230
 say if you leave 15 minutes away 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.150
 very dry inside then maximum 15 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.910
 minutes to keep an eye out not to stay 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.340
 It's safer to look good with the banana. 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.319
 We put everything right I go. 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.130
 put inside the oven and soon 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.440
 I'll come back to show you how 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.329
 Girls, why are you ready? 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.090
 now I'll do the coverage I'll do 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:37.910
 a super simple and healthy cover is 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.910
 the Greek yoghurt which today the Greek because 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.450
 has a harder consistency and because 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:53.269
 it has more protection than the natural 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:55.400
 brother whom he put in the field that 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.079
 while he is he already suffered a 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.989
 little do not miss 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:04.430
 put never again and now on top 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.579
 Remember that I told you that I had left 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.970
 a bunch of walnuts are your 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:13.220
 budgets or Brazil nut 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:19.859
 you use to decorate also has a 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:23.039
 vocation above 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.400
 the report us and how they dictate a day 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.400
 a little 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:36.320
 Who knows, this is our cap and it's the 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:39.540
 that today is very rich in protein has 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:44.460
 pretty fat good fat choice 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:46.890
 the optimal fiber of the vein and not 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.590
 could be more nutritious than who 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:53.600
 so I hope you like 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.600
 is the next recipe already
