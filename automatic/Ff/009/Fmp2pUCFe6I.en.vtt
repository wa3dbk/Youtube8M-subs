00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
throughput and better range and you can

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.289 
throughput and better range and you can
only<00:01:46.770> if<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.979> do<00:01:47.340> opt<00:01:47.549> up<00:01:47.729> for<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.939> LTE

version<00:01:48.420> know<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.070> will<00:01:50.399> work<00:01:50.430> across

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
version know that this will work across

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.389

the<00:01:51.360> world<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.810> across<00:01:52.409> carriers<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.250> can

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
the world and across carriers you can

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.399 
the world and across carriers you can
sim<00:01:53.670> slots<00:01:54.420> content<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.110> don't<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
sim slots content so you don't have to

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.469 
sim slots content so you don't have to
pick<00:01:55.619> one<00:01:55.920> particular<00:01:56.340> carrier<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:57.240> stick

pick one particular carrier to stick

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.830 
pick one particular carrier to stick
with<00:01:57.659> which<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.049> nice<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:59.280> all<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.420> adds

videos for games and the good news about
the<00:02:12.209> mini<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.750> for<00:02:12.959> all<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
the mini is that for all the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.690 
the mini is that for all the
apps<00:02:13.469> that<00:02:13.650> we've<00:02:13.799> thrown<00:02:13.980> at<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.519> I've

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
apps that we've thrown at it that I've

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.849 
apps that we've thrown at it that I've
thrown<00:02:14.939> at<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.209> you<00:02:15.870> can<00:02:16.049> see<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.469> they<00:02:16.620> all

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:16.859 
thrown at it you can see that they all

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.009 
thrown at it you can see that they all
work<00:02:17.280> really<00:02:17.549> well<00:02:17.849> in<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.299> size<00:02:18.540> they<00:02:18.840> don't

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
work really well in this size they don't

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.110 
work really well in this size they don't
feel<00:02:19.139> cramped<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.859> so<00:02:20.370> that's<00:02:20.549> why<00:02:20.730> having

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
feel cramped and so that's why having

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.119 
feel cramped and so that's why having
that<00:02:21.239> bump<00:02:21.599> up<00:02:21.780> compared<00:02:22.409> to<00:02:22.530> last<00:02:22.680> year<00:02:22.980> is

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
that bump up compared to last year is

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.190 
that bump up compared to last year is
helpful<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.819> mean<00:02:24.120> if<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.329> had<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.480> iPad<00:02:24.930> Mini

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
helpful I mean if you had the iPad Mini

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.770 
helpful I mean if you had the iPad Mini
that<00:02:25.709> at<00:02:25.859> an<00:02:26.010> a5<00:02:26.459> processor<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:27.329> goes<00:02:27.599> up<00:02:27.749> to

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
that at an a5 processor this goes up to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.110 
that at an a5 processor this goes up to
the<00:02:27.959> a7<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.069> it's<00:02:29.219> kind<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.459> like<00:02:29.579> a<00:02:29.670> two-year

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
the a7 so it's kind of like a two-year

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.390 
the a7 so it's kind of like a two-year
leap<00:02:30.299> in<00:02:30.569> terms<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.469> performance<00:02:31.620> upgrade

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
leap in terms of performance upgrade

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.129 
leap in terms of performance upgrade
compared<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.180> your<00:02:33.329> year<00:02:33.540> over<00:02:33.780> year<00:02:33.810> and

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:34.139 
compared to your year over year and

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:35.869 
compared to your year over year and
iPads<00:02:34.590> does<00:02:35.159> that<00:02:35.310> mean<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:35.549> should<00:02:35.700> upgrade

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
iPads does that mean you should upgrade

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.369 
iPads does that mean you should upgrade
well<00:02:36.329> you<00:02:36.629> know<00:02:36.719> some<00:02:36.840> people<00:02:36.959> may<00:02:37.170> still

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
well you know some people may still

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.619 
well you know some people may still
prefer<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.889> iPad<00:02:38.250> Mini<00:02:38.489> because<00:02:38.939> that's<00:02:39.090> $100

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
prefer the iPad Mini because that's $100

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.530 
prefer the iPad Mini because that's $100
less<00:02:39.900> expensive<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:41.340> screen<00:02:41.730> for<00:02:42.329> a<00:02:42.389> lot

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
less expensive and the screen for a lot

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.509 
less expensive and the screen for a lot
of<00:02:42.569> people<00:02:42.840> might<00:02:43.019> look<00:02:43.200> perfectly<00:02:43.680> fine<00:02:43.799> if

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
of people might look perfectly fine if

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.069 
of people might look perfectly fine if
you<00:02:44.700> pay<00:02:44.879> for<00:02:44.909> the<00:02:45.120> LTE<00:02:45.450> you're<00:02:45.750> paying<00:02:45.959> an

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
you pay for the LTE you're paying an

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.080 
you pay for the LTE you're paying an
extra<00:02:46.260> hundred<00:02:46.500> thirty<00:02:46.769> dollars<00:02:47.099> more<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:47.969> it

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
extra hundred thirty dollars more so it

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.629 
extra hundred thirty dollars more so it
starts<00:02:48.359> at<00:02:48.450> 529<00:02:49.290> then<00:02:49.859> you<00:02:49.980> start<00:02:50.219> bumping<00:02:50.400> up

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
starts at 529 then you start bumping up

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.089 
starts at 529 then you start bumping up
to<00:02:50.790> something<00:02:51.060> like<00:02:51.180> 128<00:02:51.959> gigabytes<00:02:52.439> which<00:02:52.949> is

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
to something like 128 gigabytes which is

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.339 
to something like 128 gigabytes which is
the<00:02:53.189> top-end<00:02:53.659> configuration<00:02:54.659> and<00:02:54.870> you're

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
the top-end configuration and you're

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.080 
the top-end configuration and you're
looking<00:02:55.560> at<00:02:55.590> something<00:02:55.769> that's<00:02:55.919> pushing<00:02:56.189> $800

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
looking at something that's pushing $800

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.030 
looking at something that's pushing $800
now<00:02:57.659> I'm<00:02:57.719> not<00:02:57.870> generally<00:02:58.230> one<00:02:58.439> for<00:02:58.739> taking

you<00:03:06.329> look<00:03:06.480> generally<00:03:06.959> snazzier<00:03:07.439> the<00:03:08.219> only

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
you look generally snazzier the only

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.559 
you look generally snazzier the only

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
other thing that's different in the box

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.330 
other thing that's different in the box
is<00:03:09.840> that<00:03:09.870> there's<00:03:10.169> now<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.319> 10<00:03:10.590> watt<00:03:10.769> charger<00:03:10.829> as

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
is that there's now a 10 watt charger as

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.830 
is that there's now a 10 watt charger as
opposed<00:03:11.639> to<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.849> 5<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.359> the<00:03:12.510> brick<00:03:12.689> is<00:03:12.810> a

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
little bit larger and that's it if you

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.849
