different<00:00:44.490> so<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.540> is<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.870> loose<00:00:46.080> end<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.470> I

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
different so this is the loose end and I

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.050 
different so this is the loose end and I
want<00:00:46.740> to<00:00:46.770> put<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> foot<00:00:47.250> difference<00:00:47.490> between

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
want to put a foot difference between

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.120 
want to put a foot difference between
this<00:00:48.240> hand<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.720> this<00:00:48.870> hand<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.320> material<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
this hand in this hand of material and

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.610 
this hand in this hand of material and
then<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.790> here<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.200> yarn<00:00:52.410> ball

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
then this here is going to the yarn ball

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.250 
then this here is going to the yarn ball
I<00:00:52.890> want<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.489> open<00:00:53.520> up<00:00:53.850> my<00:00:54.000> material<00:00:54.750> now<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.140> I

I want to open up my material now and I

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.470 
I want to open up my material now and I
want<00:00:55.380> to<00:00:55.500> pull<00:00:55.650> it<00:00:55.770> open<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.220> it'll<00:00:57.000> expose

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
want to pull it open and it'll expose

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.950 
want to pull it open and it'll expose
the<00:00:57.810> last<00:00:58.079> loop<00:00:58.560> that<00:00:59.040> is<00:00:59.310> on<00:00:59.550> it<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.630> it's<00:01:00.810> just

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the last loop that is on it so it's just

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.410 
the last loop that is on it so it's just
like<00:01:01.079> up<00:01:01.380> there<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.770> want<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.550> put<00:01:02.790> that<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:03.149> to

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
like up there I want to put that on to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.139 
like up there I want to put that on to
my<00:01:03.450> knitting<00:01:03.780> needle<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:05.129> like<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
my knitting needle just like so and the

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.030 
my knitting needle just like so and the
hand<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.899> going<00:01:07.140> toward<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.500> yarn<00:01:07.829> ball

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
hand that is going toward the yarn ball

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.760 
hand that is going toward the yarn ball
there's<00:01:08.610> going<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> be<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.180> next<00:01:09.360> loop

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
there's going to be the next loop

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.350 
there's going to be the next loop
available<00:01:10.770> okay<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.490> there's<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.880> section<00:01:12.270> of

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
available okay so there's a section of

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.840 
available okay so there's a section of
material<00:01:12.780> there<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.380> then<00:01:13.889> the<00:01:13.979> loop<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.399> want

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
material there and then the loop I want

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.340 
material there and then the loop I want
to<00:01:14.939> put<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.119> loop<00:01:15.450> onto<00:01:15.719> the<00:01:16.079> knitting

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
to put that loop onto the knitting

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.950 
to put that loop onto the knitting
needle<00:01:17.149> ok<00:01:18.149> so<00:01:18.299> now<00:01:18.509> there's<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:18.749> to<00:01:18.899> be

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
needle ok so now there's going to be

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.230 
needle ok so now there's going to be
appearing<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.679> be<00:01:19.710> too<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.249> I<00:01:20.670> want<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.119> to

appearing to be too and I want you to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.389 
appearing to be too and I want you to
grab<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.689> section<00:01:22.139> here<00:01:22.469> which<00:01:23.039> is<00:01:23.219> on<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
grab this section here which is on the

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.239 
grab this section here which is on the
other<00:01:23.549> side<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.030> pull<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.329> up<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.569> over<00:01:25.249> okay

other side and pull it up and over okay
so<00:01:26.999> let's<00:01:27.179> try<00:01:27.329> that<00:01:27.479> again<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:29.009> with<00:01:29.609> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
so let's try that again so with the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.819 
so let's try that again so with the
loose<00:01:29.939> end<00:01:30.209> okay<00:01:30.899> we're<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.469> to<00:01:31.530> look<00:01:31.770> for

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
loose end okay we're going to look for

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.129 
loose end okay we're going to look for
the<00:01:32.069> next<00:01:32.520> loop<00:01:32.819> available<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.899> we're<00:01:34.020> going

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:34.139 
the next loop available and we're going

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:37.190 
the next loop available and we're going
to<00:01:34.170> put<00:01:34.289> it<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:35.719> okay<00:01:36.719> we're<00:01:36.899> going<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.049> look

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
to put it on okay we're going to look

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.989 
to put it on okay we're going to look
for<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.469> next<00:01:37.770> loop<00:01:37.950> available<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.819> other

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999 
for the next loop available on the other

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:42.139 
for the next loop available on the other
side<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.630> put<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.289> on<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.999> we're<00:01:41.999> going<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
side and put it on and we're going to

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.629 
side and put it on and we're going to
pull<00:01:42.749> this<00:01:42.899> outer<00:01:43.170> loop<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.889> we<00:01:44.039> put<00:01:44.279> on<00:01:44.310> up

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:44.639 
pull this outer loop that we put on up

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:48.980 
pull this outer loop that we put on up
and<00:01:44.909> over<00:01:46.520> let's<00:01:47.520> try<00:01:47.639> that<00:01:47.819> again<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.840> is

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
and over let's try that again so this is

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.510 
and over let's try that again so this is
the<00:01:49.109> loose<00:01:49.289> end<00:01:49.560> looking<00:01:50.549> for<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.850> next<00:01:51.209> loop

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
the loose end looking for the next loop

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.760 
the loose end looking for the next loop
putting<00:01:53.520> up<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:55.049> side<00:01:55.259> we're<00:01:55.469> looking

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
putting up on this side we're looking

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.160 
putting up on this side we're looking
for<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.069> next<00:01:56.219> loop<00:01:56.659> we're<00:01:57.659> putting<00:01:57.929> it<00:01:58.020> on

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
for the next loop we're putting it on

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.230 
for the next loop we're putting it on
and<00:01:58.409> then<00:01:59.310> we're<00:01:59.579> just<00:01:59.609> going<00:01:59.819> to<00:01:59.880> pull<00:02:00.090> this

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
and then we're just going to pull this

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.529 
and then we're just going to pull this
up<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.840> over<00:02:02.299> okay<00:02:05.029> so<00:02:06.029> let's<00:02:06.240> try<00:02:06.419> it<00:02:06.479> again

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
up and over okay so let's try it again

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.210 
up and over okay so let's try it again
so<00:02:06.959> this<00:02:07.109> is<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.409> loose<00:02:07.560> end<00:02:07.829> we're<00:02:07.950> looking

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
so this is the loose end we're looking

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.640 
so this is the loose end we're looking
for<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.399> next<00:02:08.729> loop<00:02:08.880> available<00:02:09.450> put<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.780> on

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.050 

looking<00:02:13.650> for<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.890> next<00:02:14.040> loop<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:14.790> side

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
looking for the next loop on this side

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.020 
looking for the next loop on this side
toward<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.540> yarn<00:02:15.870> ball<00:02:16.579> okay<00:02:17.579> we're<00:02:17.879> going<00:02:17.970> to

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
toward the yarn ball okay we're going to

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.830 
toward the yarn ball okay we're going to
put<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.329> on<00:02:18.569> top

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
put it on top

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.380 
put it on top
and<00:02:21.370> then<00:02:22.370> we're<00:02:22.520> just<00:02:22.550> going<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.820> take<00:02:23.210> this

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
and then we're just going to take this

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.790 
and then we're just going to take this
one<00:02:23.450> here<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.050> we're<00:02:24.260> just<00:02:24.320> going<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.560> pull<00:02:24.770> it

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
one here and we're just going to pull it

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.440 
one here and we're just going to pull it
it's<00:02:25.310> almost<00:02:25.460> like<00:02:25.610> an<00:02:25.790> onion<00:02:25.940> you're<00:02:26.270> just

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
it's almost like an onion you're just

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.500 
it's almost like an onion you're just
going<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.630> peel<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.900> back<00:02:27.050> so<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:28.160> average

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
going to peel the back so the average

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.960 
going to peel the back so the average
scarf<00:02:29.510> distance<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.590> width<00:02:30.830> is<00:02:31.070> about<00:02:31.490> six

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
scarf distance of the width is about six

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.900 
scarf distance of the width is about six
you<00:02:32.750> can<00:02:32.960> do<00:02:33.110> nine<00:02:33.710> if<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.340> felt<00:02:34.580> like<00:02:34.640> you

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
you can do nine if you felt like you

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.390 
you can do nine if you felt like you
want<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.240> go<00:02:35.360> that<00:02:35.510> much<00:02:35.720> when<00:02:36.710> you<00:02:36.860> go<00:02:37.010> more

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
want it to go that much when you go more

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.180 
want it to go that much when you go more
stitches<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.690> scarf<00:02:39.080> will<00:02:39.260> be<00:02:39.380> less<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:39.860> six

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
stitches the scarf will be less so six

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.120 
stitches the scarf will be less so six
to<00:02:40.550> nine<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:41.090> ideal<00:02:41.870> six<00:02:42.590> is<00:02:42.740> probably<00:02:43.010> the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
to nine is ideal six is probably the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.780 
to nine is ideal six is probably the
best<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:44.450> we're<00:02:45.050> starting<00:02:45.410> up<00:02:45.500> again<00:02:45.670> so<00:02:46.670> we're

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
best so we're starting up again so we're

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.630 
best so we're starting up again so we're
just<00:02:46.820> going<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.060> put<00:02:47.240> up<00:02:47.620> okay<00:02:48.620> put<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.400> other

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
just going to put up okay put the other

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.230 
just going to put up okay put the other
one<00:02:49.760> on<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.450> peel<00:02:51.140> back<00:02:51.760> okay<00:02:52.760> I<00:02:52.790> got<00:02:52.940> one<00:02:52.970> more

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
one on and peel back okay I got one more

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.470 
one on and peel back okay I got one more
to<00:02:53.360> go<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:53.810> just<00:02:55.330> looking<00:02:56.330> for<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.570> next<00:02:56.690> loop

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
to go so just looking for the next loop

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.850 
to go so just looking for the next loop
once<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.630> get<00:02:59.750> started<00:02:59.930> this<00:03:00.290> project<00:03:00.560> goes

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
once you get started this project goes

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.440 
once you get started this project goes
really<00:03:01.040> fast<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:01.520> put<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.760> next<00:03:02.000> loop<00:03:02.150> on<00:03:04.450> put

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
really fast so put the next loop on put

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.390 
really fast so put the next loop on put
the<00:03:05.570> other<00:03:05.780> side<00:03:06.140> loop<00:03:06.410> on<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:09.100> then<00:03:10.100> peel

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
the other side loop on and then peel

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.710 
the other side loop on and then peel
that<00:03:10.550> back<00:03:11.650> like<00:03:12.650> so<00:03:12.890> so<00:03:13.850> now<00:03:14.090> you'll<00:03:14.660> have

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
that back like so so now you'll have

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.170 
that back like so so now you'll have
actually<00:03:15.260> six<00:03:15.530> loops<00:03:15.770> on<00:03:16.190> your<00:03:16.250> on<00:03:17.150> your

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
actually six loops on your on your

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.480 
actually six loops on your on your
knitting<00:03:17.900> needle<00:03:18.230> so<00:03:18.680> let's<00:03:18.800> get<00:03:18.950> started<00:03:19.100> on

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
knitting needle so let's get started on

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.220 
knitting needle so let's get started on
how<00:03:19.520> to<00:03:19.820> actually<00:03:20.150> knit<00:03:20.930> with<00:03:21.110> this

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
how to actually knit with this

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.990 
how to actually knit with this
particular<00:03:21.530> product<00:03:22.040> looking<00:03:22.850> more

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
particular product looking more

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.420 
particular product looking more
carefully<00:03:23.240> at<00:03:23.480> this<00:03:23.690> yarn<00:03:24.470> now<00:03:24.769> you<00:03:25.310> can

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
carefully at this yarn now you can

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.830 
carefully at this yarn now you can
actually<00:03:25.580> see<00:03:25.760> that<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.209> loops<00:03:26.450> are<00:03:26.630> on<00:03:26.720> the

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
actually see that the loops are on the

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.570 
actually see that the loops are on the
very<00:03:27.019> edge<00:03:27.110> so<00:03:27.800> that<00:03:27.830> there's<00:03:28.220> actually

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
very edge so that there's actually

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.340 
very edge so that there's actually
sections<00:03:29.060> that<00:03:29.300> are<00:03:29.360> joining<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.959> loops<00:03:30.140> and

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
sections that are joining the loops and

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.390 
sections that are joining the loops and
what<00:03:30.470> we<00:03:30.590> want<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.860> do<00:03:31.010> is<00:03:31.100> when<00:03:31.280> we're

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
what we want to do is when we're

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.350 
what we want to do is when we're
knitting<00:03:31.610> with<00:03:31.760> this<00:03:31.940> we<00:03:32.120> want<00:03:32.300> to

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
knitting with this we want to

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.449 
knitting with this we want to
concentrate<00:03:32.720> actually<00:03:33.290> in<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.530> holes<00:03:33.739> and<00:03:34.010> we

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
concentrate actually in the holes and we

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:35.890 
concentrate actually in the holes and we
don't<00:03:34.610> want<00:03:34.730> to<00:03:34.940> worry<00:03:35.150> about<00:03:35.269> the<00:03:35.480> sections

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
don't want to worry about the sections

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.810 
don't want to worry about the sections
that<00:03:35.989> are<00:03:36.080> grabbing<00:03:36.350> it<00:03:36.650> in<00:03:36.769> between<00:03:36.920> so

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
that are grabbing it in between so

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.250 
that are grabbing it in between so
here's<00:03:38.120> what<00:03:38.300> we<00:03:38.390> have<00:03:38.540> right<00:03:38.720> now<00:03:38.780> we<00:03:38.959> have

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
here's what we have right now we have

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.250 
here's what we have right now we have
our<00:03:39.290> six<00:03:39.739> on<00:03:39.980> our<00:03:40.489> knitting<00:03:41.060> needles<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.720> what

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
our six on our knitting needles and what

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.840 
our six on our knitting needles and what
I<00:03:42.290> want<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.620> do<00:03:42.739> is<00:03:42.769> do<00:03:42.980> is<00:03:43.130> I<00:03:43.250> want<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.459> stick<00:03:43.730> in

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
I want to do is do is I want to stick in

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.790 
I want to do is do is I want to stick in
the<00:03:43.940> needle<00:03:44.690> like<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:44.930> normally<00:03:45.200> would<00:03:45.410> and

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
the needle like I normally would and

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.890 
the needle like I normally would and
this<00:03:46.489> is<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.970> material<00:03:47.390> coming<00:03:47.570> from<00:03:47.780> the

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
this is the material coming from the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.140 
this is the material coming from the
yarn<00:03:48.110> ball<00:03:48.350> now<00:03:48.950> what<00:03:49.130> I<00:03:49.160> noticed<00:03:49.640> here<00:03:49.970> when<00:03:50.120> I

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
yarn ball now what I noticed here when I

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.120 
yarn ball now what I noticed here when I
did<00:03:50.239> it<00:03:50.450> is<00:03:50.750> that<00:03:51.080> this<00:03:51.260> loop<00:03:51.530> is<00:03:51.680> a<00:03:51.739> little<00:03:52.040> bit

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
did it is that this loop is a little bit

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.770 
did it is that this loop is a little bit
too<00:03:52.310> close<00:03:52.580> and<00:03:52.880> it's<00:03:53.120> not<00:03:53.300> going<00:03:53.450> to<00:03:53.540> give<00:03:53.690> you

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
too close and it's not going to give you

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.870 
too close and it's not going to give you
as<00:03:53.870> much<00:03:53.989> frill<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:54.709> normally<00:03:55.340> when<00:03:55.519> we<00:03:55.550> work

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
as much frill and normally when we work

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.090 
as much frill and normally when we work
in<00:03:56.060> center<00:03:56.540> going<00:03:57.019> from<00:03:57.170> in<00:03:57.590> between<00:03:57.980> the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
in center going from in between the

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.460 
in center going from in between the
edges<00:03:58.430> is<00:03:58.580> that<00:03:58.730> we<00:03:58.820> want<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.090> go<00:03:59.209> to<00:03:59.450> each<00:04:00.140> one

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
edges is that we want to go to each one

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.650 
edges is that we want to go to each one
but<00:04:01.070> on<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.280> edges<00:04:01.610> i<00:04:01.730> want<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.180> skip<00:04:02.450> this

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
but on the edges i want you to skip this

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.870 
but on the edges i want you to skip this
one<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.140> go<00:04:03.200> to<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.530> second<00:04:03.890> one<00:04:03.920> over<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.459> i

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
one and go to the second one over and i

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.460 
one and go to the second one over and i
want<00:04:05.060> you<00:04:05.330> to<00:04:05.390> put<00:04:05.600> it<00:04:05.690> on<00:04:05.810> to<00:04:05.989> your<00:04:06.110> knitting

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
want you to put it on to your knitting

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.560 
want you to put it on to your knitting
needle<00:04:06.890> just<00:04:07.070> like<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:07.459> and<00:04:07.700> i<00:04:08.209> want<00:04:08.390> you<00:04:08.540> to

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
needle just like so and i want you to

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.430 
needle just like so and i want you to
knit<00:04:08.870> as<00:04:09.050> normal<00:04:10.000> so<00:04:11.000> isn't<00:04:11.209> that<00:04:11.300> hard<00:04:11.630> isn't

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
knit as normal so isn't that hard isn't

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.170 
knit as normal so isn't that hard isn't
that<00:04:12.470> pretty<00:04:12.680> cool<00:04:12.950> so<00:04:13.550> now<00:04:13.700> we're<00:04:13.970> going<00:04:14.120> to

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
that pretty cool so now we're going to

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.539 
that pretty cool so now we're going to
go<00:04:14.330> to<00:04:14.360> the<00:04:14.480> next<00:04:14.690> one<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:15.140> so<00:04:15.400> basically<00:04:16.400> you

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
go to the next one and so basically you

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.000 
go to the next one and so basically you
will<00:04:16.669> see<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.030> loop<00:04:17.239> is<00:04:17.390> now<00:04:17.810> attached<00:04:18.260> here

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
will see the loop is now attached here

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.360 
will see the loop is now attached here
so<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:19.669> very<00:04:19.850> next<00:04:20.060> one<00:04:20.330> on<00:04:20.510> the<00:04:20.690> edge<00:04:20.870> is<00:04:21.169> just

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
so the very next one on the edge is just

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.460 
so the very next one on the edge is just
right<00:04:22.370> there<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:23.540> we<00:04:23.660> just<00:04:23.840> want<00:04:24.020> to<00:04:24.140> just

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
right there and we just want to just

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.760 
right there and we just want to just
pull<00:04:24.680> up<00:04:25.180> okay<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:26.419> just<00:04:26.450> liquid<00:04:26.870> on<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.590> your

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
pull up okay and just liquid on to your

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.920 
pull up okay and just liquid on to your
knitting<00:04:28.610> needle<00:04:29.030> so<00:04:29.180> once<00:04:29.360> you<00:04:29.450> get<00:04:29.600> into<00:04:29.720> the

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
knitting needle so once you get into the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.020 
knitting needle so once you get into the
rhythm<00:04:30.050> my<00:04:30.740> camera<00:04:31.160> angles<00:04:31.550> a<00:04:31.669> little<00:04:31.910> bit

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
rhythm my camera angles a little bit

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.950 
rhythm my camera angles a little bit
rough<00:04:32.270> in

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
rough in

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.420 
rough in
for<00:04:33.080> me<00:04:33.169> to<00:04:33.259> be<00:04:33.289> doing<00:04:33.380> this<00:04:33.650> pretty<00:04:34.370> quickly

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
for me to be doing this pretty quickly

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.820 
for me to be doing this pretty quickly
but<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:34.940> whole<00:04:35.270> scarf<00:04:35.630> is<00:04:35.780> over<00:04:36.080> two<00:04:36.380> to<00:04:36.560> three

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
but a whole scarf is over two to three

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.159 
but a whole scarf is over two to three
hours<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:37.400> actually<00:04:37.580> complete<00:04:38.060> one<00:04:38.900> ball<00:04:39.110> of

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
hours to actually complete one ball of

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.890 
hours to actually complete one ball of
the<00:04:39.440> pirouette<00:04:39.860> will<00:04:40.069> equal<00:04:40.520> one<00:04:41.210> scarf<00:04:41.660> and

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
the pirouette will equal one scarf and

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.990 
the pirouette will equal one scarf and
it's<00:04:42.349> a<00:04:42.470> generous<00:04:42.919> sized<00:04:43.130> scarf<00:04:43.490> as<00:04:43.639> you<00:04:43.819> can

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
it's a generous sized scarf as you can

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.550 
it's a generous sized scarf as you can
probably<00:04:44.660> see<00:04:44.780> in<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.020> pictures<00:04:45.289> that<00:04:45.440> I've

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
probably see in the pictures that I've

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.559 
probably see in the pictures that I've
already<00:04:45.680> probably<00:04:45.979> put<00:04:46.220> on<00:04:46.310> to<00:04:46.460> this<00:04:46.580> video<00:04:46.880> so

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 
already probably put on to this video so

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.620 
already probably put on to this video so
I<00:04:47.599> just<00:04:47.840> want<00:04:47.990> to<00:04:48.050> keep<00:04:48.229> going<00:04:48.500> along<00:04:49.630> the

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
I just want to keep going along the

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.600 
I just want to keep going along the
ruffle<00:04:51.020> is<00:04:51.139> forming<00:04:51.530> itself<00:04:51.889> and<00:04:52.099> so

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
ruffle is forming itself and so

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.070 
ruffle is forming itself and so
off-camera<00:04:53.120> i<00:04:53.270> thought<00:04:53.449> to<00:04:53.539> myself<00:04:53.599> i'm<00:04:53.960> going

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
off-camera i thought to myself i'm going

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.689 
off-camera i thought to myself i'm going
to<00:04:54.139> get<00:04:54.229> lazy<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:54.770> not<00:04:54.919> worry<00:04:55.280> about<00:04:55.340> trying

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
to get lazy and not worry about trying

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.129 
to get lazy and not worry about trying
to<00:04:55.789> get<00:04:55.970> that<00:04:56.090> and<00:04:56.300> maybe<00:04:56.419> I'll<00:04:56.569> grab<00:04:56.840> it<00:04:56.870> down

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
to get that and maybe I'll grab it down

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.370 
to get that and maybe I'll grab it down
here<00:04:57.650> maybe<00:04:57.949> in<00:04:58.160> here<00:04:58.580> and<00:04:58.789> what<00:04:59.750> I<00:04:59.780> found<00:05:00.050> is

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
here maybe in here and what I found is

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.620 
here maybe in here and what I found is
that<00:05:00.410> it<00:05:00.650> looked<00:05:00.830> awful<00:05:01.490> so<00:05:01.699> the<00:05:02.180> extra<00:05:02.449> time

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
that it looked awful so the extra time

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.300 
that it looked awful so the extra time
that<00:05:02.840> it<00:05:02.930> takes<00:05:03.080> you<00:05:03.289> to<00:05:03.380> find<00:05:03.680> the<00:05:03.830> edge<00:05:03.979> is

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
that it takes you to find the edge is

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.339 
that it takes you to find the edge is
actually<00:05:05.300> really<00:05:05.539> worth<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:05.960> time<00:05:06.139> because

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 
actually really worth the time because

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.020 
actually really worth the time because
then<00:05:06.680> your<00:05:06.830> ruffles<00:05:07.220> are<00:05:07.370> actually<00:05:07.699> looking

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
then your ruffles are actually looking

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.879 
then your ruffles are actually looking
they<00:05:08.599> look<00:05:08.810> random<00:05:09.289> but<00:05:09.440> they're<00:05:09.590> actually

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
they look random but they're actually

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.920 
they look random but they're actually
pretty<00:05:10.039> consistent<00:05:10.759> which<00:05:10.940> is<00:05:11.120> probably<00:05:11.360> more

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
pretty consistent which is probably more

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.710 
pretty consistent which is probably more
desirable<00:05:12.500> for<00:05:12.770> your<00:05:12.949> project<00:05:13.789> so<00:05:14.570> we're<00:05:14.690> just

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
desirable for your project so we're just

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.620 
desirable for your project so we're just
going<00:05:14.900> to<00:05:14.960> keep<00:05:15.169> working<00:05:15.410> along<00:05:16.389> so<00:05:17.389> a<00:05:17.419> couple

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
going to keep working along so a couple

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.029 
going to keep working along so a couple
tips<00:05:17.930> that<00:05:18.110> I<00:05:18.139> have<00:05:18.380> for<00:05:18.590> you<00:05:18.650> with<00:05:18.889> this

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
tips that I have for you with this

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:20.950 
tips that I have for you with this
particular<00:05:19.370> yarn<00:05:19.789> is<00:05:19.970> that<00:05:20.539> when<00:05:20.720> we<00:05:20.810> go<00:05:20.930> to

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
particular yarn is that when we go to

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.010 
particular yarn is that when we go to
rotate<00:05:21.710> ourselves<00:05:22.550> to<00:05:22.669> come<00:05:22.849> back<00:05:23.060> I<00:05:23.330> tend<00:05:23.930> to

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
rotate ourselves to come back I tend to

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.499 
rotate ourselves to come back I tend to
always<00:05:24.169> rotate<00:05:24.740> my<00:05:25.009> hooks<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.520> same<00:05:25.729> way<00:05:25.909> but

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 
always rotate my hooks the same way but

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.180 
always rotate my hooks the same way but
what<00:05:26.659> happens<00:05:27.050> is<00:05:27.229> is<00:05:27.409> that<00:05:27.560> this<00:05:27.710> material

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
what happens is is that this material

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.649 
what happens is is that this material
because<00:05:28.460> you<00:05:28.580> need<00:05:28.729> to<00:05:28.759> open<00:05:29.000> it<00:05:29.270> up<00:05:29.360> and<00:05:29.479> it's

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659 
because you need to open it up and it's

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:31.180 
because you need to open it up and it's
already<00:05:29.900> like<00:05:30.020> a<00:05:30.080> shoelace<00:05:30.380> when<00:05:30.770> you<00:05:30.860> start

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
already like a shoelace when you start

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.129 
already like a shoelace when you start
with<00:05:31.370> it<00:05:31.520> is<00:05:31.669> that<00:05:32.300> every<00:05:32.539> time<00:05:32.659> you<00:05:32.720> rotate

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
with it is that every time you rotate

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:34.480 
with it is that every time you rotate
you're<00:05:33.349> actually<00:05:33.500> going<00:05:33.740> to<00:05:33.830> be<00:05:33.860> twisting<00:05:34.400> up

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
you're actually going to be twisting up

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.189 
you're actually going to be twisting up
your<00:05:34.639> material<00:05:35.150> so<00:05:35.720> what<00:05:35.870> you're<00:05:36.020> going<00:05:36.110> to

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199 
your material so what you're going to

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:37.990 
your material so what you're going to
find<00:05:36.229> with<00:05:36.650> yourself<00:05:37.070> is<00:05:37.250> that<00:05:37.280> when<00:05:37.759> you<00:05:37.849> go

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
find with yourself is that when you go

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.939 
find with yourself is that when you go
to<00:05:38.060> go<00:05:38.330> back<00:05:38.509> and<00:05:38.720> forth<00:05:38.900> in<00:05:39.139> one<00:05:39.740> direction

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
to go back and forth in one direction

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.330 
to go back and forth in one direction
you<00:05:40.370> should<00:05:40.400> rotate<00:05:41.389> your<00:05:41.750> hook<00:05:41.930> in<00:05:42.340> one

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
you should rotate your hook in one

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.520 
you should rotate your hook in one
direction<00:05:43.520> in<00:05:43.940> the<00:05:44.120> other<00:05:44.300> direction<00:05:45.139> you

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
direction in the other direction you

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.740 
direction in the other direction you
should<00:05:45.560> rotate<00:05:45.889> so<00:05:46.310> not<00:05:46.880> what<00:05:47.180> I'm<00:05:47.270> saying<00:05:47.300> by

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
should rotate so not what I'm saying by

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.270 
should rotate so not what I'm saying by
that<00:05:47.990> is<00:05:48.169> that<00:05:48.199> i<00:05:48.380> normally<00:05:48.530> just<00:05:48.860> go<00:05:49.130> like

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
that is that i normally just go like

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.459 
that is that i normally just go like
this<00:05:49.430> and<00:05:49.490> switch<00:05:49.880> hands<00:05:50.270> but<00:05:50.840> and<00:05:51.050> when<00:05:51.199> i<00:05:51.229> go

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:51.469 
this and switch hands but and when i go

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:53.080 
this and switch hands but and when i go
to<00:05:51.500> do<00:05:51.800> it<00:05:51.919> the<00:05:52.159> next<00:05:52.430> line<00:05:52.580> i<00:05:52.759> should<00:05:52.969> actually

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
to do it the next line i should actually

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.600 
to do it the next line i should actually
do<00:05:53.930> it<00:05:54.050> the<00:05:54.169> other<00:05:54.199> way<00:05:54.500> to<00:05:55.159> prevent<00:05:55.430> the

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
do it the other way to prevent the

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.980 
do it the other way to prevent the
material<00:05:56.030> from<00:05:56.120> actually<00:05:56.449> twisting<00:05:56.840> up

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
material from actually twisting up

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.170 
material from actually twisting up
hopefully<00:05:57.440> that<00:05:57.560> makes<00:05:57.710> a<00:05:57.830> lot<00:05:57.979> of<00:05:58.009> sense<00:05:58.180> so

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
hopefully that makes a lot of sense so

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.649 
hopefully that makes a lot of sense so
again<00:05:59.479> back<00:05:59.719> on<00:05:59.750> the<00:06:00.020> edge<00:06:00.610> just<00:06:01.610> like<00:06:01.729> so<00:06:02.090> and

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:02.659 
again back on the edge just like so and

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:06.100 
again back on the edge just like so and
so<00:06:02.690> then<00:06:03.409> what<00:06:03.860> it<00:06:04.039> is<00:06:04.190> is<00:06:04.430> that<00:06:04.610> six<00:06:05.060> across<00:06:05.690> is

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
so then what it is is that six across is

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.649 
so then what it is is that six across is
a<00:06:06.139> really<00:06:06.530> generous<00:06:06.770> size<00:06:07.159> as<00:06:07.400> well<00:06:07.580> again<00:06:08.419> I

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:08.659 
a really generous size as well again I

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:10.659 
a really generous size as well again I
want<00:06:09.080> to<00:06:09.169> skip<00:06:09.440> the<00:06:09.590> very<00:06:09.800> next<00:06:10.009> one<00:06:10.310> that<00:06:10.520> is

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
want to skip the very next one that is

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:12.279 
want to skip the very next one that is
available<00:06:10.849> so<00:06:11.330> I<00:06:11.389> want<00:06:11.570> to<00:06:11.630> go<00:06:11.690> to<00:06:11.750> the<00:06:11.930> second

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 
available so I want to go to the second

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.100 
available so I want to go to the second
one<00:06:12.380> over<00:06:12.710> I<00:06:12.860> just<00:06:13.550> use<00:06:13.729> my<00:06:13.909> fingers<00:06:13.940> to<00:06:14.330> pull

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
one over I just use my fingers to pull

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.589 
one over I just use my fingers to pull
that<00:06:15.259> open<00:06:15.699> again<00:06:16.699> I<00:06:16.729> just<00:06:16.849> want<00:06:17.210> to<00:06:17.240> go<00:06:17.360> to<00:06:17.419> the

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
that open again I just want to go to the

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:19.629 
that open again I just want to go to the
second<00:06:18.020> loop<00:06:18.199> over<00:06:18.590> when<00:06:18.800> I<00:06:18.830> go<00:06:19.009> to<00:06:19.039> do<00:06:19.310> an<00:06:19.430> edge

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 
second loop over when I go to do an edge

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.399 
second loop over when I go to do an edge
I<00:06:19.969> don't<00:06:20.479> want<00:06:20.630> to<00:06:20.690> go<00:06:20.780> to<00:06:20.840> the<00:06:20.960> first<00:06:21.199> one

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:21.409 
I don't want to go to the first one

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:24.159 
I don't want to go to the first one
because<00:06:22.039> it<00:06:22.370> just<00:06:22.520> makes<00:06:22.759> it<00:06:22.969> a<00:06:23.120> lot<00:06:23.449> nicer<00:06:23.719> and

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
because it just makes it a lot nicer and

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:26.649 
because it just makes it a lot nicer and
so<00:06:24.650> in<00:06:24.919> between<00:06:25.039> again<00:06:25.880> I'm<00:06:26.150> just<00:06:26.300> going<00:06:26.419> to

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659 
so in between again I'm just going to

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:34.350 
so in between again I'm just going to
grab<00:06:26.800> each<00:06:27.800> loop<00:06:28.340> as<00:06:28.550> they<00:06:28.880> come

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.970 

so<00:06:35.360> requires<00:06:35.720> a<00:06:35.870> little<00:06:35.990> more<00:06:36.140> care<00:06:36.500> to<00:06:36.530> do<00:06:36.860> it

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
so requires a little more care to do it

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.070 
so requires a little more care to do it
but<00:06:37.550> you<00:06:37.670> know<00:06:37.790> something<00:06:38.060> like<00:06:38.450> this<00:06:38.630> item<00:06:38.960> is

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
but you know something like this item is

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.510 
but you know something like this item is
actually<00:06:39.500> going<00:06:39.590> to<00:06:39.680> be<00:06:39.740> really<00:06:40.130> cool<00:06:40.340> when

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
actually going to be really cool when

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.520 
actually going to be really cool when
it's<00:06:40.640> done<00:06:40.730> and<00:06:41.090> the<00:06:41.570> extra<00:06:41.960> time<00:06:42.170> that<00:06:42.410> you

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
it's done and the extra time that you

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.670 
it's done and the extra time that you
will<00:06:42.680> take<00:06:42.920> to<00:06:43.610> create<00:06:44.090> this<00:06:44.360> is<00:06:44.600> going<00:06:45.290> going

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
will take to create this is going going

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.380 
will take to create this is going going
to<00:06:45.770> create<00:06:46.010> a<00:06:46.070> look<00:06:46.370> that's<00:06:46.580> absolutely<00:06:47.150> just

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.390 
to create a look that's absolutely just

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.910 
to create a look that's absolutely just
spectacular<00:06:47.570> it's<00:06:48.170> this<00:06:48.500> stuff<00:06:48.740> is

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:48.920 
spectacular it's this stuff is

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.730 
spectacular it's this stuff is
absolutely<00:06:49.520> gorgeous<00:06:50.230> so<00:06:51.230> now<00:06:51.410> we're<00:06:51.560> just

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
absolutely gorgeous so now we're just

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.830 
absolutely gorgeous so now we're just
finishing<00:06:51.920> up<00:06:52.220> and<00:06:52.460> so<00:06:52.970> basically<00:06:53.150> like<00:06:53.690> I

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
finishing up and so basically like I

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.540 
finishing up and so basically like I
said<00:06:54.080> I<00:06:54.110> would<00:06:54.350> have<00:06:54.470> done<00:06:54.620> this<00:06:54.800> but<00:06:55.340> in<00:06:55.460> this

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
said I would have done this but in this

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.800 
said I would have done this but in this
case<00:06:55.790> what<00:06:56.030> I'm<00:06:56.120> going<00:06:56.240> to<00:06:56.300> just<00:06:56.450> do<00:06:56.600> is<00:06:56.720> I'm

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
case what I'm going to just do is I'm

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.740 
case what I'm going to just do is I'm
going<00:06:56.930> to<00:06:56.990> rotate<00:06:57.170> it<00:06:57.500> around<00:06:57.710> like<00:06:58.610> that<00:06:58.850> okay

00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.750 
going to rotate it around like that okay

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.960 
going to rotate it around like that okay
so<00:07:00.350> that<00:07:00.560> it<00:07:00.800> prevents<00:07:01.400> this<00:07:01.550> from<00:07:01.610> El

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:01.970 
so that it prevents this from El

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.910 
so that it prevents this from El
twisting<00:07:02.390> up<00:07:02.540> so<00:07:02.960> all<00:07:03.110> you<00:07:03.170> got<00:07:03.350> to<00:07:03.470> just<00:07:03.590> do<00:07:03.770> is

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:03.920 
twisting up so all you got to just do is
