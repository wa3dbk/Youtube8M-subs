00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.390
 continuing here we are going to put a material 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.670
 for our water 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.670
 Do not put a suit here. 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.399
 cement industry 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.399
 rectangular 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.039
 just to found a little 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.470
 and another to our other one of scene 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.470
 The only care that we have to be people is to do 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.739
 it only takes the company 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.879
 and have to take care to mourn but do not overflow here just that this is a 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.370
 Little hot up there has a 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.660
 in the water leak so put a little under the floor that does not have 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.600
 problem 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.000
 or can 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 also creates chicago from the design of the 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.370
 studying at home we feel it's just a plane to its facade surface 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.390
 of water this is on account of 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.880
 so we will fight here 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.880
 the kingston 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.330
 in two 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.660
 It's called the now 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.660
 and another that calls it pool 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.900
 so now we 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.900
 the water much like glasses catch the bleh king's dream 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.510
 explains much like 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.990
 differential of the water itself refraction dr 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.370
 video in which a placebo pill would be crazy if it were a child 33 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.240
 we can 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.890
 give a color by the beautiful wing has already enabled the side leashes does not look cool 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.640
 at first, this network aims to 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.640
 then this material that her reflection 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.950
 Depends on the year we see it. 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.450
 is basically inflation 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.590
 so the more inclined the more weakened 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.170
 does not lean well thus 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.770
 healing the sleep issue 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.500
 it will be well reflected in sicily 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.360
 that nothing 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.149
 the interpreter in heaven he 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.200
 only that this water for here is not very funny he claims error 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.269
 It gives an air 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.189
 dancing or chemistry box 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.549
 for that we put the bank map 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.549
 - in the bank 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.319
 in the country 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.019
 usually this very large initial value if they do not complain will not stay 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.569
 very interesting 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.619
 klÃ©ber elected here 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:45.819
 then I go 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.819
 Mom tells me that the 10 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.680
 and it will depend on how we want to adjust this routine as it is 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.699
 kind of relief we want 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.609
 now we can see a little better here 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.179
 It's always up to us to have chic achievements. 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:07.349
 so if the psd is going to have to make it smaller than the day 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.759
 it will get a little more interesting 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:13.949
 including after doing those scenes as I am 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:17.219
 Appearing 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.219
 to flex 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.349
 click and try couple only in the reflex resent vecchi with a powder that more 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.619
 interesting 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:30.379
 this kind of effect 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:31.539
 was thousand note 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:33.539
 we're fine here 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:37.639
 let's do as we act to our bench our stool with the Serbian brown 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:38.820
 kind of life funds 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.479
 I can bring people back to zero comma 3 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.029
 I'm staying a little bit longer 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:46.029
 more agitated on clay 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:49.259
 the most irritated of the normal title 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:50.899
 which is a school enzyme 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:54.159
 those who are so little else the water was with us 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.389
 of regular 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.049
 to fraktal 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.799
 We can do a comparison here like this. 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.179
 Mr. Riedel was always good at 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:05.179
 these side-by-side regular capital comparisons 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.299
 have a little more 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:14.719
 rocked like this 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:16.629
 to say 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:19.629
 truco or sesi connected motor lina dar 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.350
 then we either used it or we are regular 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.120
 hawking 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.150
 smaller or fraktal in that it can increase a little size as if it did 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:31.969
 automatic subdivisions or more 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.550
 so it's as if you take the plus of that size and do other smaller ones 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:41.219
 not only the latter 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:43.759
 sheik tietÃª 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.430
 I know that being that we see 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.279
 only what will be indemnified 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:49.430
 It's always important to us 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.430
 I never saw a right that had rendered 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.349
 ivete too agitated 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:02.620
 Wanna come back for them? 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.610
 being hudson 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.559
 of fire 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:08.559
 will depend on how we want to make it come out very well come back here 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.300
 the middleman 8 and putting regular 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.289
 I think it's already interesting 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:15.139
 without pierre 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.050
 It is worth noting here is a bento effect then 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.029
 I sing here 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:22.159
 I request him to continue 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:25.339
 a straight line 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:28.270
 research give real relief even 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.479
 if you vote here for example 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.479
 type t 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:38.020
 boot kimati cut 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.419
 to found a little caesar 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.379
 my transparency 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:46.229
 the hand 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:47.789
 but there was here 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.559
 in this case 

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:52.309
 luiz de aquino 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:55.309
 in this case the given line will stay 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:58.610
 I really had it now 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.610
 being 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.169
 channel if you really want to put it to the ego. 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.449
 that I commented nauseated displays and we would have to change 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.219
 not even a little more health, too 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:13.619
 top 10 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:15.029
 so I'll change here 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:16.619
 my bank 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:18.240
 by waste and swat 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.990
 it's the exchange 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.089
 we can do a test here make less minor here alternate view 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:30.129
 I'll go ahead and put a little more subdivision in this plan 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.740
 on here 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.389
 the goal with 1 4 by 4 fights here 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:35.740
 10 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.740
 kicked out 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:43.349
 which puts more details already 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:47.360
 kind of compare now 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.559
 I get very low 

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:50.380
 same thing that happens to you sick 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.919
 the boot here 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:53.479
 5 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:55.689
 we will see 

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:58.199
 will do some ripples here 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:01.199
 and then we will see that now these waves they really 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:03.619
 but taking it outside 

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:07.069
 I know it would be the most realistic of all 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:10.279
 but with or without which displays take longer 

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:11.949
 take a little longer 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:14.400
 but when it is bigger as soon as this 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.520
 this format and want more past 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.050
 it is heavier center performs in the fast 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.680
 so what really takes is the very detailed and very fine displays 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.589
 that in the grass 

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:24.849
 recently now 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:26.869
 with much more interesting 

00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:30.149
 so this is a case that you can even use the display itself although 

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:33.189
 most of the cases that I see are resolved show with banda 

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:40.039
 classic the two options 

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:41.919
 it is
