wherever you want to stop the animation
let's<00:02:42.880> make<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.180> somewhere<00:02:43.900> around<00:02:44.019> here<00:02:45.120> and

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
let's make it somewhere around here and

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.720 
let's make it somewhere around here and

okay so that's pretty cool so we made a

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.610 
okay so that's pretty cool so we made a
unicorn<00:03:10.510> appear<00:03:10.810> on<00:03:10.960> the<00:03:11.050> screen<00:03:11.290> it's<00:03:11.440> pretty

unicorn appear on the screen it's pretty
clean<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.070> we<00:03:12.130> made<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.310> little<00:03:12.580> animation

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
clean and we made a little animation

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.690 
clean and we made a little animation
first<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:13.990> all<00:03:14.080> I<00:03:14.260> am<00:03:14.290> gonna<00:03:14.800> make<00:03:15.070> sure<00:03:15.130> that

you<00:03:49.000> did<00:03:49.150> with<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:50.560> position<00:03:51.160> keyframing

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
you did with the position keyframing

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.800 
you did with the position keyframing
just<00:03:52.600> presently<00:03:52.990> +<00:03:54.060> go<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.120> wherever<00:03:55.390> you<00:03:55.600> want

just presently + go to wherever you want
to<00:03:55.930> stop<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.350> animation<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:58.140> let's<00:03:59.140> say<00:03:59.770> I

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
to stop the animation and let's say I

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.000 
to stop the animation and let's say I
want<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.520> rotate<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.180> like<00:04:01.480> -<00:04:02.040> 360<00:04:03.510> okay<00:04:05.010> that

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
want to rotate it like - 360 okay that

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.949 
want to rotate it like - 360 okay that
should<00:04:06.160> do<00:04:06.340> so<00:04:06.910> let's<00:04:07.120> take<00:04:07.300> a<00:04:07.330> look<00:04:07.600> right<00:04:07.630> now

should do so let's take a look right now

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.949 
should do so let's take a look right now
okay<00:04:08.739> that<00:04:08.770> looks<00:04:09.100> pretty<00:04:09.430> cool<00:04:09.670> I<00:04:12.750> can<00:04:13.750> see
