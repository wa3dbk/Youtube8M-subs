00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
on the instant boost we'll go over this

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.379 
on the instant boost we'll go over this
more<00:01:43.889> than<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> review<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.209> here

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
as well so let's move on to the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.139 
as well so let's move on to the
motherboard<00:01:47.789> itself<00:01:49.670> I'm<00:01:50.670> doing<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.969> nice

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
motherboard itself I'm doing a nice

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.569 
motherboard itself I'm doing a nice
static<00:01:51.600> bag<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.829> actually<00:01:52.979> has<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> nice

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579

static bag and it actually has a nice
foam<00:01:54.420> package<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:54.959> the<00:01:55.049> background<00:01:55.499> so<00:01:55.619> that

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
foam package on the background so that

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.859 
foam package on the background so that
you<00:01:55.740> don't<00:01:56.009> cut<00:01:56.249> your<00:01:56.399> fingers<00:01:56.789> or<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.539> bag<00:01:57.689> is

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
you don't cut your fingers or the bag is

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.840 
you don't cut your fingers or the bag is
employer<00:01:58.200> open<00:01:58.529> you<00:01:59.369> as<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> component

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
employer open you as a component

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.489 
employer open you as a component
sticking<00:02:00.240> out<00:02:00.359> in<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.509> back<00:02:01.279> it<00:02:02.279> open<00:02:03.350> put<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:04.499 
sticking out in the back it open put the

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:07.359 
sticking out in the back it open put the
round<00:02:04.709> you<00:02:05.279> can<00:02:05.399> see<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.700> ZIF<00:02:05.909> socket<00:02:05.939> here

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
round you can see the ZIF socket here

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.850 
round you can see the ZIF socket here
the<00:02:08.369> area<00:02:08.640> around<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.909> ZIF<00:02:09.090> socket<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.860> it's

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the area around the ZIF socket is it's

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.350 
the area around the ZIF socket is it's
pretty<00:02:11.009> decent<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.700> looks<00:02:11.849> like<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.060> can<00:02:12.180> use

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
pretty decent it looks like you can use

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.990 
pretty decent it looks like you can use
probably<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> few<00:02:13.110> different<00:02:13.349> aftermarket

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
probably a few different aftermarket

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.640 
probably a few different aftermarket
if<00:02:14.240> you<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:14.540> desire<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:14.930> even<00:02:15.440> though<00:02:15.530> this

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
if you so desire and even though this

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.590 
if you so desire and even though this
motherboard<00:02:15.980> really<00:02:16.460> is<00:02:16.610> based<00:02:16.940> on<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.150> small

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
motherboard really is based on a small

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.290 
motherboard really is based on a small
form<00:02:17.900> factor<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.470> as<00:02:18.620> mainly<00:02:19.280> for<00:02:19.490> an<00:02:19.580> HD<00:02:19.730> PC

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
form factor and as mainly for an HD PC

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.570 
form factor and as mainly for an HD PC
but<00:02:21.020> some<00:02:21.410> people<00:02:21.650> care<00:02:21.860> about<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:22.430> I'll

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
but some people care about this so I'll

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.290 
but some people care about this so I'll
go<00:02:22.790> over<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:23.150> here<00:02:23.360> your<00:02:24.050> memory<00:02:24.350> slots<00:02:25.300> there

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
go over it here your memory slots there

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.470 
go over it here your memory slots there

s/pdif but that's ok most people still
have<00:03:41.360> this<00:03:41.510> kind<00:03:41.750> of<00:03:41.840> speaker<00:03:42.110> system<00:03:42.500> anyways

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
have this kind of speaker system anyways

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.210 
have this kind of speaker system anyways
so<00:03:43.820> overall<00:03:44.239> there's<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.930> motherboard<00:03:45.410> we'll

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
so overall there's the motherboard we'll

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.920 
so overall there's the motherboard we'll
just<00:03:46.430> take<00:03:46.519> a<00:03:46.610> quick<00:03:46.850> spin<00:03:47.150> around<00:03:47.299> on<00:03:47.660> it<00:03:47.780> for

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
just take a quick spin around on it for

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.979 
just take a quick spin around on it for
you<00:03:48.019> to<00:03:48.049> see<00:03:48.200> one<00:03:48.320> more<00:03:48.470> time<00:03:48.709> and<00:03:49.600> as<00:03:50.600> we<00:03:50.750> said
