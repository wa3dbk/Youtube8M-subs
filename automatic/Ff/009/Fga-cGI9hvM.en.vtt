00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.200
 Hi everyone, I'm black 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.809
 game and today tomorrow in these days 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.020
 we will have lots of news about black 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.529
 ops to do as much as possible here too 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.180
 in Italy we can have it thanks to 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.320
 gamescom a conference of regions that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.269
 it is taking place precisely in these 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.220
 days tomorrow night the live streaming 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.619
 which you will see in the link found in 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.230
 description below and beyond those 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.719
 in clips you will find other call gameplay 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.030
 of duty black ops 2 multiplayer they are 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.469
 already leaked around the web and me 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.200
 thanks gameplay today i managed to 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.540
 make a list of all the parks that 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.640
 we will find in call of duty black ops 2 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.379
 indeed we leave immediately before you do this you 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.739
 I mean the meeting of black ops 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.570
 2 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.660
 about perk i perk are the bonuses 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.780
 we will not have the bonus prof 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.780
 after all the call of duty based excuses 4 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.730
 so anyway black ops mv 23 bonus pro 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.949
 now we will not have any more problems 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.559
 other things anyway that so able to 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.700
 upgrade our bonuses and leaving 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.070
 immediately with the bonus the bag is that 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.830
 unlike call of duty black ops is 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.939
 weak state of toe weakened but more 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.090
 which weakened is divided into two parts 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.009
 something very wise because really 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.920
 killer in visibility to the ghosts are 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.880
 really powerful bonuses that 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.700
 very many a lot of people hate and 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.700
 finally they did something 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.680
 very reasonable thing, too 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.600
 to eliminate gambers 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.880
 indeed face it in something that 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.920
 considers us the phantom goal and golf 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.049
 the bon ghost will allow us to be 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.259
 invisible to iuav to the enemy watan 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.390
 only if we move if we are still 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.030
 places will identify if we do 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.200
 we will not be able to identify ourselves 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.079
 this thing 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.790
 very much eliminates the fact of changing 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.250
 because so many like black ops yes 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.780
 put with ghosts in a corner e 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.070
 no one saw them with the silencer 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.360
 nobody 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.700
 identifying things here will do so 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.409
 Leorato in radar shall find them anyway 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.780
 you should have to move to be 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.450
 invisible to places thanks to the bonus 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.570
 ghost the second bonus and lightweight 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.520
 ie light which will allow us to 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.170
 have faster movements e 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.240
 probably also no damage from 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.500
 always falls that do not seem to be there 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.330
 fall both within the bones 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.440
 that on the different bonuses and that there is not 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.900
 I'll talk in another video 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.360
 then we will have a flak jacket that smashes 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.620
 which will allow you to have resistance 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.650
 increased explosives we will see it blinds it 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.000
 same name as the report we had 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.280
 in short they could have a different effect 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.170
 and this blinds us practically makes us 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.030
 immune to dependent automatic evenings 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.700
 like the robotic turrets that go by themselves 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.050
 is a series of killings of which vi 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.480
 I'll talk in the next video anyway 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.800
 part and without you told him to 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.810
 commanding goes in search of only the 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.030
 enemy here this blindfold considers us 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.070
 to be immune to this type of series 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.830
 of automatic killing ones 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.540
 then we will have hardline which means 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.360
 the classic bonus is inflexible 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.610
 It lets get our killing 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.310
 with an engraving in less and then we pass 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.720
 the bonus 2 in the bonus is a 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:19.910
 shellfish born cool blood and ditches a 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:22.890
 cold-blooded themselves effects of is 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.239
 possible to phantom this one here 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.980
 for example it will allow us to be 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:31.400
 immune to helicopters and I think so too 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.560
 both and aipi veil and to those things that 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.750
 command the agenda here then we will have one 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.760
 hard wired call series means 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.500
 translated means wired but also if 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.670
 I don't think the kits will be called that 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.280
 allows you to be immune to 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.489
 counter- intelligence lmp 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.110
 then we have jackal avengers that you 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.670
 allows you to restore ammunition e 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.489
 maybe lethal grenades what else do I have to do 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.920
 check however I will talk about it in the point 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.310
 in the next videos then we will have tom next 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.110
 which means hardness translated into that you 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.170
 I think it allows us to live a 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.740
 recoil decreased this not yet 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.270
 But probably at this very safe 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.040
 my diminished ass I don't think so 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.750
 traits of expert as in black hawk and 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.220
 product penetration was the era 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.680
 increase through the walls because 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:22.170
 this will be thanks to promises the sm j2 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.260
 eco priest who can pierce the 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.050
 surfaces okay then we have parties nens 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.400
 ie fast hands that is not a game of 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.870
 prestige because this hands fast one 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.730
 but as a fast station, however, that is it 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.310
 lets you throw more grenades 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.470
 quickly and throw more stunners 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.870
 quickly also equipment b 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.940
 quickly lenco then we have in the 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.540
 space we find dead silence in silence 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.670
 of tomb is represented by this ninja 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.080
 in his design that allows us to have 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.180
 synthesis movements so we can't 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.610
 move silently then we have 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.320
 engineer that means engineer who there 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.140
 allows you to locate explosives of 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.820
 enemy equipment like hackers 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.650
 we have tactical masper this mask 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.800
 tactic that reduces the effects of 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.240
 stun and tactical grenades and mascara 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.220
 tactic prof 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.200
 then we have extreme con of conditioning 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.330
 which are extreme conditions a bit like 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.640
 marathon that considers us to run more 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.980
 for a long time then we have awareness 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.020
 which means awareness and conscience 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.170
 here this is a bit like ninja pro 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.910
 ie this bonus is allowed to 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.960
 feel that the movements of the easily 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.180
 enemies 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.850
 here is also constituted weakened tumi 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.850
 in india 1 without graves 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.480
 silently and this awareness 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.420
 conscience allows us to feel them more 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.340
 more easily here and finally last 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.770
 good is called dexter of ie 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.650
 dexterity and represented with a weapon 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.110
 first upwards and consider of 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.300
 overcome obstacles faster 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.830
 the objects to climb the stairs but 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.240
 above all that to derive a ready more 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.990
 quickly after a courteous these 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.520
 we are running the button to aim 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.960
 we immediately got the rome ready 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.920
 quickly thanks to this bonus 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:08.460
 here to girls like this can not the 15 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:11.010
 16 bonuses that we will find in black ops two 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.230
 maybe some like torres that I wasn't 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.570
 sure they will have another effect anyway 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.370
 in case I will keep you updated you follow 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.170
 one and that maybe a 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.500
 Article about it 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:24.000
 and while to himself as you have seen many 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.140
 especially weakened ghost thing 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 very wise 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:31.650
 in my opinion it is also grave silence 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.520
 then set a little more playable yes 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:38.580
 hope you don't tell me about the sights let's ask 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.960
 a parenthesis we trust we spread a veil 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.060
 pitiful and what it looks like really seems to me 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.580
 powerful, however, we'll see 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.160
 here from the live streaming 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.390
 stream tomorrow I remind you to give 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.830
 a carnet description that you find all 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.500
 the English will continue to follow me 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.840
 on facebook because public news e 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.919
 when I can't do it here on youtube it is 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.600
 served more 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.640
 remember to put it like me if 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.350
 see you tomorrow with a new one 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.150
 video about weapons or series 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:06.020
 of killing the next guys 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.020
 equity black game
