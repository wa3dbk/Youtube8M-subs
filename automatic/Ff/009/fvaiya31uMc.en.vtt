00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
okay let's bounce the Blitz so what we

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.130 
okay let's bounce the Blitz so what we
need<00:00:16.820> is<00:00:17.090> a<00:00:17.270> set<00:00:17.450> of<00:00:17.570> lids<00:00:17.860> talaya<00:00:19.180> right<00:00:20.180> these

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
need is a set of lids talaya right these

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.859 
need is a set of lids talaya right these
are<00:00:21.260> already<00:00:21.470> imbalanced<00:00:22.720> actually<00:00:23.720> two

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
are already imbalanced actually two

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.210 
are already imbalanced actually two
bands<00:00:24.050> know<00:00:24.170> just<00:00:24.349> how<00:00:24.410> to<00:00:24.439> take<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:24.860> tape<00:00:25.070> off

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
bands know just how to take the tape off

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.490 
bands know just how to take the tape off
so<00:00:25.520> check<00:00:26.119> the<00:00:26.300> edges<00:00:26.599> over<00:00:26.930> check<00:00:27.230> there's<00:00:27.380> no

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
so check the edges over check there's no

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.370 
so check the edges over check there's no
split<00:00:27.800> so<00:00:28.099> anyway<00:00:29.000> our<00:00:29.180> tear<00:00:29.480> now<00:00:30.140> you<00:00:30.200> can

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
split so anyway our tear now you can

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.050 
split so anyway our tear now you can
bounce<00:00:30.739> smoke<00:00:31.040> you<00:00:31.250> could<00:00:31.400> fasten<00:00:31.849> together

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.060 
bounce smoke you could fasten together

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.390 
bounce smoke you could fasten together
the<00:00:32.390> ball<00:00:32.570> to<00:00:32.810> the<00:00:32.840> middle<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:33.829> balance<00:00:34.220> them

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
the ball to the middle and balance them

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.870 
the ball to the middle and balance them
on<00:00:34.550> that<00:00:35.200> you<00:00:36.200> could<00:00:36.500> bet<00:00:37.460> you<00:00:37.550> could<00:00:37.700> bounce

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
on that you could bet you could bounce

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.479 
on that you could bet you could bounce
it<00:00:38.120> on<00:00:38.180> your<00:00:38.360> finger<00:00:39.130> not<00:00:40.130> really<00:00:40.399> very

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
it on your finger not really very

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.500 
it on your finger not really very
effective<00:00:41.030> accurate<00:00:42.880> you<00:00:43.880> could<00:00:44.120> bounce<00:00:44.270> it

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
effective accurate you could bounce it

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.990 
effective accurate you could bounce it
on<00:00:44.600> a<00:00:44.680> straight<00:00:45.680> edge<00:00:45.890> or<00:00:46.130> a<00:00:46.160> knife<00:00:46.310> edge<00:00:46.610> but

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
on a straight edge or a knife edge but

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.120 
on a straight edge or a knife edge but
again<00:00:47.240> it's<00:00:47.960> not<00:00:48.230> very<00:00:48.350> accurate<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:48.890> what<00:00:49.010> you

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
again it's not very accurate so what you

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.740 
again it's not very accurate so what you
want<00:00:49.310> why<00:00:50.270> not<00:00:50.480> just<00:00:50.510> get<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:51.470> blade<00:00:51.890> balancer

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
want why not just get a blade balancer

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.780 
want why not just get a blade balancer
very<00:00:53.750> simple<00:00:54.230> very<00:00:54.380> accurate<00:00:55.010> very<00:00:55.370> quick<00:00:55.640> to

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
very simple very accurate very quick to

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.410 
very simple very accurate very quick to
use<00:00:56.080> what<00:00:57.080> they<00:00:57.140> do<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.760> nuts<00:00:58.940> off<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.210> top

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
use what they do to the nuts off the top

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.100 
use what they do to the nuts off the top
fix<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:00.500> plate<00:01:00.710> on

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.860 

what<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.770> normally<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:05.160> is<00:01:05.309> balance<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.510> in

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
what I normally do is balance that in

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.390 
what I normally do is balance that in
the<00:01:07.080> way<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> rotation<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.040> blade<00:01:08.250> is

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the way that the rotation the blade is

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.610 
the way that the rotation the blade is
so<00:01:08.670> that's<00:01:09.270> obviously<00:01:09.420> wrong<00:01:09.750> way<00:01:09.900> around<00:01:09.960> so

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
so that's obviously wrong way around so

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.110 
so that's obviously wrong way around so
they<00:01:10.800> hit<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.160> one<00:01:11.340> off<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:13.250> little<00:01:14.250> bit<00:01:14.370> pop

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
they hit that one off a little bit pop

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.280 
they hit that one off a little bit pop
whoops<00:01:15.660> no<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.230> got<00:01:16.470> right<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:18.000> put<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.660> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
whoops no I got right and put it on the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.900 
whoops no I got right and put it on the
way<00:01:19.410> it<00:01:19.470> wouldn't<00:01:20.010> oh<00:01:20.070> baby<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.790> your

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
way it wouldn't oh baby on on your

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.219 
way it wouldn't oh baby on on your
helicopter<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.600> going<00:01:22.590> clockwise<00:01:23.900> so<00:01:24.900> tame

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
helicopter so we going clockwise so tame

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.090 
helicopter so we going clockwise so tame
that<00:01:25.260> one<00:01:25.590> up<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:28.380> second<00:01:28.740> one<00:01:30.290> well<00:01:31.290> not<00:01:31.860> off

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
that one up the second one well not off

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.840 
that one up the second one well not off
and<00:01:32.870> then<00:01:33.870> line<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.890> up<00:01:35.070> obviously<00:01:35.280> going<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
and then line it up obviously going to

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.219 
and then line it up obviously going to
go<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> right<00:01:36.509> we're<00:01:36.660> so<00:01:36.990> that'll<00:01:37.170> be

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
go in the right we're so that'll be

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.320 
go in the right we're so that'll be

you do is add a piece of tip on a small
piece<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:06.960> electricians<00:02:07.680> TM<00:02:08.070> or<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.970> tell<00:02:09.179> us

when<00:02:09.510> it<00:02:09.570> comes<00:02:09.750> with<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.929> blades<00:02:10.970> just<00:02:12.019> dress

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
when it comes with the blades just dress

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.420 
when it comes with the blades just dress
it<00:02:13.080> on<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.470> blade<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.680> then<00:02:13.980> where<00:02:14.280> the

balance point where it needs it and then

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.970 
balance point where it needs it and then
you<00:02:15.870> can<00:02:15.989> stick<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.290> on<00:02:17.660> okay<00:02:18.660> right<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.590> there

you can stick it on okay right so there

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.560 
you can stick it on okay right so there
you<00:02:20.070> go<00:02:20.130> let's<00:02:20.459> we<00:02:20.580> have<00:02:20.700> neither<00:02:21.030> bounce<00:02:21.360> so

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
you go let's we have neither bounce so

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.780 
you go let's we have neither bounce so
stuck<00:02:21.810> with<00:02:22.019> a<00:02:22.049> tip<00:02:22.290> on<00:02:22.470> there<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.700> other

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.610 
happens if you buy a new server blades
obviously<00:02:28.860> they<00:02:29.010> should<00:02:29.160> be<00:02:29.310> balanced<00:02:29.730> well

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
obviously they should be balanced well

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.199 
obviously they should be balanced well
sometimes<00:02:31.620> are<00:02:31.799> not<00:02:31.950> like<00:02:32.760> what<00:02:32.940> we'll<00:02:33.060> do

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
sometimes are not like what we'll do

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.570 
sometimes are not like what we'll do
we'll<00:02:34.200> get<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.380> new<00:02:34.560> set<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:34.950> blades

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
we'll get a new set of blades

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:44.670 
we'll get a new set of blades
just<00:02:37.210> find<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.450> passes<00:02:37.810> us<00:02:38.460> then<00:02:39.460> we'll<00:02:39.550> go<00:02:43.680> new

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
just find it passes us then we'll go new

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.330 
just find it passes us then we'll go new
set<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:44.950> blades<00:02:45.100> music<00:02:45.520> you<00:02:45.610> see<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:48.100> half

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
set of blades music you see the the half

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.140 
set of blades music you see the the half
tip<00:02:48.760> on<00:02:48.970> them<00:02:49.180> so<00:02:50.110> that<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:51.340> me<00:02:51.460> says<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.790> beam

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
tip on them so that to me says the beam

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.200 
tip on them so that to me says the beam
balanced<00:02:52.770> so<00:02:53.770> I've<00:02:53.950> taught<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.160> lot<00:02:54.310> new<00:02:54.910> set<00:02:55.120> of

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
balanced so I've taught a lot new set of

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.940 
balanced so I've taught a lot new set of
blades<00:02:55.360> where's<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.080> tip<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:58.740> let's<00:02:59.740> see

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
blades where's the tip so let's see

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.050 
blades where's the tip so let's see
let's<00:03:00.400> see<00:03:00.490> if<00:03:00.700> it'll<00:03:00.820> balance<00:03:02.760> again<00:03:03.760> put

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
let's see if it'll balance again put

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.700 
let's see if it'll balance again put
them<00:03:04.180> on<00:03:04.270> it<00:03:04.450> where<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.900> duck<00:03:05.050> no<00:03:05.230> direction

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
them on it where the duck no direction

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:12.490 
them on it where the duck no direction
what<00:03:05.860> go

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.220 

not<00:03:13.400> on

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:28.110 

right<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.849> second<00:03:21.209> one

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.570 

obviously<00:03:28.959> if<00:03:29.049> your<00:03:29.500> blades<00:03:29.739> aren't<00:03:30.010> balanced

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
obviously if your blades aren't balanced

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.220 
obviously if your blades aren't balanced
when<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.209> got<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.480> fly<00:03:31.720> obviously<00:03:32.140> it's

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
when you got the fly obviously it's

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.960 
when you got the fly obviously it's
going<00:03:32.349> to<00:03:32.409> cause<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.620> lot<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:32.890> vibration<00:03:33.129> in<00:03:33.790> the

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
going to cause a lot of vibration in the

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.729 
going to cause a lot of vibration in the
head<00:03:34.180> rates<00:03:34.569> of<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.959> whole<00:03:35.110> had<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.319> couple<00:03:35.560> of

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
head rates of the whole had a couple of

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.530 
head rates of the whole had a couple of
so<00:03:35.920> you<00:03:36.010> want<00:03:36.159> a<00:03:36.220> nice<00:03:36.400> balance<00:03:36.940> blades<00:03:37.390> you

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
so you want a nice balance blades you

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.839 
so you want a nice balance blades you
wouldn't<00:03:37.780> write<00:03:38.500> in<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.799> drive<00:03:39.099> a<00:03:39.129> car<00:03:39.489> right

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
wouldn't write in a drive a car right

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.509 
wouldn't write in a drive a car right
and<00:03:39.970> what<00:03:40.090> about<00:03:40.120> with<00:03:40.500> unbalanced<00:03:41.500> wheels<00:03:41.769> so

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
and what about with unbalanced wheels so

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.809 
and what about with unbalanced wheels so
let's<00:03:42.700> have<00:03:42.819> a<00:03:42.879> look<00:03:43.049> nip<00:03:44.049> them<00:03:44.200> up<00:03:44.670> pull<00:03:45.670> them

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
let's have a look nip them up pull them

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:52.110 
let's have a look nip them up pull them
straight<00:03:46.290> pop<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.470> down<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:49.209> go<00:03:50.340> are<00:03:51.340> they

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
straight pop it down and go are they

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.990 
straight pop it down and go are they
bounced

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.420 

yes<00:03:57.290> yes<00:03:58.290> they<00:03:58.560> are<00:03:58.709> so<00:03:59.489> there<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.360> go
