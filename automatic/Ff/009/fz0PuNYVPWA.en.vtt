00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hi how are you subnormal I tell you 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.990
 yesterday a punctured virus came into my pc 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.330
 fuck I could not open the king the and neither 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.820
 ms confit I wanted to restart in mode 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.070
 sure and the bugger virus number 113 mi 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.619
 USB memory and shit hid my 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.160
 shit files my antivirus did not 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.289
 nothing 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.779
 fucking antivirus good lidÃ³n musters 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.630
 investigate a little and after an hour 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.070
 of frustration get the solution I've 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.590
 I uploaded a program that you can 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.539
 download it in 5 seconds is called the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.730
 urge this program restores the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.140
 system when you run it you only have 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.079
 than download it from the link of the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.640
 description weighs only 700 kilobytes so 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.829
 that is not much 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.860
 Well, you bastards just have to extract it 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.680
 and run it as administrator click 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.690
 sens and after that a 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.090
 window like this with options like 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.219
 explore select folder and exit 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.410
 Well, it is advisable that you initiate the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.210
 exploration with the disk that is by 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.210
 defect and you believe him to explore 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.660
 well finished the exploration there not 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.460
 is everything we will have to restart the pc 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.160
 in safe mode that is what this 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.350
 program manages to enable those who do not 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.300
 you know they can constantly press the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.310
 button the c8 just when it starts to 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.650
 Restart to show them a 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.870
 screen like this one and start windows in 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.030
 safe way good once here 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.690
 we execute the ms config that is already 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.270
 enabled 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.390
 we open execute and write ms config 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.270
 and we accept in the window we go 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.490
 to the windows start tab and it's 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.440
 then when we find the element 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.229
 start that has created that virus focus 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.320
 which blocks our pc first we must 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.759
 uncheck the active box of the virus 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.590
 immediately we are placed in the command and 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.780
 we open our team explorer and 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.150
 We visually copy the address where 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.490
 there is the virus after copying it 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.890
 we keep the changes of the most conflict and 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.130
 that 'not accept if you see a 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.360
 Gas box click on exit without restarting 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.070
 good in the team explorer 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.830
 we press enter to the address that 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.660
 we copy once there you will find the 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.700
 camera throwing viruses with icons 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.180
 like these and the only thing that you have to 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.030
 do 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.040
 delete all those files for 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.800
 conclude just restart windows 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.450
 normally and finished business if you 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.340

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.070
 share it if you have any questions 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.910
 you just have to leave your comment 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.910
