00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 in a city council 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.390
 it was decided that the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.519
 Parking situation for trucks around the vw 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.650
 The most important thing is to change the work 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.630
 parking lots hopelessly crowded what 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.969
 this leads to the driver in the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.100
 border building or unceremoniously 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.230
 stop walking or cycling 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.539
 through the trucks weighing up to 40 tons 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.150
 cause considerable damage to this 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.150
 parking spaces for residents pedestrians and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.109
 Cyclists are annoyed 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.060
 the biggest problem, however, are the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.759
 legally determined steering times and 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.649
 the fact that the drivers per day 9 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.270
 ten times a week twice a week 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.520
 you are allowed to move your vehicle 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.920
 is this time expired is called 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.079
 stop and take a break 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.750
 Half an hour parking can be so for 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.870
 The driver will be expensive because so the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.070
 link times, we all exceed 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.140
 want to make money 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.680
 then we should drive or have to 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.600
 drive and the other side will us 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.579
 Again, not the opportunity given to us 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.670
 to comply with law 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.010
 must travel time shift 2 rest 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.630
 the police are attacking and the park sinners 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.280
 scare away from your place 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.260
 Imagine if no parking 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.630
 is free to another location at the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.570
 The park also forbidden is not 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.520
 Ending cycle on these waiting times 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.479
 to load and unload do not just carry 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.650
 to relax the situation with you 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.650
 have been here since when 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.160
 and when is the delivery date of 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.960
 The center will be at 17 o'clock 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.730
 I have time window as a ford 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.100
 registration at 17 o'clock but at the latest 17 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.690
 Clock is already over now wanted 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.010
 I'm on call because there are the researchers 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:50.490
 then full and they do not know when they will 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.920
 there comes a solution to the problem 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.960
 it does not seem to exist for the time being 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.760
 Thus, the police continue to be the driver 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.010
 shoo away from your parking 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.300
 so that they take on another 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.300
 put it down again
