00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
team or combination um I think in this

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.789 
team or combination um I think in this
game<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.329> was<00:01:36.479> about<00:01:36.750> listen<00:01:37.259> against<00:01:37.590> why

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
game it was about listen against why

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.010 
game it was about listen against why
because<00:01:38.189> listen<00:01:38.490> counters<00:01:39.030> are<00:01:39.240> very<00:01:39.540> hard<00:01:39.840> if

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
because listen counters are very hard if

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.190 
because listen counters are very hard if
he<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.890> meteor<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.820> jungle<00:01:42.240> alone<00:01:42.360> she<00:01:43.079> will

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
he like meteor and jungle alone she will

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.600 
he like meteor and jungle alone she will
just<00:01:43.439> beat<00:01:43.920> her<00:01:44.130> easy<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:45.450> then<00:01:46.369> listen<00:01:47.369> Kent

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
just beat her easy and then listen Kent

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.510 
just beat her easy and then listen Kent

farm jungle that fastest shawana so you

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.109 
farm jungle that fastest shawana so you
better<00:01:51.000> gantu<00:01:51.479> theme<00:01:51.720> not<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.860> farm<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.970> saw

alliance<00:04:37.979> i<00:04:38.130> think<00:04:38.460> a<00:04:38.610> lot<00:04:38.820> of<00:04:39.090> people<00:04:39.180> are

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
alliance i think a lot of people are

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:40.820 
alliance i think a lot of people are
going<00:04:39.479> to<00:04:39.570> be<00:04:39.630> giving<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.020> other<00:04:40.199> teams<00:04:40.650> in

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
going to be giving the other teams in

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.810 
going to be giving the other teams in
the<00:04:40.889> league<00:04:41.039> a<00:04:41.280> little<00:04:41.520> bit<00:04:41.610> more<00:04:41.699> attention

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
the league a little bit more attention

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.110 
the league a little bit more attention
and<00:04:42.630> then<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:42.960> last<00:04:42.990> is<00:04:43.620> from<00:04:43.889> at<00:04:44.070> sedo<00:04:44.370> fit<00:04:44.639> FL

I<00:04:45.330> think<00:04:45.600> SK<00:04:45.900> gaming<00:04:46.080> can<00:04:46.440> be<00:04:46.560> pretty<00:04:46.800> strong

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
I think SK gaming can be pretty strong

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.650 
I think SK gaming can be pretty strong
in<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.370> entire<00:04:47.580> split<00:04:47.880> they<00:04:48.210> are<00:04:48.360> very

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
in the entire split they are very

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.990 
in the entire split they are very
skilled<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.259> jess's<00:04:49.770> is<00:04:49.949> very<00:04:50.220> underrated<00:04:50.820> I

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
skilled and jess's is very underrated I

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.999 
skilled and jess's is very underrated I
think<00:04:51.630> SK<00:04:51.990> still<00:04:52.199> need<00:04:52.320> to<00:04:52.380> step<00:04:52.620> up<00:04:52.740> at<00:04:52.919> the

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
think SK still need to step up at the

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.740 
think SK still need to step up at the
moment<00:04:53.340> you<00:04:53.430> know<00:04:53.550> they<00:04:53.759> just<00:04:54.090> added<00:04:54.270> iterated

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
moment you know they just added iterated

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.210 
moment you know they just added iterated
about<00:04:54.930> a<00:04:54.960> week<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:55.380> half<00:04:55.410> ago<00:04:55.740> or<00:04:56.009> two<00:04:56.190> weeks

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
about a week and a half ago or two weeks

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.890 
about a week and a half ago or two weeks
ago<00:04:56.550> I<00:04:56.820> think<00:04:57.060> they<00:04:57.270> still<00:04:57.419> trying<00:04:57.660> to<00:04:57.720> find

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
ago I think they still trying to find

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.980 
ago I think they still trying to find
their<00:04:58.110> they<00:04:58.830> form<00:04:59.310> their<00:04:59.639> the<00:05:00.300> way<00:05:00.539> the<00:05:00.780> team

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
their they form their the way the team

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.749 
their they form their the way the team
works<00:05:01.259> as<00:05:01.440> a<00:05:01.470> whole<00:05:01.740> mechanically<00:05:02.550> they're

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 
works as a whole mechanically they're

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.879 
works as a whole mechanically they're
doing<00:05:03.000> good<00:05:03.120> things<00:05:03.449> but<00:05:04.020> as<00:05:04.169> same<00:05:04.470> mistakes

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
doing good things but as same mistakes

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.080 
doing good things but as same mistakes
that<00:05:04.979> Alliance<00:05:05.370> are<00:05:05.460> making<00:05:05.759> their<00:05:05.880> not

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
that Alliance are making their not

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.520 
that Alliance are making their not
rotating<00:05:06.630> they're<00:05:06.750> not<00:05:06.840> playing<00:05:07.020> objective

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
rotating they're not playing objective

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.260 
rotating they're not playing objective
so<00:05:07.740> it'll<00:05:08.130> take<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.280> little<00:05:08.550> bit<00:05:08.669> more<00:05:08.880> time<00:05:09.060> for

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
so it'll take a little bit more time for

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.870 
so it'll take a little bit more time for
them<00:05:09.389> to<00:05:09.419> become<00:05:10.080> dark<00:05:10.560> horses<00:05:10.979> I<00:05:11.099> think<00:05:11.130> thank
