00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello how good are we all returned 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.160
 we have moved to a bathroom 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.130
 and well I will explain how to clean 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.320
 in a natural way what are the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.900
 bathroom taps or also 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.510
 from anywhere in a kitchen by 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.670
 example or a sink for example 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.070
 also and good and we are going to clean it of 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.720
 a natural way and that's why we have not 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.119
 moved are we put bathing and 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.130
 how am I explaining and good first thing 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.700
 of everything we have to know that there is 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.440
 different types of taps 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.079
 would normal stabilize there is another one that is 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.510
 porcelain for example aluminum 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.969
 tinplate or whatever there are different 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.520
 types of faucets and good we go 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.340
 to clean this we have here and for 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.649
 that we are going to use the products now 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.420
 we have to know I already know that there are 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.399
 the products that they sell in the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.530
 Currently they are products for 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.020
 clean the faucet but we're going 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.000
 to use as I said a natural way 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.370
 because we have to look for the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.269
 environment also and also by 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.420
 our ecosystem and that's why 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.119
 this time we are going to use what 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.000
 it's lemon we can also use what 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.219
 is for example and carbonate also but 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.990
 we are going to use lemon because 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:21.140
 the lemons are the best because the 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.329
 hail we can the cake also 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.280
 lemon yogurt and good in other 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.189
 Sometimes you can teach him other ways 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.079
 to use what is lemon and good what 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.420
 first of all we go the bile ferÃ­a 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.020
 we have to use as I said a 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.880
 lemon 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.360
 I have this here and that's why we're going to 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.750
 use this we do not have to leave for 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.550
 half 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.190
 and then we go to the taps 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.660
 we open lemon and we remove it if 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.880
 we want the pipes or if you do not 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.340
 We leave, I leave them because it's better 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.860
 and well now we have to go to the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.260
 taps we also know that we have to 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.140
 clean what is this from here the 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.570
 circle this because also metallic and 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.760
 it will be much more gleaming with 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.260
 that we started at the bottom and 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.200
 then for the one above because later 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.140
 we have to clean with a rag this 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.480
 what are we doing 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:19.010
 we will specify what bands and we are going to give it 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.010
 let's give it a little 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.170
 how well it smells we are giving little to 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.540
 little we are going squeezing a little bit more 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.050
 on all sides and we have to 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.050
 to take advantage of 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.650
 this has acid and then what does 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.950
 the acid is to clean what is 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.950
 metal 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.720
 what are we going with? 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.260
 this we leave about five minutes to 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:53.720
 that drives what has been lemon and 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.160
 and to better clean the lemon which 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.710
 We are talking 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.050
 so we do not leave the same right now 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.270
 has what the lemon juice and then 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.610
 we have to give him a rag if not 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.280
 we have for example a magazine or 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.240
 a newspaper whatever we are giving him and 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.940
 then rinse with the water with which 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.800
 now we move to the top part if 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.560
 we still have lemon like they have been in 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.069
 this case, we also clean with the 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.660
 same union 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:28.960
 we are giving what he said yes 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:32.470
 we go here we take care so that 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.660
 do not leave the water and we get dirty 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.310
 giving him around the tap and this has 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.410
 to be all over the tap because to 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.060
 that we want to clean the bottom part and 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.280
 we leave the dirty top not to 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.210
 something that is not understood with what 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.070
 we are giving everywhere this too 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.630
 also the part especially because what 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.770
 which is the face we are talking about 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.380
 the hourly 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.650
 this usually also affects the part of 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.590
 here from outside especially and the part of 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.810
 tap 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.050
 what I recommend is that if we give 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.030
 a lot of face in what in the filter 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.129
 of the tap, we will have to change it 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.930
 on the other because there I can not do 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.090
 nothing I 'm explaining of one thing that is 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.250
 can do because that's plumbing 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.410
 otherwise we will talk about something else 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.079
 but right now he was talking about the 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.780
 faucet cam the faucet faces of a 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.550
 said anybody like I'm talking 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.909
 we are giving them everywhere 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.740
 when we are seeing with half a lemon 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:32.199
 we have how to clean a faucet 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.000
 whole with which I still not used and the 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.819
 another part of everything we can use it 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.229
 so for what is the tap of the base 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:41.139
 of the teeth for example also 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.440
 you can use it the other lemon and that's why 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.880
 we take advantage 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:50.849
 if we have bicarbonate we use it too 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:54.569
 because everything would be linked 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:56.849
 of lemon as you are seeing and now yes 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.349
 we have poplar tacos with a rag 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.539
 newspaper or whatever 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:03.479
 the other one we can not save it if not 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:06.629
 what we have to use is saved and 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.729
 now we would only take part of the 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:10.889
 risk is also that we are going to 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.409
 clean as we are seeing has a lot 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:16.999
 lime and then we have to clean it 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:21.240
 also with what we would give him with lemon 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:25.409
 to the part of the leaf or we do not give 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:29.400
 pretty good there right now we're 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:32.430
 seeing that he has what is lemon 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.880
 he is good at it and now we would leave 5 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:39.330
 minutes and we passed the following we take 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.080
 rhythm we put it looking at what the 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.659
 hole 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.659
 of the bathtub and now it is given 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:52.800
 he is giving everything 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.800
 you are giving a little bit of everything 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.180
 We have been cleaning with water 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.669
 you want to give him everything and 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.580
 then if we want to leave them and it's the 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:05.169
 first step to remove our face from 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.080
 the bathtub because I hope that I have 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:10.509
 liked these tips and the 'lady this 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.210
 it would only be cleaning with a paper or 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:15.419
 with a notebook if we have and only 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.979
 what I hope you liked 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:20.080
 this tutorial nothing of favorites if you 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.210
 liked and good to put me the comments 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.219
 without having a tutorial that you would like 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.349
 that made me put what are the 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:29.129
 comments thank you very much and a 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:29.129
 strong step all
