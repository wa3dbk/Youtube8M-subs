00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
like a 721 and brought it out and

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.910 
like a 721 and brought it out and
actually<00:01:11.520> mowed<00:01:12.300> the<00:01:12.570> bank<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.200> showed<00:01:13.710> me

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
grasshopper and the first thing I stress

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.000 
grasshopper and the first thing I stress
is<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:03.239> way<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.570> mow<00:03:03.750> index<00:03:04.140> built<00:03:04.530> itself

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
is the way the mow index built itself

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.030 
is the way the mow index built itself
because<00:03:05.970> I've<00:03:06.150> tried<00:03:06.420> other<00:03:06.660> mowers<00:03:07.040> they're

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
because I've tried other mowers they're

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.910 
because I've tried other mowers they're
bad<00:03:08.250> about<00:03:08.690> clumping<00:03:09.690> up<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.080> grass<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.739> just

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920

problem<00:03:13.500> with<00:03:13.769> grasshoppers<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:15.420> actually

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
problem with grasshoppers it actually

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.809 
problem with grasshoppers it actually

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.790 

without<00:03:19.510> looking<00:03:19.900> at<00:03:20.020> books<00:03:20.230> or<00:03:20.590> anything
