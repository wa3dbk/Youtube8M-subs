00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
screen that literally flips around like

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.560 
screen that literally flips around like

convertible tablets before those are
usually<00:00:33.100> systems<00:00:33.700> where<00:00:34.270> the<00:00:34.360> screen<00:00:34.570> rotates

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
usually systems where the screen rotates

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.569 
usually systems where the screen rotates
around<00:00:35.290> this<00:00:35.800> is<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.040> first<00:00:36.220> time<00:00:36.310> you<00:00:36.460> see

one that literally flips back and forth
like<00:00:38.470> this<00:00:38.860> so<00:00:39.340> you<00:00:39.400> can<00:00:39.490> fold<00:00:39.850> it<00:00:39.940> down<00:00:40.090> and

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420

gigs<00:00:49.300> of<00:00:49.450> ram<00:00:49.630> so<00:00:50.530> it's<00:00:50.800> really<00:00:51.040> not<00:00:51.310> going<00:00:51.490> to

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
gigs of ram so it's really not going to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
the touch interface on top of it it

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.080 
the touch interface on top of it it
tends<00:00:56.200> to<00:00:56.290> feel<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.560> little<00:00:56.740> bit<00:00:57.100> sluggish<00:00:57.490> but

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
tends to feel a little bit sluggish but

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.340 
tends to feel a little bit sluggish but
at<00:00:58.180> least<00:00:58.300> there<00:00:58.510> is<00:00:58.600> a<00:00:58.630> custom<00:00:59.170> touch

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
at least there is a custom touch

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.690 
at least there is a custom touch
interfaces<00:00:59.770> if<00:00:59.950> I<00:01:00.010> flip<00:01:00.220> the<00:01:00.370> screen<00:01:00.520> back

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
interfaces if I flip the screen back

around<00:01:01.150> and<00:01:01.420> fold<00:01:02.140> it<00:01:02.290> down<00:01:02.440> you'll<00:01:02.740> see<00:01:02.800> that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
around and fold it down you'll see that

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.490 
around and fold it down you'll see that
it<00:01:03.160> goes<00:01:03.280> into<00:01:03.760> this<00:01:04.570> touch<00:01:04.869> interface<00:01:05.290> right

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
it goes into this touch interface right

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.289 
it goes into this touch interface right
here<00:01:05.710> which<00:01:05.830> lets<00:01:06.009> you<00:01:06.100> have<00:01:06.220> quick<00:01:06.490> access<00:01:06.520> to

gigs of ram and a 250 gig hard drive if
you<00:01:57.969> think<00:01:58.179> about<00:01:58.240> it<00:01:58.420> it<00:01:58.630> does<00:01:58.780> have<00:01:58.959> a

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
you think about it it does have a

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.039 
you think about it it does have a
slightly<00:01:59.799> higher<00:01:59.950> definition<00:02:00.429> screen<00:02:00.700> it's

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
slightly higher definition screen it's

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.559 
slightly higher definition screen it's
1366<00:02:02.049> x<00:02:02.200> 768<00:02:02.859> while<00:02:03.189> most<00:02:03.429> 10-inch<00:02:03.850> netbooks

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
1366 x 768 while most 10-inch netbooks

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.859 
1366 x 768 while most 10-inch netbooks
are<00:02:04.749> 1024<00:02:05.649> x<00:02:06.039> 600<00:02:06.369> so<00:02:07.270> if<00:02:07.329> you<00:02:07.389> add<00:02:07.539> those<00:02:07.719> all

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
are 1024 x 600 so if you add those all

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.900 
are 1024 x 600 so if you add those all
together<00:02:08.020> you<00:02:08.679> know<00:02:08.770> maybe<00:02:08.800> it's<00:02:09.069> about<00:02:09.130> 399

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
together you know maybe it's about 399

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.460 
together you know maybe it's about 399
netbook<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:10.539> basically<00:02:10.840> you're<00:02:10.959> paying<00:02:11.200> a
