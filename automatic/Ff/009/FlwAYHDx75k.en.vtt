00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.759
 and now the best overview 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.330
 inertial coils of all time and 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.870
 peoples 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.820
 known under the brand name Neva in general, I 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.240
 I consider it a great luck that 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.789
 time came into our hands this 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.550
 perfect mechanical product Neva 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.119
 coil and it's really perfect 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.619
 her thing is all in its place every 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.710
 cog each lever 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.380
 all sizes and proportions are very good 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.190
 well thought out and mechanical 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.780
 parts are incredibly resistant to wear in 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.000
 operating low coil very 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.520
 simple and even the one who takes the first 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.949
 her hands can easily open it without 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.230
 labor understand how it all works here 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.649
 such a lever click open look 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:04.409
 we study therefore there is no point in telling 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.840
 about obvious things but a couple of nuances 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.860
 especially useful novice fisherman 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.210
 should still be shown and also we 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.650
 show another interesting point 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.850
 I discovered recently that 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.070
 start let's start with what 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.200
 read what is written on the back side 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.869
 Neva coil body 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.549
 here it is necessary to take a picture 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.549
 what we actually do 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.100
 but here's the connection with these voiced 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.480
 shows the names of information generally think 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.420
 what next is no point 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.310
 tell some details of what 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.250
 this coil consists and so on just 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.110
 the next question is next or we 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.750
 feel and understand 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:02.750
 hidden in her strength and its capabilities or 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.620
 no objectivity for the sake of need to recognize 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.300
 that neva coil in one moment 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.420
 loses modern gear it comes 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.600
 about casting distance if we drop 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.630
 heavy feeder with bait in general 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.930
 heavy bottom gear then we are limited 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:25.640
 probably in such numbers is 70 maximum 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.770
 80 meters I think that modern 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.530
 bizarre ration coil with fine 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.010
 smooth thread with a powerful feeder 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.190
 a rod of 10-20 meters will leave us 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.590
 behind but it is only in one discipline 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.550
 But in all other disciplines 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.860
 Neva reel leaves far behind 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.160
 already modern gear but still there may 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.090
 there are some nuances 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.480
 this screw 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.510
 top here on this reel you can 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.030
 show it eliminates longitudinal play 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.880
 drum need to unscrew this little nut 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.610
 and use a thin screwdriver 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.160
 screw up light touch then 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.510
 twist this little nut and so 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.330
 longitudinal play of the drum we will eliminate 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.860
 what else moment is that nuance about 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.040
 which i told which i 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:23.450
 discovered quite by accident the case was 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.800
 so here is the Neva coil has these 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.130
 here are my relatives 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.940
 pens that serve for twenty years if 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.680
 no more and sometime they me and not only 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.880
 these hands seemed to me and other anglers 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.330
 very thin 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.459
 and uncomfortable that's why many are clearly 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.160
 Chinas these pens wore any segment 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.519
 hose to make them non-slip 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.070
 thick and easy to use however 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.100
 it turned out that this is the measure 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.050
 undertaking 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.170
 anglers for such a convenience 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.260
 steals our meters and throwing meters 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.380
 because there is a very serious 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.170
 air resistance when casting and 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.060
 drum coil used to become like 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.610
 it was discovered by accident 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.690
 when on 2 coils in turn almost 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.930
 Immediately, I once crumbled and yet 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:20.030
 broke the handle native native pens 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.210
 I put it on one of them but what 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.670
 fell under the arm here here such 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.890
 Here are the syringes from the syringe of their needles 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.940
 checks such here I cut them off on these 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:34.250
 pins put handles become thinner 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.670
 next time I solved this question here 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.580
 so here I wore this coil 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:44.860
 silicone tubes on top ordinary 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.450
 Kembriki was a pity because of such a trifle 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.360
 disable one and the second coil 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.550
 because they were already installed 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.890
 the bearings are such a procedure here 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.840
 apparently worth bearing there is so old 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.540
 old phishing tradition on neva 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.250
 coils install bearings but i 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.890
 I think that this should be done only after 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:08.690
 of having a native drum sleeve 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.840
 will break and fall into disrepair and 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:15.610
 there will be a backlash for example 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.920
 the reel is this if I'm not mistaken 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.470
 here still has no bearings 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:26.450
 Here is the native vtulochka still normal 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:29.300
 condition is not very erased here and also 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:32.600
 This rink at this coil is quite good 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:36.350
 inertia we are so far with stop bearings 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.410
 let's not hurry one more moment behind 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.370
 agnes to the coil there is such a here 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:45.260
 so tricky 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.730
 the nut she holds the shaft of the drum fixes 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.410
 him 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:51.160
 sometimes fishing she can get loose 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:54.590
 it happens very very extremely rare but 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:58.100
 round pliers wearing a backpack 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:05.600
 not at all 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:07.310
 we are nearing completion and here is our 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.150
 domestic 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:13.610
 the chair coil that was bought well 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.220
 in order to look at every 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:20.510
 case if in some carcass some 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:23.090
 replacement yes there is because low coil 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:26.030
 whatever it is but i think that 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.610
 such a way in which she reached us with 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.740
 by the parameters if and even someone 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.960
 doing then it will be the wrong child 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.540
 coil so if suddenly 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.950
 all my partnership at once 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.800
 coils will become worthless 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:43.340
 Now please have a replacement coil est 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.760
 Angle this is our Zhytomyr reel 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:49.730
 Ukrainian Ukrainian coil in her 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.160
 very nice smooth ride very long 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.180
 move with it all good two bearings 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.110
 not worth 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.730
 from birth she has thin arms that 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.940
 especially important for casting 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:05.000
 light weights a little harsh 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:08.360
 ratchet but in general then if to her 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.780
 get used then i think as a substitute 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:15.140
 German coil why not and 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:18.980
 further try to take her with you on 

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:21.230
 fishing and see but here's how she 

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.840
 show itself with such a system 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:26.570
 studying and here is the first impression about her 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.360
 pretty good very 

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.490
 good coil can be safely 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.320
 recommend 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.310
 Well, that's probably all he came up 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:39.040
 end review 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.040
 inertial reels for phishing
