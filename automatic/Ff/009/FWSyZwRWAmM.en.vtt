hello and welcome to a quick mount guide

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.160 
hello and welcome to a quick mount guide
so<00:00:03.000> this<00:00:03.120> time<00:00:03.330> we're<00:00:03.510> going<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.780> be<00:00:03.840> talking

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
so this time we're going to be talking

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.070 
so this time we're going to be talking
about<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.440> reins<00:00:04.710> of<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.400> Raven<00:00:06.150> Lord<00:00:06.390> this

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
about the reins of the Raven Lord this

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.299 
about the reins of the Raven Lord this
is<00:00:07.350> definitely<00:00:07.680> one<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.010> most<00:00:08.130> wanted

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
is definitely one of the most wanted

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.879 
is definitely one of the most wanted
mounts<00:00:08.730> in<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.880> game<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.389> it's<00:00:09.750> found<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.380> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
mounts in the game and it's found in the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:11.870 
mounts in the game and it's found in the
Burning<00:00:11.340> Crusade

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
Burning Crusade

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.490

collector's edition actually containing

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.660 
collector's edition actually containing
them<00:00:15.269> out<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.690> essentially<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.770> remake<00:00:17.430> of

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
them out that is essentially a remake of

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.580 
them out that is essentially a remake of
the<00:00:17.760> raven<00:00:18.180> lord<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.510> can<00:00:18.690> fly<00:00:18.869> i<00:00:19.140> thought<00:00:19.529> it

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
the raven lord that can fly i thought it

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.529 
the raven lord that can fly i thought it
would<00:00:19.680> be<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> pretty<00:00:19.980> good<00:00:20.430> idea<00:00:20.820> just<00:00:21.420> to

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
would be a pretty good idea just to

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.660 
would be a pretty good idea just to
quickly<00:00:21.689> tell<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.230> probably<00:00:22.680> two<00:00:22.920> people<00:00:23.369> out

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
quickly tell the probably two people out

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.189 
quickly tell the probably two people out
there<00:00:24.000> who<00:00:24.180> don't<00:00:24.449> know<00:00:24.600> how<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.840> get<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
there who don't know how to get the

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.859 
there who don't know how to get the
raven<00:00:25.500> lord<00:00:25.590> just<00:00:26.310> how<00:00:26.400> they<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.730> get<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.119> so

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
raven lord just how they can get it so

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.720 
raven lord just how they can get it so
there<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.080> some<00:00:28.230> good<00:00:28.260> news<00:00:28.439> actually<00:00:29.010> mounts

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
there is some good news actually mounts

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.849 
there is some good news actually mounts
are<00:00:30.000> now<00:00:30.269> account<00:00:30.720> bound<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.439> game<00:00:31.619> and

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
are now account bound in the game and

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.000 
are now account bound in the game and
this<00:00:32.579> means<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.450> well<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.649> hops<00:00:34.829> so

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
this means that well this is hops so

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.610 
this means that well this is hops so
quite<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> lot<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:36.420> boss<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.840> question<00:00:37.260> Anzu

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
quite a lot the boss in question Anzu

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.340 
quite a lot the boss in question Anzu
can<00:00:37.950> only<00:00:38.070> be<00:00:38.250> killed<00:00:38.520> once<00:00:39.239> per<00:00:39.540> day<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.930> only

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
can only be killed once per day and only

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.380 
can only be killed once per day and only
on<00:00:40.469> heroic<00:00:40.860> mode<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.940> means<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.210> you

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
on heroic mode so this means that you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.299 
on heroic mode so this means that you
can<00:00:42.510> actually<00:00:42.629> try<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.350> time<00:00:43.559> per<00:00:43.829> day<00:00:44.010> per

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
can actually try one time per day per

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.639 
can actually try one time per day per
character<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.510> multiple<00:00:45.629> 85s<00:00:46.530> or

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
character so if you have multiple 85s or

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.400 
character so if you have multiple 85s or
90s<00:00:47.160> or<00:00:47.309> whatever<00:00:47.550> then<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.690> going<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.379> a

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
90s or whatever then it's going to be a

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.250 
90s or whatever then it's going to be a
lot<00:00:49.710> quicker<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:51.300> drop<00:00:51.510> rate<00:00:51.719> for<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> mount

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
lot quicker the drop rate for the mount

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.549 
lot quicker the drop rate for the mount
is<00:00:52.410> 1<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.070> 2%<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.899> formula<00:00:55.410> for

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
is 1 to 2% and the formula for

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.260 
is 1 to 2% and the formula for
calculating<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.129> drop<00:00:56.340> chance<00:00:56.579> over<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.030> given

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
calculating a drop chance over a given

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.560 
calculating a drop chance over a given
number<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.690> runs<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.260> 1<00:00:58.920> minus<00:00:59.370> 1<00:00:59.820> minus<00:00:59.850> X<00:01:00.359> to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
number of runs is 1 minus 1 minus X to

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.540 
number of runs is 1 minus 1 minus X to
the<00:01:00.690> power<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.899> y<00:01:01.199> X<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> drop<00:01:02.100> chance<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the power of y X is the drop chance and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.160 
the power of y X is the drop chance and
Y<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.910> amount<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.120> runs<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.600> whatever

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
Y is the amount of runs and whatever

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.660 
Y is the amount of runs and whatever
I've<00:01:04.379> already<00:01:04.619> done<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> maths<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.400> it's

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
I've already done the maths and it's

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.020 
I've already done the maths and it's
left<00:01:05.850> my<00:01:06.119> head<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.990> anyway<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.400> 50%

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
left my head so anyway to have a 50%

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.490 
left my head so anyway to have a 50%
chance<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.630> seeing<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.990> mount<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.380> will

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
chance of seeing this mount you will

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.399 
chance of seeing this mount you will
have<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.770> kill<00:01:10.890> Anzu<00:01:11.369> 47<00:01:12.270> times<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.689> then<00:01:13.229> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
have to kill Anzu 47 times and then to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.469 
have to kill Anzu 47 times and then to
get<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> 90%<00:01:14.130> chance<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.939> kill<00:01:15.180> him<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
get a 90% chance you have to kill him a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.520 
get a 90% chance you have to kill him a
lovely<00:01:16.759> 153<00:01:17.759> times<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.390> course<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.320> could

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
lovely 153 times of course you could

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.080 
lovely 153 times of course you could
never<00:01:19.710> see<00:01:19.950> him<00:01:20.040> because<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> roughly

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
never see him because it is a roughly

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.690 
never see him because it is a roughly
1.5%<00:01:21.990> drop<00:01:22.380> rate<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.009> over<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.250> large<00:01:23.460> enough

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
1.5% drop rate but over a large enough

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.520 
1.5% drop rate but over a large enough
sample<00:01:23.880> size<00:01:24.090> you're<00:01:24.810> probably<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.409> to

sample size you're probably going to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.859 
sample size you're probably going to
eventually<00:01:26.009> get<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.310> guy<00:01:26.479> still<00:01:27.479> though<00:01:27.659> when

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
eventually get the guy still though when

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.109 
eventually get the guy still though when
you<00:01:27.990> are<00:01:28.140> dealing<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:28.560> 1.5<00:01:29.250> percent<00:01:29.610> drop<00:01:29.880> in

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
you are dealing with 1.5 percent drop in

you are dealing with 1.5 percent drop in
terms<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.570> statistics<00:01:31.049> even<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.820> 1000<00:01:32.820> attempt

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
sample size is not really ginormous

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.210

anyway<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:36.810> your<00:01:36.960> level<00:01:37.259> 85<00:01:37.619> or<00:01:37.799> above<00:01:38.009> this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
