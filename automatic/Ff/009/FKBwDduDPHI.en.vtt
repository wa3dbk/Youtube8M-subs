pretty much the same speed so okay we
can<00:00:34.559> have<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> little<00:00:35.100> bit<00:00:35.309> song

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:48.090 

and<00:00:43.379> yeah<00:00:44.379> I<00:00:45.030> will<00:00:46.030> first<00:00:46.420> show<00:00:46.809> you<00:00:47.350> on<00:00:47.890> the

Galaxy<00:00:48.550> Note

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.639 

so<00:01:07.670> as<00:01:07.850> you<00:01:08.060> can<00:01:08.240> see<00:01:08.450> it's<00:01:08.630> a<00:01:08.719> real<00:01:08.960> big<00:01:09.259> screen

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
so as you can see it's a real big screen

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:34.130 
so as you can see it's a real big screen
it's<00:01:10.640> really<00:01:10.880> nice<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.570> play

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.790 

can<00:01:34.770> be<00:01:35.010> a<00:01:35.040> little<00:01:35.310> hard<00:01:35.760> sometimes<00:01:36.510> I<00:01:37.170> think

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
can be a little hard sometimes I think

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.610 
can be a little hard sometimes I think
this<00:01:38.310> game<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:39.120> little<00:01:39.479> bit<00:01:39.659> easier<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
this game is a little bit easier on the

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:47.420 
this game is a little bit easier on the
bigger<00:01:41.070> screen<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:44.479> know<00:01:45.710> it's<00:01:46.710> easier<00:01:47.250> to

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
bigger screen so you know it's easier to

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.180 
bigger screen so you know it's easier to
game<00:01:47.760> on<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> bigger<00:01:48.420> screen<00:01:48.750> than<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:49.619> small

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
game on a bigger screen than on a small

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.980 
game on a bigger screen than on a small
screen<00:01:50.960> not<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.880> 4.3<00:01:53.880> inch<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.330> a<00:01:54.360> small

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
screen not that a 4.3 inch is a small

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.550 
screen not that a 4.3 inch is a small
screen<00:01:55.440> but<00:01:56.270> if<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.570> would<00:01:57.750> compare<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
screen but if you would compare it to

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.180 
screen but if you would compare it to
this<00:01:58.680> 5.3<00:01:59.580> it's<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.090> big<00:02:00.360> difference<00:02:03.860> chased<00:02:04.860> by

laggy sometimes I don't know why and
just<00:02:56.170> feels<00:02:56.560> like<00:02:56.740> it's<00:02:56.890> going<00:02:57.280> faster<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.210> the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
just feels like it's going faster on the

just feels like it's going faster on the
samsung<00:02:58.810> galaxy<00:02:58.840> s2<00:02:59.880> maybe<00:03:00.880> it's<00:03:01.090> because

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
samsung galaxy s2 maybe it's because

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:13.800 
samsung galaxy s2 maybe it's because
it's<00:03:01.600> a<00:03:01.780> lower<00:03:02.620> resolution
