any end grain the shape of the cutter

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.959 
any end grain the shape of the cutter
will<00:01:35.469> influence<00:01:36.469> the<00:01:37.130> pattern<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.520> you<00:01:37.700> get

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
will influence the pattern that you get

this off here and I'll show you how it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.679 
this off here and I'll show you how it
works<00:01:51.429> when<00:01:52.429> we<00:01:52.459> look<00:01:52.759> at<00:01:52.909> our<00:01:53.029> chatter<00:01:53.420> tool

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
works when we look at our chatter tool

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.739 
works when we look at our chatter tool
we've<00:01:54.380> got<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.619> spring<00:01:55.100> steel<00:01:55.429> cutter<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.179> the

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:56.749 
we've got a spring steel cutter and the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.599 
we've got a spring steel cutter and the
spring<00:01:57.049> steel<00:01:57.259> cutter<00:01:57.619> when<00:01:57.859> it<00:01:58.009> contacts<00:01:58.579> the

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:58.609 
spring steel cutter when it contacts the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:01.690 
spring steel cutter when it contacts the
wood<00:01:58.990> oscillates<00:01:59.990> in<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.740> very<00:02:00.950> rhythmic<00:02:01.219> way

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
wood oscillates in a very rhythmic way

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.719 
wood oscillates in a very rhythmic way
and<00:02:02.179> depending<00:02:02.990> on<00:02:03.109> how<00:02:03.319> we<00:02:03.380> present<00:02:03.829> the

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
and depending on how we present the

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.779 
and depending on how we present the
cutter<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:06.200> our<00:02:06.349> workpiece<00:02:06.829> we<00:02:07.189> can<00:02:07.429> pretty

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
cutter to our workpiece we can pretty

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.550 
cutter to our workpiece we can pretty
well<00:02:07.880> predict<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.810> pattern<00:02:09.229> that<00:02:09.410> we're

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
well predict the pattern that we're

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.980 
well predict the pattern that we're
going<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.709> get<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.340> I'm<00:02:11.150> going<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.420> do<00:02:11.569> two<00:02:11.780> of

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
going to get and I'm going to do two of

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.540 
going to get and I'm going to do two of
them<00:02:12.110> here<00:02:12.319> just<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.680> show<00:02:12.740> you

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
them here just to show you

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.050 
them here just to show you
a<00:02:13.580> different<00:02:14.000> variation<00:02:14.270> I<00:02:15.790> like<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.940> use<00:02:17.030> a

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
a different variation I like to use a

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.840 
a different variation I like to use a
lot<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.420> speed<00:02:17.840> typically<00:02:18.350> around<00:02:18.710> 3000<00:02:19.400> rpms

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
lot of speed typically around 3000 rpms

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.530 
lot of speed typically around 3000 rpms
it's<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.780> very<00:02:21.110> very<00:02:21.500> quick<00:02:25.090> let's<00:02:26.090> see<00:02:26.300> how<00:02:26.480> we

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
it's a very very quick let's see how we

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.390 
it's a very very quick let's see how we
did

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.520 

very<00:02:31.400> nice<00:02:31.670> delicate<00:02:32.510> fine<00:02:32.810> pattern

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
very nice delicate fine pattern

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.890 
very nice delicate fine pattern
so<00:02:34.310> let's<00:02:34.580> come<00:02:34.790> out<00:02:34.940> a<00:02:34.970> little<00:02:35.150> bit<00:02:35.390> I'm<00:02:35.630> going

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
so let's come out a little bit I'm going

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.880 
so let's come out a little bit I'm going
to<00:02:35.990> change<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:37.310> angle<00:02:38.210> of<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.810> tool<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.650> it's

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
to change the angle of the tool and it's

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.290 
to change the angle of the tool and it's
going<00:02:40.070> to<00:02:40.160> give<00:02:40.280> me<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.430> very<00:02:40.700> very<00:02:40.940> different

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
going to give me a very very different

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:52.240 
going to give me a very very different
pattern<00:02:49.060> this<00:02:50.060> pattern<00:02:50.120> is<00:02:50.750> much<00:02:51.710> different

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
pattern this pattern is much different

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.940 
pattern this pattern is much different
than<00:02:52.820> what<00:02:53.000> we<00:02:53.150> have<00:02:53.360> in<00:02:53.540> there<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.960> know<00:02:54.590> it's

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
than what we have in there I know it's

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.860 
than what we have in there I know it's
probably<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.580> little<00:02:55.790> hard<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.210> see<00:02:56.390> on<00:02:56.420> camera

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
probably a little hard to see on camera

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.320 
probably a little hard to see on camera
in<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.710> real<00:02:57.920> world<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.460> wouldn't<00:02:58.820> add<00:02:59.000> color

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
in the real world I wouldn't add color

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.560 
in the real world I wouldn't add color
I'm<00:02:59.930> going<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.230> add<00:03:00.380> some<00:03:00.710> color<00:03:00.920> here<00:03:01.360> just<00:03:02.360> to

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
I'm going to add some color here just to

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.560 
I'm going to add some color here just to
highlight<00:03:03.130> what<00:03:04.130> we've<00:03:04.310> done<00:03:04.580> so<00:03:05.000> you<00:03:05.090> can<00:03:05.330> see

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
highlight what we've done so you can see

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.730 
highlight what we've done so you can see
it<00:03:05.660> for<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:05.960> camera

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.680 

we<00:03:10.190> will<00:03:10.310> do<00:03:10.460> that<00:03:10.700> one<00:03:10.880> in<00:03:11.260> grid

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.570 

and<00:03:15.960> this<00:03:16.260> one<00:03:16.470> in<00:03:16.590> black<00:03:22.040> yeah<00:03:23.040> we<00:03:23.220> did<00:03:23.400> pretty

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
and this one in black yeah we did pretty

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.540 
and this one in black yeah we did pretty
well<00:03:24.230> let<00:03:25.230> me<00:03:25.260> get<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.560> out<00:03:25.710> of<00:03:25.770> here<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.370> can

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.220 

give<00:03:29.550> you<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.700> better<00:03:29.910> idea<00:03:30.080> what<00:03:31.080> it<00:03:31.200> looks

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
give you a better idea what it looks

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.550 
give you a better idea what it looks
like<00:03:34.190> so<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.630> looks<00:03:36.630> like<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:36.960> took<00:03:37.110> us<00:03:37.290> hours

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
like so that looks like it took us hours

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.310 
like so that looks like it took us hours
to<00:03:37.770> carve<00:03:38.220> when<00:03:38.820> in<00:03:38.940> some<00:03:39.420> matter<00:03:39.600> of<00:03:39.750> fact<00:03:39.990> it

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
to carve when in some matter of fact it

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.580 
to carve when in some matter of fact it
just<00:03:40.350> took<00:03:40.740> seconds<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:42.080> think<00:03:43.080> you'll<00:03:43.410> really
