attempted<00:02:20.989> shooting<00:02:21.019> end<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:22.069> with<00:02:22.280> nothing

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
attempted shooting end it with nothing

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.860 
attempted shooting end it with nothing
because<00:02:23.030> we<00:02:23.300> miss<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.629> target<00:02:25.629> okay<00:02:26.629> so<00:02:26.690> now

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
because we miss the target okay so now

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.589 
because we miss the target okay so now
it's<00:02:27.019> their<00:02:27.230> turn<00:02:28.000> very<00:02:29.000> nicely<00:02:29.209> designed

to collect and to have for later you can

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.800 
to collect and to have for later you can
click<00:02:46.430> with<00:02:46.489> a<00:02:46.640> gravity<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:47.540> can<00:02:47.690> actually

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
click with a gravity so you can actually

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.420 
click with a gravity so you can actually
make<00:02:48.170> longer<00:02:48.440> jumps<00:02:48.920> if<00:02:49.069> you<00:02:49.160> change<00:02:49.370> the

fire<00:02:52.519> damage<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.150> you<00:02:53.360> have<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.599> collect

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
fire damage and you have to collect

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.170 
fire damage and you have to collect
rewards<00:02:54.319> purchase<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.040> cards<00:02:55.370> this<00:02:55.880> is<00:02:56.000> still

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
rewards purchase the cards this is still

rewards purchase the cards this is still
a<00:02:56.209> turn-based<00:02:56.480> strategy<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:57.440> let's<00:02:58.370> see<00:02:58.489> what

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
a turn-based strategy and let's see what

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.220 
a turn-based strategy and let's see what
happens<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.940> this<00:02:59.030> warm<00:02:59.299> if<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.660> use<00:02:59.930> the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
happens to this warm if I use the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.809 
happens to this warm if I use the
bazooka<00:03:00.489> yet<00:03:01.489> again<00:03:02.140> too<00:03:03.140> much<00:03:03.290> 54<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:04.370> fell

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
bazooka yet again too much 54 and I fell

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.470 
bazooka yet again too much 54 and I fell
into<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.989> water<00:03:06.140> almost<00:03:06.739> nope<00:03:07.640> fell<00:03:08.180> into<00:03:08.299> the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
into the water almost nope fell into the

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.210 
into the water almost nope fell into the
water<00:03:08.569> and<00:03:08.810> died<00:03:11.349> the<00:03:12.349> controls<00:03:12.739> take<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.010> while

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
water and died the controls take a while

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.410 
water and died the controls take a while
to<00:03:13.400> get<00:03:13.489> used<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.819> especially<00:03:13.940> if<00:03:14.329> you're

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
to get used to especially if you're

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.610 
to get used to especially if you're
expecting<00:03:14.660> touch<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:17.319> there<00:03:18.319> are<00:03:18.440> also

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
expecting touch and there are also

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.440 
expecting touch and there are also
classes<00:03:19.190> so<00:03:19.340> there<00:03:19.459> are<00:03:19.609> three<00:03:19.850> big<00:03:20.000> additions

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
classes so there are three big additions

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.120 
classes so there are three big additions
here<00:03:20.630> we<00:03:20.780> have<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.019> third<00:03:21.230> system<00:03:21.680> we<00:03:22.100> have

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
here we have the third system we have

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.190 
here we have the third system we have
the<00:03:22.459> new<00:03:22.609> d-pad<00:03:23.090> control<00:03:23.569> and<00:03:23.810> have<00:03:24.049> the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
the new d-pad control and have the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.289 
the new d-pad control and have the
classic<00:03:24.440> system<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.549> world<00:03:25.760> classes<00:03:26.150> are

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
classic system the world classes are

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.379 
classic system the world classes are
dividing<00:03:26.780> too<00:03:27.049> heavy<00:03:27.489> scientist<00:03:28.489> scout<00:03:29.150> and

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
dividing too heavy scientist scout and

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.590 
dividing too heavy scientist scout and
soldier<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:30.819> guess<00:03:31.819> I'm<00:03:31.970> totally<00:03:32.209> going<00:03:32.569> to

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
soldier I guess I'm totally going to

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.800 
soldier I guess I'm totally going to
lose<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:32.930> battle<00:03:33.109> if<00:03:33.410> I<00:03:33.530> keep<00:03:33.739> losing<00:03:33.950> worms

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
lose this battle if I keep losing worms

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.750 
lose this battle if I keep losing worms
maybe<00:03:35.810> let's<00:03:36.049> try<00:03:36.139> and<00:03:36.410> draw<00:03:36.560> a<00:03:36.590> grenade<00:03:36.950> this

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
maybe let's try and draw a grenade this

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.289 
maybe let's try and draw a grenade this
time<00:03:38.620> k<00:03:39.620> so<00:03:39.680> this<00:03:39.980> little<00:03:40.160> fellow<00:03:40.519> is<00:03:40.880> going<00:03:41.180> to

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
time k so this little fellow is going to

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:42.759 
time k so this little fellow is going to
throw<00:03:41.450> little<00:03:41.750> grenade<00:03:42.019> by<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.290> way<00:03:42.470> since

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
throw little grenade by the way since

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
you can zoom in a bit and also move

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.969 
you can zoom in a bit and also move
around<00:04:33.879> the<00:04:34.000> map<00:04:34.090> but<00:04:34.780> only<00:04:35.199> a<00:04:35.229> little<00:04:35.349> bit<00:04:35.680> not

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:48.969 
slow movement of the d-pad I guess I can

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:59.209 
slow movement of the d-pad I guess I can
also<00:04:49.090> use<00:04:49.530> this<00:04:50.530> star<00:04:51.099> system<00:04:51.400> so<00:04:52.060> let's<00:04:52.449> go

actually<00:06:03.610> pretty<00:06:03.819> painful<00:06:04.389> I<00:06:04.539> guess<00:06:04.990> my<00:06:05.259> two

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:05.319 
actually pretty painful I guess my two

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:07.200 
actually pretty painful I guess my two
worms<00:06:05.650> are<00:06:05.860> dead<00:06:06.099> or<00:06:06.339> the<00:06:06.610> least<00:06:06.789> one<00:06:06.969> of<00:06:07.089> them

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
worms are dead or the least one of them

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.369 
worms are dead or the least one of them
is<00:06:08.069> almost<00:06:09.069> too<00:06:09.509> ok<00:06:10.509> so<00:06:10.839> this<00:06:10.990> battle<00:06:11.319> is

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:11.379 
is almost too ok so this battle is

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:12.809 
is almost too ok so this battle is
almost<00:06:11.680> lost<00:06:11.919> there<00:06:12.190> is<00:06:12.279> no<00:06:12.370> point<00:06:12.550> in<00:06:12.729> going

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:12.819 
almost lost there is no point in going

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:18.149 
almost lost there is no point in going
on<00:06:12.969> here<00:06:15.449> let's<00:06:16.449> quit<00:06:16.750> and<00:06:17.050> see<00:06:17.949> the<00:06:18.069> other

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:18.159 
on here let's quit and see the other

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:21.209 
on here let's quit and see the other
sections<00:06:18.759> as<00:06:19.120> you<00:06:20.080> can<00:06:20.229> see<00:06:20.440> that<00:06:20.620> G<00:06:20.740> game<00:06:20.949> just

00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:21.219 
sections as you can see that G game just

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:22.499 
sections as you can see that G game just
spit<00:06:21.400> on<00:06:21.430> me<00:06:21.639> and<00:06:21.819> it<00:06:21.909> happens<00:06:22.210> quite<00:06:22.360> a<00:06:22.419> lot

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:22.509

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:25.019 
spit on me and it happens quite a lot
that<00:06:23.229> justifies<00:06:23.889> the<00:06:24.099> low<00:06:24.310> grade<00:06:24.639> that<00:06:24.909> I'm

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:25.029 
that justifies the low grade that I'm

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:26.999 
that justifies the low grade that I'm
going<00:06:25.150> to<00:06:25.270> give<00:06:25.479> to<00:06:25.629> this<00:06:25.719> game<00:06:25.960> usually<00:06:26.680> would

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:27.009 
going to give to this game usually would

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:28.469 
going to give to this game usually would
have<00:06:27.159> been<00:06:27.279> a<00:06:27.310> high<00:06:27.520> grade<00:06:27.580> maybe<00:06:28.150> something

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
have been a high grade maybe something

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:30.570 
have been a high grade maybe something
like<00:06:28.599> a<00:06:28.629> nine<00:06:28.960> because<00:06:29.440> the<00:06:29.770> very<00:06:29.860> fun<00:06:30.159> game<00:06:30.190> is
