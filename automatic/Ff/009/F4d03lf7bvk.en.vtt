00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello everyone and welcome to my 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.960
 channel today we continue with you 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.420
 decorate our beautiful bird with which 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.330
 in the future we will make a pendant and so to us 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.940
 need to do different patterns and do i 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.420
 I will be using them with just a little 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.210
 ball needle with an awl and choose what 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.430
 it will be convenient for you to do that 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.099
 patterns also do at your discretion 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.080
 include fantasy in exercises and 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.080
 draw on the bird what you want 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.180
 I decided to decorate the wings just 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.670
 dots along the edge make it a tool 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.309
 with a small little ball also this 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.579
 You can also make a toothpick or 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.440
 needle now it's time tail 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.110
 on the tail also do different 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.120
 dots you can put some circles 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.820
 commas and stripes 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.739
 but now I suggest you just 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.739
 see how I do it 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.120
 and many people have nowhere to heed to heed to heed to 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.390
 unit 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.480
 after the bird is already decorated need 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.000
 clean it up for this i take wet 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.580
 napkin and start gently wipe 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.190
 the entire surface of the bird removing all sorts 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.380
 hairs maybe some dust got 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.480
 and fingerprints for the bird to be 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.480
 exactly neat and clean 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:43.939
 I plan where I will be located 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.489
 eye and do it just no techniques 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:49.010
 with the help of a needle but later on you 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.780
 You will see that we are in place of these dots. 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.209
 there was a strip with 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.269
 with an open edge, it seemed to me that 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.150
 so the eye is virtually invisible and therefore 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.930
 I made it strips of white 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.930
 with lace edge 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.980
 Now you need to arrange and the edges of the bird 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.440
 that everything was beautiful on the perimeter 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.659
 starting with a mint color, first make out 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.930
 but those places where it is mint color 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:20.269
 whale head and one wing 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.629
 everything else I will decorate 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.480
 using n live color i just take 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:30.950
 a thin strip cut off her figure 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.500
 blade and wrap it all his little bird 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.989
 I hold this strip well 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.420
 she tightly pressed osprey pity for 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.359
 birds so that it does not disappear from us and 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.510
 go nowhere 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.949
 See to these cloves which 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.750
 openwork did not raise much high 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:50.870
 the old woman will be impossible then 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:55.659
 scratch well into your clothes or flat 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.659
 scratch scratch you arm or neck 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:12.190
 and new york and after the whole edge 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.470
 already issued 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.390
 broke their cycle too orange 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.600
 now you need to make a hole in which 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:27.610
 called the inserted pins I do this with 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:29.050
 using needles are also extra i 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.750
 made some beads 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.120
 to arrange the cord that we will have 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.400
 bake on the bird and and at a temperature 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.669
 110 degrees half an hour as you see here 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.090
 already eye I designed this strip 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:46.030
 white with lace edge vip pins 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:50.340
 rut us glue so they are good 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.340
 held and did not fall 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.639
 on pins 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.560
 need to attach two ringlet in which 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.560
 we will tie the waxed cord 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:31.110
 but I chose white to one 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.780
 ringlet tied this cord and do 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.050
 your widow knot make them like 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.120
 can we have them too 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.920
 unleashed now need to issue himself 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.920
 Cord draw and I will be using 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.490
 beads initially need to tie a knot 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:50.100
 after the knot will go bead 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:52.200
 after the bead goes knot again and again 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.650
 geese don't put this keecker alternate until 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.220
 As long as I do not seem that the length 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.970
 cord 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:02.970
 already enough and I chose such a length 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.770
 so that I can freely wear this pendant 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.530
 over the head so that there are no 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.570
 locks and 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:14.730
 zavyazochek to just put quietly 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:18.740
 over the head and went the location and 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.980
 choose the order of the beads yourself 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.680
 nodules 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:27.050
 between the beads and tie in order 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.050
 so that they do not mix for each other 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.330
 after the eternal 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.660
 decorated you can tie the second 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:45.130
 nodule to the second ringlet 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.130
 I also connect two other knots 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:06.400
 and that the knots are not untied I 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.400
 thoroughly coat with super glue 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.420
 rap them im a bit and right 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.290
 finger spreading glue completely 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.290
 all knots 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.090
 glue and distribute all alone for 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.850
 so that she naturally does not 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:25.670
 unleashed and after glue 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:28.720
 good dry out unnecessary parts 

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.720
 scissor cut 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.220
 beautiful bird is ready but I will 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.170
