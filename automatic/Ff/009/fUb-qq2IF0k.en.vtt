00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
to briefly take a look at my transition

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.910 
to briefly take a look at my transition
suggestions<00:03:10.540> if<00:03:11.540> I<00:03:11.690> look<00:03:11.870> at<00:03:11.990> this<00:03:12.170> frame<00:03:12.470> here

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
suggestions if I look at this frame here

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.490 
suggestions if I look at this frame here
I<00:03:13.070> can<00:03:13.610> see<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:14.120> depending<00:03:14.900> on<00:03:14.989> what<00:03:15.140> type<00:03:15.320> of

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
I can see that depending on what type of

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.960 
I can see that depending on what type of
hook<00:03:15.650> I'm<00:03:15.830> using<00:03:16.040> I<00:03:16.400> have<00:03:16.760> different

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
hook I'm using I have different

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.420 
hook I'm using I have different
potential<00:03:17.510> frames<00:03:17.780> and<00:03:18.769> this<00:03:18.890> isn't<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.250> only

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
potential frames and this isn't the only

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.009 
potential frames and this isn't the only
way<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.640> go<00:03:19.820> but<00:03:20.060> it's<00:03:20.180> one<00:03:20.360> way<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:20.540> I'm<00:03:20.840> going

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
way to go but it's one way so I'm going

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.509 
way to go but it's one way so I'm going
to<00:03:21.080> use<00:03:21.260> one<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.500> these<00:03:21.709> here<00:03:22.190> with<00:03:22.400> the

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
to use one of these here with the

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.240 
to use one of these here with the
antidote<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:24.970> antidote<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.590> I'm<00:03:27.590> going<00:03:28.040> to

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
antidote the antidote and I'm going to

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:35.729 
antidote the antidote and I'm going to
add<00:03:28.519> in<00:03:28.970> here<00:03:30.250> although<00:03:31.250> this<00:03:31.880> is<00:03:32.320> one<00:03:33.320> example

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
add in here although this is one example

add in here although this is one example
my<00:03:36.739> story<00:03:37.310> is<00:03:37.760> not<00:03:39.010> necessarily<00:03:40.570> rule<00:03:43.150> how<00:03:44.150> so

towards<00:04:09.380> research<00:04:10.510> in<00:04:11.510> cancer<00:04:13.090> prevention

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
towards research in cancer prevention

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:23.710 
towards research in cancer prevention
and<00:04:16.340> treatment<00:04:21.940> see<00:04:22.940> how<00:04:23.000> a<00:04:23.030> spelling<00:04:23.600> error

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
and treatment see how a spelling error

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:40.530 
and treatment see how a spelling error
cancer<00:04:24.530> oh<00:04:27.670> goodness

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.110 

so<00:04:41.540> now<00:04:41.690> I<00:04:41.720> need<00:04:42.050> a<00:04:42.650> short<00:04:43.130> transition<00:04:43.700> to<00:04:43.970> get

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
so now I need a short transition to get

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.990 
so now I need a short transition to get
me<00:04:44.300> into<00:04:44.750> my<00:04:44.930> thesis<00:04:45.290> can't<00:04:46.250> just<00:04:46.490> tack<00:04:46.760> it<00:04:46.790> on

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
me into my thesis can't just tack it on

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.940 
me into my thesis can't just tack it on
there<00:04:47.330> so<00:04:47.810> I'm<00:04:47.960> going<00:04:48.170> to<00:04:48.260> use<00:04:48.500> consequently

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.740 

pull<00:04:54.950> that<00:04:55.160> up<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:56.290> call<00:04:57.290> that<00:04:57.500> good
