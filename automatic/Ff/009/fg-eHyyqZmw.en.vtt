00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.210 
it just didn't give us the weapons would
have<00:03:35.870> been<00:03:35.959> cool<00:03:36.229> I<00:03:36.530> think<00:03:36.799> this<00:03:36.859> figure<00:03:37.099> would

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
have been cool I think this figure would

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.110 
have been cool I think this figure would
have<00:03:37.310> been<00:03:37.400> cool<00:03:37.549> if<00:03:37.579> you<00:03:37.669> had<00:03:37.790> like<00:03:37.879> a<00:03:37.940> machine

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
gun also or some kind of a handgun but I

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.599 
gun also or some kind of a handgun but I
think<00:03:41.389> he<00:03:41.510> really<00:03:41.840> could<00:03:42.169> would<00:03:43.099> be<00:03:43.280> cool<00:03:43.519> if

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609
