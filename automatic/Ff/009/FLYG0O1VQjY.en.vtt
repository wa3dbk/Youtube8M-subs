 bread salty like cake baguette telera or

 Bobbin 12 kilograms approximately 20 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.010
 trays depends on the weight of the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.240
 portions 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:20.440
 ingredients flour 12 kilograms salt

 fresh yeast 400 grams 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.859
 water 7 liters 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.170
 It mixes the ingredients perfectly 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.530
 in the mixer for a while between 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.719
 13 to 17 minutes it must be very 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.149
 careful and observe the consistency of 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.089
 the mass since if the time is exceeded 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.729
 the dough will begin to warm up taking 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.829
 a chewy consistency a way to 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.080
 to prevent this from happening is to put 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.479
 operates the sound of the mass when the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.789
 process of kneading exceeds is heard 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.950
 a sound similar to that of the bombs 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.950
 chewing gum when they burst 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.930
 preparation of the raw dough we shape 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.479
 to the bread while we give shape to the pieces 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.350
 of bread is time to preheat the 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.600
 270 degree centigrade oven to 280 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.150
 degrees centigrade the temperature of 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.070
 pre-heated is variable depending on 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.320
 the ambient temperature of the place where 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.880
 we are located for example the 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.130
 ambient temperature of the state of 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.810
 Puebla is lower compared to the 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.700
 ambient temperature of the state of 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.830
 veracruz in warm places the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.140
 preheating temperature will be lower 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.860
 Recommendation is recommended that 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.270
 during preheating dow the heat 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.700
 placing the speaker or loaded with 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.729
 our raw bread on one side of 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.670
 our furnace typed to help us 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:08.100
 to ferment the bread this process can 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.100
 take a time of 15 to 35 minutes
