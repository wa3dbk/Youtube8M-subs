00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.670 

I'm<00:00:00.359> just<00:00:00.510> making<00:00:00.630> a<00:00:00.810> quick<00:00:00.989> video<00:00:01.140> response

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
I'm just making a quick video response

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.869 
I'm just making a quick video response
to<00:00:01.770> answer<00:00:02.040> some<00:00:02.190> of<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.310> questions<00:00:02.370> I've

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
to answer some of the questions I've

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.410 
to answer some of the questions I've
received<00:00:03.270> and<00:00:03.540> one<00:00:04.410> gentleman<00:00:05.150> wasn't<00:00:06.150> happy

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
received and one gentleman wasn't happy

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.240 
received and one gentleman wasn't happy
with<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.660> bearing<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.319> he<00:00:07.830> found<00:00:08.069> that<00:00:08.160> it

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
with the bearing and he found that it

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.980 
with the bearing and he found that it
wasn't<00:00:08.400> actually<00:00:08.639> an<00:00:08.940> improvement<00:00:09.210> on<00:00:09.719> the

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
wasn't actually an improvement on the

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.070 
wasn't actually an improvement on the
existing<00:00:10.230> one<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:10.830> he<00:00:10.889> had<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.870> he<00:00:12.870> felt

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
existing one that he had and he felt

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.209 
existing one that he had and he felt
that<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.320> was<00:00:13.440> due<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.920> being<00:00:13.950> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
that it was due to it being the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.820 
that it was due to it being the
different<00:00:14.759> generation<00:00:15.299> wheel<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.590> may

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
different generation wheel and I may

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.439 
different generation wheel and I may
have<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.430> may<00:00:17.670> have<00:00:17.699> overlooked<00:00:18.240> a

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
have and I may have overlooked a

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.140 
have and I may have overlooked a
difference<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.619> design<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.850> which<00:00:20.970> was

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
difference in the design but which was

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.970 
difference in the design but which was
accounting<00:00:21.449> for<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.600> not<00:00:21.720> working<00:00:21.930> as<00:00:22.230> well<00:00:22.410> so

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
accounting for it not working as well so

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:23.929 
accounting for it not working as well so
what<00:00:23.160> I've<00:00:23.250> got<00:00:23.279> here<00:00:23.400> I've<00:00:23.670> got<00:00:23.789> an<00:00:23.880> example

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
what I've got here I've got an example

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.029 
what I've got here I've got an example
of<00:00:24.420> both<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.779> first<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.140> second<00:00:25.560> generation

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
of both the first and second generation

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.870 
of both the first and second generation
wheels<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:27.119> difference<00:00:27.480> being<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.609> this<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
wheels the difference being the this the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.389 
wheels the difference being the this the
the<00:00:30.150> turning<00:00:31.080> block<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.859> stops<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.279> wheel

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
the turning block that stops the wheel

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.729 
the turning block that stops the wheel
over-rotating<00:00:33.390> being<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.200> opposite<00:00:34.500> side

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
over-rotating being on the opposite side

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.340 
over-rotating being on the opposite side
to<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.370> gear<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.600> metal<00:00:37.079> but<00:00:37.320> metal

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
to the gear and the metal but metal

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.970 
to the gear and the metal but metal
mounting<00:00:38.010> plate<00:00:38.160> slightly<00:00:38.579> different<00:00:38.969> so

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
mounting plate slightly different so

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.650 
mounting plate slightly different so
here<00:00:40.980> we<00:00:41.070> go<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> prototype<00:00:42.360> bearing

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
here we go this is the prototype bearing

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.080 
here we go this is the prototype bearing
the<00:00:42.750> one<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> first<00:00:43.290> made<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.030> just<00:00:45.030> to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
the one that I first made and just to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.400 
the one that I first made and just to
check<00:00:45.120> out<00:00:45.360> I've<00:00:45.450> got<00:00:45.570> my<00:00:45.600> iron<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.140> got<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
check out I've got my iron and got the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.130 
check out I've got my iron and got the
size<00:00:46.620> right<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:48.059> fairly<00:00:48.629> tight<00:00:48.870> fit<00:00:49.050> in

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
size right and it's fairly tight fit in

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.770 
size right and it's fairly tight fit in
there<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.730> actually<00:00:50.879> see<00:00:51.210> daylight

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
there and you can actually see daylight

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.750 
there and you can actually see daylight
that<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.410> not<00:00:52.590> day<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.800> was<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> gap

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
that like not day I was there is a gap

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.850 
that like not day I was there is a gap
down<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.300> edge<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.960> that's<00:00:55.410> due<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.620> this

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
down the edge and that's due to this

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.580 
down the edge and that's due to this
soon<00:00:56.070> Danny<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.460> slight<00:00:56.699> taper<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.469> by

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
soon Danny a slight taper so just by

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.930 
soon Danny a slight taper so just by
looking<00:00:58.949> at<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.160> might<00:00:59.340> think<00:00:59.609> that's<00:00:59.699> not

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
looking at it you might think that's not

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.520 
looking at it you might think that's not
actually<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.449> great<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.930> think<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.350> see

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
actually that great you think I can see

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.619 
actually that great you think I can see
all<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> gaps<00:01:01.980> down<00:01:02.219> there<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.149> once<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.510> on

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
all the gaps down there but once it's on

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.340 
all the gaps down there but once it's on
fully<00:01:04.519> it's<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.640> tight<00:01:05.850> fit<00:01:05.880> there<00:01:06.200> but<00:01:07.200> also

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
fully it's a tight fit there but also

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.649 
fully it's a tight fit there but also
here<00:01:10.040> the<00:01:11.040> outer<00:01:11.189> diameter<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> very<00:01:12.390> tight

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
here the outer diameter is a very tight

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.570 
here the outer diameter is a very tight
fit<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.229> side<00:01:13.439> here<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.549> actually

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
fit on the side here and that actually

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.820 
fit on the side here and that actually
won't<00:01:15.119> rotate<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.659> there<00:01:15.840> that's<00:01:16.259> fine<00:01:16.500> that

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
won't rotate in there that's fine that

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.050 
won't rotate in there that's fine that
just<00:01:16.860> means<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> tight<00:01:18.030> fit

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
just means it's going to be a tight fit

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.310 
just means it's going to be a tight fit
and<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.500> rotating<00:01:20.100> faces<00:01:21.020> in<00:01:22.020> stock

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
and the and the rotating faces in stock

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.920 
and the and the rotating faces in stock
as<00:01:22.470> such<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.860> now<00:01:23.070> that's<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.180> very<00:01:24.390> tight<00:01:24.659> fit

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
as such and now that's a very tight fit

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.399 
as such and now that's a very tight fit
and<00:01:25.430> there's<00:01:26.430> no<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.939> can't<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.509> any<00:01:27.659> horizontal

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
and there's no I can't be any horizontal

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.109 
and there's no I can't be any horizontal
vertical<00:01:28.530> move<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.040> there<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.549> only<00:01:29.820> movement

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
vertical move on there the only movement

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.240 
vertical move on there the only movement
is<00:01:30.210> rotational<00:01:30.930> that's<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.009> first

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
is rotational that's the first

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.359 
is rotational that's the first
generation<00:01:32.820> wheel<00:01:33.950> again<00:01:34.950> I'll<00:01:35.070> leave<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.310> in

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
generation wheel again I'll leave it in

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.069 
generation wheel again I'll leave it in
the<00:01:35.460> same<00:01:35.640> plate<00:01:35.880> here<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> second

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the same plate here this is the second

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.620 
the same plate here this is the second
generation<00:01:37.170> one<00:01:37.790> different<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.000> different

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
generation one different and different

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.890 
generation one different and different
turning<00:01:40.170> block

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.550 

click<00:01:48.740> that<00:01:48.920> back<00:01:49.070> in<00:01:49.310> it's<00:01:50.030> fully<00:01:50.270> in<00:01:50.450> play

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.380 

that's<00:01:54.560> fine<00:01:54.830> it's<00:01:55.670> exactly<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.210> same

that's fine it's exactly the same

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.440 
that's fine it's exactly the same
there's<00:01:56.750> no<00:01:56.930> there's<00:01:57.620> no<00:01:57.710> difference<00:01:58.010> and<00:01:58.970> I

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
there's no there's no difference and I

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.630 
there's no there's no difference and I
can<00:02:00.380> demonstrate<00:02:00.680> with<00:02:01.190> any<00:02:01.340> of<00:02:01.490> these

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
can demonstrate with any of these

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.210 
can demonstrate with any of these
bearings<00:02:02.150> these<00:02:02.600> are<00:02:02.750> all<00:02:02.870> from<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.110> same

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
bearings these are all from the same

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.740 
bearings these are all from the same
these<00:02:04.220> all<00:02:04.430> came<00:02:04.640> off<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.910> same<00:02:05.120> strip<00:02:05.510> on<00:02:05.660> the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
these all came off the same strip on the

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.840 
these all came off the same strip on the
lathe<00:02:05.900> and<00:02:06.140> do<00:02:06.290> them<00:02:06.410> all<00:02:06.500> in<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.800> line<00:02:07.010> the

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
lathe and do them all in a line the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.490 
lathe and do them all in a line the
outer<00:02:08.000> diameter<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.720> inner<00:02:08.869> diameter<00:02:09.050> and

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
outer diameter the inner diameter and

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.560 
outer diameter the inner diameter and
then<00:02:09.590> just<00:02:09.740> slice<00:02:09.950> them<00:02:10.160> off<00:02:10.310> so<00:02:11.210> they're<00:02:11.420> all

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
then just slice them off so they're all

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:20.170 
then just slice them off so they're all
identical<00:02:13.600> fits<00:02:14.600> in<00:02:14.750> there<00:02:17.410> again<00:02:19.180> perfect

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
identical fits in there again perfect

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.440 
identical fits in there again perfect
fit<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.560> I'll<00:02:22.550> show<00:02:22.820> you<00:02:22.850> this<00:02:23.180> one

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.050 

no<00:02:26.450> meaning<00:02:26.720> at<00:02:26.780> all<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.530> I<00:02:27.740> think<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:28.010> key<00:02:28.190> up

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
no meaning at all and I think the key up

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.410 
no meaning at all and I think the key up
in<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.330> key<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:30.040> put<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.160> together<00:02:31.310> bounce<00:02:32.240> it

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
in the key is put it together bounce it

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.300 
in the key is put it together bounce it
back<00:02:32.570> together<00:02:32.750> don't<00:02:33.290> do<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.620> over<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:34.070> time

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
back together don't do it over the time

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.440 
back together don't do it over the time
you<00:02:34.580> don't<00:02:34.730> want<00:02:34.850> to<00:02:34.910> clump<00:02:35.120> if<00:02:35.240> you<00:02:35.300> don't

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
you don't want to clump if you don't

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.020 
you don't want to clump if you don't
squeeze<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.140> they<00:02:36.230> won't<00:02:36.470> rotate<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:37.910> get

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
squeeze it so they won't rotate just get

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.390 
squeeze it so they won't rotate just get
it<00:02:38.410> back<00:02:39.410> together<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.770> when<00:02:40.010> it's<00:02:40.160> fully

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
it back together and when it's fully

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.880 
it back together and when it's fully
assembled<00:02:41.000> all<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.840> pieces<00:02:42.200> they<00:02:42.440> interact

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
assembled all the pieces they interact

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.110 
assembled all the pieces they interact
and<00:02:43.010> interlock<00:02:43.400> with<00:02:43.610> each<00:02:43.670> other

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
and interlock with each other

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.600 
and interlock with each other
hold<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.540> rigid<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.100> really<00:02:46.100> reduce<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
hold it rigid and really reduce the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.870 
hold it rigid and really reduce the
movement<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.510> just<00:02:47.780> by<00:02:47.930> popping<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.410> on<00:02:48.880> like

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
movement so just by popping it on like

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.390 
movement so just by popping it on like
this<00:02:50.060> thing<00:02:50.360> going<00:02:50.600> are<00:02:50.780> those<00:02:51.050> that<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.220> need

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
this thing going are those that you need

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.949 
this thing going are those that you need
to<00:02:52.550> get<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:52.790> need<00:02:52.820> to<00:02:52.970> really<00:02:53.300> fully<00:02:53.450> assembly

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
to get you need to really fully assembly

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.380 
to get you need to really fully assembly
before<00:02:54.110> you<00:02:54.350> start<00:02:54.590> see<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.860> benefit<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:55.640> I

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
before you start see the benefit and I

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.300 
before you start see the benefit and I
suspect<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.410> gentleman<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.950> brought<00:02:58.160> the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
suspect the gentleman the brought the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.040 
suspect the gentleman the brought the
cord<00:02:58.550> off<00:02:58.670> me<00:02:58.820> I<00:02:58.850> think<00:02:59.209> that<00:02:59.660> we<00:02:59.810> all<00:02:59.930> must

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
cord off me I think that we all must

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.600 
cord off me I think that we all must
have<00:03:00.170> just<00:03:00.350> been<00:03:00.500> completely<00:03:00.920> napping<00:03:01.400> and

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
have just been completely napping and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.759 
have just been completely napping and
there<00:03:02.330> is<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.480> limit<00:03:02.900> really<00:03:03.050> as<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.350> what<00:03:03.530> can

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
there is a limit really as to what can

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:04.210 
there is a limit really as to what can
be<00:03:03.800> doing

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
be doing

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.340 
be doing
I've<00:03:04.730> designed<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.330> work<00:03:05.600> with<00:03:05.870> my<00:03:06.080> wheel

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
I've designed you to work with my wheel

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.500 
I've designed you to work with my wheel
which<00:03:06.620> is<00:03:06.769> we<00:03:07.130> both<00:03:07.310> of<00:03:07.550> my<00:03:07.760> wiggle<00:03:08.090> tail<00:03:08.269> you

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
which is we both of my wiggle tail you

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.290 
which is we both of my wiggle tail you
can<00:03:08.570> see<00:03:09.519> they're<00:03:10.519> both<00:03:10.700> receive<00:03:11.030> quite<00:03:11.239> a

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
can see they're both receive quite a

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.030 
can see they're both receive quite a
good<00:03:11.510> deal<00:03:11.690> of<00:03:11.720> wear<00:03:12.019> as<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:12.320> said<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:12.769> wanted

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
good deal of wear as you said you wanted

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.370 
good deal of wear as you said you wanted
to<00:03:13.100> snapped<00:03:13.459> off<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:15.670> so<00:03:16.670> I<00:03:17.050> just<00:03:18.050> think<00:03:18.200> it

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
to snapped off and so I just think it

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.380 
to snapped off and so I just think it
wasn't<00:03:18.620> what<00:03:18.739> I<00:03:18.910> suspect<00:03:19.910> it<00:03:20.030> was<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.150> one-off

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
wasn't what I suspect it was a one-off

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.420 
wasn't what I suspect it was a one-off
case<00:03:20.690> for<00:03:20.930> every<00:03:21.110> and<00:03:21.230> I'd<00:03:21.739> ask<00:03:21.950> what<00:03:22.130> you<00:03:22.250> use

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
case for every and I'd ask what you use

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.040 
case for every and I'd ask what you use
your<00:03:22.580> judgement<00:03:22.940> in<00:03:23.120> whether<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.660> think<00:03:23.810> the

your judgement in whether you think the

world can be safe or what you really
have<00:03:25.670> gave<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.150> good<00:03:26.330> back<00:03:28.209> think<00:03:29.209> of<00:03:29.269> your

decision whether you want to get a
