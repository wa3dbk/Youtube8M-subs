the<00:01:21.420> gym<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:22.310> think<00:01:23.310> one<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> biggest

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
the gym I think one of the biggest

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.940 
the gym I think one of the biggest
misconceptions<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.780> Phil<00:01:25.050> eath<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.860> he

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
misconceptions is Phil eath is of it he

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.820 
misconceptions is Phil eath is of it he
doesn't<00:01:26.100> train<00:01:26.490> hard<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.350> honest<00:01:28.710> with

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
doesn't train hard and to be honest with

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.090 
doesn't train hard and to be honest with
you<00:01:29.450> when<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.509> first<00:01:31.200> started<00:01:31.740> watching<00:01:31.830> him

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
you when I first started watching him

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.650 
you when I first started watching him
training<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.820> know<00:01:32.940> just<00:01:33.119> glance<00:01:33.360> I'm<00:01:33.540> not

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
training you know just glance I'm not

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.990 
training you know just glance I'm not
really<00:01:33.780> paying<00:01:33.990> attention<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.830> I<00:01:35.070> didn't

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
really paying attention to it I didn't

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.670 
really paying attention to it I didn't
think<00:01:36.030> he'd<00:01:36.210> trained<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.509> hard<00:01:36.750> too<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.440> you

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680

very<00:01:54.810> smart<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.680> mean<00:01:55.950> he<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.640> getting<00:01:56.909> his

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
very smart I mean he is getting his

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.760 
very smart I mean he is getting his
contract<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.690> that's<00:01:57.900> why<00:01:58.049> his<00:01:58.200> muscle<00:01:58.620> belly

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
contract and that's why his muscle belly

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.830 
contract and that's why his muscle belly
is<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.159> look<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.729> mean<00:01:59.880> other<00:02:00.360> than<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.750> know
