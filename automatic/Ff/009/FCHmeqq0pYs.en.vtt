00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.330 
think i posted i think 33 games already
on<00:00:09.330> overflow<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:09.900> would<00:00:10.110> be<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.349> fourth<00:00:10.679> so

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
on overflow this would be the fourth so

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.160 
on overflow this would be the fourth so
quite<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.790> few<00:00:12.059> already<00:00:12.360> on<00:00:12.509> this<00:00:12.630> map<00:00:12.840> i<00:00:12.990> think

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
quite a few already on this map i think

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.169 
quite a few already on this map i think
this<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.469> probably<00:00:13.740> one<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.160> my<00:00:14.250> probably<00:00:15.089> i'm

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
this is probably one of my probably i'm

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.220 
this is probably one of my probably i'm
never<00:00:15.360> gonna<00:00:15.540> say<00:00:15.660> it's<00:00:15.750> gonna<00:00:15.870> be<00:00:15.990> one<00:00:16.139> my

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
never gonna say it's gonna be one my

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.950 
never gonna say it's gonna be one my
most<00:00:16.410> favorite<00:00:16.770> maps<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.160> play<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.750> black<00:00:18.750> ops

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
most favorite maps to play and black ops

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.900 
most favorite maps to play and black ops
2<00:00:19.230> i<00:00:19.260> think<00:00:19.560> i've<00:00:19.830> already<00:00:19.980> kind<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.279> went<00:00:20.760> over

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
2 i think i've already kind of went over

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.070 
2 i think i've already kind of went over
this<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.090> little<00:00:21.180> bit<00:00:21.359> but<00:00:21.449> i<00:00:21.510> think<00:00:21.689> i'll<00:00:21.779> do<00:00:21.990> it

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
this a little bit but i think i'll do it

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.990 
this a little bit but i think i'll do it
again<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.470> my<00:00:22.619> top<00:00:22.980> three<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.250> think<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.730> far

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
again that my top three I think so far

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.980 
again that my top three I think so far
and<00:00:24.210> still<00:00:24.390> our<00:00:24.710> overflow<00:00:26.449> meltdown<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.720> raid

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
and still our overflow meltdown and raid

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.050 
and still our overflow meltdown and raid
so<00:00:28.500> yeah<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.220> probably<00:00:29.640> can<00:00:29.730> see<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> lot<00:00:30.029> of

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
so yeah the probably can see a lot of

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.759 
so yeah the probably can see a lot of
the<00:00:30.179> game<00:00:30.330> plays<00:00:30.539> from<00:00:30.779> me<00:00:30.960> I'm<00:00:31.170> those<00:00:31.500> maps

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.119 
been out not even a week yet so yeah but
anyways<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.230> game<00:00:37.469> plays<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> game<00:00:37.920> plays

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
anyways this game plays a game plays

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.549 
anyways this game plays a game plays
pretty<00:00:38.610> good<00:00:38.940> i'd<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.360> say<00:00:39.600> it's<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.379> really

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
pretty good i'd have say it's a really

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.920 
pretty good i'd have say it's a really
short<00:00:40.829> gameplay<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.850> game<00:00:42.120> i<00:00:42.480> think<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
short gameplay the game i think the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.450 
short gameplay the game i think the
final<00:00:43.110> score<00:00:43.350> line<00:00:43.649> at<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> end<00:00:43.950> was<00:00:44.070> like<00:00:44.190> 200

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
final score line at the end was like 200

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.200 
final score line at the end was like 200
to<00:00:44.820> 35<00:00:45.980> so<00:00:46.980> very<00:00:47.219> short<00:00:47.579> i<00:00:47.700> think<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:47.969> just

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
to 35 so very short i think it's just

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.110 
to 35 so very short i think it's just
like<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.690> 88<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.559> one<00:00:49.920> game<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.850> i<00:00:50.879> posted

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
like that 88 in one game that i posted

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.189 
like that 88 in one game that i posted
on<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.649> same<00:00:52.890> map<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.730> instead<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
on this on the same map but instead the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.869 
on this on the same map but instead the
game<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> bit<00:00:55.829> better<00:00:56.010> because<00:00:56.280> i<00:00:56.520> went<00:00:56.789> a

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
game is a bit better because i went a

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.639 
game is a bit better because i went a
hundred<00:00:57.420> two<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.230> i<00:00:58.260> got<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> hundred

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
hundred two in one so i got a hundred

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.189 
hundred two in one so i got a hundred
two<00:00:58.890> kills<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.550> i<00:00:59.940> think<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.570> game<00:01:00.719> last<00:01:00.930> in

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
two kills and i think the game last in

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.529 
two kills and i think the game last in
total<00:01:01.500> think<00:01:01.649> seven<00:01:02.579> minutes<00:01:02.879> or<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.210> maybe<00:01:03.390> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
total think seven minutes or so maybe a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.810 
total think seven minutes or so maybe a
little<00:01:03.660> less<00:01:03.809> than<00:01:03.989> seven<00:01:04.290> minutes<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:05.189> pretty

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
little less than seven minutes so pretty

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.570 
little less than seven minutes so pretty
pretty<00:01:06.479> good<00:01:06.689> stuff<00:01:06.930> getting<00:01:07.200> 100<00:01:07.860> kills<00:01:08.159> in

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
pretty good stuff getting 100 kills in

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.760 
pretty good stuff getting 100 kills in
less<00:01:09.420> than<00:01:09.570> seven<00:01:09.900> minutes<00:01:10.049> away<00:01:10.290> at<00:01:10.530> about

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
less than seven minutes away at about

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.920 
less than seven minutes away at about
seven<00:01:11.100> minutes<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:12.299> yeah<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.479> was<00:01:12.600> pretty<00:01:12.720> happy

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
seven minutes so yeah I was pretty happy

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.359

thought<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:30.900> game<00:01:31.140> player<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.409> actually

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
thought this game player is actually

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.109 
thought this game player is actually
pretty<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.250> thought<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.490> was<00:01:32.549> kind<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.820> almost

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
pretty I thought it was kind of almost

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.640 
pretty I thought it was kind of almost
better<00:01:33.509> than<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.869> hundred<00:01:34.170> thirty<00:01:34.350> three<00:01:34.590> in

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
better than that hundred thirty three in

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.020 
better than that hundred thirty three in
one<00:01:34.799> game<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.280> i<00:01:35.310> posted<00:01:35.490> maybe<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.909> guys

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
one game that i posted maybe you guys

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.990 
one game that i posted maybe you guys
won't<00:01:36.810> think<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.320> if<00:01:37.680> you've<00:01:38.520> watched<00:01:38.759> that

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
won't think it is if you've watched that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.149 
won't think it is if you've watched that
or<00:01:39.150> not<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.259> go<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.439> book<00:01:40.920> find

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
or not but you can just go and book find

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.039 
or not but you can just go and book find
that<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.430> my<00:01:41.549> channel<00:01:41.880> he'll<00:01:42.450> definitely<00:01:42.630> see

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
that in my channel he'll definitely see

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.480 
that in my channel he'll definitely see
it<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.470> no<00:01:43.590> time<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.280> kind<00:01:44.399> of

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
it and you can no time it's kind of

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.399 
it and you can no time it's kind of
referencing<00:01:45.090> here<00:01:45.299> but<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> thought<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.320> was

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
referencing here but the thought it was

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.630 
referencing here but the thought it was
moving<00:01:46.710> around<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.890> lot<00:01:47.009> more<00:01:47.159> thing<00:01:47.340> i<00:01:47.430> think<00:01:47.549> i

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
moving around a lot more thing i think i

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.429 
moving around a lot more thing i think i
have<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.270> i<00:01:48.299> had<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.810> gotten<00:01:48.960> more<00:01:49.170> gun

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
have to i had to have gotten more gun

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.260 
have to i had to have gotten more gun
kills<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:50.070> imagine<00:01:50.820> cuz<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:50.970> thought<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.149> was

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
kills I imagine cuz I thought I was

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.969 
kills I imagine cuz I thought I was
playing<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.509> little<00:01:51.630> bit<00:01:51.810> more<00:01:52.380> passive<00:01:52.860> in

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
playing a little bit more passive in

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.289 
playing a little bit more passive in
that<00:01:53.130> game<00:01:53.369> play<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.880> one<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.090> thought<00:01:54.270> I

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
that game play but this one I thought I

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.469 
that game play but this one I thought I
did<00:01:55.079> pretty<00:01:55.140> good<00:01:55.500> because<00:01:56.219> as<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.850> sided<00:01:57.329> get

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
did pretty good because as you sided get

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.380 
did pretty good because as you sided get
a<00:01:57.570> triple<00:01:58.200> kill<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:59.070> few<00:01:59.430> moments<00:01:59.549> ago<00:01:59.850> so

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
a triple kill just a few moments ago so

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.560 
a triple kill just a few moments ago so
you<00:02:01.049> have<00:02:01.170> pretty<00:02:01.380> good<00:02:01.530> stuff<00:02:01.759> but<00:02:02.759> yeah

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
you have pretty good stuff but yeah

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.990 
you have pretty good stuff but yeah

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
right now so I can so people don't have

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.800 
right now so I can so people don't have
to<00:02:23.580> ask<00:02:23.760> those<00:02:23.910> type<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.150> questions<00:02:24.360> in<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
to ask those type of questions in the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.260 
to ask those type of questions in the
comments<00:02:25.290> but<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.370> gun<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.640> i<00:02:26.700> was<00:02:26.820> using<00:02:26.970> is

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
comments but the gun that i was using is

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.930 
comments but the gun that i was using is
the<00:02:27.450> PDW<00:02:28.230> i<00:02:28.440> think<00:02:29.280> it's<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.490> second

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
the PDW i think it's the second

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.230 
the PDW i think it's the second
submachine<00:02:30.840> gun<00:02:31.020> that<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.290> can<00:02:31.800> unlock<00:02:32.240> and

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
submachine gun that you can unlock and

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.580 
submachine gun that you can unlock and
this<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.690> probably<00:02:33.870> my<00:02:34.050> new<00:02:34.170> favorite

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
this is probably my new favorite

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.460 
this is probably my new favorite
honestly<00:02:35.010> it's<00:02:35.250> it's<00:02:35.730> amazing<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.780> has<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.960> 50

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
honestly it's it's amazing it has a 50

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.040 
honestly it's it's amazing it has a 50
meg<00:02:37.650> clip<00:02:38.070> which<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.940> by<00:02:39.360> far<00:02:39.540> i<00:02:39.600> think<00:02:39.810> the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
meg clip which is by far i think the

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.930 
meg clip which is by far i think the
most<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.740> submachine<00:02:41.220> gun<00:02:41.400> or<00:02:41.550> if<00:02:41.610> not<00:02:41.760> it's

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
most of a submachine gun or if not it's

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.080 
most of a submachine gun or if not it's
probably<00:02:42.480> like<00:02:42.720> close<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.680> being<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.890> most

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
probably like close to being the most

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.500 
probably like close to being the most
because<00:02:45.090> mp7<00:02:45.600> has<00:02:45.870> 40<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:47.090> MSMC<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.120> think<00:02:48.390> as

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
because mp7 has 40 and MSMC I think as

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.920 
because mp7 has 40 and MSMC I think as
30<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:49.290> then<00:02:49.800> scorpion<00:02:50.460> evo<00:02:50.700> has<00:02:50.910> 32<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.870> I

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
30 and then scorpion evo has 32 and I

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.300 
30 and then scorpion evo has 32 and I
think<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.230> might<00:02:52.380> be<00:02:52.410> missing<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.860> chai<00:02:53.040> calm

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
think I might be missing the chai calm

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.440 
think I might be missing the chai calm
cuz<00:02:53.520> i<00:02:53.550> don't<00:02:53.700> think<00:02:53.820> i've<00:02:53.910> used<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.270> too

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
cuz i don't think i've used that too

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.290 
cuz i don't think i've used that too
much<00:02:54.630> but<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.590> one<00:02:55.770> has<00:02:55.860> 50<00:02:56.280> which<00:02:56.490> is<00:02:56.700> pretty

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
much but this one has 50 which is pretty

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.550 
much but this one has 50 which is pretty
amazing<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.710> think<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.820> think<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.660> m27<00:03:01.230> like

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
amazing I think I think the m27 like

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.740 
amazing I think I think the m27 like
assault<00:03:01.830> rifle<00:03:02.250> only<00:03:02.490> as<00:03:02.610> 31<00:03:03.150> then<00:03:03.450> we<00:03:03.540> put

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
assault rifle only as 31 then we put

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
smart and not try to I guess get caught

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.310

in<00:05:00.730> like<00:05:00.910> really<00:05:01.150> bad<00:05:01.300> situations<00:05:01.870> to<00:05:01.990> try<00:05:02.200> and

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
in like really bad situations to try and

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.370 
in like really bad situations to try and
I<00:05:02.440> guess<00:05:02.680> make<00:05:02.950> my<00:05:03.100> way<00:05:03.250> out<00:05:03.280> of<00:05:03.460> them<00:05:04.080> but<00:05:05.080> yeah

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
I guess make my way out of them but yeah

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.950 
I guess make my way out of them but yeah
so<00:05:05.760> starting<00:05:06.760> off<00:05:06.850> the<00:05:07.030> second<00:05:07.540> round<00:05:07.660> with

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
so starting off the second round with

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.540 
so starting off the second round with
all<00:05:08.140> my<00:05:08.290> killstreaks<00:05:08.560> up<00:05:08.950> that's<00:05:09.160> always<00:05:09.520> a

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
all my killstreaks up that's always a

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.510 
all my killstreaks up that's always a
good<00:05:09.730> thing<00:05:09.790> to<00:05:09.940> do<00:05:10.150> in<00:05:10.420> my<00:05:10.450> opinion<00:05:10.810> because

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
good thing to do in my opinion because

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.280 
good thing to do in my opinion because
since<00:05:12.520> since<00:05:12.850> they<00:05:13.000> implemented<00:05:13.720> this<00:05:14.050> thing

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
since since they implemented this thing

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.350 
since since they implemented this thing
where<00:05:14.560> you<00:05:15.100> switch<00:05:15.340> sides<00:05:15.610> halfway<00:05:16.060> through

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
where you switch sides halfway through

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
where you switch sides halfway through
each<00:05:17.080> domination<00:05:17.770> game<00:05:18.000> I<00:05:19.000> think<00:05:19.480> having<00:05:19.900> kill

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
each domination game I think having kill

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.230 
each domination game I think having kill
streaks<00:05:20.680> like<00:05:20.800> ready<00:05:21.220> to<00:05:21.370> go<00:05:21.490> up<00:05:21.670> actually

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
streaks like ready to go up actually

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.060 
streaks like ready to go up actually
really<00:05:22.540> helps<00:05:22.810> you<00:05:23.020> because<00:05:23.680> it<00:05:23.800> helps<00:05:24.010> you

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
really helps you because it helps you

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.200 
really helps you because it helps you
get<00:05:24.190> started<00:05:24.250> in<00:05:24.730> the<00:05:24.850> realm<00:05:25.060> because

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
get started in the realm because

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.270 
get started in the realm because
building<00:05:25.780> momentum<00:05:25.900> is<00:05:26.290> always<00:05:26.620> always<00:05:26.950> key

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
building momentum is always always key

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.380 
building momentum is always always key
whenever<00:05:27.520> you're<00:05:27.730> playing<00:05:27.970> a<00:05:28.060> game<00:05:28.240> because

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
whenever you're playing a game because

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.080 
whenever you're playing a game because
once<00:05:28.630> your<00:05:28.840> cuz<00:05:29.560> that<00:05:29.830> kind<00:05:30.250> of<00:05:30.280> that<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.880> half

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
once your cuz that kind of that the half

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.760 
once your cuz that kind of that the half
way<00:05:31.270> switch<00:05:31.540> kind<00:05:32.050> of<00:05:32.110> really<00:05:32.260> throws<00:05:32.560> off

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
way switch kind of really throws off

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.100 
way switch kind of really throws off
like<00:05:33.070> most<00:05:33.250> people's<00:05:33.610> I<00:05:33.880> guess<00:05:34.420> momentum<00:05:34.960> and

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
like most people's I guess momentum and

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.720 
like most people's I guess momentum and
it<00:05:35.200> does<00:05:35.410> to<00:05:35.620> me<00:05:35.650> too<00:05:35.770> it<00:05:36.160> kind<00:05:36.340> of<00:05:36.400> makes<00:05:36.550> me

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
it does to me too it kind of makes me

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.580 
it does to me too it kind of makes me
have<00:05:36.940> to<00:05:36.970> like<00:05:37.210> we<00:05:37.870> start<00:05:38.140> all<00:05:38.260> over<00:05:38.290> again

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590

cold<00:05:39.160> and<00:05:39.430> then<00:05:39.610> try<00:05:39.850> build<00:05:40.150> like<00:05:40.390> pretty<00:05:41.080> much

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
cold and then try build like pretty much

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.290 
cold and then try build like pretty much
try<00:05:41.440> to<00:05:41.500> I<00:05:41.620> guess<00:05:41.950> find<00:05:42.280> find<00:05:42.610> the<00:05:42.730> routes<00:05:42.910> and

and also because if you only have like a

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.120 
and also because if you only have like a
minute<00:06:07.060> left<00:06:07.480> and<00:06:07.870> you<00:06:08.110> have<00:06:08.230> a<00:06:08.260> blackbird<00:06:08.860> or

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
minute left and you have a blackbird or

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.090 
minute left and you have a blackbird or
dogs<00:06:10.120> or<00:06:10.390> swarm<00:06:10.870> about<00:06:11.140> to<00:06:11.230> go<00:06:11.350> up<00:06:11.440> that<00:06:11.560> just

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
dogs or swarm about to go up that just

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.380 
dogs or swarm about to go up that just
save<00:06:12.280> those<00:06:12.460> because<00:06:12.820> I<00:06:12.850> don't<00:06:13.060> think<00:06:13.210> they're

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
save those because I don't think they're

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.610 
save those because I don't think they're
going<00:06:13.480> to<00:06:13.540> get<00:06:13.690> as<00:06:13.840> many<00:06:13.990> kills<00:06:14.320> if<00:06:14.470> they

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
going to get as many kills if they

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.400 
going to get as many kills if they
probably<00:06:14.890> would<00:06:15.160> if<00:06:15.340> you<00:06:16.120> if<00:06:16.810> you<00:06:16.960> waited<00:06:17.140> to

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
probably would if you if you waited to

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.720 
probably would if you if you waited to
call<00:06:17.590> them<00:06:17.740> in<00:06:17.830> in<00:06:17.920> the<00:06:18.010> second<00:06:18.370> round<00:06:18.400> and

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
call them in in the second round and

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.840 
call them in in the second round and
then<00:06:19.360> also<00:06:19.620> the<00:06:20.620> another<00:06:21.070> good<00:06:21.280> point<00:06:21.460> to<00:06:21.730> why

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
then also the another good point to why

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.180 
then also the another good point to why
not<00:06:22.120> to<00:06:22.450> use<00:06:22.600> all<00:06:23.260> your<00:06:23.470> kill<00:06:23.740> streaks<00:06:23.980> like

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
not to use all your kill streaks like

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.600 
not to use all your kill streaks like
right<00:06:24.580> at<00:06:24.700> once<00:06:25.500> or<00:06:26.500> raise<00:06:26.710> the<00:06:26.890> game<00:06:27.040> the

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
right at once or raise the game the

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.130 
right at once or raise the game the
round<00:06:27.790> is<00:06:27.940> about<00:06:28.030> to<00:06:28.240> end<00:06:28.270> is<00:06:28.600> to<00:06:28.930> prevent

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
round is about to end is to prevent

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.810 
round is about to end is to prevent
people<00:06:29.440> from<00:06:29.470> quitting<00:06:29.860> on<00:06:30.040> you<00:06:30.190> because<00:06:30.760> I

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
people from quitting on you because I

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.940 
people from quitting on you because I
think<00:06:30.880> if<00:06:31.180> you<00:06:31.390> if<00:06:31.750> you<00:06:32.140> were<00:06:32.230> to<00:06:32.320> use<00:06:32.380> like<00:06:32.800> all

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950 
think if you if you were to use like all

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.350 
think if you if you were to use like all
like<00:06:33.220> your<00:06:33.400> killstreaks<00:06:33.820> right<00:06:34.000> at<00:06:34.090> the<00:06:34.240> end

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
like your killstreaks right at the end

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.300 
like your killstreaks right at the end
of<00:06:34.450> the<00:06:34.570> first<00:06:34.870> round<00:06:35.020> I<00:06:35.290> think<00:06:35.500> most<00:06:36.070> people

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
of the first round I think most people

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.070 
of the first round I think most people
most<00:06:36.850> people<00:06:37.000> would<00:06:37.300> probably<00:06:37.330> quit<00:06:37.960> after

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
most people would probably quit after

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.719 
most people would probably quit after
that<00:06:38.350> if<00:06:38.530> you<00:06:38.680> called<00:06:38.890> in<00:06:39.010> like<00:06:39.130> two<00:06:39.340> sets<00:06:39.610> of

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
that if you called in like two sets of

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:41.080 
that if you called in like two sets of
dogs<00:06:39.970> or<00:06:40.180> two<00:06:40.300> sets<00:06:40.510> of<00:06:40.600> swarm

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
dogs or two sets of swarm

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.330 
dogs or two sets of swarm
I<00:06:41.210> think<00:06:41.810> they'll<00:06:42.080> probably<00:06:42.320> feel<00:06:42.710> like<00:06:42.889> okay

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
I think they'll probably feel like okay

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.250 
I think they'll probably feel like okay
this<00:06:43.730> is<00:06:43.790> this<00:06:44.210> is<00:06:44.360> getting<00:06:44.630> ridiculous<00:06:44.720> right

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.260 
this is this is getting ridiculous right

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.290 
this is this is getting ridiculous right
now<00:06:45.320> I'm<00:06:46.190> just<00:06:46.280> kind<00:06:46.580> of<00:06:46.610> getting<00:06:46.790> embarrassed

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
now I'm just kind of getting embarrassed

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.719 
now I'm just kind of getting embarrassed
so<00:06:47.419> I'm<00:06:47.510> just<00:06:47.600> gonna<00:06:47.690> leave<00:06:48.260> this<00:06:48.440> game<00:06:48.680> but<00:06:49.520> if

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:49.729 
so I'm just gonna leave this game but if

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:51.189 
so I'm just gonna leave this game but if
you<00:06:49.820> if<00:06:50.030> you<00:06:50.120> wait<00:06:50.300> for<00:06:50.510> the<00:06:50.540> second<00:06:50.960> round<00:06:51.020> I

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 
you if you wait for the second round I

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.900 
you if you wait for the second round I
think<00:06:51.410> you'll<00:06:51.830> only<00:06:52.160> have<00:06:52.370> called<00:06:52.639> in<00:06:52.760> like

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910 
think you'll only have called in like

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.689 
think you'll only have called in like
maybe<00:06:53.060> one<00:06:53.389> dogs<00:06:53.990> and<00:06:54.290> once<00:06:54.440> warm<00:06:54.770> so<00:06:55.340> maybe

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:55.699 
maybe one dogs and once warm so maybe

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:57.070 
maybe one dogs and once warm so maybe
they<00:06:55.880> won't<00:06:55.970> be<00:06:56.150> expecting<00:06:56.180> you<00:06:56.840> to<00:06:56.930> call

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
they won't be expecting you to call

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.409 
they won't be expecting you to call
another<00:06:57.380> one<00:06:57.620> in<00:06:57.740> the<00:06:57.830> second<00:06:58.160> round<00:06:58.280> but<00:06:58.970> yeah

00:06:59.409 --> 00:06:59.419 
another one in the second round but yeah

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.300 
another one in the second round but yeah
I<00:06:59.449> could<00:06:59.900> be<00:07:00.020> wrong<00:07:00.199> I<00:07:00.470> think<00:07:00.889> that's<00:07:01.040> also

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310 
I could be wrong I think that's also

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.360 
I could be wrong I think that's also
another<00:07:01.639> another<00:07:02.270> good<00:07:02.510> reason<00:07:02.660> why<00:07:03.199> not<00:07:03.530> to

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370 
another another good reason why not to

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.100 
another another good reason why not to
use<00:07:04.490> like<00:07:04.669> everything<00:07:05.120> at<00:07:05.360> once<00:07:05.570> in<00:07:05.750> one<00:07:05.780> round

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 
use like everything at once in one round

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.960 
use like everything at once in one round
