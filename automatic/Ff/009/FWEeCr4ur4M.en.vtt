00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.370 
what I will do is it will take a few
seconds<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.240> then<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.750> looks<00:02:57.990> like<00:02:58.170> it's

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
seconds and then it looks like it's

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.050 
seconds and then it looks like it's
going<00:02:58.590> outside<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.280> trying<00:02:59.460> to<00:02:59.550> download<00:02:59.760> it

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
going outside and trying to download it

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.820 
going outside and trying to download it
but<00:03:00.210> since<00:03:00.480> we're<00:03:00.780> right<00:03:00.960> now<00:03:01.140> just<00:03:01.380> direct<00:03:01.680> it

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
but since we're right now just direct it

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.410 
but since we're right now just direct it
to<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.340> will<00:03:02.460> detect<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.030> then<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.330> will

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
to it it will detect and then it will

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.450 
to it it will detect and then it will
start<00:03:03.780> unpacking<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.590> for<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.370> will

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
start unpacking it for you and it will

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.180 
start unpacking it for you and it will
install<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.000> proper<00:03:06.240> credentials<00:03:06.930> for<00:03:07.680> the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
install the proper credentials for the
