00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
into the Chester bound lane and was

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.860 
into the Chester bound lane and was
astride<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:14.130> central<00:05:14.580> white<00:05:14.760> lines<00:05:15.060> at<00:05:15.780> the

astride the central white lines at the
point<00:05:16.080> of<00:05:16.229> impact<00:05:16.349> so<00:05:16.889> half<00:05:17.610> of<00:05:17.729> the<00:05:17.820> vehicle

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
point of impact so half of the vehicle

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.909 
point of impact so half of the vehicle
was<00:05:18.389> in<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:18.599> Chester<00:05:18.870> bound<00:05:19.050> lane<00:05:19.229> half<00:05:19.740> who

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
was in the Chester bound lane half who

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.100 
was in the Chester bound lane half who
was<00:05:20.130> still<00:05:20.340> in<00:05:20.370> its<00:05:20.580> correct<00:05:20.909> line<00:05:21.080> astride<00:05:22.080> a

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
was still in its correct line astride a

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.290 
was still in its correct line astride a
sense<00:05:22.440> of<00:05:22.560> white<00:05:22.680> lines<00:05:22.889> so<00:05:23.280> half<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.610> vehicle

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
sense of white lines so half the vehicle

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.589 
sense of white lines so half the vehicle
was<00:05:24.630> on<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.760> opposing<00:05:26.760> character<00:05:27.150> yes<00:05:27.389> that's

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
was on the opposing character yes that's

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:27.920 
was on the opposing character yes that's
correct

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
correct

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.149 
correct
and<00:05:28.669> if<00:05:29.669> therefore<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.530> other<00:05:31.530> vehicle<00:05:32.039> the

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159 
and if therefore the other vehicle the

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.189 
and if therefore the other vehicle the
fourth<00:05:32.400> transit<00:05:32.970> was<00:05:33.150> in<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.419> center<00:05:33.810> of<00:05:33.900> its

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
fourth transit was in the center of its

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.320 
fourth transit was in the center of its
lane<00:05:34.530> there<00:05:35.130> was<00:05:35.280> inevitably<00:05:35.789> going<00:05:36.030> to<00:05:36.120> be<00:05:36.300> a

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
lane there was inevitably going to be a

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.530 
lane there was inevitably going to be a
collision<00:05:36.690> yes<00:05:37.139> that's<00:05:37.380> correct
