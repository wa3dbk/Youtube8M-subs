00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.900
 and productive life before the same was very 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.560
 quiet since I worked in the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.480
 public sector I met a lot of people and 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.970
 That motivated me to start looking for the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.010
 possibility of creating a business within 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.440
 of that business because we started to see the 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.010
 possibilities of an investment and of 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.140
 They created a company that could give us 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.030
 the tranquility for tomorrow 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.030
 be able to be economically better 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.730
 I know is equal by means of a 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.309
 person who told me that I speak for 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.809
 ask and ask for reports on how to 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.300
 must acquire a franchise of this 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.060
 dude I saw it so excited that really 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.100
 I was interested 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.650
 for me the experience of 15 years of 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.360
 unequal was fundamental in terms of 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.760
 make the decision to work with them 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.070
 since this makes me think that 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.750
 is an improvised company one of the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.730
 most important things that the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.830
 Attention is the same was that they 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.850
 support to create your first portfolio of 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.260
 customers 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.330
 this is sending from a team of 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.450
 cambaceo that in a week achieves 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.080
 join 350 people I'm talking to you 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.490
 that now after a year I have 700 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.080
 then they in a week achieved what 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.030
 that I have achieved in a year 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.670
 my experience with the training that 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.150
 offers me is the same is the basis of my 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.030
 business since one by itself has 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.300
 an expectation of growth them 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.940
 as your advisors as supervisors you 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.610
 where to walk are saying that because 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.160
 for me it is very important because of 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.820
 some way I'm not walking to the 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.580
 drift 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.830
 I go where they are marking us 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.650
 software is very important for the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.200
 The entire store is managed 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.650
 fundamental tool to know 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.060
 our sales in our partners 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.979
 there we administer our database 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.930
 It is a very important tool 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.430
 because it gives you the ability to know what 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.110
 is what you have to sell when you 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.120
 You have to sell and with whom you have it 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.930
 what to sell 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.840
 the growth of the business venture 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.280
 in unequal has been at a very good pace since 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.790
 than from the first investment that 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.740
 We did not reinvest in 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.050
 fact we have created a portfolio of 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.950
 pretty solvent customers within a 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.650
 year we have worked without losses always 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.120
 with utilities and since two 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.010
 months or the beginning of this season 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:36.560
 our profits doubled or in 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.880
 some cases even triple then 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.920
 I want to want to think that that has done 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.560
 part of the work we have done in 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.900
 set between us as 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.880
 franchisees with the support that we 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.890
 is providing unequal and we have arrived 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.980
 to these good results that obviously 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.110
 are a watershed for growth of 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.030
 here in the future because because 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.130
 sales has not gone down but on the contrary 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.630
 my plans have been playing 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.630
 for the future they are acquiring another 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.240
 franchise that same solvent the 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.010
 acquisition of a third because I think 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.670
 that this business is very good business 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.890
 in him fully and yes and I'm sure 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.280
 that a store is not enough for me 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.030
 with uneven takes firm steps in your new 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.030
 life Proyect 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.590
