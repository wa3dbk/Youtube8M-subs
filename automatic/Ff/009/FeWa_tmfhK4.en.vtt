00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
think everyone is going to be important

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.970 
think everyone is going to be important
for<00:00:11.860> me<00:00:12.099> I<00:00:12.309> have<00:00:12.999> to<00:00:13.269> do<00:00:13.450> well<00:00:13.690> and<00:00:13.990> every<00:00:14.799> game

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.220 
for me I have to do well and every game
because<00:00:15.400> i<00:00:15.610> think<00:00:16.420> this<00:00:17.380> season<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:20.050> be<00:00:20.080> a

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
because i think this season can be a

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.410 
because i think this season can be a
very<00:00:20.860> good<00:00:20.980> season<00:00:21.280> for<00:00:21.400> me<00:00:21.700> very<00:00:21.940> important

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
very good season for me very important

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.050 
very good season for me very important
season<00:00:22.600> from

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.300 

of<00:00:25.660> course<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:27.580> have<00:00:27.930> difficult<00:00:28.930> teams<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
of course we have difficult teams to

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.240 
of course we have difficult teams to
compete<00:00:30.490> compete<00:00:31.210> with<00:00:31.419> us<00:00:31.599> but<00:00:32.230> we<00:00:32.950> try<00:00:33.190> to

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
compete compete with us but we try to

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.210 
compete compete with us but we try to
debate<00:00:33.760> them<00:00:34.120> and<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:35.800> course<00:00:36.640> to<00:00:37.510> win<00:00:37.840> delay

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
debate them and of course to win delay

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.670 
debate them and of course to win delay
usually<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:40.750> always<00:00:41.230> just<00:00:42.190> but<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:44.320> season

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
usually it's always just but this season

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.819 
usually it's always just but this season
I<00:00:44.769> think<00:00:45.010> probably<00:00:45.940> can<00:00:46.300> be<00:00:46.480> different<00:00:47.230> we

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
I think probably can be different we

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.260 
I think probably can be different we
will<00:00:47.980> see

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.690 

sometimes<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.510> got<00:00:51.770> some<00:00:52.770> players<00:00:53.280> injured

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
sometimes we got some players injured

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.760 
sometimes we got some players injured
and<00:00:53.940> then<00:00:54.540> we<00:00:54.810> can<00:00:56.090> change<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.270> players<00:00:57.540> and

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
and then we can change the players and

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.470 
and then we can change the players and
the<00:00:58.770> team<00:00:59.160> will<00:00:59.400> feel<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> same<00:01:00.090> feel

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
the team will feel the same feel

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.350 
the team will feel the same feel
confidence<00:01:00.960> because<00:01:01.790> we<00:01:02.790> have<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> lot<00:01:03.330> of

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
confidence because we have a lot of

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.600 
confidence because we have a lot of
quality<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:03.990> team<00:01:04.290> that's<00:01:04.980> important<00:01:05.489> for

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
quality and team that's important for

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.250 
quality and team that's important for
one<00:01:05.730> team

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.040 

I<00:01:08.410> don't<00:01:09.010> of<00:01:09.340> course<00:01:09.370> I<00:01:09.700> want<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:09.880> do<00:01:10.060> much<00:01:10.780> more

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
I don't of course I want to do much more

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.630 
I don't of course I want to do much more
and<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:13.180> won't<00:01:13.510> have<00:01:13.780> my<00:01:13.840> team<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.410> to<00:01:14.920> win<00:01:15.070> this

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.570 
and I won't have my team to to win this

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.970 
maybe ain't it again they have a good
team

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.030 

we<00:01:56.980> never<00:01:57.130> know<00:01:57.400> is<00:01:57.910> always<00:01:58.410> difficult<00:01:59.410> to

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
we never know is always difficult to

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
we never know is always difficult to
know<00:02:00.370> the<00:02:00.610> game

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060

know the game
I<00:02:03.649> don't<00:02:04.649> know<00:02:04.740> if<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.159> would<00:02:05.250> be<00:02:05.490> very<00:02:05.670> hard

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
I don't know if it would be very hard

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.350 
I don't know if it would be very hard
because<00:02:06.560> we<00:02:07.560> are<00:02:07.710> mighty<00:02:07.950> want<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.090> win<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.990 
because we are mighty want to win the
league<00:02:09.709> because<00:02:10.709> they<00:02:11.039> spend<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.400> lot<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.580> money

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
league because they spend a lot of money

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.199 
league because they spend a lot of money
on<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.660> team<00:02:12.959> but<00:02:13.680> Barcelona<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.430> very<00:02:14.970> good

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
on that team but Barcelona is very good

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.960 
on that team but Barcelona is very good
team<00:02:15.450> they<00:02:15.690> play<00:02:15.900> volleyball<00:02:16.860> football<00:02:17.040> we

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
team they play volleyball football we

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.839 
team they play volleyball football we
never<00:02:18.120> know<00:02:18.330> we<00:02:18.450> will<00:02:18.569> see

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.670 

last<00:02:21.849> year<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.420> was<00:02:22.629> confident<00:02:23.140> on<00:02:23.290> Bursa

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
last year I was confident on Bursa

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.759 
last year I was confident on Bursa
because<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.670> way<00:02:24.819> they<00:02:25.030> play<00:02:25.269> was<00:02:26.170> fantastic

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
because the way they play was fantastic

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.630 
because the way they play was fantastic
and<00:02:26.920> then<00:02:28.530> they<00:02:29.530> show<00:02:29.769> everything<00:02:29.920> on<00:02:30.430> page

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
and then they show everything on page

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.170 
and then they show everything on page
they<00:02:30.910> win<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.209> board<00:02:31.390> games<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.940> but<00:02:33.940> this

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
they win the board games and but this

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.800 
they win the board games and but this
year<00:02:34.480> maybe<00:02:34.930> can<00:02:35.319> be<00:02:35.470> different
