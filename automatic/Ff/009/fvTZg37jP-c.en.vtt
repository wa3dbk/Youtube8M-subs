00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
is what works for me so one of the first

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.050 
is what works for me so one of the first
steps<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.810> do<00:00:20.270> is<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.510> will<00:00:21.720> rub<00:00:21.990> bio<00:00:22.500> oil

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
steps that I do is I will rub bio oil

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.609 
steps that I do is I will rub bio oil
over<00:00:24.060> my<00:00:24.210> stretch<00:00:24.480> mark<00:00:24.750> area<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.230> my<00:00:25.350> stretch

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
over my stretch mark area on my stretch

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.740 
over my stretch mark area on my stretch
mark<00:00:26.070> area<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.640> mainly<00:00:27.060> around<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.420> upper

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
mark area is mainly around the upper

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.790 
mark area is mainly around the upper
thigh<00:00:27.930> area<00:00:29.269> just<00:00:30.269> because<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.170> weight<00:00:31.380> there

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
thigh area just because the weight there

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.180 
thigh area just because the weight there
kind<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.309> flop<00:00:33.030> 2/8<00:00:33.390> either<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.469> gain<00:00:35.040> weight

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
kind of flop 2/8 either I gain weight

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.650 
kind of flop 2/8 either I gain weight
lose<00:00:35.460> weight<00:00:35.520> gain<00:00:35.880> weight<00:00:36.000> lose<00:00:36.239> weight<00:00:36.270> so

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
lose weight gain weight lose weight so

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.280 
lose weight gain weight lose weight so
that<00:00:36.690> kind<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.079> causes<00:00:37.410> stretch<00:00:37.620> marks<00:00:38.239> and

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
that kind of causes stretch marks and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.209 
that kind of causes stretch marks and
yeah<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> use<00:00:40.829> bio<00:00:41.070> oil<00:00:41.190> first<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.739> then<00:00:43.739> I

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
quite a lot of products a little

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.800 
quite a lot of products a little
seriously<00:02:33.760> goes<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.000> long<00:02:34.240> way<00:02:34.480> with<00:02:34.660> this

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
seriously goes a long way with this

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.770 
seriously goes a long way with this
thing<00:02:35.080> because<00:02:35.590> if<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.950> take<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.460> lot<00:02:36.780> you're

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
thing because if you take a lot you're

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.710 
thing because if you take a lot you're
just<00:02:38.050> gonna<00:02:38.260> like<00:02:38.950> be<00:02:39.190> dripping<00:02:39.490> of<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.480> oil

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
just gonna like be dripping of the oil

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.380 
just gonna like be dripping of the oil
and<00:02:41.110> it's<00:02:41.680> not<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.610> best<00:02:42.820> feeling<00:02:43.270> in<00:02:43.360> the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
and it's not the best feeling in the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.070 
and it's not the best feeling in the
world<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:45.340> works<00:02:45.670> if<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.420> are<00:02:46.450> also

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
world and this works if you are also

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.970 
world and this works if you are also
preggers<00:02:48.070> because<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:50.380> helps<00:02:50.709> prevent

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
preggers because this helps prevent

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
preggers because this helps prevent
stretch<00:02:51.370> marks<00:02:51.400> if<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.030> apply<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.500> constantly

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
stretch marks if you apply it constantly

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.470 
stretch marks if you apply it constantly

found that that really works for stretch

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.100 
found that that really works for stretch
marks<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:00.880> really<00:03:01.120> like<00:03:01.270> it<00:03:01.420> because<00:03:01.540> it

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
marks and I really like it because it

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.800 
marks and I really like it because it
really<00:03:02.470> helped<00:03:03.070> fade<00:03:04.000> away<00:03:04.239> my<00:03:04.480> stretch<00:03:04.720> marks
