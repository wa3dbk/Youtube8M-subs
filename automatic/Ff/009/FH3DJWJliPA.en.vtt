it'll<00:01:45.090> well<00:01:45.750> adjust<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.229> brightness<00:01:46.409> it's

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
it'll well adjust the brightness it's

it'll well adjust the brightness it's
pretty<00:01:47.220> self-explanatory<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.270> you're<00:01:48.420> in

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
more hours of playtime I just don't

intend<00:01:52.200> Oh<00:01:52.259> added<00:01:52.590> more<00:01:52.770> battery<00:01:53.159> power<00:01:53.250> but

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
intend Oh added more battery power but

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.069 
intend Oh added more battery power but
at<00:01:54.030> least<00:01:54.149> you're<00:01:54.329> trying<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.600> do<00:01:54.720> something

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
at least you're trying to do something

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.139 
at least you're trying to do something
to<00:01:55.170> compensate<00:01:55.380> us<00:01:55.680> here<00:01:55.979> as<00:01:56.130> for<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.729> camera

to compensate us here as for this camera

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.789 
to compensate us here as for this camera
it's<00:01:57.390> also<00:01:57.659> about<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.140> same<00:01:58.290> quality<00:01:58.680> as

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
it's also about the same quality as

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.980 
it's also about the same quality as
before<00:01:59.159> save<00:01:59.460> for<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.700> bit<00:01:59.939> better<00:02:00.119> lighting<00:02:00.450> to

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
the 3d as this resolution is so low I'll

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.399 
the 3d as this resolution is so low I'll
let<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.210> slide<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:03.899> certainly<00:02:04.170> weird

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
let it slide but it's certainly weird

when you're at a range and if you're
looking<00:02:37.290> at<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.620> system<00:02:37.920> too<00:02:38.069> low<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.519> screws

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
looking at the system too low it screws

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.399 
looking at the system too low it screws
up<00:02:38.939> a<00:02:39.060> lot<00:02:39.269> but<00:02:39.629> that's<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.870> pretty<00:02:40.109> small

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
up a lot but that's a pretty small

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.009 
up a lot but that's a pretty small
compromise<00:02:40.950> for<00:02:41.189> an<00:02:41.310> awesome<00:02:41.549> feature<00:02:42.030> oh<00:02:42.450> and

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
compromise for an awesome feature oh and

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.690 
compromise for an awesome feature oh and
another<00:02:43.170> quick<00:02:43.560> thing<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.980> volume<00:02:44.310> slider<00:02:44.400> is

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
another quick thing the volume slider is

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.250 
another quick thing the volume slider is
just<00:02:44.909> like<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.120> 3d<00:02:45.420> slider<00:02:45.659> now<00:02:45.959> where<00:02:46.170> it's

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
just like the 3d slider now where it's

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.539 
just like the 3d slider now where it's
placed<00:02:46.470> on<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.650> other<00:02:46.829> side<00:02:47.099> of<00:02:47.189> the<00:02:47.250> top<00:02:47.400> of

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
placed on the other side of the top of

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.309 
placed on the other side of the top of
the<00:02:47.609> system<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.299> found<00:02:48.599> it<00:02:48.780> pretty<00:02:48.930> useful

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
the system I just found it pretty useful

I'm guessing it's because it has a
faster<00:06:27.870> write<00:06:28.080> speed<00:06:28.350> or<00:06:28.650> because<00:06:28.890> it<00:06:29.010> takes

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
faster write speed or because it takes

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.680 
faster write speed or because it takes
up<00:06:29.280> less<00:06:29.310> space<00:06:29.490> or<00:06:29.970> it's<00:06:30.090> cheaper<00:06:30.360> to<00:06:30.450> make

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
up less space or it's cheaper to make

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.750 
up less space or it's cheaper to make
but<00:06:31.080> it's<00:06:31.200> another<00:06:31.380> $15<00:06:32.040> I<00:06:32.160> had<00:06:32.340> to<00:06:32.460> shell<00:06:32.730> out

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
but it's another $15 I had to shell out

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.580 
but it's another $15 I had to shell out
and<00:06:33.120> a<00:06:33.180> complicated<00:06:33.720> process<00:06:33.870> I<00:06:34.169> had<00:06:34.290> to<00:06:34.410> go

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
and a complicated process I had to go

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.710 
and a complicated process I had to go
through<00:06:34.620> so<00:06:35.280> I<00:06:35.310> was<00:06:35.550> not<00:06:35.700> very<00:06:35.970> happy<00:06:36.180> about<00:06:36.360> it

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720
