black finish that most of you guys know

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.299 
black finish that most of you guys know
and<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:46.020> definitely<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.620> considerably

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and it definitely is considerably

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.400 
and it definitely is considerably
heavier<00:00:47.610> however<00:00:48.570> there<00:00:48.809> are<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> few<00:00:49.230> features

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
heavier however there are a few features

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.220 
heavier however there are a few features
of<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:50.010> ps3<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.239> more<00:00:51.510> compared<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
of this ps3 that I like more compared to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.400 
of this ps3 that I like more compared to
the<00:00:52.379> super<00:00:52.680> slim<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.750> you<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:54.899> see<00:00:55.050> we're<00:00:55.320> I'm

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the super slim as you can see we're I'm

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.350 
the super slim as you can see we're I'm
fiddling<00:00:55.829> around<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.370> has<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.730> automatic

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
fiddling around that has that automatic

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.029 
fiddling around that has that automatic
disc<00:00:57.629> tray<00:00:57.930> loader<00:00:58.170> which<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.649> definitely

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
disc tray loader which I definitely

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.069 
disc tray loader which I definitely
prefer<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.850> gives<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.149> more<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.600> premium

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
prefer it gives it more of a premium

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.529 
prefer it gives it more of a premium
feel<00:01:01.440> whereas<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> super<00:01:02.699> slim<00:01:02.969> has<00:01:03.270> that

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
feel whereas the super slim has that

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.050 
feel whereas the super slim has that
sliding<00:01:04.320> disc<00:01:04.710> tray<00:01:04.979> kinda<00:01:05.549> reminds<00:01:05.909> me<00:01:05.939> of

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
sliding disc tray kinda reminds me of

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.539 
sliding disc tray kinda reminds me of
the<00:01:06.180> old-school<00:01:06.450> Sony<00:01:06.900> Walkmans<00:01:07.500> or<00:01:08.040> some<00:01:08.340> old
