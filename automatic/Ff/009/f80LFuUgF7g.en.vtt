00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
all right and welcome back for another

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.630 
all right and welcome back for another
round<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:03.149> Maya<00:00:03.510> so<00:00:04.440> for<00:00:04.710> this<00:00:04.799> demonstration

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
round of Maya so for this demonstration

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.400 
round of Maya so for this demonstration
we're<00:00:05.940> going<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.089> go<00:00:06.210> ahead<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:06.960> play<00:00:07.230> around

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
we're going to go ahead and play around

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.009 
we're going to go ahead and play around
with<00:00:07.680> this<00:00:07.890> dynamics<00:00:08.900> shattering<00:00:09.900> effect

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
with this dynamics shattering effect

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.820 
with this dynamics shattering effect
that<00:00:10.469> comes<00:00:10.710> preset<00:00:11.309> with<00:00:11.550> Maya<00:00:12.769> it's<00:00:13.769> a

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
that comes preset with Maya it's a

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.560 
that comes preset with Maya it's a
really<00:00:14.190> interesting<00:00:14.670> effect<00:00:15.000> what<00:00:15.210> ends<00:00:15.480> up

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
really interesting effect what ends up

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.180 
really interesting effect what ends up
happening<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.199> can<00:00:16.470> take<00:00:16.710> any<00:00:16.949> object

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
happening is you can take any object

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.660 
happening is you can take any object
that<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.760> have<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.510> make<00:00:19.500> some<00:00:19.770> shattering

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
that you have and make some shattering

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.580 
that you have and make some shattering
effect<00:00:20.789> which<00:00:21.240> will<00:00:21.480> ultimately<00:00:22.020> cause<00:00:22.289> some

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
effect which will ultimately cause some

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.790 
effect which will ultimately cause some
debris<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.189> destruction<00:00:24.470> so<00:00:25.470> let<00:00:25.619> me<00:00:25.710> go

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
debris and destruction so let me go

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.380 
debris and destruction so let me go
ahead<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.160> give<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.580> demonstration<00:00:26.730> of

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
ahead and give you a demonstration of

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.580 
ahead and give you a demonstration of
what<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.830> feature<00:00:28.830> entails<00:00:30.230> so<00:00:31.230> there<00:00:31.470> you

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
what this feature entails so there you

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.010 
what this feature entails so there you
go<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.099> have<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.460> pretty<00:00:33.300> interesting

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
go so you have this pretty interesting

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.990 
go so you have this pretty interesting
of<00:00:34.340> destruction<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:36.200> an<00:00:37.200> object<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.800> mean<00:00:38.000> not

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
of destruction of an object I mean not

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.700 
of destruction of an object I mean not
really<00:00:39.300> sure<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.600> why<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.020> gives<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.410> yellow

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
really sure on why it gives you yellow

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.470 
really sure on why it gives you yellow
but<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.100> think<00:00:41.460> that's<00:00:41.640> probably<00:00:41.879> an<00:00:42.180> option

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
but I think that's probably an option

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.630 
but I think that's probably an option
you<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.690> turn<00:00:42.840> off<00:00:43.079> or<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.430> select

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
you can turn off or you can select

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.279 
you can turn off or you can select
something<00:00:44.969> else<00:00:45.329> from<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:45.989> that's<00:00:46.140> pretty

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
something else from it but that's pretty

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.250 
something else from it but that's pretty
much<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.739> shattering<00:00:47.460> effect<00:00:47.690> to<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.930> so

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
much the shattering effect to it so

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.560 
much the shattering effect to it so
whatever<00:00:49.829> project<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.610> want<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.420> if

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
whatever project that you want and if

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.209 
whatever project that you want and if
this<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.899> something<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> scene<00:00:52.829> or

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
this is something for a scene or

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.369 
this is something for a scene or
something<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.879> desperately<00:00:54.570> need<00:00:54.930> in

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
something that you desperately need in

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.410 
something that you desperately need in
order<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.710> create<00:00:55.949> some<00:00:56.280> kind<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.030> destructive

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
order to create some kind of destructive

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.599 
order to create some kind of destructive
feel<00:00:57.840> tool<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.859> an<00:00:58.920> environment<00:00:59.460> you're

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
feel tool to an environment you're

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.799 
feel tool to an environment you're
creating<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.270> probably<00:01:00.629> your<00:01:00.750> best

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
creating this is probably your best

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.340 
creating this is probably your best
option<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.469> far<00:01:01.680> as<00:01:01.770> destruction<00:01:02.250> goes<00:01:02.699> so

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
option as far as destruction goes so

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.830 
option as far as destruction goes so
anyway<00:01:04.350> let's<00:01:04.559> go<00:01:04.710> ahead<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.270> get<00:01:06.270> started<00:01:06.420> so

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
anyway let's go ahead and get started so

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.050 
anyway let's go ahead and get started so
let's<00:01:06.869> go<00:01:07.229> start<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.770> new<00:01:07.890> scene<00:01:10.760> put<00:01:11.760> your<00:01:11.880> give

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
let's go start a new scene put your give

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.249 
let's go start a new scene put your give
yourself<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> plane<00:01:14.090> make<00:01:15.090> yourself<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.600> cube<00:01:16.110> or

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
yourself a plane make yourself a cube or

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.420 
yourself a plane make yourself a cube or
whatever<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.710> object<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.490> want<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.729> destroy

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
whatever the object you want to destroy

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.539 
whatever the object you want to destroy
let's<00:01:20.430> zero<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.970> out<00:01:21.180> first<00:01:22.340> translate<00:01:23.340> Y

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
let's zero this out first translate Y

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.399 
let's zero this out first translate Y
let's<00:01:23.909> go<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.270> ten<00:01:26.299> okay<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.900> then<00:01:28.080> select

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
let's go up to ten okay so then select

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.270 
let's go up to ten okay so then select
your<00:01:28.530> cube<00:01:28.860> here<00:01:29.100> delete<00:01:29.880> history<00:01:31.070> then<00:01:32.070> once

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
your cube here delete history then once

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.030 
your cube here delete history then once
you've<00:01:32.430> done<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.640> go<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.479> effects<00:01:34.040> create

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
you've done that go to to effects create

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.840 
you've done that go to to effects create
shatter<00:01:35.310> go<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.240> your<00:01:36.390> options<00:01:36.540> right<00:01:36.869> here

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
shatter go to your options right here

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.789 
shatter go to your options right here
okay<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.630> get<00:01:39.750> some<00:01:40.259> options<00:01:40.409> right<00:01:40.770> here

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
okay so you get some options right here

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.889 
okay so you get some options right here
traction<00:01:41.520> or<00:01:41.729> solid<00:01:42.119> shadow<00:01:42.329> or<00:01:42.540> surface

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
traction or solid shadow or surface

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.109 
traction or solid shadow or surface
shatter<00:01:43.130> surface<00:01:44.130> shader<00:01:44.369> won't<00:01:44.820> give<00:01:45.000> you

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
shatter surface shader won't give you

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.609 
shatter surface shader won't give you
that<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.390> guess<00:01:45.720> will<00:01:45.990> give<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.259> something<00:01:46.470> a

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
that I guess will give you something a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.859 
that I guess will give you something a
little<00:01:46.799> bit<00:01:46.890> different<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.399> far<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.750> what<00:01:48.750> we

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
little bit different as far as what we

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.249 
little bit different as far as what we
had<00:01:49.049> initially<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:50.640> then<00:01:51.299> solid<00:01:51.750> shadow<00:01:51.990> will

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
had initially so then solid shadow will

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.050 
had initially so then solid shadow will
but<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.680> pretty<00:01:52.860> much<00:01:52.979> speaks<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.430> itself<00:01:53.759> it

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
but it pretty much speaks for itself it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.330 
but it pretty much speaks for itself it
gives<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.360> solid<00:01:54.750> base<00:01:55.380> objects<00:01:56.009> when<00:01:56.219> it

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
gives you a solid base objects when it

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.679 
gives you a solid base objects when it
just<00:01:56.759> gone<00:01:57.060> destructs<00:01:58.049> or<00:01:58.439> shatters<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.689> then

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
just gone destructs or shatters so then

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.870 
just gone destructs or shatters so then
let's<00:02:01.680> go<00:02:01.799> ahead<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.250> reset<00:02:02.579> some<00:02:02.820> of

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
let's go ahead and just reset some of

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.639 
let's go ahead and just reset some of
the<00:02:02.939> settings<00:02:03.240> here<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:03.930> our<00:02:04.049> shard<00:02:04.350> count

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
the settings here so for our shard count

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.880 
the settings here so for our shard count
this<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.520> basically<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.960> amount<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.409> pieces

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
this is basically the amount of pieces

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.949 
this is basically the amount of pieces
we<00:02:08.039> want<00:02:08.420> from<00:02:09.420> our<00:02:10.400> bob<00:02:11.400> from<00:02:12.120> our<00:02:12.270> cube<00:02:12.569> we

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
we want from our bob from our cube we

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.559 
we want from our bob from our cube we
want<00:02:13.140> to

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
want to

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.599 
want to
chatter<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.829> can<00:02:14.950> go<00:02:15.069> as<00:02:15.189> little<00:02:15.459> as<00:02:15.579> zero

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:15.609 
chatter so you can go as little as zero

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:17.879

material I'm going to try turning that
off<00:02:47.409> and<00:02:47.739> see<00:02:47.859> what<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.189> does<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:49.299> then<00:02:50.069> let's

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
off and see what it does and then let's

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.009 
off and see what it does and then let's
see<00:02:51.250> make<00:02:51.760> sure<00:02:51.969> you<00:02:52.060> have<00:02:52.209> links<00:02:52.419> to<00:02:52.780> shards

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
see make sure you have links to shards

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.369 
see make sure you have links to shards
on<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.530> that's<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.549> so<00:02:55.449> let's<00:02:56.019> see<00:02:56.139> if<00:02:56.230> this

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
on and that's it so let's see if this

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.809 
on and that's it so let's see if this
works<00:02:58.739> it'll<00:02:59.739> take<00:02:59.889> a<00:02:59.919> few<00:02:59.980> seconds<00:03:00.430> for<00:03:00.579> it<00:03:00.639> to

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
works it'll take a few seconds for it to

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.119 
works it'll take a few seconds for it to
process<00:03:03.599> okay<00:03:04.599> so<00:03:05.290> now<00:03:05.439> what<00:03:05.620> just<00:03:05.799> happened

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
process okay so now what just happened

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.220 
process okay so now what just happened
is<00:03:06.250> after<00:03:06.549> we<00:03:06.819> applied<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.449> shattering

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
is after we applied the shattering

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.229 
is after we applied the shattering
effect<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:08.680> takes<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.250> object<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:09.790> breaks<00:03:10.000> it

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
effect it takes the object and breaks it

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.599 
effect it takes the object and breaks it
all<00:03:10.419> into<00:03:10.689> pieces<00:03:11.049> with<00:03:11.230> edges<00:03:11.560> everywhere<00:03:11.949> so

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
all into pieces with edges everywhere so

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.879 
all into pieces with edges everywhere so
it<00:03:12.819> may<00:03:12.939> look<00:03:13.150> kind<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:14.019> wrong<00:03:14.199> right<00:03:14.439> now<00:03:14.590> but

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
it may look kind of wrong right now but

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.520 
it may look kind of wrong right now but
I<00:03:15.129> it<00:03:16.090> will<00:03:16.239> work<00:03:16.480> once<00:03:16.930> we<00:03:17.139> have<00:03:17.290> everything

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
I it will work once we have everything

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.429 
I it will work once we have everything
set<00:03:17.819> so<00:03:18.819> make<00:03:19.000> sure<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.209> have<00:03:19.329> don't<00:03:20.049> deselect

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:20.439 
set so make sure you have don't deselect

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.689 
set so make sure you have don't deselect
anything<00:03:20.919> so<00:03:21.189> make<00:03:21.310> sure<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.519> have<00:03:21.609> the

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:21.699 
anything so make sure you have the

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:25.319 
anything so make sure you have the
square<00:03:22.569> set<00:03:22.870> selected<00:03:23.829> go<00:03:24.549> to<00:03:24.579> fields<00:03:25.180> and

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
square set selected go to fields and

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.449 
square set selected go to fields and
then<00:03:25.449> click<00:03:25.750> on<00:03:25.900> gravity<00:03:26.470> obviously<00:03:27.310> this

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
then click on gravity obviously this

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.339 
then click on gravity obviously this
will<00:03:27.609> apply<00:03:27.849> the<00:03:27.970> physics<00:03:28.509> to<00:03:28.689> it<00:03:28.810> so<00:03:29.109> which

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
will apply the physics to it so which

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.670 
will apply the physics to it so which
obviously<00:03:29.949> will<00:03:30.870> entail<00:03:31.870> gravity<00:03:32.470> pulling

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
obviously will entail gravity pulling

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.939 
obviously will entail gravity pulling
down<00:03:32.919> the<00:03:32.949> object<00:03:33.489> pretty<00:03:33.879> self-explanatory

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
down the object pretty self-explanatory

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:36.119 
down the object pretty self-explanatory
okay

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
okay

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.979 
okay
so<00:03:36.280> one<00:03:36.639> final<00:03:36.790> step<00:03:37.090> we<00:03:37.239> just<00:03:37.419> have<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.629> do<00:03:37.750> is

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
so one final step we just have to do is

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.439 
so one final step we just have to do is
make<00:03:38.169> sure<00:03:38.199> we<00:03:38.409> have<00:03:38.620> this<00:03:39.069> plane<00:03:39.430> here<00:03:39.729> acting

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:40.449 
make sure we have this plane here acting

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.270 
make sure we have this plane here acting
like<00:03:40.509> a<00:03:40.689> solid<00:03:41.109> surface<00:03:41.319> otherwise<00:03:41.949> it<00:03:42.220> will

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
like a solid surface otherwise it will

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.890 
like a solid surface otherwise it will
not<00:03:42.519> create<00:03:42.759> that<00:03:42.849> shattering<00:03:43.389> effect<00:03:43.509> for

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
not create that shattering effect for

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.039 
not create that shattering effect for
the<00:03:43.959> cube<00:03:44.229> it<00:03:44.949> will<00:03:45.099> not<00:03:45.250> allow<00:03:45.489> it<00:03:45.639> to<00:03:45.729> do<00:03:45.849> that

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
the cube it will not allow it to do that

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.349 
the cube it will not allow it to do that
so<00:03:47.049> just<00:03:47.079> go<00:03:47.349> ahead<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:47.680> create<00:03:47.829> select<00:03:48.759> the

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
so just go ahead and create select the

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.369 
so just go ahead and create select the
plane<00:03:50.459> let's<00:03:51.459> go<00:03:51.609> to<00:03:51.729> our<00:03:51.849> soft<00:03:52.540> rigid<00:03:52.989> bodies

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
plane let's go to our soft rigid bodies

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.170 
plane let's go to our soft rigid bodies
make<00:03:53.530> sure<00:03:53.680> your<00:03:53.949> dynamics<00:03:54.549> tab<00:03:54.729> by<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.030> way

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
make sure your dynamics tab by the way

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.479 
make sure your dynamics tab by the way
and<00:03:56.109> then<00:03:56.319> create<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.519> passive<00:03:58.000> rigid<00:03:58.359> body<00:03:59.489> so

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
and then create a passive rigid body so

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:01.709 
and then create a passive rigid body so
once<00:04:00.699> you've<00:04:00.819> done<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:01.060> you're<00:04:01.449> going<00:04:01.479> to<00:04:01.599> go

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:01.719 
once you've done that you're going to go

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:04.289 
once you've done that you're going to go
to<00:04:01.780> your<00:04:01.900> channel<00:04:02.109> box<00:04:02.379> layer<00:04:02.790> editor<00:04:03.790> and

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
to your channel box layer editor and

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.780 
to your channel box layer editor and
then<00:04:04.389> you're<00:04:04.509> going<00:04:04.599> to<00:04:04.659> go<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:04.810> rigid<00:04:05.290> body

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
then you're going to go to rigid body

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.530 
then you're going to go to rigid body
then<00:04:06.790> you're<00:04:06.909> going<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.090> scroll<00:04:07.269> down<00:04:07.329> until

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
then you're going to scroll down until

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.779 
then you're going to scroll down until
you<00:04:08.079> see<00:04:08.109> collision<00:04:08.799> layer<00:04:08.949> make<00:04:09.489> sure<00:04:09.519> you

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:09.789 
you see collision layer make sure you

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:11.869 
you see collision layer make sure you
have<00:04:09.969> that<00:04:10.150> set<00:04:10.389> to<00:04:10.419> negative<00:04:10.659> one

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
have that set to negative one

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.909 
have that set to negative one
alright<00:04:12.879> so<00:04:13.509> that<00:04:13.719> pretty<00:04:14.349> much<00:04:14.469> solves

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
alright so that pretty much solves

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:19.259 
alright so that pretty much solves
everything<00:04:16.349> and<00:04:17.349> we<00:04:17.500> are<00:04:17.620> ready<00:04:17.769> to<00:04:17.919> go<00:04:18.269> so

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
everything and we are ready to go so

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.899 
everything and we are ready to go so
let's<00:04:19.509> go<00:04:19.659> ahead<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:19.930> create<00:04:20.349> our<00:04:20.440> frame

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
let's go ahead and create our frame

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.800 
let's go ahead and create our frame
count<00:04:21.909> two<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.570> one

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
count two to one

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.020 
count two to one
it<00:04:23.430> drag<00:04:24.430> it<00:04:24.580> on<00:04:24.730> our<00:04:25.270> timeline<00:04:26.790> go<00:04:27.790> to<00:04:27.850> the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
it drag it on our timeline go to the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.090 
it drag it on our timeline go to the
beginning<00:04:28.270> of<00:04:28.450> our<00:04:28.510> animation<00:04:29.139> and<00:04:29.580> watch<00:04:30.580> oh

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
beginning of our animation and watch oh

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.820 
beginning of our animation and watch oh
boy<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.520> didn't<00:04:34.060> work

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
boy I didn't work

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.190 
boy I didn't work
probably<00:04:35.830> an<00:04:35.919> operator<00:04:36.310> error<00:04:37.200> select

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
probably an operator error select

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.280 
probably an operator error select
everything<00:04:38.440> good<00:04:39.990> go<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.050> gravity

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
everything good go to gravity

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.640 
everything good go to gravity
try<00:04:44.290> it<00:04:44.350> again<00:04:45.210> there<00:04:46.210> we<00:04:46.389> go<00:04:46.480> that's<00:04:47.350> better

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
try it again there we go that's better

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.570 
try it again there we go that's better
that's<00:04:48.160> a<00:04:48.340> lot<00:04:48.490> better<00:04:48.669> so<00:04:49.600> now<00:04:49.630> we<00:04:49.810> don't<00:04:50.050> have

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
that's a lot better so now we don't have

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.120 
that's a lot better so now we don't have
that<00:04:51.580> yellow<00:04:52.270> color<00:04:52.620> extra<00:04:53.620> layer<00:04:53.860> in<00:04:53.889> our

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
that yellow color extra layer in our

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.490 
that yellow color extra layer in our
shatter<00:04:54.460> so<00:04:54.820> make<00:04:55.120> sure<00:04:55.150> you<00:04:55.419> have<00:04:55.720> this

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
shatter so make sure you have this

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.409 
shatter so make sure you have this
option<00:04:56.830> off<00:04:57.190> if<00:04:57.490> you<00:04:57.580> don't<00:04:57.760> want<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:58.060> apply

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
option off if you don't want to apply

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.820 
option off if you don't want to apply
interior<00:04:59.020> material<00:04:59.919> so<00:05:01.320> already<00:05:02.320> so<00:05:02.680> that

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
interior material so already so that

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.950 
interior material so already so that
pretty<00:05:03.100> much<00:05:03.220> entail<00:05:04.030> that<00:05:04.060> pretty<00:05:04.810> much

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
pretty much entail that pretty much

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.500 
pretty much entail that pretty much
gives<00:05:05.440> you<00:05:05.530> a<00:05:05.590> basic<00:05:06.460> idea<00:05:06.610> of<00:05:07.030> what<00:05:07.060> you<00:05:07.360> can

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
gives you a basic idea of what you can

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.800 
gives you a basic idea of what you can
do<00:05:07.660> with<00:05:07.870> this<00:05:08.020> shattering<00:05:08.620> effect<00:05:08.710> so<00:05:09.810> it's

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
do with this shattering effect so it's

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.960 
do with this shattering effect so it's
obviously<00:05:11.200> something<00:05:11.470> you<00:05:11.740> can<00:05:11.919> you<00:05:12.700> know<00:05:12.820> go

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
obviously something you can you know go

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.430 
obviously something you can you know go
ahead<00:05:13.090> and<00:05:13.360> play<00:05:13.479> with<00:05:13.540> the<00:05:13.750> settings<00:05:13.960> as<00:05:14.260> far

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
ahead and play with the settings as far

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.879 
ahead and play with the settings as far
as<00:05:14.590> I<00:05:14.710> want<00:05:15.100> my<00:05:15.690> object<00:05:16.690> to<00:05:16.780> be<00:05:16.870> bigger<00:05:17.200> I<00:05:17.710> want

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
as I want my object to be bigger I want

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.219 
as I want my object to be bigger I want
the<00:05:17.979> things<00:05:18.220> to<00:05:18.400> be<00:05:18.520> smaller<00:05:18.850> thinner<00:05:19.360> as<00:05:19.990> far

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
the things to be smaller thinner as far

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:21.810 
the things to be smaller thinner as far
as<00:05:20.380> how<00:05:20.500> many<00:05:20.560> pieces<00:05:20.889> come<00:05:21.190> off<00:05:21.340> so<00:05:21.639> that's

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
as how many pieces come off so that's

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.060 
as how many pieces come off so that's
always<00:05:22.060> options<00:05:22.690> you<00:05:22.810> can<00:05:22.930> go<00:05:23.080> ahead<00:05:23.830> and

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
always options you can go ahead and

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.540 
always options you can go ahead and
tweak<00:05:24.389> but<00:05:25.389> this<00:05:25.570> basically<00:05:26.050> observe<00:05:26.550> what

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
tweak but this basically observe what

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.380 
tweak but this basically observe what
this<00:05:28.150> shattering<00:05:28.690> effect<00:05:28.810> can<00:05:29.680> do<00:05:30.120> that<00:05:31.120> comes

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
this shattering effect can do that comes

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.130 
this shattering effect can do that comes
with<00:05:31.690> Maya

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
with Maya

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.740 
with Maya
so<00:05:32.380> I<00:05:32.620> find<00:05:33.160> it<00:05:33.280> pretty<00:05:33.580> interesting<00:05:33.729> and<00:05:34.630> then

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
so I find it pretty interesting and then

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.279 
so I find it pretty interesting and then
in<00:05:35.620> some<00:05:35.890> cases<00:05:35.919> very<00:05:36.280> helpful<00:05:36.850> because<00:05:37.289> let's

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
in some cases very helpful because let's

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.620 
in some cases very helpful because let's
say<00:05:38.410> for<00:05:38.620> example<00:05:39.100> you<00:05:39.220> want<00:05:39.430> to<00:05:39.550> you<00:05:40.510> know

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
say for example you want to you know

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.450 
say for example you want to you know
create<00:05:40.810> an<00:05:41.229> object<00:05:41.380> and<00:05:41.890> then<00:05:42.070> you<00:05:42.250> obviously

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
create an object and then you obviously

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.000 
create an object and then you obviously
don't<00:05:42.910> want<00:05:43.030> it<00:05:43.270> to<00:05:43.360> be<00:05:43.539> you<00:05:44.169> know<00:05:44.200> you<00:05:44.890> don't

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
don't want it to be you know you don't

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.500 
don't want it to be you know you don't
want<00:05:45.190> it<00:05:45.250> to<00:05:45.340> be<00:05:45.460> put<00:05:45.700> together<00:05:45.820> he<00:05:46.180> wanted<00:05:46.419> to

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
want it to be put together he wanted to

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.260 
want it to be put together he wanted to
be<00:05:46.600> destroyed<00:05:47.200> like<00:05:48.160> there<00:05:48.340> was<00:05:48.490> remanence

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
be destroyed like there was remanence

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.440 
be destroyed like there was remanence
remnants<00:05:49.930> of<00:05:50.020> a<00:05:50.200> of<00:05:50.650> an<00:05:50.800> object<00:05:51.250> let's<00:05:52.240> say<00:05:52.360> I

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
remnants of a of an object let's say I

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.040 
remnants of a of an object let's say I
don't<00:05:52.630> know<00:05:52.750> like<00:05:52.870> a<00:05:52.930> bowl<00:05:53.229> or<00:05:53.680> or<00:05:54.180> a<00:05:55.180> wall<00:05:55.660> that

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
don't know like a bowl or or a wall that

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.040 
don't know like a bowl or or a wall that
had<00:05:56.289> a<00:05:56.850> cannon<00:05:57.850> just<00:05:58.419> one<00:05:58.600> throw<00:05:58.840> it<00:05:58.960> and

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
had a cannon just one throw it and

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.590 
had a cannon just one throw it and
there's<00:05:59.229> debris<00:05:59.919> everywhere<00:06:00.039> so<00:06:00.729> that<00:06:01.360> sort

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
there's debris everywhere so that sort

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.570 
there's debris everywhere so that sort
of<00:06:01.630> gives<00:06:01.750> you<00:06:01.990> that<00:06:02.020> idea<00:06:02.620> that<00:06:03.130> cool<00:06:03.460> effect

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
of gives you that idea that cool effect

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.409 
of gives you that idea that cool effect
of<00:06:04.030> you<00:06:04.630> know<00:06:04.660> destruction<00:06:05.560> so<00:06:06.270> but<00:06:07.270> that's

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
of you know destruction so but that's

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:08.850 
of you know destruction so but that's
pretty<00:06:07.660> much<00:06:07.810> it<00:06:08.050> for<00:06:08.200> this<00:06:08.650> demonstration

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
pretty much it for this demonstration

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.890 
pretty much it for this demonstration
hopefully<00:06:09.789> this<00:06:09.940> will<00:06:10.060> be<00:06:10.210> helpful<00:06:10.510> for<00:06:10.630> you
