00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
alive like it looks more like that's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.270 
alive like it looks more like that's
ever<00:01:17.729> been<00:01:18.140> you<00:01:19.140> see<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> cop<00:01:19.710> even<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
ever been you see a cop even in the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.690 
ever been you see a cop even in the
being<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> cop<00:01:21.240> chasing<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.170> thug<00:01:22.830> while<00:01:23.520> you're

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
being a cop chasing a thug while you're

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.030 
being a cop chasing a thug while you're
flying<00:01:23.880> through<00:01:24.390> one<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.619> awesome<00:01:25.799> it

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
flying through one is like so awesome it

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.859 
flying through one is like so awesome it
finally<00:01:26.430> makes<00:01:26.490> sense<00:01:26.670> because<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.689> other

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
finally makes sense because in the other

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.840 
finally makes sense because in the other
games<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.530> was<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.100> okay<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> thugs<00:01:29.700> took

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
games I was like okay the thugs took

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.460 
games I was like okay the thugs took
over<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.090> city<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.570> they<00:01:30.960> decided<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.380> take

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
over the city but they decided to take

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.350 
over the city but they decided to take
over<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.920> city<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.280> not<00:01:32.460> use<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.909> roads<00:01:33.150> at

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
over the city but not use the roads at

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.380 
over the city but not use the roads at
all<00:01:33.479> because<00:01:33.720> they're<00:01:34.020> stupid<00:01:34.490> well<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.790> guess

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
all because they're stupid well I guess

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.270 
all because they're stupid well I guess
it's<00:01:36.630> somewhat<00:01:37.229> made<00:01:37.409> sense<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.860> Origins

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
it's somewhat made sense in Origins

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.550 
it's somewhat made sense in Origins
because<00:01:38.579> there's<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:38.970> much<00:01:39.090> no<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> think

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
because there's so much no but I think

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.200 
because there's so much no but I think
they<00:01:40.619> could<00:01:40.770> still<00:01:41.400> doing<00:01:41.670> something<00:01:42.119> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
they could still doing something and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.630 
they could still doing something and
