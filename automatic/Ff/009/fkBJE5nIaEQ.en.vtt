00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.419
 good day with you channel master secret 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.230
 continue the topic of electronic 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.870
 constructor 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.580
 from a lamp tv to work with 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.889
 electronic crafts needed 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.629
 experience high voltage power supply 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.789
 knowing what the most difficult thing is 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.130
 amateur construction is the body 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.540
 It was decided to make the power supply in without 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.850
 corpus version the more to do 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.100
 beautiful body for heavy block 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.500
 power it is quite difficult he was 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.160
 assembled on the basis of the body from the old 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.770
 sidiroma 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.570
 it is better to use the old sidir 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.499
 the transformer was fixed on 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.050
 regular landing place she two screws 

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:38.579
 which fastened the socket 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.499
 allowed to hide the terminal block 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.760
 inward and comply accordingly 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:44.129
 electrical safety 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.260
 terminals are on the front panel 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.760
 heat 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.260
 ground terminal and high-voltage terminals 250 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.649
 volt 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:01:00.829
 230 volts and 150 volts check operation 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.829
 power supply turn on the power supply 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.569
 there is a characteristic buzz 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:17.570
 transformer take tester and measure 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:20.460
 voltage is first measured 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.049
 high voltage now 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.770
 no load so the voltage will be 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.770
 slightly higher 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.100
 measure the heat one winding second 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.490
 winding 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.280
 if we turn off the power supply there is one 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.030
 unpleasant factor these electrolytic 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.220
 capacitors 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.130
 accumulate large amounts of energy and 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.890
 if there is no yoga, then it will not seem like it 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.480
 to discharge capacitors installed 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.180
 damping resistor and this 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.220
 for each voltage of the order of 100 kilos 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.070
 installed resistor but still it 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.350
 it takes a long time to leave no leaves under the highway 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.440
 if you had no load 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.690
 work carefully take care of yourself and your 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.690
 life look inside the power supply 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.049
 power supply circuitry simple with 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.700
 step-up winding voltage 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.310
 straightened by two rectifiers 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.989
 bridges see the circuit and voltage 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.349
 arrives 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.090
 consistently on the filter capacitor 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.519
 To reduce pulsation set 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.260
 low impedance resistors which helps 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.520
 extinguish high voltage ripple 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.580
 stresses 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.040
 this crisis is necessary to reduce the throw 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.290
 current to protect rectifier bridges 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.760
 be sure to put high impedance 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.890
 resistor and which will take off 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.800
 voltage after shutdown 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.260
 power supply although they are worth something 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.130
 voltage still has sparks 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.620
 the fly will come down on through resistor 51 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.830
 Killam construction is simple and in it 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.870
 laid stock for upgrading is quite 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.930
 possible if there is interest in tube 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.480
 designs this power supply will 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.620
 remake to 800 volts 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.660

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.590
 make tube stereo
