hi<00:00:09.750> everyone<00:00:09.960> so<00:00:10.469> today<00:00:10.500> we're<00:00:11.160> taking<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.490> look

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
hi everyone so today we're taking a look

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.079 
hi everyone so today we're taking a look
at<00:00:11.849> microsoft's<00:00:12.330> game<00:00:13.110> DVR<00:00:13.590> footage<00:00:14.130> so<00:00:14.880> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
at microsoft's game DVR footage so the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.849 
at microsoft's game DVR footage so the
way<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.389> works<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.839> at<00:00:15.990> any<00:00:16.139> time<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.830> can

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
way this works is at any time you can

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.269 
way this works is at any time you can
say<00:00:17.279> xbox<00:00:18.150> record<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.590> xbox<00:00:19.980> one

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
say xbox record that and the xbox one

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.670 
say xbox record that and the xbox one
will<00:00:20.490> grab<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.449> last<00:00:21.689> 30<00:00:22.050> seconds<00:00:22.560> of

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
will grab the last 30 seconds of

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.529 
will grab the last 30 seconds of
gameplay<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.939> will<00:00:24.029> make<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.300> available

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
gameplay and it will make that available

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.279 
gameplay and it will make that available
to<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.080> now<00:00:25.949> likewise<00:00:26.460> developers<00:00:27.150> can<00:00:27.359> build

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
to you now likewise developers can build

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.220 
to you now likewise developers can build
their<00:00:28.560> games<00:00:28.830> around<00:00:29.310> game<00:00:29.670> DVR<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.599> when

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
their games around game DVR so that when

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.740 
their games around game DVR so that when
particular<00:00:32.130> moments<00:00:32.550> happen<00:00:32.850> like<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.480> level

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
particular moments happen like you level

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.520 
particular moments happen like you level
up<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:33.989> battlefield<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:35.390> basically<00:00:36.390> start

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
up in battlefield you basically start

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.690 
up in battlefield you basically start
recording<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.890> last<00:00:38.040> 30<00:00:38.280> seconds

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
recording for the last 30 seconds

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.940 
recording for the last 30 seconds
meaning<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.059> capture<00:00:39.600> whatever<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.680> that

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
meaning you capture whatever it is that

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.860 
meaning you capture whatever it is that
caused<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.460> level<00:00:41.820> up<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.329> quite<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.629> cool

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
caused you to level up it's quite a cool

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.410 
caused you to level up it's quite a cool
feature<00:00:43.160> but<00:00:44.160> that's<00:00:44.760> really<00:00:45.030> where<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
feature but that's really where the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.670 
feature but that's really where the
coolness<00:00:45.660> kind<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.140> ends<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:46.559> this

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
coolness kind of ends with this

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.770 
coolness kind of ends with this
technology<00:00:47.270> unfortunately<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> resulting

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
but it is bed badly let down by only

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.130 
but it is bed badly let down by only
recording<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.520> last<00:01:44.670> 30<00:01:45.000> seconds<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.689> can

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
of footage while you play but five

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.050 
of footage while you play but five
minutes<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.860> not<00:01:50.070> an<00:01:50.189> awful<00:01:50.520> lot<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.820> footage

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
minutes is not an awful lot of footage

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.460 
minutes is not an awful lot of footage
when<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.390> actually<00:01:51.630> think<00:01:51.930> about<00:01:52.259> it

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
when you actually think about it

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.980 
when you actually think about it
certainly<00:01:52.890> not<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.520> 45<00:01:54.149> minute<00:01:54.420> long<00:01:54.630> game

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
certainly not in a 45 minute long game

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.560 
certainly not in a 45 minute long game
of<00:01:55.140> battlefield<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:56.850> would<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.210> been<00:01:57.360> much

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
of battlefield it would have been much

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.120 
of battlefield it would have been much
better<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:58.020> Microsoft<00:01:58.590> had<00:01:58.710> launched<00:01:58.950> with

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
better if Microsoft had launched with

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.280 
better if Microsoft had launched with
twitch<00:01:59.369> TV<00:01:59.640> support<00:02:00.210> putting<00:02:00.630> them<00:02:00.719> on<00:02:00.840> parity

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
twitch TV support putting them on parity

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.170
