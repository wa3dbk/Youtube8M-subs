so<00:01:23.540> rough<00:01:23.840> that<00:01:24.170> it<00:01:24.320> hurts<00:01:24.530> my<00:01:24.770> fingers<00:01:25.150> that

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
so rough that it hurts my fingers that

so rough that it hurts my fingers that
does<00:01:26.420> have<00:01:26.630> that<00:01:26.840> slight<00:01:27.320> texture<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:28.160> it<00:01:28.360> that

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
does have that slight texture to it that

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.200 
does have that slight texture to it that
holds<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.590> past<00:01:30.800> all<00:01:31.100> it<00:01:31.250> grips<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.760> past<00:01:31.970> all

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
holds the past all it grips the past all

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:44.050 
holds the past all it grips the past all
really<00:01:32.720> nicely<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:42.070> the<00:01:43.070> more<00:01:43.340> you<00:01:43.520> press<00:01:43.790> the

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
really nicely and the more you press the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.719 
really nicely and the more you press the
more<00:01:44.560> dust<00:01:45.560> there<00:01:45.860> will<00:01:45.979> be<00:01:46.130> so<00:01:46.370> I<00:01:46.400> like<00:01:46.700> to

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
more dust there will be so I like to

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.020 
more dust there will be so I like to
just<00:01:46.970> build<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:47.510> up<00:01:47.659> gradually<00:01:48.729> so<00:01:49.729> you<00:01:49.820> don't

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
just build it up gradually so you don't

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.600 
just build it up gradually so you don't
get<00:01:50.240> a<00:01:50.600> huge<00:01:51.050> amount<00:01:51.260> of<00:01:51.560> dust<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:52.040> start<00:01:52.370> with

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
get a huge amount of dust to start with

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.130 
get a huge amount of dust to start with
and<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:54.760> can<00:01:55.760> overlay<00:01:56.299> color<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.020> will

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
and you can overlay color so it will

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.850 
and you can overlay color so it will
take<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.380> lot<00:01:57.710> of<00:01:57.770> possible<00:01:58.430> work<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:59.440> if<00:02:00.440> you

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
take a lot of possible work and if you

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.440 
take a lot of possible work and if you
wanted<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.310> use<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:02.330> fixative<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:04.460> enable<00:02:05.360> you

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
wanted to use a fixative to enable you

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.930 
wanted to use a fixative to enable you
to<00:02:05.510> put<00:02:05.750> more<00:02:05.960> layers<00:02:06.290> on<00:02:06.680> top<00:02:07.430> of<00:02:07.580> that<00:02:07.700> you

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
to put more layers on top of that you

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.699 
to put more layers on top of that you
could<00:02:08.119> spray<00:02:08.450> that

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
could spray that

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.030 
could spray that
and<00:02:10.959> then<00:02:11.959> you'll<00:02:12.140> be<00:02:12.260> able<00:02:12.349> to<00:02:12.500> build<00:02:12.620> up<00:02:12.799> more

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
and then you'll be able to build up more

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.559 
and then you'll be able to build up more
layers<00:02:13.250> so<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.459> can<00:02:13.670> use<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:14.060> body<00:02:14.239> of<00:02:14.450> the

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
layers so you can use the body of the

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.679 
layers so you can use the body of the
past<00:02:14.780> or<00:02:15.079> you<00:02:15.530> can<00:02:15.709> use<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.069> tip<00:02:16.510> like<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
past or you can use the tip like the

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.929 
past or you can use the tip like the
past<00:02:17.930> or<00:02:18.200> for<00:02:18.409> more<00:02:18.560> detail<00:02:19.010> perhaps<00:02:19.220> more

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
past or for more detail perhaps more

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.229 
past or for more detail perhaps more
specific<00:02:20.540> areas<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:21.409> can<00:02:21.530> go<00:02:21.739> over<00:02:22.239> dark

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
specific areas you can go over dark

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.140 
specific areas you can go over dark
colors<00:02:23.599> with<00:02:23.780> light<00:02:24.049> colors<00:02:24.760> over<00:02:25.760> light
