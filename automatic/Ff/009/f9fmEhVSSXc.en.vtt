00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 ski region ski dual was created by the 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.790
 connection from deal ciao now 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.319
 and craft all these two ski resorts are 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.790
 recently connected and that 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.300
 means a lot of new things too 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.040
 to discover 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.519
 in this video we show some nice ones 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.759
 tipsy for this area 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.759
 h 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.250
 a nice tip for the best snow 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.920
 the highest point of the ski area above 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.930
 though light who dishorn horn was allowed 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.000
 more than 120 to measure it and is therefore the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.010
 highest peak within the ski area and you 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.420
 that really have a great view 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.610
 that is the side of the soul 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.380
 want to see here lay a c but we 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.760
 have you mostly very good snow 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.530
 until deep into the season 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.390
 we here in January and it is foggy then 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.770
 you should definitely be something here but you are 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.820
 later in the season we are here 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.400
 February March 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.400
 beautiful snow well into the day 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:14.729
 I stand in the day though already thought the 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.990
 style advice the 47 it really recommended 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.429
 read cyst 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.829
 a nice piping through the woods 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.240
 meanders that you head like that 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.460
 less sunny days and days we will 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.380
 have a great time here but I would 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.310
 certainly not over radiantly sunny 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.310
 my really worth it 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.729
 so just made the crossing to it 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.990
 ski area of ​​wheelchair name 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.999
 area of ​​you want after consists of one 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.500
 number of individual ski resorts but by far it 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:04.780
 The largest part is on the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.850
 shads mountain and that's where we stand here 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.379
 the mountain shots are two 6-person 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.670
 chairlift and the cable car 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.260
 the unions that two 6-person 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.989
 chairlift they are a number of slopes 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.849
 find about seven and behind them 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.500
 are actually all a mega tip 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.209
 wide as a soccer field 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.220
 a wonderful slope they are 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.959
 you can imagine all red light red 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.849
 as a beginner you also come well 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.010
 down but you are more advanced 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.670
 well where you stay that all day 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.670
 to enjoy 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.780
 I am standing by the tube forest for it 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.730
 middle station of the birch and this shots 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.010
 really meant austria austria here 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.870
 is a nice lovely come a nice 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.070
 chalet can eat very well 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.110
 children's meadow where the children are quiet 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.640
 learn to ski where they are where there is no danger 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.440
 from racing skiers 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.670
 the most beautiful you come, you are really one 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.670
 very cool red run 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.049
 the last tip may seem like one 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.620
 the obvious but it certainly is 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.749
 not 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.510
 in the wheelchair section you already have 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:49.700
 a separate ski area with two fast 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.739
 lifts and regiment slept lightly it is 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.150
 the ski resort at liberal 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.859
 Many people think it might seem 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.150
 about it goes on up to sixteen 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.719
 one hundred as many do not know all of that 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.909
 so special 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:01.519
 but it is no less true slopes 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.319
 have a lot of challenge at the top and the 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.879
 snow remains really good so the now 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.620
 around mid-March and there is snow 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.030
 still great compared to the rest 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.530
 from the ski area 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.540
 In addition, you have the ski area at the bottom 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.010
 you actually arrive in the village and first 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.780
 real fun so a children's meadow 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.980
 everything on it and on it would be a shame 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.820
 if you like this part of the ski area 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.820
 to skip
