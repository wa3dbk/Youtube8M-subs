00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
guess what you don't need that um you

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.250 
guess what you don't need that um you
don't<00:02:39.660> need<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:41.239> tinsel<00:02:42.239> rib<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:43.080> going

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
don't need that tinsel rib this is going

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
this hope version this whole process I'm

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.660 
this hope version this whole process I'm
going<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.840> take<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.290> fur<00:02:53.190> off<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:55.670> forward
