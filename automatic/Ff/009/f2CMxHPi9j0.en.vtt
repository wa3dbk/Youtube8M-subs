start to remove some of the holes just a

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.020 
start to remove some of the holes just a
little<00:04:46.290> bit

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
little bit

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.030

whenever we're ready we're gonna start

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:59.989 
whenever we're ready we're gonna start
with<00:04:57.749> D<00:04:58.020> polling<00:04:58.619> and<00:04:58.830> then<00:04:59.159> the<00:04:59.339> D<00:04:59.520> shelling

00:04:59.989 --> 00:04:59.999 
with D polling and then the D shelling

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:03.709 
with D polling and then the D shelling
process<00:05:01.129> the<00:05:02.129> deep<00:05:02.339> haulers<00:05:02.879> are<00:05:03.180> basically

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
process the deep haulers are basically

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:07.650 
process the deep haulers are basically
the<00:05:03.930> same<00:05:03.960> as<00:05:04.559> the<00:05:04.589> D<00:05:05.339> shellers

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
the same as the D shellers

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.030 
the same as the D shellers
and<00:05:08.110> we're<00:05:08.200> going<00:05:08.320> to<00:05:08.350> show<00:05:08.560> you<00:05:08.620> what<00:05:08.890> they

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
and we're going to show you what they

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.720 
and we're going to show you what they
look<00:05:09.070> like<00:05:09.760> basically<00:05:10.330> they<00:05:10.660> run<00:05:10.930> through<00:05:11.290> a

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
look like basically they run through a

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.620 
look like basically they run through a
hauling<00:05:12.730> machine<00:05:13.030> and<00:05:13.240> a<00:05:13.300> run<00:05:13.450> through

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
hauling machine and a run through

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.030 
hauling machine and a run through
another<00:05:13.780> hauling<00:05:14.350> machine<00:05:14.590> in<00:05:14.710> another

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
another hauling machine in another

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.080 
another hauling machine in another
hauling<00:05:15.310> machine<00:05:15.550> they're<00:05:15.670> all<00:05:15.820> really

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
hauling machine they're all really

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.110 
hauling machine they're all really
similar<00:05:16.480> and<00:05:16.840> what<00:05:17.500> they<00:05:17.590> do<00:05:17.650> is<00:05:17.860> they<00:05:17.950> start

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
similar and what they do is they start

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.640 
similar and what they do is they start
squeeze<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.420> nut<00:05:19.630> just<00:05:19.870> a<00:05:20.020> little<00:05:20.350> bit<00:05:20.500> by

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
squeeze the nut just a little bit by

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.200 
squeeze the nut just a little bit by
rolling<00:05:20.980> it<00:05:21.010> through<00:05:21.190> these<00:05:21.280> roller<00:05:21.610> devices

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
rolling it through these roller devices

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.600 
rolling it through these roller devices
here<00:05:22.840> you<00:05:22.990> can<00:05:23.170> see<00:05:23.410> it<00:05:23.590> sucked<00:05:23.980> out<00:05:24.160> some<00:05:24.490> of

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
here you can see it sucked out some of

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.630 
here you can see it sucked out some of
the<00:05:24.700> trash<00:05:25.030> that's<00:05:25.750> starting<00:05:26.170> to<00:05:26.200> be<00:05:26.640> pulled

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
the trash that's starting to be pulled

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.340 
the trash that's starting to be pulled
off<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:28.060> nut<00:05:28.330> just<00:05:28.960> through<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:29.230> hole

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
off the nut just through the hole

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.370 
off the nut just through the hole
cleaning<00:05:29.620> process

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.170 

and<00:05:32.860> then<00:05:32.980> it<00:05:33.100> goes<00:05:33.220> down<00:05:33.400> to<00:05:33.550> another<00:05:33.820> device

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
and then it goes down to another device

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.610 
and then it goes down to another device
or<00:05:34.420> begins<00:05:34.630> to<00:05:34.750> remove<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:35.140> hole<00:05:35.350> in<00:05:35.500> the

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
or begins to remove the hole in the

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.440 
or begins to remove the hole in the
shell<00:05:35.830> another<00:05:36.430> one<00:05:36.730> and<00:05:36.970> it<00:05:37.030> just<00:05:37.210> gets<00:05:37.360> a

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
shell another one and it just gets a

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.840 
shell another one and it just gets a
little<00:05:37.570> tighter<00:05:37.960> each<00:05:38.290> time

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
little tighter each time

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.420 
little tighter each time
until<00:05:40.480> finally<00:05:40.750> you<00:05:41.080> just<00:05:41.320> have<00:05:41.500> the<00:05:41.650> M<00:05:41.860> and<00:05:42.220> in

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
until finally you just have the M and in

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.160 
until finally you just have the M and in
the<00:05:42.580> shown<00:05:42.790> from<00:05:42.970> here<00:05:43.300> we<00:05:43.720> could<00:05:43.990> if<00:05:44.140> we

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
the shown from here we could if we

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.840 
the shown from here we could if we
wanted<00:05:44.500> to<00:05:44.560> just<00:05:44.860> take<00:05:45.070> out<00:05:45.220> our<00:05:45.400> hamon<00:05:45.670> in<00:05:45.760> the

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
wanted to just take out our hamon in the

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.650 
wanted to just take out our hamon in the
shell<00:05:46.030> and<00:05:46.120> sell<00:05:46.330> them<00:05:46.450> in<00:05:46.570> shell<00:05:48.540> but<00:05:49.540> then

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
shell and sell them in shell but then

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.000 
shell and sell them in shell but then
they're<00:05:49.840> brought<00:05:49.990> over<00:05:50.170> to<00:05:50.290> the<00:05:50.500> other<00:05:50.650> side

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
they're brought over to the other side

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.590 
they're brought over to the other side
of<00:05:51.070> the<00:05:51.220> plant<00:05:51.460> which<00:05:51.730> begins<00:05:52.180> to<00:05:52.270> remove<00:05:52.480> the

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
of the plant which begins to remove the

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.060 
of the plant which begins to remove the
shell<00:05:52.780> they're<00:05:52.930> actually<00:05:53.200> the<00:05:53.320> same<00:05:53.620> machines

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
shell they're actually the same machines

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.200 
shell they're actually the same machines
and<00:05:54.340> we<00:05:54.850> tuned<00:05:55.180> these<00:05:55.450> machines<00:05:55.900> to<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:57.490> exact

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
and we tuned these machines to the exact

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.750 
and we tuned these machines to the exact
a<00:05:58.390> variety<00:05:58.930> of<00:05:58.960> ammon<00:05:59.590> and<00:06:00.010> we<00:06:00.160> there's<00:06:00.580> those

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
a variety of ammon and we there's those

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.910 
a variety of ammon and we there's those
little<00:06:01.060> shiny<00:06:01.870> handles<00:06:02.290> there<00:06:02.440> you<00:06:02.590> can<00:06:02.710> see

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:02.920 
little shiny handles there you can see

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.680 
little shiny handles there you can see
we<00:06:03.100> can<00:06:03.460> tighten<00:06:03.850> them<00:06:03.940> up<00:06:04.060> make<00:06:04.270> it<00:06:04.300> even<00:06:04.630> a

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
we can tighten them up make it even a

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.090 
we can tighten them up make it even a
little<00:06:04.870> closer<00:06:05.170> each<00:06:05.500> one<00:06:05.710> gets<00:06:05.860> a<00:06:05.950> little

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
little closer each one gets a little

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.550 
little closer each one gets a little
tighter<00:06:06.460> and<00:06:06.640> tighter<00:06:06.790> until<00:06:07.090> the<00:06:07.990> nut<00:06:08.290> is

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
tighter and tighter until the nut is

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.830 
tighter and tighter until the nut is
just<00:06:09.520> the<00:06:09.640> only<00:06:09.790> thing<00:06:09.940> remaining<00:06:10.450> we<00:06:10.660> don't

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
just the only thing remaining we don't

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.540 
just the only thing remaining we don't
want<00:06:11.020> to<00:06:11.140> damage<00:06:11.470> the<00:06:11.680> net<00:06:11.950> so<00:06:12.070> that's<00:06:12.220> why<00:06:12.370> we

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
want to damage the net so that's why we

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.700 
want to damage the net so that's why we
only<00:06:13.150> have<00:06:13.480> just<00:06:13.510> a<00:06:13.780> little<00:06:13.990> bit<00:06:14.110> tightened

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
only have just a little bit tightened

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.910 
only have just a little bit tightened
each<00:06:14.890> time<00:06:15.630> over<00:06:16.630> here<00:06:16.690> you<00:06:16.840> can<00:06:16.960> see<00:06:17.140> that<00:06:17.410> a

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
each time over here you can see that a

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.140 
each time over here you can see that a
lot<00:06:18.160> of<00:06:18.190> the<00:06:18.340> Amin's<00:06:18.670> are<00:06:18.760> starting<00:06:19.000> to<00:06:19.090> be

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
lot of the Amin's are starting to be

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.730 
lot of the Amin's are starting to be
really<00:06:19.420> clean<00:06:19.600> there's<00:06:19.810> a<00:06:19.870> kernel<00:06:20.200> in<00:06:20.500> there

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
really clean there's a kernel in there

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.470 
really clean there's a kernel in there
there's<00:06:21.220> still<00:06:21.400> a<00:06:21.430> little<00:06:21.610> bit<00:06:21.730> of<00:06:21.820> a<00:06:21.910> halt<00:06:22.180> in

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:22.480 
there's still a little bit of a halt in

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.230 
there's still a little bit of a halt in
there<00:06:22.720> and<00:06:23.010> the<00:06:24.010> hole<00:06:24.280> actually<00:06:24.760> is<00:06:24.820> in<00:06:24.940> total

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
there and the hole actually is in total

there and the hole actually is in total
trash<00:06:25.450> a<00:06:25.480> lot<00:06:25.930> of<00:06:26.110> that<00:06:26.260> goes<00:06:26.680> to<00:06:26.980> dairies<00:06:27.760> and

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
trash a lot of that goes to dairies and

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.580 
trash a lot of that goes to dairies and
they<00:06:27.970> use<00:06:28.120> it<00:06:28.300> in<00:06:28.450> the<00:06:28.720> cattle<00:06:29.050> feed<00:06:29.260> for<00:06:29.500> the

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
they use it in the cattle feed for the

they use it in the cattle feed for the
nutrients<00:06:30.150> finally<00:06:31.150> have<00:06:31.300> to<00:06:31.420> go<00:06:31.510> through
