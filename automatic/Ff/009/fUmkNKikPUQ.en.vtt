hey<00:00:02.159> guys<00:00:02.399> chrisfix<00:00:02.939> here<00:00:03.179> and<00:00:03.570> this<00:00:03.659> video<00:00:03.929> is

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
hey guys chrisfix here and this video is

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.360 
hey guys chrisfix here and this video is
going<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.200> be<00:00:04.290> a<00:00:04.350> start<00:00:04.740> of<00:00:04.920> something<00:00:05.130> that

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
going to be a start of something that

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.059 
going to be a start of something that
has<00:00:05.520> never<00:00:05.759> been<00:00:06.000> done<00:00:06.270> on<00:00:06.540> youtube<00:00:07.080> before<00:00:07.259> so

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
has never been done on youtube before so

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.950 
has never been done on youtube before so
you<00:00:08.160> saw<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.429> clean<00:00:08.790> boost<00:00:08.970> max<00:00:09.269> test<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:09.780> did

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
you saw the clean boost max test I did

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.020 
you saw the clean boost max test I did
with<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.200> Honda<00:00:10.380> Civic<00:00:10.679> Si<00:00:11.130> on<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.519> dyno<00:00:11.759> and

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
with the Honda Civic Si on the dyno and

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.459 
with the Honda Civic Si on the dyno and
that<00:00:12.300> was<00:00:12.420> testing<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.900> claims<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.349> the

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
that was testing the claims that the

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.440 
that was testing the claims that the
clean<00:00:13.679> boost<00:00:13.860> max<00:00:14.160> creates<00:00:14.670> horsepower<00:00:15.179> in

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
clean boost max creates horsepower in

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.960 
clean boost max creates horsepower in
that<00:00:15.870> test<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.350> did<00:00:16.500> see<00:00:16.800> an<00:00:16.980> increase<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.550> up

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
that test we did see an increase of up

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.269 
that test we did see an increase of up
to<00:00:18.029> 11<00:00:18.420> horsepower<00:00:18.900> which<00:00:19.380> was<00:00:19.560> surprising

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
to 11 horsepower which was surprising

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.189 
to 11 horsepower which was surprising
now<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.699> was<00:00:20.880> done<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.119> one<00:00:21.480> car<00:00:21.720> with<00:00:21.960> six

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
now that was done on one car with six

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.019 
now that was done on one car with six
dyno<00:00:22.439> runs<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:23.039> wish<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.369> had<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.550> money<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.880> do

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
dyno runs I wish I had the money to do

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.880 
dyno runs I wish I had the money to do
the<00:00:24.150> tests<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.539> more<00:00:24.779> cars<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.710> it's

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
the tests on more cars but it's

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.980 
the tests on more cars but it's
expensive<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.789> other<00:00:26.939> thing<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.390> those

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
expensive the other thing is those

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.109 
expensive the other thing is those
results<00:00:28.470> were<00:00:28.590> great<00:00:28.920> but<00:00:29.519> not<00:00:29.730> many<00:00:29.910> people

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
results were great but not many people

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.089 
results were great but not many people
could<00:00:30.449> really<00:00:30.630> use<00:00:30.960> 10<00:00:31.260> horsepower<00:00:31.560> that's

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
could really use 10 horsepower that's

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.010 
could really use 10 horsepower that's
not<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> big<00:00:32.730> deal<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:32.969> them<00:00:33.270> unless<00:00:33.870> if

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
not like a big deal for them unless if

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.750 
not like a big deal for them unless if
you're<00:00:34.140> racing<00:00:34.350> your<00:00:34.620> car<00:00:34.860> 10<00:00:35.430> horsepower

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
you're racing your car 10 horsepower

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.760 
you're racing your car 10 horsepower
can't<00:00:36.180> really<00:00:36.420> be<00:00:36.540> felt<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:37.320> more<00:00:37.559> for

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
can't really be felt it's more for

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.510 
can't really be felt it's more for
bragging<00:00:38.129> rights

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
bragging rights

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.819 
bragging rights
but<00:00:38.969> what<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.360> useful<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.079> an<00:00:40.260> increase<00:00:40.680> in

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
but what is useful is an increase in

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.229 
but what is useful is an increase in
fuel<00:00:41.070> economy<00:00:41.280> because<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.180> to

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
fuel economy because that is going to

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.030 
fuel economy because that is going to
save<00:00:42.450> us<00:00:42.629> money<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.230> then<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.739> could<00:00:43.890> also

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
save us money and then if we could also

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.250 
save us money and then if we could also
get<00:00:44.280> an<00:00:44.430> increase<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.879> horsepower<00:00:45.059> as<00:00:45.660> well<00:00:46.079> as

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
get an increase in horsepower as well as

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.680 
get an increase in horsepower as well as
fuel<00:00:46.469> economy<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:47.430> can't<00:00:47.640> beat<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.510> what

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
fuel economy you can't beat that so what

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.000 
fuel economy you can't beat that so what
we're<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.469> we're<00:00:49.680> going<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> test

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
we're going to do is we're going to test

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.680 
we're going to do is we're going to test
the<00:00:50.219> claims<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.000> clean<00:00:51.239> boost<00:00:51.420> max

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the claims that the clean boost max

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.229 
the claims that the clean boost max
additive<00:00:52.170> increases<00:00:52.980> fuel<00:00:53.250> economy<00:00:53.430> let<00:00:54.149> me

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
additive increases fuel economy let me

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.090 
additive increases fuel economy let me
start<00:00:54.480> by<00:00:54.539> saying<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:55.170> will<00:00:55.469> not<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.739> answering

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
start by saying I will not be answering

suggestions on how to go about doing
this<00:01:09.090> fuel<00:01:09.330> economy<00:01:09.510> test

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
this fuel economy test

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.440 
this fuel economy test
so<00:01:10.770> with<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.040> said<00:01:11.340> let's<00:01:11.820> move<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
so with that said let's move on to the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.750 
so with that said let's move on to the
test<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> test<00:01:14.189> there's<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> be

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
test so for the test there's going to be

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.510 
test so for the test there's going to be
two<00:01:15.030> main<00:01:15.360> parts<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.350> first<00:01:16.380> part<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:17.009> me

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
two main parts the first part is me

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.130 
two main parts the first part is me
using<00:01:17.939> my<00:01:18.060> own<00:01:18.270> car<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.570> doing<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> test

cruise<00:01:27.060> control<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.720> could<00:01:27.900> set<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> certain

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
cruise control so I could set a certain

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.679 
cruise control so I could set a certain
speed<00:01:28.740> I'll<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.369> doing<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.700> highway<00:01:30.090> circuit<00:01:30.540> of

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
speed I'll be doing a highway circuit of

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.719 
speed I'll be doing a highway circuit of
at<00:01:30.930> least<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.290> hundred<00:01:31.680> miles<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.520> I'll<00:01:32.610> be

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
at least a hundred miles and I'll be

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.850 
at least a hundred miles and I'll be
going<00:01:33.000> half<00:01:33.210> way<00:01:33.240> south<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.380> other<00:01:34.590> half

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
going half way south and the other half

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.590 
going half way south and the other half
of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.040> circuit<00:01:35.430> I'll<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.790> going<00:01:36.090> back<00:01:36.270> north

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
of the circuit I'll be going back north

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.390 
of the circuit I'll be going back north
this<00:01:37.140> will<00:01:37.290> help<00:01:37.470> prevent<00:01:37.680> wind<00:01:38.070> from

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
this will help prevent wind from

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.730 
this will help prevent wind from
affecting<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> results<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.320> I'll<00:01:40.439> do<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
affecting the results so I'll do the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.740 
affecting the results so I'll do the
test<00:01:40.979> with<00:01:41.250> normal<00:01:41.640> gas<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> average

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
test with normal gas get the average

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.190 
test with normal gas get the average
mile<00:01:43.140> per<00:01:43.350> gallon

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
mile per gallon

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.139 
mile per gallon
I'll<00:01:44.320> use<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.619> clean<00:01:44.860> boost<00:01:45.070> max<00:01:45.399> and<00:01:45.729> do<00:01:46.000> the

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
I'll use the clean boost max and do the

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.330 
I'll use the clean boost max and do the
test<00:01:46.390> again<00:01:46.539> to<00:01:47.289> get<00:01:47.439> an<00:01:47.560> average<00:01:47.770> mile<00:01:48.130> per

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
test again to get an average mile per

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.429 
test again to get an average mile per
gallon<00:01:48.399> and<00:01:48.820> compare<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.479> know<00:01:50.020> there<00:01:50.289> are<00:01:50.409> a

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
gallon and compare I know there are a

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.080 
gallon and compare I know there are a
ton<00:01:50.649> of<00:01:50.680> variables<00:01:51.189> when<00:01:51.369> doing<00:01:51.670> fuel<00:01:51.909> economy

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
ton of variables when doing fuel economy

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.120 
ton of variables when doing fuel economy
tests<00:01:52.689> so<00:01:53.170> I'm<00:01:53.289> going<00:01:53.409> to<00:01:53.439> be<00:01:53.560> doing<00:01:53.829> is<00:01:53.950> as

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
tests so I'm going to be doing is as

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.469 
tests so I'm going to be doing is as
carefully<00:01:54.729> as<00:01:54.820> possible

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479

when you're doing tests like this the
more<00:02:51.040> data<00:02:51.280> points<00:02:51.639> you<00:02:51.700> have<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.359> more

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
more data points you have the more

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.720 
more data points you have the more

are<00:02:54.880> plus<00:02:55.450> we'll<00:02:55.690> have<00:02:55.780> many<00:02:55.959> different<00:02:56.350> types

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
are plus we'll have many different types

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.710 
are plus we'll have many different types
of<00:02:56.650> cars<00:02:56.859> and<00:02:57.160> different<00:02:57.579> driving<00:02:57.940> styles<00:02:58.450> so

of cars and different driving styles so

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.879 
of cars and different driving styles so
we're<00:02:58.840> going<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.019> get<00:02:59.109> some<00:02:59.290> really<00:02:59.440> good<00:02:59.560> data

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
we're going to get some really good data

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.650 
we're going to get some really good data
to<00:03:00.220> see<00:03:00.489> if<00:03:00.579> the<00:03:00.700> additive<00:03:01.150> actually

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
to see if the additive actually

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.680 
to see if the additive actually
increases<00:03:02.170> fuel<00:03:02.410> economy<00:03:02.590> as<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.010> said

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
increases fuel economy as it said

is<00:03:16.440> important<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.400> before<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.880> after

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
is important so that before and after

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.850 
is important so that before and after
results<00:03:18.510> are<00:03:18.600> comparable<00:03:18.960> for<00:03:19.350> example<00:03:19.800> you
