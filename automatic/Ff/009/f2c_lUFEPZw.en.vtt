 5000 on the chain so it's still 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.670
 pleasure for the series of which I 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.290
 will be a small record at the same time for 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.360
 series a lot of things to come we know 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.060

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.280
 that it works well it's against up 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.479
 sicko where i shot or enix slab prod 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.860
 it works very well 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.299
 I have a lot of people who are on 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.010
 my list of expectations that are all 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.479
 agree for the most part I think that 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.220
 I had only one refusal is that at 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.799
 background since he does not like too many matches 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.580
 in Paris I fully understand and for 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.750
 the moment it's all good I have not 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.580
 still asked everyone but for 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.490
 the wager there will be enough stuff 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.080
 nice soon to swarm the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.729
 good but there will be a faq Here 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.440
 many teacher books you not do a 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.000
 faq and bags I made a hedge 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.400
 for a very, very, very long time 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.920
 patient had a thousand subscribers it was for 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.530
 talk a little bit about 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.250
 a little immature I use some 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.580
 general questions 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.319
 why if why that's so I'll put 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.580
 everything in place to be not bad I think 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:17.650
 for and 5000 subscribers I will have to 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:20.050
 to get a webcam soon 720 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.730
 or 1080p so I could stream and the 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.780
 best of the end it would be hd 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.459
 will not be able to do it 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.550
 actually what mountain it may not be 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.290
 badly or with a little gameplay of a 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.019
 little gap is two girls strong at 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.400
 background it could be pretty good too 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.069
 something else to say there may be 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.140
 a contest normally some credit 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.280
 regained on ps3 and xbox here is there 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.200
 may have several winners 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.290
 getting ready for trouble after I'll see if 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.239
 to get you a little bit more finally 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.650
 other things there we'll see the 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.680
 point because I talked about it to let 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.049
 laugh all france the beginning I was with 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.280
 we will continue I would like 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.090
 take the hybrids at cases a lot 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.620
 of people who would be interested 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.140
 by messi shines from a because it's a 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.209
 competitive team c5 corals or 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.680
 means water budget very small 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.120
 competitive convoy so that's it 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.980
 original and a lot of harmonies do you see 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.840
 will have to do again for flanders 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.549
 you I do not know for a moment maybe 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.350
 invest on a small word people 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.900
 currently I have over a million 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.750
 credits on the top left yes credits 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.820
 then still last berry neymar I 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.079
 see there I still have if I mens touch 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.400
 should not be far from the 3 million 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.010
 so here you can see that there is 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.840
 1 0 we put scholarships does not come for 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.750
 the for the final and on a corner I 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.880
 will mark sergio ramos head you 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.280
 hear them I think moment he shouted 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.930
 good nakhoul guulante so that's for 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.049
 the time quite a lot of people told me 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.880
 my housing destiny so it's perfect 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.220
 I saw how I did not say that 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.650
 get a webcam I could do 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.299
 some videos fÃ¨s kamatari 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.560
 team presentations the wager I 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.100
 think to actually make this comment 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.239
 so that's it it could be pretty good 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.530
 so that's all I hope I had 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.209
 says to do 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.920
 I saw a little bit of everything said yeah I 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.989
 think so I did not help wager I 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.799
 talked about the series I talked about the 5000 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.720
 subscribers that it could be pretty good 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.430
 I 'll do maybe a live I'm in 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.790
 thinking maybe during the holidays 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.370
 do 24 hours of live or 12 hours to 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.750
 following I do not know I will see a lot 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.879
 I was proposing yeah it takes a real 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.019
 default 24 hours of live that could 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.419
 to be nice it could be nice 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.919
 I have a site under construction it's a 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.099
 yes bly for the moment it will be free 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.690
 face manage not pay to have it but 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.340
 if I see that it works kid the 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.409
 quality the properties of the signed stream 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.729
 comments there is no bug and if you 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.729

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.349

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.860
 personal it could be not bad here 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.090
 I am quite a lot of other projects I you 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.620
 say no more simply because 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.770
 that I have too many series now and 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.669
 then I do not want to tell them too much 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.659
 people who ask me when is 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.729
 that you attack and that then I wanted 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:56.950
 speak fast does the club can see that 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.380
 I say at 3 euros to the 36th and then good 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.490
 is that my opponent was not playing very 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.840
 quite frankly I'm not going very very 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.820
 well he has a great team as we can 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.860
 see it at the beginning but hey it was not 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.060
 famous camp here it was not famous 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.610
 should not delay afterwards after you 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.159
 will include the end of video pack 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.479
 so for the live I remember jean done 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:18.940
 not all the time but if I do 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.260
 it's more the weekend so surely 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.110
 of course twitter everything is in the 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.930
 description and on my facebook and even 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.590
 even have this time there I hold you I 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.090
 you know about everything but 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.970
 live so here you can see 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.730
 four years 7th 4 to 0 he pulls off 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.590
 and then we go back to the office pack 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.260
 and a premium offer pack so that's 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.700
 easter at 7500 well know very well that 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.020

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.180
 step by step 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.040
 so there is I hope that this little 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.140
 video will have you a little blah with 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.430

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.040
 only attempt ex technique is 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.160
 really very very competitive 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.050
 I wanted to show during scrum so 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.940

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.850
 will have more I leave with the opening of the 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.720
