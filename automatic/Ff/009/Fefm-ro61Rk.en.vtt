and<00:01:53.649> it<00:01:54.039> is<00:01:54.159> a<00:01:54.249> one-hit<00:01:54.759> headshot<00:01:55.299> up<00:01:55.539> close<00:01:55.959> as

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
and it is a one-hit headshot up close as

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.440 
and it is a one-hit headshot up close as
well<00:01:56.709> as<00:01:56.799> a<00:01:56.829> two-hit<00:01:57.399> body<00:01:57.700> shot<00:01:58.060> up<00:01:58.240> close

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
well as a two-hit body shot up close

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.419 
well as a two-hit body shot up close
against<00:01:58.840> armors<00:01:59.259> so<00:01:59.439> it's<00:01:59.799> a<00:01:59.920> very<00:02:00.219> powerful

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
against armors so it's a very powerful

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.090 
against armors so it's a very powerful
useful<00:02:01.240> shotgun<00:02:01.840> that<00:02:02.289> you<00:02:02.439> see<00:02:02.709> used

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
useful shotgun that you see used

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.919 
useful shotgun that you see used
normally<00:02:03.729> on<00:02:03.969> CT<00:02:04.329> side<00:02:04.539> but<00:02:04.689> I've<00:02:04.779> actually

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
normally on CT side but I've actually

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.139 
normally on CT side but I've actually
seen<00:02:05.319> it<00:02:05.409> used<00:02:05.560> on<00:02:05.770> T<00:02:06.039> side<00:02:06.340> before<00:02:06.579> as<00:02:06.909> well

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
seen it used on T side before as well

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.779 
seen it used on T side before as well
the<00:02:08.110> auto<00:02:08.289> shot<00:02:08.619> e<00:02:08.649> is<00:02:08.860> similar<00:02:09.189> to<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.429> Nova

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
the auto shot e is similar to the Nova

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.809 
the auto shot e is similar to the Nova
except<00:02:10.509> that<00:02:10.869> it<00:02:10.989> fires<00:02:11.230> at<00:02:11.439> a<00:02:11.500> much<00:02:11.739> faster

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
except that it fires at a much faster

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.979 
except that it fires at a much faster
firing<00:02:12.819> rate<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.209> it<00:02:13.299> actually<00:02:13.629> does<00:02:13.780> more

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
firing rate and it actually does more

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:14.680 
firing rate and it actually does more
damage

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
damage

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.839 
damage
it<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:15.019> actually<00:02:15.349> fairly<00:02:15.739> useful<00:02:16.220> at<00:02:16.519> closer

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
it is actually fairly useful at closer

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.670 
it is actually fairly useful at closer
distances<00:02:17.000> when<00:02:17.690> trying<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:17.989> quickly<00:02:18.349> destroy

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
distances when trying to quickly destroy

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.039 
distances when trying to quickly destroy
an<00:02:18.799> enemy<00:02:19.190> or<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.400> group<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.150> enemies<00:02:20.569> and<00:02:20.720> you

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
an enemy or a group of enemies and you

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.449 
an enemy or a group of enemies and you
know<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.319> may<00:02:21.470> be<00:02:21.530> more<00:02:21.830> useful<00:02:22.040> against

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
know it may be more useful against

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.649 
know it may be more useful against
multiple<00:02:22.849> opponents<00:02:22.909> than<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.450> other

multiple opponents than the other

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.750 
multiple opponents than the other
shotguns<00:02:24.080> in<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.530> fact<00:02:24.739> that<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.040> fires<00:02:25.340> so

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
shotguns in the fact that it fires so

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.210 
shotguns in the fact that it fires so
quickly<00:02:26.269> it<00:02:26.780> also<00:02:27.049> does<00:02:27.379> not<00:02:27.650> seem<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.069> have<00:02:28.190> a

that<00:02:45.200> this<00:02:45.319> video<00:02:45.620> came<00:02:45.829> out<00:02:45.950> valve<00:02:46.549> has

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
that this video came out valve has

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.089 
that this video came out valve has
reduced<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.360> price<00:02:47.629> of<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.870> weapon<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.290> 2000

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
reduced the price of the weapon to 2000

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.650 
reduced the price of the weapon to 2000
making<00:02:49.489> it<00:02:49.760> still<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.090> most<00:02:50.239> expensive

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
making it still the most expensive

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.770 
making it still the most expensive
shotgun<00:02:51.319> but<00:02:51.829> in<00:02:52.099> a<00:02:52.340> range<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:53.060> be<00:02:53.180> equivalent

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
shotgun but in a range to be equivalent

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.900 
shotgun but in a range to be equivalent
to<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.019> Galil<00:02:54.319> infamous<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.129> scout<00:02:55.430> in<00:02:55.640> terms

to the Galil infamous and scout in terms
of<00:02:56.150> force<00:02:56.510> by<00:02:56.810> weapons<00:02:57.349> so<00:02:57.950> it's<00:02:58.489> like<00:02:58.670> if<00:02:58.849> your

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
of force by weapons so it's like if your

best places to use shotguns you'll see

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:46.239 
best places to use shotguns you'll see
some<00:06:44.780> of<00:06:44.870> the<00:06:44.930> footage<00:06:45.110> of<00:06:45.319> it<00:06:45.469> shotguns<00:06:46.129> are

some of the footage of it shotguns are

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:49.059 
some of the footage of it shotguns are
best<00:06:46.550> used<00:06:47.060> around<00:06:47.509> corners<00:06:48.080> very<00:06:48.409> close<00:06:48.830> up

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:49.069 
best used around corners very close up

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:51.309 
best used around corners very close up
so<00:06:49.550> basically<00:06:49.699> where<00:06:50.180> a<00:06:50.210> terrorist<00:06:50.629> will<00:06:51.139> have

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 
so basically where a terrorist will have

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:53.350 
so basically where a terrorist will have
to<00:06:51.469> turn<00:06:51.650> the<00:06:51.800> corner<00:06:52.039> and<00:06:52.370> also<00:06:52.969> be<00:06:53.330> very

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
to turn the corner and also be very

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.019 
to turn the corner and also be very
close<00:06:53.990> to<00:06:54.169> the<00:06:54.289> corner<00:06:54.620> so<00:06:54.889> hallways<00:06:55.669> so<00:06:55.939> they

00:06:56.019 --> 00:06:56.029 
close to the corner so hallways so they

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:57.279 
close to the corner so hallways so they
can't<00:06:56.180> be<00:06:56.240> like<00:06:56.419> further<00:06:56.689> back<00:06:56.960> when<00:06:57.199> they

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:57.289 
can't be like further back when they

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:59.019 
can't be like further back when they
turn<00:06:57.439> the<00:06:57.469> corner<00:06:57.860> because<00:06:58.400> it<00:06:58.699> is<00:06:58.819> very

00:06:59.019 --> 00:06:59.029 
turn the corner because it is very

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:00.459 
turn the corner because it is very
difficult<00:06:59.479> to<00:06:59.569> take<00:06:59.719> on<00:06:59.870> multiple<00:07:00.050> opponents

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:00.469 
difficult to take on multiple opponents

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:03.369 
difficult to take on multiple opponents
it<00:07:00.889> is<00:07:01.279> also<00:07:01.819> best<00:07:02.120> to<00:07:02.330> have<00:07:02.599> an<00:07:02.719> escape<00:07:02.960> route

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:03.379 
it is also best to have an escape route

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:05.320 
it is also best to have an escape route
when<00:07:03.650> you're<00:07:03.770> using<00:07:04.009> this<00:07:04.249> meaning<00:07:04.849> after<00:07:05.029> you

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330

there<00:07:21.169> are<00:07:21.379> two<00:07:21.680> ways<00:07:21.860> to<00:07:21.889> use<00:07:22.279> them<00:07:22.490> at

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:22.669 
there are two ways to use them at

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:24.610 
there are two ways to use them at
corners<00:07:23.240> peak<00:07:23.840> your<00:07:24.020> opponent<00:07:24.439> when<00:07:24.529> you

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:24.620 
corners peak your opponent when you

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.649 
corners peak your opponent when you
think<00:07:24.919> he's<00:07:25.069> going<00:07:25.310> near<00:07:25.639> to<00:07:25.759> it<00:07:25.909> so<00:07:26.330> that<00:07:26.509> you

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:26.659 
think he's going near to it so that you

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:28.420 
think he's going near to it so that you
can<00:07:26.840> use<00:07:27.050> that<00:07:27.229> corner<00:07:27.590> as<00:07:27.710> cover<00:07:27.979> and<00:07:28.250> you<00:07:28.310> can

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:28.430 
can use that corner as cover and you can

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.830 
can use that corner as cover and you can
wait<00:07:28.610> for<00:07:28.639> the<00:07:28.849> second<00:07:29.180> shot<00:07:29.360> to<00:07:29.479> happen<00:07:29.779> so

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 
wait for the second shot to happen so

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.089 
wait for the second shot to happen so
you<00:07:29.900> can<00:07:29.990> just<00:07:30.080> strafe<00:07:30.319> out<00:07:30.500> shoot<00:07:30.800> straight

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:31.099 
you can just strafe out shoot straight

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:32.379 
you can just strafe out shoot straight
back<00:07:31.310> straight<00:07:31.460> found<00:07:31.759> shoot<00:07:31.969> straight<00:07:32.240> back

back straight found shoot straight back

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:34.839 
back straight found shoot straight back
it's<00:07:32.569> great<00:07:32.719> way<00:07:32.900> to<00:07:32.930> kill<00:07:33.169> people<00:07:33.319> or<00:07:33.849> to

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:34.849 
it's great way to kill people or to

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:36.459 
it's great way to kill people or to
allow<00:07:35.150> your<00:07:35.419> opponent<00:07:35.839> to<00:07:35.900> turn<00:07:36.080> the<00:07:36.229> corner

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:39.229 
and ambush them personally I think it is

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:41.439 
and ambush them personally I think it is
better<00:07:39.439> to<00:07:39.589> peek<00:07:39.919> with<00:07:40.099> shotguns<00:07:40.639> because<00:07:41.210> you

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:41.449 
better to peek with shotguns because you

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:43.600 
better to peek with shotguns because you

different<00:07:43.969> than<00:07:44.120> my<00:07:44.300> beliefs<00:07:44.689> on<00:07:44.839> some<00:07:45.110> of<00:07:45.199> the

00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:45.259 
different than my beliefs on some of the
