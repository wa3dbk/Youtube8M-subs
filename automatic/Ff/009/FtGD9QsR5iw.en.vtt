00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.610
 com.mx glad to greet you we are going to 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.050
 talk about the Realmadrid punctually 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.790
 I would like much more to delve into the matter 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.170
 Atletico Madrid but I'm going to stay 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.300
 with Real Madrid after being 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.210
 let's say the macabre weekend in 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.880
 where they lose 44 by zero we have a 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.610
 ease of it really seems absurd to me 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.250
 ease of mentioning crisis before 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.140
 any let's say stumble of some 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.360
 important equipment of course I do not know 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.739
 can ignore a four by zero before the 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.510
 rival of the city â€‹â€‹against an opponent 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.930
 punctually that he has already taken the 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.000
 measure 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.830
 you have to applaud much more the the 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.750
 very great capacity of the atletico madrid 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.489
 to in this type of instances that maybe 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.769
 the miseries of real madrid and then 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.989
 I saw spiced by this let's say this 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.239
 Uncomfortable party of Christian Ronaldo with 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.030
 his 30 years and singers and others 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.949
 questions there are 12 aspects that 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.970
 they believe that the high sportsman 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.460
 performance has to be 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.350
 behaving according to how he wins 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.790
 or if he loses and those who believe that the 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.979
 high performance athlete in 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.560
 any discipline has the right to be 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.390
 in your free time what is best for you 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.760
 but when I want to talk about 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.680
 Madrid 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.050
 it's not to whip the upside down is for 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.690
 recognize the maturity of 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.810
 team already fully recognized their 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.720
 guilt did not point to the referee or the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.190
 rival or that kicked them or that 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.450
 the position of his coach ancelotti 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.750
 it was wrong or not 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.090
 they simply said 'mea culpa' he assumed 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.130
 your responsibility and do not have the least 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.170
 doubt that Madrid will continue to be 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.420
 as powerful as honorable as he has 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.880
 been from the management of carlo ancelotti 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.979
 his own just brutal I insist that 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.630
 does not show a template in the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.270
 sports aspect I insist the subject of 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.820
 the party of ronaldo after 4 for 0 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.710
 lost I'm not even going to get talked 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.180
 of a really immature team 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.729
 intelligent sensible not 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.410
 responsible outside his headquarters of his 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.970
 dressing when you have to take 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.370
 responsibility to remove the face and say 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.990
 I was wrong what we did wrong our 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.970
 some fine and other issues good the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.700
 madrid has just given us or really a 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.400
 Chair of how self-manages a 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.870
 dressing room of the real manufactory 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.580
 madrid because it 's very easy to be in 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.080
 decisions and medians and that 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.430
 averagely walk you have to auto 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.650
