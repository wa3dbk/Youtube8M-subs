really good and you don't have to plug
it<00:00:05.930> into<00:00:06.109> an<00:00:06.410> electrical<00:00:07.040> outlet<00:00:07.189> to<00:00:07.580> make<00:00:07.729> it

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
it into an electrical outlet to make it

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.620 
it into an electrical outlet to make it
work<00:00:08.090> either

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:08.630 
work either

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.129

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
no it's not my Titebond 3 glue although

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.470 
no it's not my Titebond 3 glue although
that's<00:00:12.320> pretty<00:00:12.679> good<00:00:12.860> stuff<00:00:13.160> -<00:00:13.429> it's<00:00:14.179> this

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.930 

this<00:00:18.380> is<00:00:18.560> the<00:00:18.680> very<00:00:18.950> last<00:00:19.250> piece<00:00:19.550> from<00:00:19.850> that

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
this is the very last piece from that

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.240 
this is the very last piece from that
Manitoba<00:00:20.900> maple<00:00:21.080> tree<00:00:21.530> branch<00:00:21.830> that<00:00:21.950> had

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
Manitoba maple tree branch that had

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.220 
Manitoba maple tree branch that had
broken<00:00:22.430> off<00:00:22.790> my<00:00:23.000> neighbor's<00:00:23.420> tree<00:00:23.690> last<00:00:23.960> fall

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
broken off my neighbor's tree last fall

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.050 
broken off my neighbor's tree last fall
now<00:00:27.230> I<00:00:27.260> sliced<00:00:27.740> off<00:00:27.980> nine<00:00:28.279> I<00:00:28.580> think<00:00:28.670> some

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
now I sliced off nine I think some

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.720 
now I sliced off nine I think some
people<00:00:29.180> call<00:00:29.600> them<00:00:29.750> log<00:00:30.200> cookies<00:00:30.710> off<00:00:30.950> this

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
people call them log cookies off this

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.470 
people call them log cookies off this
piece<00:00:32.000> of<00:00:32.180> wood<00:00:32.360> and<00:00:33.670> they<00:00:34.670> were<00:00:34.730> still<00:00:35.090> really

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
piece of wood and they were still really

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.240 
piece of wood and they were still really
green<00:00:35.750> even<00:00:36.020> though<00:00:36.320> that<00:00:36.680> piece<00:00:37.010> had<00:00:37.220> been

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
green even though that piece had been

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.979 
green even though that piece had been
sitting<00:00:37.700> in<00:00:37.760> my<00:00:37.820> workshop<00:00:38.390> over<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.809> winter

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
so okay you can see the log cookie

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.790 
so okay you can see the log cookie
soaking<00:00:44.270> in<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:44.480> pentacle<00:00:45.020> solution<00:00:45.590> there

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
soaking in the pentacle solution there

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.330 
soaking in the pentacle solution there
in<00:00:46.040> ice<00:00:46.220> cream<00:00:46.430> pails<00:00:46.790> and<00:00:47.829> when<00:00:48.829> I<00:00:48.860> poured<00:00:49.250> it

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
in ice cream pails and when I poured it

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.420 
in ice cream pails and when I poured it
all<00:00:49.520> back<00:00:49.820> I<00:00:50.180> only<00:00:50.510> got<00:00:50.989> back<00:00:51.290> two<00:00:51.829> containers

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
all back I only got back two containers

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.470 
all back I only got back two containers
of<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:53.540> solution<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:54.890> those<00:00:55.160> pieces<00:00:56.000> of<00:00:56.300> wood

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
of the solution so those pieces of wood

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.010 
of the solution so those pieces of wood
had<00:00:56.870> absorbed<00:00:57.410> one<00:00:58.160> whole<00:00:58.489> container<00:00:59.000> about<00:00:59.780> a

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
had absorbed one whole container about a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.869 
had absorbed one whole container about a
quart<00:01:00.380> or<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:01.309> leader<00:01:01.700> of<00:01:01.970> your<00:01:02.090> canadian

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
quart or a leader of your canadian

quart or a leader of your canadian
when<00:01:04.570> I<00:01:04.600> started<00:01:05.080> to<00:01:05.229> drain<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.680> cookies<00:01:06.040> I

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
when I started to drain the cookies I

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.100 
when I started to drain the cookies I
was<00:01:06.670> surprised<00:01:07.090> at<00:01:07.299> how<00:01:07.330> little<00:01:07.689> of<00:01:07.960> the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
was surprised at how little of the

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.370 
was surprised at how little of the
solution<00:01:08.650> came<00:01:08.920> back<00:01:09.130> out<00:01:09.369> of<00:01:09.400> them<00:01:10.380> you

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
solution came back out of them you

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.740 
solution came back out of them you
remember<00:01:11.830> that<00:01:11.950> I<00:01:12.070> said<00:01:12.100> I<00:01:12.340> sliced<00:01:12.820> off<00:01:13.060> 9<00:01:13.390> log

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
remember that I said I sliced off 9 log

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.859 
remember that I said I sliced off 9 log
cookies<00:01:14.200> well<00:01:14.979> I<00:01:15.250> did<00:01:15.670> but<00:01:15.909> I<00:01:15.970> only<00:01:16.210> treated<00:01:16.720> 8

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
cookies well I did but I only treated 8

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.440 
cookies well I did but I only treated 8
of<00:01:17.049> them<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:17.350> one<00:01:18.070> I<00:01:18.100> just<00:01:18.490> left<00:01:18.700> natural<00:01:19.240> just

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
of them and one I just left natural just

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.499 
of them and one I just left natural just
to<00:01:19.540> see<00:01:19.810> what<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.110> difference<00:01:20.470> would<00:01:20.619> be<00:01:21.509> now

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
to see what the difference would be now

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.020 
to see what the difference would be now
after<00:01:22.899> about<00:01:23.080> 24<00:01:23.680> hours<00:01:23.860> this<00:01:24.340> one<00:01:24.549> piece<00:01:24.820> it

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
after about 24 hours this one piece it

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.810 
after about 24 hours this one piece it
was<00:01:25.240> not<00:01:25.600> treated<00:01:26.259> with<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.530> pentacle<00:01:27.070> began

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
was not treated with the pentacle began

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.420 
was not treated with the pentacle began
to<00:01:28.000> crack<00:01:28.299> and<00:01:28.600> after<00:01:29.470> about<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.770> week<00:01:29.860> the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
to crack and after about a week the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.100 
to crack and after about a week the
crack<00:01:30.729> was<00:01:30.940> about<00:01:31.240> as<00:01:31.390> big<00:01:31.570> as<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.930> way<00:01:32.049> you

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
crack was about as big as the way you

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.180 
crack was about as big as the way you
see<00:01:32.409> it<00:01:32.500> here<00:01:32.740> now<00:01:34.140> I've<00:01:35.140> been<00:01:35.409> using<00:01:35.619> my<00:01:35.920> car

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
see it here now I've been using my car

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.969 
see it here now I've been using my car
dashboard<00:01:36.880> as<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.119> kiln<00:01:37.539> to<00:01:37.750> force<00:01:38.440> dry<00:01:38.710> these

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
dashboard as a kiln to force dry these

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.590 
dashboard as a kiln to force dry these
things<00:01:39.280> so<00:01:39.520> that<00:01:39.670> I<00:01:39.789> can<00:01:39.970> use<00:01:40.179> them<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.420> little

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
things so that I can use them a little

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.200 
things so that I can use them a little
bit<00:01:40.869> earlier<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:42.310> one<00:01:42.700> piece<00:01:42.970> that<00:01:43.000> was

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
bit earlier and the one piece that was

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.389 
bit earlier and the one piece that was
not<00:01:43.600> treated<00:01:44.020> with<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.289> Penta<00:01:44.590> grill<00:01:44.860> it's

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
not treated with the Penta grill it's

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.279 
not treated with the Penta grill it's
cracked<00:01:45.909> about<00:01:46.119> as<00:01:46.420> much<00:01:46.659> as<00:01:46.810> it's<00:01:46.990> going<00:01:47.170> to

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
cracked about as much as it's going to

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.440 
cracked about as much as it's going to
crack<00:01:47.530> and<00:01:47.830> the<00:01:48.340> ones<00:01:48.580> that<00:01:48.819> were<00:01:48.970> treated

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
crack and the ones that were treated

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.870 
crack and the ones that were treated
there's<00:01:49.869> no<00:01:50.140> sign<00:01:50.470> of<00:01:50.500> cracking<00:01:51.100> whatsoever

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
there's no sign of cracking whatsoever

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.180 
there's no sign of cracking whatsoever
now<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.539> me<00:01:52.840> that's<00:01:53.050> proof<00:01:53.470> positive<00:01:53.800> that

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
now to me that's proof positive that

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.249 
now to me that's proof positive that
this<00:01:54.580> stuff<00:01:54.880> really<00:01:55.420> works<00:01:56.049> I<00:01:57.750> only<00:01:58.750> have<00:01:59.020> two

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
this stuff really works I only have two

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.109 
this stuff really works I only have two
negative<00:01:59.799> comments<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.429> make<00:02:00.580> about<00:02:00.640> this

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
negative comments to make about this

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.230 
negative comments to make about this
Penta<00:02:01.539> kril<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:03.009> first<00:02:03.250> one<00:02:03.520> is<00:02:03.670> it's<00:02:04.000> a
