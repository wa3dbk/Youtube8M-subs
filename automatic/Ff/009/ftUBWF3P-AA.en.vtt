feel<00:02:29.239> like<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.900> wasn't<00:02:30.470> doing<00:02:30.769> everything<00:02:31.220> I

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
feel like I wasn't doing everything I

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.660 
feel like I wasn't doing everything I
could<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:32.019> get<00:02:33.019> better<00:02:33.319> and<00:02:33.620> train<00:02:33.860> harder<00:02:34.370> and

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
could to get better and train harder and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.089 
could to get better and train harder and
become<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.090> better<00:02:35.209> player<00:02:35.690> but<00:02:36.620> I'd<00:02:36.709> like<00:02:36.890> to

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
become a better player but I'd like to

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.850 
become a better player but I'd like to
think<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.459> I'm<00:02:37.930> wiser<00:02:38.930> this<00:02:39.440> time<00:02:39.680> around

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
think that I'm wiser this time around

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.910 
think that I'm wiser this time around
and<00:02:40.370> I've<00:02:41.090> realized<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:41.959> can<00:02:42.170> be<00:02:42.409> great

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
and I've realized that it can be great

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.610 
and I've realized that it can be great
to<00:02:43.159> give<00:02:43.340> your<00:02:43.640> head<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.180> body<00:02:44.629> a<00:02:44.930> rest<00:02:44.989> after

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
to give your head and body a rest after

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.509 
to give your head and body a rest after
a<00:02:46.220> few<00:02:46.879> months<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.360> very<00:02:47.959> hectic<00:02:48.310> training<00:02:49.310> and

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
a few months of very hectic training and

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.920 
a few months of very hectic training and
competition<00:02:50.290> however<00:02:51.290> with<00:02:51.739> that<00:02:51.769> said<00:02:51.980> my

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
competition however with that said my

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.360 
competition however with that said my
motivation<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.079> get<00:02:54.230> back<00:02:54.470> into<00:02:54.650> training<00:02:55.010> is

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
motivation to get back into training is

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.250 
motivation to get back into training is
almost<00:02:56.269> completely<00:02:57.200> at<00:02:57.620> zero<00:02:58.870> this<00:02:59.870> happens

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
almost completely at zero this happens

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.680 
almost completely at zero this happens
every<00:03:00.530> time<00:03:00.769> I<00:03:01.099> had<00:03:01.370> take<00:03:01.730> some<00:03:01.970> time<00:03:02.239> off<00:03:02.269> for

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
every time I had take some time off for

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.900 
every time I had take some time off for
training<00:03:03.079> and<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.349> find<00:03:03.650> it<00:03:03.829> a<00:03:04.010> real<00:03:04.640> challenge

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
training and I find it a real challenge

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.119 
training and I find it a real challenge
to<00:03:05.180> get<00:03:05.450> back<00:03:06.049> into<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.500> groove<00:03:06.709> of<00:03:07.480> training

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
to get back into the groove of training

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.880 
to get back into the groove of training
the<00:03:10.129> more<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:10.400> practice<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:11.480> more<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:11.780> enjoy<00:03:12.650> the

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
the more I practice the more I enjoy the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.250 
the more I practice the more I enjoy the
sessions<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:13.609> it<00:03:14.510> becomes<00:03:14.810> like<00:03:15.079> an

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
sessions and it becomes like an

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.379 
sessions and it becomes like an
addiction<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:15.739> i<00:03:16.099> need<00:03:16.639> to<00:03:16.669> do<00:03:16.940> it<00:03:17.090> every<00:03:17.209> day

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
addiction that i need to do it every day

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.629 
addiction that i need to do it every day
or<00:03:17.870> else<00:03:18.139> I<00:03:18.319> feel<00:03:18.560> like<00:03:18.799> something's<00:03:19.370> missing

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
or else I feel like something's missing

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.420 
or else I feel like something's missing
but<00:03:20.599> having<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:20.930> time<00:03:21.290> completely<00:03:22.069> away<00:03:22.400> from

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
but having the time completely away from

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.479 
but having the time completely away from
training<00:03:23.030> just<00:03:23.889> clearing<00:03:24.889> it<00:03:24.919> from<00:03:25.160> my<00:03:25.280> head

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
training just clearing it from my head

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.300 
training just clearing it from my head
it<00:03:25.849> feels<00:03:25.910> like<00:03:26.540> a<00:03:26.569> distant<00:03:26.950> thought<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:28.099> come

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
it feels like a distant thought to come

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.629 
it feels like a distant thought to come
back<00:03:28.519> and<00:03:28.730> practice<00:03:29.030> hard<00:03:29.480> every<00:03:29.630> day<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:30.370> did<00:03:31.370> a

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
back and practice hard every day I did a

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.229 
back and practice hard every day I did a
session<00:03:32.269> this<00:03:32.900> morning<00:03:33.549> and<00:03:34.549> it<00:03:34.849> took<00:03:35.000> a<00:03:35.030> good

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
session this morning and it took a good

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.319 
session this morning and it took a good
hour<00:03:35.540> before<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.560> found<00:03:37.160> my<00:03:37.370> groove<00:03:37.430> found<00:03:38.120> my

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
hour before I found my groove found my

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.710 
hour before I found my groove found my
timing<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.200> felt<00:03:40.130> like<00:03:40.639> i<00:03:40.819> was<00:03:41.000> playing<00:03:41.389> all

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
timing and felt like i was playing all

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.819 
timing and felt like i was playing all
right<00:03:41.780> again<00:03:42.590> by<00:03:43.519> that<00:03:43.760> time<00:03:44.120> my<00:03:44.569> hips<00:03:45.500> my

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
right again by that time my hips my

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:52.030 
right again by that time my hips my
groins<00:03:46.489> and<00:03:47.500> my<00:03:48.500> back<00:03:48.919> were<00:03:49.340> sore<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:50.389> I<00:03:51.230> guess

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
groins and my back were sore and I guess

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.550 
groins and my back were sore and I guess
it's<00:03:52.220> just<00:03:52.280> from<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.810> complete<00:03:54.109> lack<00:03:54.500> of

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
it's just from the complete lack of

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.740 
it's just from the complete lack of
doing<00:03:55.010> any<00:03:55.220> of<00:03:55.310> those<00:03:55.519> movements<00:03:55.910> in<00:03:56.359> normal

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
doing any of those movements in normal

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.170 
doing any of those movements in normal
life<00:03:56.959> I<00:03:57.290> mean<00:03:57.560> those<00:03:57.739> movements<00:03:58.180> basically

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
life I mean those movements basically

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.970 
life I mean those movements basically
only<00:03:59.329> happen<00:03:59.840> in<00:03:59.989> table<00:04:00.349> tennis<00:04:00.470> and<00:04:00.859> they're

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
only happen in table tennis and they're

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.000 
only happen in table tennis and they're
very<00:04:01.010> specific<00:04:01.849> to<00:04:02.000> certain<00:04:02.209> areas<00:04:02.510> of<00:04:03.010> the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
very specific to certain areas of the

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.220 
very specific to certain areas of the
body<00:04:04.190> they'll<00:04:05.180> only<00:04:05.329> take<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:05.780> few<00:04:06.049> more

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
body they'll only take a few more

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.680 
body they'll only take a few more
sessions<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.799> get<00:04:07.099> properly<00:04:07.879> back<00:04:08.209> into<00:04:08.569> it

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
sessions to get properly back into it

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.039 
sessions to get properly back into it
but<00:04:08.989> it's<00:04:09.769> hard<00:04:10.069> work<00:04:10.340> and<00:04:10.840> not<00:04:11.840> very

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
but it's hard work and not very

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.610 
but it's hard work and not very
enjoyable<00:04:12.470> why<00:04:12.889> that<00:04:13.129> process<00:04:13.579> is<00:04:13.609> happening

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
enjoyable why that process is happening

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.680 
enjoyable why that process is happening
