 who happens people is to make a boxing 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:19.610
 golden team and 5 is a bit but 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.590
 I checked this phone to focus 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.770
 mother I am always me always like the 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.590
 that we go there and this is fine 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.590
 is the club of the apple iphone 5 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.670
 and nothing then let's see what it is that 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.390
 comes 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.390
 in the package 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.870
 he puts more plastic 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.260
 and here we have it 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.380
 this club is physically the same as the 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.380
 original 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.670
 supposedly the seller says no 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.060
 have logos that have logos we're going to see 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.060
 if that is true 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.610
 the phone 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.090
 here 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.310
 this article 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.440
 a battery with a phone 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:02.040
 another phone on battery 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.040
 also the battery 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.330
 I have 2 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.690
 the cables 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.690
 d the usb cable 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.160
 prices are defined 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.380
 the helmets 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.580
 this case will not be the same is the original 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.090
 but there we have the charger two 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.090
 loaders 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.360
 and the adapter 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:42.470
 we have here 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.470
 here 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.130
 here we have the pin stand for the 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.130
 card 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.710
 and I can be this would be all 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.900
 but no 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:02.230
 and none of that 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.230
 it's time to leave 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.640
 and let's see the phone 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.870
 here we have the phone as you can 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.870
 see physically is the same 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.780
 can physically is the same has a lot 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:27.400
 quality has the design is 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:30.310
 incredible the finishes the details 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.180
 from this terminal it is impressive 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.530
 honestly it 's very very very good all 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.599
 this here I have been covered by 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.530
 plastic or does not have 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.530
 this is aluminum 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.130
 this is aluminum is not this is very very 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.130
 well done 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.650
 and we are going to what we want all the world 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.890
 not to see if this has to see how it 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.780
 can you see a sticker there let's see 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.360
 if this chitin below this has 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.440
 then 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.440
 what is it that interests me 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.490
 the wolf 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.700
 there we have it 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.610
 that is, this terminal comes with logo 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.610
 as you can see there 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.220
 amazing 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.220
 let's turn it on 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:40.080
 this you already know it can be changed 

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:40.080
 surely with an activation code 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.280
 but what interests me to see the relationship 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:46.139
 from the screen 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.849
 and it's the manufacturer says that this has 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:53.240
 a screen 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:56.999
 is a Cuba check or hd forgiveness of 960 x 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.879
 540 because something like that is and the truth that 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:01.660
 It has good uses and it is very good 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:04.650
 resolution yes 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.650
 so you can see there 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.110
 it's very very very good is very very very 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:15.360
 good the quad-core processor and a mts 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:18.030
 582 has not been achieved with that 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.970
 and I want to see it 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.720
 the storage memory that is in 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.800
 around the 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:30.580
 I have a gig of ram too 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:33.099
 4 GB of storage and this has 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.020
 you have to talk about that it's all through 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.150
 a museum have seen a tutorial that 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.139
 you can remove this sometimes you can go 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.499
 inside has a slot to put a 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:46.379
 s of a microsd and this one comes now 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:48.870
 comes with 8 but can be increased up 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:51.389
 32 apart from the four days that come 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.430
 internal ones can now be done wrong 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.409
 but you should do it carefully 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.120
 will see if to a how-to tutorial 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:00.740
 doing it is worth it but this is by far 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.740
 careful because you can charge phone 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.830
 and as you can see there is 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.830
 identical to the original this 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:13.510
 very very fast is very fast 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:16.770
 honestly I liked it very much 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.770
 very much I like it 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.390
 he's fast enough 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.900
 sometimes I do not have an account it seems that 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:32.340
 She bears a shepherd, that is, it must be done 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.139
 install the pastor 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.419
 I already did a tutorial on how 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:39.360
 install it on the other for the version 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:42.720
 basic of this phone and nothing because this 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.190
 it's up to here in what is the voice and if 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.610
 you liked it from the phone in the 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.830
 description of the video you will have this 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.610
