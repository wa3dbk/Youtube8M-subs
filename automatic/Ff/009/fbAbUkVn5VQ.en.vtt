00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.670
 hello girls in the video and what I 'm going to 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.040
 to do is teach my useful morning my 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.990
 morning routine and this has been one of 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.120
 the videos just super super super 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.460
 most loved orders of all the videos 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.440
 and that is because youtube is right now 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.720
 super trendy that the videos of maimona 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.310
 and routing and my life my new team and of me 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.920
 you asked for the night routine but it 's 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.570
 solar and a little bit later and what 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.060
 that I am going to teach you is that since I 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.190
 I get up right in the morning until it 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.230
 raise my baby that is the hours that 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.410
 I have to work 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.989
 more because if I get up at the same time 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.760
 she willing can do anything and I'm going 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.230
 to teach the recorded a little more 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.199
 late because when I get up I 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.550
 literally it is night so no 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.350
 you could get there so I got two 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.570
 last afternoon but it's basically the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.930
 same routine so let's start with 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.930
 the video 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.790
 and this I am on a normal day I 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.090
 I wake up just sound the alarm and I 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.280
 there is a rating on the bed drooling 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.320
 looking at twitter watching the instagram 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.360
 answering some comments looking 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.080
 my mail we go the normal thing that I know 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.080
 we all do 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.020
 after a little while trying 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.500
 convince me that I should continue to sleep 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.760
 it ended up lifting me and leaving me 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.760
 directly to the bathroom 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.640
 upon arriving in the bathroom and before 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.350
 start with any kind of routine what 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.450
 first thing I do is take my hair 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.280
 of the face so they are out and I do not 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.929
 bother what I'm going to do and I 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.329
 noticed that my face is a little bit 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.729
 greasy so I 'm going to wash with my 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.490
 Garnier soap simply with the 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.619
 hands to remove dirt or 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.619
 extra fat that accumulates during the night 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.940
 next I will go with this cream 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.440
 de la roche posay that I like to use for 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.180
 remove makeup from my eyes 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.100
 I always notice if in the morning I have 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.140
 a little makeup I put the 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.140
 cream directly on the eyes and I 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.480
 I rub it very well and then with a cotton 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.130
 wet I pass the cotton on top of 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.370
 eyes to remove all the remains of 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.370
 makeup 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.440
 and finally I'm going to apply my cream 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.770
 moisturizing favorite is the mushroom 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.770
 row 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.330
 and we go with one of the most steps 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.910
 important in the morning that is washing 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.650
 the teeth and I'm going to use my pasta 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.570
 of favorite teeth that always tried 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.090
 buy that is the one of colgate in the 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.370
 normal and I'm going to brush my teeth to 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.530
 fund to make sure that I have all 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.070
 the mouth super fresh and completely 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.070
 clean 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.200
 and now I go directly to the kitchen 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.570
 because I wake up with a lot 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.700
 hungry I'm going to put on my robe and 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.800
 jacket to be at home for 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.690

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.140
 I do is just get to the kitchen is 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.630
 pick up my giant beer glass I know that 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.250
 super big and we're going to fill it whole 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.250
 of water not beer 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.900
 then we go for breakfast and today 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.030
 I'm just going to have toast breakfast because 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.340

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.100

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.530

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.110

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.580
 having breakfast either seize the time 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.580
 and how not to see any YouTube video 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.340
 I shower my hair when I touch the 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.440
 hair at night but just today I do not know 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.000
 why he played me in the morning so 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.200
 I'm going to take a shower and I'll show you all 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.200
 the products that I use 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.670
 one of the most important products of 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.890
 my routine in the shower is the shampoo 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.290
 obviously and the shampoo that I use is the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.010
 Wednesday gration of the brand well and I 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.260
 Leaves the hair hyper soft silky 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.060
 bright beautiful so I love it and 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.090
 The first thing I do is wet myself well 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.400
 hair, put the shampoo on me 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.930
 head and then I take it off and I 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.970
 I put it back a second time 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.229
 you will notice that the second time has 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.229
 a lot more foam 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.110
 let's see the conditioner and I'm going to 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.820
 apply the same line and I like 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.820
 put it from means to ends 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.490
 body gel that I will tell you more about 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.220
 this soap that he had already told us in my 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.440
 another video I love this soap 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.420
 I think it smells great body 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.420
 It makes me feel super super clean 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.510
 it's time to get dressed and start the day 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.670
 finally and what else we are going to take 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.280
 When I'm home, Mayans are 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.170
 basic shirt and a giant jersey 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.850
 because I think it 's super super 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.720
 I bought this one centuries ago 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:27.000
 this triple size x l in the hm and from 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.680
 boy I love it because it 's super big 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.420
 and sometimes I do not like it I want to throw it 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.160
 but in the end I do not keep it because 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.160
 I love it and it's super comfortable 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.380
 for now and until I finish doing 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.900
 my office I'm recording and I'm 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.670
 using my living room as my office like this 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.920
 that I am all day or all hours 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.660
 that I have to work here so what 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.940
 What I do is go to the classroom to take my 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.650
 computer up the blinds so that 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.480

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:59.090

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.320
 here I stay all morning answering
