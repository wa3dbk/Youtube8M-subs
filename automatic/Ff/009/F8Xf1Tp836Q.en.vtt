00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.110
 hello everybody I'm ricardo from blog lp 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.240
 technician 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.120
 in today's video let's talk one 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.869
 About Usb 3.0 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.789
 after all it's worth it or not 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:25.039
 buy devices with usb support 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:28.410
 3.0 and what are the benefits or 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.199
 that these devices can bring to the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.410
 our day-to-day use 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.440
 Good day, first thing you do. 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.840
 need to know what you need to 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.420
 to use usb 3.0 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.600
 are three important points, one of them is 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.809
 a usb port available then a port 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.239
 usb 3.0 it should be here the native in 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.730
 your motherboard or your notebook 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.570
 or else you can buy a pci card 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.539
 express with usb 3.0 ports there is this 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.790
 in the market also the second point you 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.640
 you need dredgers installed for your 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.479
 operating system and the third you 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.630
 need a device that is is the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.780
 usb 3.0 so basically these three 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.560
 drive port points and device 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.689
 what is the main advantage of usb 3.0? 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.220
 the main one is the speed you have a 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.590
 much higher speed 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.420
 you get a usb 2.0 device for 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.790
 example you can not watch a 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.560
 Full HD video with full quality without 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.340
 crash without giving a problem execution 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.040
 from usb 3.0 you can do it without problem 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.220
 some you do not have more problem 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.250
 advantage in transfer it does not arrive 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:51.450
 to be measured at extreme levels it can 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.399
 to become twice usb 2.0 then 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.640
 for transferring files to 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.070
 mediation the advantage is enormous is 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.430
 really big 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.969
 Another point that should be highlighted is 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.770
 issue of conflicts which, according to 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.640
 technology developers there are 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.280
 conflict 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.100
 only compatible one to explode 2.0 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.830
 I can place a 3.0 port as well as a 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.170
 device can be plugged into a 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.350
 door two then all this is the 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.500
 compatibility between technologies 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.530
 mans 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.020
 there are reports out there in the user box 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.040
 have had problems for example with the 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.690
 mouse is that it has a signal receiver without 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.739
 shoot users 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:42.270
 so we wireless him the receiver of it 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:44.640
 port 2.0 was plugged in and not 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.130
 had official way is made of 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.560
 software to deal with everything that 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.890
 it was a possible conflict to happen 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.780
 It happened, I did not do it, it did not work then. 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.440
 this is the only report but this is a 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.660
 random thing and may have several other 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.070
 there causes in the middle may have caused the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.390
 this issue of conflict 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:10.230
 another question also on the a usb port 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.850
 is the energy consumption she needs 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.730
 to make explode run then 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.310
 device 3.0 it consumes much more 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.549
 with two points is then the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.799
 usb 3.0 it has demand more power 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.959
 to this device as soon as you 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.970
 using a notebook 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.459
 the battery has a reason that will last - 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.340
 if you are using devices 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.769
 3.0 this is a consequence of the 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.680
 of the amount of energy that this port 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.680
 is the dispensing by the device in it 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.829
 is connected but in summary then we have 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.380
 more positives than negatives 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.570
 I think it's worth investing 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.450
 the price is still a little high the 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.200
 devices does not have so much 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.420
 Brazilian market despite several years 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.890
 technology but do not have much to offer 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.260
 devices and the price is still a 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.390
 little salty but worth it if you 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.030
 works mainly with the backup of 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.220
 data with transfers or execution of 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:12.319
 media through removable media 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:14.989
 worth investing in 3.0 technology and 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.940
 This was our worth today. 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.370
 If you liked the tips you liked 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.440
 of this video format shares this 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.660
 video on a social network takes a jewel in 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.300
 youtube sign up for our channel to 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.970
 and you can also 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.550
 send suggestions of subjects to be 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.169
 treated here is not worth it then 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.450
 Do you want to suggest a subject to be 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.690
 addressed in the future video send an email 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.910
 to contact bnb tech info point 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.520
 in the subject field there in your email you 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.190
 puts suggestion to the table is worth 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.590
 pen send your email we evaluate 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.680
 suggestions and your suggestion can be 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.240
 be answered is can be commented on a 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.100
 video in the future 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.050
 Many thanks to everyone who watches us. 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.940
 should not follow ibedec in networks 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.940
 social and until the next video
