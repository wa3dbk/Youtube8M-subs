turtle and this is my review on the

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.709 
turtle and this is my review on the
sector<00:00:05.370> 9<00:00:05.720> Jake's<00:00:06.950> bamboo<00:00:07.950> board<00:00:08.599> start<00:00:09.599> off

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
sector 9 Jake's bamboo board start off

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.360 
sector 9 Jake's bamboo board start off
with<00:00:09.900> it's<00:00:10.080> got<00:00:10.290> clear<00:00:10.860> grip<00:00:11.099> tape<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.809> a<00:00:13.370> w

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
with it's got clear grip tape and a w

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.189 
with it's got clear grip tape and a w
concave<00:00:15.830> so<00:00:16.830> basically<00:00:17.430> comes<00:00:18.420> up<00:00:18.690> then<00:00:18.990> down

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
concave so basically comes up then down

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.010 
concave so basically comes up then down
then<00:00:19.260> up<00:00:19.650> then<00:00:19.949> down<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.400> up<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:21.119> concave<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
then up then down and up to concave and

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.040 
then up then down and up to concave and
then<00:00:22.560> three<00:00:23.070> parts<00:00:23.310> or<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.490> comes<00:00:23.609> up<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.779> it

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
then three parts or it comes up so it

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.920 
then three parts or it comes up so it
looks<00:00:25.109> like<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> w<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.130> know<00:00:26.510> not<00:00:27.510> too<00:00:27.660> hard<00:00:27.869> to

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
looks like a w you know not too hard to

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.780 
looks like a w you know not too hard to
understand<00:00:28.609> it's<00:00:29.609> 30<00:00:29.880> 1.75<00:00:30.840> inches<00:00:31.140> long<00:00:31.439> and

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
understand it's 30 1.75 inches long and

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.510 
understand it's 30 1.75 inches long and
8<00:00:32.790> inches<00:00:33.090> wide<00:00:33.800> it's<00:00:34.800> only<00:00:34.920> about<00:00:35.070> 4<00:00:35.370> inches

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
8 inches wide it's only about 4 inches

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.310 
8 inches wide it's only about 4 inches
off<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.820> ground<00:00:36.000> which<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.540> really<00:00:36.870> nice<00:00:37.020> so

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
off the ground which is really nice so

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.840 
off the ground which is really nice so
it's<00:00:38.070> kind<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.250> pretty<00:00:38.399> low<00:00:38.550> center<00:00:38.790> of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
it's kind of pretty low center of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.940 
it's kind of pretty low center of

turn<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.260> bones<00:00:49.500> read<00:00:50.449> bearings<00:00:51.449> I

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
turn I have the bones read bearings I

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.400 
turn I have the bones read bearings I
have<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.270> Randle<00:00:54.270> 180<00:00:54.570> millimeter<00:00:55.020> trucks

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
have the Randle 180 millimeter trucks

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.639 
have the Randle 180 millimeter trucks
with<00:00:55.590> verse<00:00:55.800> kingpin<00:00:56.899> so<00:00:57.899> that's<00:00:58.109> that's

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
with verse kingpin so that's that's

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.560 
with verse kingpin so that's that's
pretty<00:00:58.770> nice<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.820> board<00:01:00.030> itself<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.420> great

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
pretty nice the board itself is great

looking<00:01:08.549> into<00:01:08.780> trying<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.900> longboarding<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
looking into trying out longboarding and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.380 
looking into trying out longboarding and
you<00:01:10.770> want<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.040> figure<00:01:11.220> out<00:01:11.430> what<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.729> really

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
you want to figure out what you really

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.270 
you want to figure out what you really
want<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.720> get<00:01:12.840> into<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.590> whether<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.070> down

want to get into like whether it be down
L<00:01:14.520> or<00:01:14.670> carving<00:01:15.119> or<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.420> free<00:01:15.600> riding<00:01:16.369> um<00:01:17.369> so

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
L or carving or just free riding um so

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:26.030 
L or carving or just free riding um so
yeah<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.860> sport<00:01:23.189> really<00:01:24.119> isn't<00:01:24.799> even<00:01:25.799> though
