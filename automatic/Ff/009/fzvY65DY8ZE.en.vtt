00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.759 
extremely useful it's going to be a way
to<00:00:06.629> program<00:00:07.319> your<00:00:07.770> Motorola<00:00:08.250> DVR<00:00:09.000> remote<00:00:09.780> to

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
program like program it to do everything

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.349 
program like program it to do everything
there's<00:00:23.100> only<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.310> few<00:00:23.430> things<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:24.060> do

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
there's only a few things you can do

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.929 
there's only a few things you can do
that<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.140> capable<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:26.099> being<00:00:26.279> programmed<00:00:26.550> to

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
that it's capable of being programmed to

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.990 
that it's capable of being programmed to
so<00:00:27.570> for<00:00:28.019> instance<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.619> have<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> cable<00:00:29.849> one

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
so for instance I have a cable one

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.510 
so for instance I have a cable one
remote<00:00:30.300> here<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:31.109> works<00:00:31.380> with<00:00:31.560> Comcast<00:00:32.040> it

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
remote here this works with Comcast it

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.380 
remote here this works with Comcast it
works<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.820> whole<00:00:32.940> bunch<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.239> different

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390

works with a whole bunch of different
cable<00:00:33.840> providers<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.590> make<00:00:34.800> sure<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.040> have

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
cable providers just make sure you have

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.610 
cable providers just make sure you have
a<00:00:35.219> Motorola<00:00:35.700> DVR<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.989> will<00:00:37.260> most<00:00:37.530> likely

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
a Motorola DVR and it will most likely

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.299 
a Motorola DVR and it will most likely
work<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.059> usually<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> program<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
work but I usually a program is a a

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.700 
work but I usually a program is a a
through<00:00:41.850> D<00:00:42.059> buttons<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.840> do<00:00:42.989> things<00:00:43.290> because

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
through D buttons to do things because

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.420 
through D buttons to do things because
mine<00:00:44.129> don't<00:00:44.430> do<00:00:44.550> anything<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.480> also<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:47.039> ugly

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
mine don't do anything and also the ugly

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.310 
mine don't do anything and also the ugly
picture<00:00:47.910> picture<00:00:48.270> stuff<00:00:48.480> down<00:00:48.690> here<00:00:48.930> because

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
picture picture stuff down here because

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.619 
picture picture stuff down here because
they<00:00:49.950> don't<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.489> anything<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.879> my<00:00:50.940> DVR<00:00:51.329> either

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
they don't do anything on my DVR either

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.260 
they don't do anything on my DVR either
so<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:53.010> very<00:00:53.129> easy<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.520> do<00:00:53.699> I'll<00:00:53.910> teach<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.239> a
