problem<00:00:07.270> with<00:00:07.509> the<00:00:07.720> UH<00:00:08.759> with<00:00:09.759> the<00:00:09.820> field<00:00:10.330> gauge

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
problem with the UH with the field gauge

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.690 
problem with the UH with the field gauge
like<00:00:12.280> I<00:00:12.309> just<00:00:12.849> feel<00:00:13.650> filled<00:00:14.650> up<00:00:14.830> my<00:00:14.860> gas<00:00:15.429> tank

and it was you can tell right here
the<00:00:19.600> fuel<00:00:19.930> gauge<00:00:20.020> went<00:00:20.560> up<00:00:20.770> to<00:00:21.040> like<00:00:21.850> a<00:00:22.080> 3/4<00:00:23.080> and

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
the fuel gauge went up to like a 3/4 and

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.300 
the fuel gauge went up to like a 3/4 and
it<00:00:24.250> slowly<00:00:24.580> is<00:00:24.850> going<00:00:25.270> down<00:00:25.680> like<00:00:26.680> it<00:00:27.190> will

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
it slowly is going down like it will

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.020 
it slowly is going down like it will
take<00:00:27.550> it<00:00:27.760> like<00:00:27.970> dream<00:00:28.410> not<00:00:29.410> like<00:00:29.700> 15<00:00:30.700> minutes

and he'll eventually we'll get down to
the<00:00:33.220> empty<00:00:33.790> we'll<00:00:34.570> go<00:00:34.720> from<00:00:34.900> here<00:00:35.320> to<00:00:35.590> like

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
empty symbol will show up beeping like

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.000 
empty symbol will show up beeping like
in<00:01:15.370> it's<00:01:15.880> empty<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.720> I<00:01:17.020> just<00:01:17.290> filled<00:01:17.560> up<00:01:17.830> the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
in it's empty and I just filled up the

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.850 
in it's empty and I just filled up the
tank<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.840> it<00:01:19.930> should<00:01:20.140> be<00:01:20.170> on<00:01:20.470> full<00:01:20.770> right<00:01:21.070> now

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
tank so it should be on full right now

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.289 
tank so it should be on full right now
but<00:01:23.860> uh<00:01:23.890> I<00:01:24.960> don't<00:01:25.960> know<00:01:26.200> why<00:01:26.440> I<00:01:27.000> I'm<00:01:28.000> still

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
but uh I don't know why I I'm still

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:29.969 
but uh I don't know why I I'm still
trying<00:01:28.570> to<00:01:28.630> figure<00:01:28.840> it<00:01:29.020> out<00:01:29.140> what<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:29.590> is

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
trying to figure it out what it is

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.180 
trying to figure it out what it is
I<00:01:30.010> changed<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:31.030> field<00:01:31.330> pump<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:32.650> fuel<00:01:32.830> pump

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
I changed the field pump the fuel pump

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.930 
I changed the field pump the fuel pump
is<00:01:33.340> brand<00:01:33.820> new<00:01:33.970> same<00:01:34.780> with<00:01:35.049> the<00:01:35.229> floater<00:01:35.940> so

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
is brand new same with the floater so

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.630 
is brand new same with the floater so
it's<00:01:37.450> all<00:01:37.720> in<00:01:37.750> one<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.229> floater<00:01:38.860> descend<00:01:39.490> in

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
it's all in one the floater descend in

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.810 
it's all in one the floater descend in
the<00:01:39.790> unit<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:41.619> know<00:01:42.369> it<00:01:42.640> it's<00:01:43.600> brand<00:01:44.049> new

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the unit if you know it it's brand new

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.990 
the unit if you know it it's brand new
so<00:01:45.820> I<00:01:46.890> don't<00:01:47.890> know<00:01:48.010> if<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:48.310> has<00:01:48.490> something<00:01:48.970> to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
so I don't know if that has something to

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.660 
so I don't know if that has something to
do<00:01:49.210> with<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.479> sensors<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:50.520> haven't<00:01:51.520> checked

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
do with the sensors I haven't checked

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.969 
do with the sensors I haven't checked
the<00:01:51.820> sensors<00:01:52.270> but<00:01:52.570> I<00:01:52.630> did<00:01:53.080> check<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.500> sensors

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
the sensors but I did check the sensors

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.289 
the sensors but I did check the sensors
like<00:01:54.340> before<00:01:54.909> I<00:01:55.270> put<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.259> UH<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.610> fuel<00:01:57.909> pump

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
like before I put the UH the fuel pump

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.870 
like before I put the UH the fuel pump
and<00:01:58.540> with<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.110> sending<00:01:59.380> unit<00:01:59.520> and<00:02:00.520> this<00:02:00.670> all

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
and with the sending unit and this all

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.810 
and with the sending unit and this all
the<00:02:01.090> sensors<00:02:01.509> were<00:02:01.630> good<00:02:01.960> so<00:02:02.860> I<00:02:02.890> looked<00:02:03.189> it<00:02:03.549> all

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
the sensors were good so I looked it all

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.679 
the sensors were good so I looked it all
led<00:02:04.150> me<00:02:04.390> to<00:02:04.630> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
led me to the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.400 
led me to the
leave<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:08.649> field<00:02:08.860> pump<00:02:09.130> which<00:02:09.399> I<00:02:09.550> replaced<00:02:10.410> as

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
leave the field pump which I replaced as

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.559 
leave the field pump which I replaced as
you<00:02:11.560> can<00:02:11.739> tell<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:13.150> almost<00:02:13.540> half<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:15.390> then<00:02:16.390> I

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
you can tell it's almost half and then I

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.440 
you can tell it's almost half and then I
just<00:02:16.810> fill<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.260> tank<00:02:17.590> up<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.209> should<00:02:19.420> be

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
just fill the tank up so it should be

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.620 
just fill the tank up so it should be
all<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:19.959> way<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.380> full<00:02:20.739> say<00:02:21.520> like<00:02:21.790> 15<00:02:22.300> minutes

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
all the way to full say like 15 minutes

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.449 
all the way to full say like 15 minutes
of<00:02:22.780> all<00:02:22.900> good<00:02:23.080> or<00:02:23.319> 20<00:02:23.770> minutes<00:02:24.069> I'll<00:02:24.160> get<00:02:24.280> down

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
of all good or 20 minutes I'll get down

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.670 
of all good or 20 minutes I'll get down
to<00:02:24.670> empty<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.209> then<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.750> light<00:02:25.989> will<00:02:26.260> show<00:02:26.500> up

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
to empty and then the light will show up

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.670 
to empty and then the light will show up
if<00:02:27.190> anybody<00:02:27.640> knows<00:02:27.880> how<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.930> fix<00:02:29.230> this

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680
