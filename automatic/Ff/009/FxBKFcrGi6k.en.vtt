 either buy immediately in powder but in powder 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.430
 I have a large dosage of sachets 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.370

 stir the drink thoroughly so that 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.010

 immunity 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.130
 if you want to cook a serving 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:31.520
 less then take half a liter of water and 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.860
 all ingredients two times less to 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.800
 make a large portion you can take two 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.770

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.600
 respectively 2 times my

 friends joke that ready drink 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.930
 especially how can you bottle it up 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.070

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.690
 during sports 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.850
 If you do not have honey or rose hips that 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.550
 instead of one of these ingredients you can 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:05.240
 use raspberry or currant 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.530
 jam if you don't have lemon then you can 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.139
 squeeze orange juice 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:14.660
 but orange juice need to be pressed in 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:16.460
 two times more than lemon one 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.889
 drink can be consumed before 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.080
 exercise to charge the muscles of energy 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:24.050
 to cheer up and boost 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.080
 stamina except the people this drink 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.479
 well beat right after training to 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.699
 restore fluid reserves and give 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:35.090
 body energy and vitamins for 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:37.610
 recovery also this drink can 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.430
 drink in small portions right during 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.669
 workouts instead of water if loads 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.039
 allow to drink if there is a need 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.620
 It is suitable for all sports 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:50.180
 for example many weightlifters and 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.970
 cyclists during long 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.100
 loads drink energy drinks for 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.660
 maintaining strength and energy levels in 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.400
 muscles 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.350
 I myself love to use this composition 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.840
 before strength training 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.100
 and also in the summer when we go with friends 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.620
 on bicycles for a long distance 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.030
 driving 100 kilometers I always 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.030
 take a bottle with this drink 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.610

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.860
 so you can cook it in advance 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:24.889

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.740
