00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
to work with we can get a little bit

be<00:00:50.059> grabbing<00:00:50.300> down<00:00:50.570> here<00:00:50.870> so<00:00:51.079> maybe<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.800> paint

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
be grabbing down here so maybe the paint

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.670

can<00:00:52.280> start<00:00:52.519> to<00:00:52.640> fade<00:00:52.850> right<00:00:53.120> here<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:54.050> also

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
can start to fade right here and also

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.229 
can start to fade right here and also
when<00:00:54.860> you're<00:00:54.949> sitting<00:00:55.339> on<00:00:55.430> this<00:00:55.670> your<00:00:55.970> feet

are always going to be right here for
the<00:00:57.769> most<00:00:57.949> part<00:00:58.220> so<00:00:58.760> maybe<00:00:59.750> a<00:00:59.870> couple<00:01:00.470> really

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
the most part so maybe a couple really

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.250 
the most part so maybe a couple really
bad<00:01:01.040> wear<00:01:01.370> spots<00:01:01.760> where<00:01:02.120> they<00:01:02.300> feet

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
bad wear spots where they feet
