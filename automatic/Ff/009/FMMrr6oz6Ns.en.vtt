on<00:02:16.490> there<00:02:16.640> I'd<00:02:16.760> install<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.330> wheels<00:02:17.540> and

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
on there I'd install the wheels and

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.120 
on there I'd install the wheels and
everything<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.230> just<00:02:18.440> got<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.650> do<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.800> windows

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
everything I just got to do the windows

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.970 
everything I just got to do the windows
but<00:02:19.690> I<00:02:20.690> haven't<00:02:20.900> put<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.410> windows<00:02:21.740> yet

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
but I haven't put in the windows yet

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.130 
but I haven't put in the windows yet
because<00:02:22.460> I'm<00:02:22.820> still<00:02:22.850> deciding<00:02:23.510> if<00:02:23.840> i'm<00:02:23.960> going

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
because I'm still deciding if i'm going

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
because I'm still deciding if i'm going
to<00:02:24.200> put<00:02:24.440> where<00:02:24.590> i'm<00:02:24.680> gonna<00:02:24.830> place<00:02:24.980> my

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
to put where i'm gonna place my

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.650 
to put where i'm gonna place my
batteries<00:02:25.670> but<00:02:25.820> most<00:02:25.970> likely<00:02:26.120> it's<00:02:26.360> going<00:02:26.540> to

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
batteries but most likely it's going to

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.960 
batteries but most likely it's going to
be<00:02:26.780> up<00:02:26.900> on<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.200> ear<00:02:27.440> inside<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.490> fuselage

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
be up on the ear inside the fuselage

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.910 
be up on the ear inside the fuselage
area<00:02:29.390> which<00:02:29.510> i'll<00:02:29.720> show<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:30.050> how<00:02:30.200> ran<00:02:30.680> all<00:02:30.890> the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
area which i'll show you how ran all the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.020 
area which i'll show you how ran all the
wires<00:02:31.250> up<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.700> here<00:02:31.940> with<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.960> specter<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:33.410> a

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
wires up to here with the specter of a

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.590 
wires up to here with the specter of a
r7000<00:02:35.030> receiver<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:37.150> controlling<00:02:38.150> all<00:02:38.420> this

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
r7000 receiver that controlling all this

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.320 
r7000 receiver that controlling all this
stuff<00:02:39.160> planes<00:02:40.160> really<00:02:40.580> light<00:02:40.850> I<00:02:40.880> haven't

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
stuff planes really light I haven't

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.850 
stuff planes really light I haven't
actually<00:02:41.480> waited<00:02:42.020> yet<00:02:42.230> i'm<00:02:42.380> going<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.680> wait

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
actually waited yet i'm going to wait

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.030 
actually waited yet i'm going to wait
before<00:02:43.190> i<00:02:43.430> fly<00:02:43.730> away<00:02:44.180> with<00:02:44.209> my<00:02:44.510> five<00:02:44.810> cell<00:02:45.170> 33

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
before i fly away with my five cell 33

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.620 
before i fly away with my five cell 33
hundreds<00:02:46.580> in<00:02:46.730> there<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.030> did<00:02:47.150> not<00:02:47.240> weigh<00:02:47.450> at<00:02:47.570> a

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
hundreds in there and did not weigh at a

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.230 
hundreds in there and did not weigh at a
game<00:02:47.870> with<00:02:48.050> my<00:02:48.170> 6l<00:02:48.709> 3850<00:02:49.580> batteries<00:02:49.970> in<00:02:50.090> there

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
game with my 6l 3850 batteries in there

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.320 
game with my 6l 3850 batteries in there
so<00:02:50.480> i'll<00:02:51.350> try<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.709> fly<00:02:52.040> both<00:02:52.370> ways<00:02:52.640> out<00:02:52.940> fly<00:02:53.180> up

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
so i'll try to fly both ways out fly up

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330 
so i'll try to fly both ways out fly up

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
the six cells definitely of course there

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.020 
the six cells definitely of course there
will<00:02:57.440> be<00:02:57.530> powered<00:02:57.980> different<00:02:58.580> stare<00:02:58.790> but<00:02:58.970> uh

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030
