00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
got two stacks in there now so two sacks

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.710 
got two stacks in there now so two sacks
in<00:01:41.580> there<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.000> works<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.330> all<00:01:42.450> bright<00:01:42.690> and

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
is going to be the ender barrel this

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.150 
is going to be the ender barrel this
one's<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:46.979> old<00:01:48.200> 1024<00:01:49.200> stacks<00:01:49.619> guys<00:01:49.800> now

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
one's going to old 1024 stacks guys now

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.889 
one's going to old 1024 stacks guys now
you're<00:01:50.310> gonna<00:01:50.399> need<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.789> make<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.420> previous

one that we made the bit the normal

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.070 
one that we made the bit the normal
barrel<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.759> holds<00:01:53.940> 60<00:01:54.179> for<00:01:54.360> sex<00:01:54.569> you<00:01:54.660> need<00:01:54.869> to

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
barrel that holds 60 for sex you need to

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.050 
barrel that holds 60 for sex you need to
ender<00:01:55.380> pearls<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.770> need<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.250> blaze<00:01:56.520> rods<00:01:56.849> and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
ender pearls you need for blaze rods and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.080 
ender pearls you need for blaze rods and
you<00:01:57.330> need<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:58.619> obsidian<00:01:58.950> i<00:01:59.280> do<00:01:59.340> not<00:01:59.700> think<00:01:59.729> this

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
you need to obsidian i do not think this

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.880 
you need to obsidian i do not think this
is<00:02:00.209> overpowered<00:02:00.690> do<00:02:01.200> i<00:02:01.229> think<00:02:01.379> that<00:02:01.709> it<00:02:01.860> is

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
is overpowered do i think that it is

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.300 
is overpowered do i think that it is
unnecessary<00:02:02.479> yes<00:02:03.479> very<00:02:03.989> much<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.289> because<00:02:05.160> i

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
unnecessary yes very much so because i

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.619 
unnecessary yes very much so because i
don't<00:02:05.459> think<00:02:05.610> you're<00:02:05.700> gonna<00:02:05.819> need<00:02:05.940> a<00:02:06.000> thousand

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:06.629 
don't think you're gonna need a thousand

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:09.229 
don't think you're gonna need a thousand
stacks<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:07.110> anything<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.649> Minecraft<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.280> 64

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
stacks of anything in Minecraft but 64

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.360 
stacks of anything in Minecraft but 64
definitely<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.410> can<00:02:10.560> make<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.709> few<00:02:10.950> of

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
definitely and you can make a few of

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.100 
definitely and you can make a few of
those<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.550> those<00:02:11.790> will<00:02:12.000> work<00:02:12.030> out<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.569> this<00:02:12.930> is

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
those and those will work out so this is

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.660 
those and those will work out so this is
kind<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.320> work<00:02:13.470> it's<00:02:13.650> overkill<00:02:13.980> but<00:02:14.310> if<00:02:14.520> you

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
kind of work it's overkill but if you

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.600 
kind of work it's overkill but if you
have<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.180> resources<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.930> do<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.200> why<00:02:16.740> not<00:02:17.190> guys

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
have the resources to do so why not guys

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.590 
have the resources to do so why not guys
you<00:02:17.820> guys<00:02:17.970> can<00:02:18.150> also<00:02:18.300> use

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
you guys can also use

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.270 
you guys can also use
these<00:02:18.720> with<00:02:18.870> hoppers<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.290> stuff<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.130> can

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
these with hoppers and stuff so you can

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.210 
these with hoppers and stuff so you can
set<00:02:20.520> up<00:02:20.700> some<00:02:21.210> some<00:02:21.900> really<00:02:22.650> really<00:02:22.860> really

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
set up some some really really really

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.520 
set up some some really really really
cool<00:02:23.490> redstone<00:02:23.790> things<00:02:24.300> with<00:02:24.510> hoppers<00:02:24.870> yes<00:02:25.380> in

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
cool redstone things with hoppers yes in

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.440 
cool redstone things with hoppers yes in
some<00:02:25.680> really<00:02:26.040> cool<00:02:26.190> things<00:02:26.250> with<00:02:26.580> hoppers<00:02:26.970> so

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
some really cool things with hoppers so

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.510 
some really cool things with hoppers so
that<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.780> have<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.930> mob<00:02:28.470> grinder<00:02:28.710> that<00:02:28.920> will<00:02:29.220> if

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
that you have a mob grinder that will if

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.370 
that you have a mob grinder that will if
say<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.270> on<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.360> server<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:31.080> it's<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.260> your

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
say it's on a server and it's in your

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.160 
say it's on a server and it's in your
spawn<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.980> will<00:02:32.310> literally<00:02:32.670> never<00:02:33.390> fill<00:02:33.990> up

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
spawn it will literally never fill up

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.890 
spawn it will literally never fill up
you<00:02:35.160> do<00:02:35.340> some<00:02:35.490> pretty<00:02:35.760> cool<00:02:35.850> things<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.330> moving

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
you do some pretty cool things so moving

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.360 
you do some pretty cool things so moving
on<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.260> one<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.920> yeah<00:02:38.010> this<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.340> one

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
on to that one so yeah this is the one

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.130 
on to that one so yeah this is the one
that<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.640> can<00:02:38.760> make<00:02:38.850> their<00:02:39.030> then<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.780> final

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
that you can make their then the final

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.340 
that you can make their then the final
one<00:02:40.350> is<00:02:40.710> going<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.070> be<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:42.050> quantum<00:02:43.050> barrel

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
one is going to be the quantum barrel

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.780 
one is going to be the quantum barrel
now<00:02:43.500> that's<00:02:43.680> going<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.890> require<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.550> ender

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
now that's going to require the ender

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.520 
now that's going to require the ender
barrel<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.300> middle<00:02:45.540> here<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.750> thousand<00:02:46.230> 24

and boom it's in there now I'm going to
switch<00:03:07.590> out<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.980> game<00:03:08.220> wood<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.580> i'll<00:03:08.940> show

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
switch out of game wood and i'll show

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.000 
switch out of game wood and i'll show
