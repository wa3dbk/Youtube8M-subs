their balance with the leg turnover but

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.319 
their balance with the leg turnover but
it's<00:00:53.010> important<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.579> work<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:53.940> our<00:00:54.059> arm

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
it's important that we work on our arm

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.389

next jump here you're also gonna notice

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.010 
next jump here you're also gonna notice
that<00:01:05.760> we're<00:01:05.880> working<00:01:06.060> with<00:01:06.240> resistance

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
that we're working with resistance

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.560 
that we're working with resistance
anytime<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.100> use<00:01:08.280> k<00:01:08.520> bands<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.119> jumping

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
anytime that we use k bands and jumping

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
sure that we're building those muscles

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.670 
sure that we're building those muscles
we<00:01:31.590> need<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.860> be<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.100> explosive<00:01:32.820> as<00:01:32.909> we<00:01:33.090> can

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
we need to be as explosive as we can

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.929 
we need to be as explosive as we can
velocity<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.250> ability<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.640> hit<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
velocity and the ability to hit the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.819 
velocity and the ability to hit the
baseball<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.390> long<00:01:36.630> ways<00:01:36.960> all<00:01:37.259> comes<00:01:37.740> with

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
baseball a long ways all comes with

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.710 
baseball a long ways all comes with
