going to be talking about Auto loaders
and<00:00:18.449> gun<00:00:18.900> rumors<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:20.220> will<00:00:20.400> start<00:00:20.699> off<00:00:20.850> by<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
and gun rumors we will start off by the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.380 
and gun rumors we will start off by the
first<00:00:22.230> types<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.859> auto<00:00:23.100> loader<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.939> was<00:00:24.150> used

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
first types of auto loader this was used

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.900 
first types of auto loader this was used
on<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.779> t-64<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.550> called<00:00:26.789> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
on the t-64 and this it is called the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.870 
on the t-64 and this it is called the
carousel<00:00:27.269> auto<00:00:27.779> loader<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.529> now<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.640> reamer

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
carousel auto loader and now a reamer

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.569 
carousel auto loader and now a reamer
isn't<00:00:30.480> an<00:00:30.810> actual<00:00:31.199> individual<00:00:31.920> part<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.399> is

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
isn't an actual individual part it is

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.000 
isn't an actual individual part it is
part<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.480> auto<00:00:33.780> loader<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.500> don't<00:00:34.800> get

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
part of the auto loader so don't get

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.639 
part of the auto loader so don't get
confused<00:00:35.219> now<00:00:36.210> let<00:00:36.480> me<00:00:36.660> start<00:00:36.930> by<00:00:37.260> describing

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
confused now let me start by describing

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.160 
confused now let me start by describing
it<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.340> guys<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.719> bottom<00:00:40.020> as<00:00:40.140> you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
it to you guys and in the bottom as you

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.440 
it to you guys and in the bottom as you
can<00:00:40.260> see<00:00:40.559> there<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.460> carousel<00:00:42.059> which

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
can see there is the carousel which

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.900 
can see there is the carousel which
contains<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.530> ammunition<00:00:44.129> as<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.730> see

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
contains the ammunition as you can see

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.150 
contains the ammunition as you can see
the<00:00:45.120> ammunition<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:46.140> split<00:00:46.440> into<00:00:46.680> two<00:00:46.829> parts

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
the ammunition is split into two parts

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.040 
the ammunition is split into two parts
every<00:00:47.910> round<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.239> split<00:00:48.480> into<00:00:48.629> two<00:00:48.899> and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
every round is split into two and

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.290 
every round is split into two and
basically<00:00:50.039> what<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> auto<00:00:50.579> loader<00:00:50.910> does<00:00:51.120> is

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
basically what the auto loader does is

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.410 
basically what the auto loader does is
it<00:00:51.570> grabs<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.610> projectile<00:00:53.610> puts<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.149> first

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
it grabs the projectile puts it in first

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.869 
it grabs the projectile puts it in first
and<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:54.809> grabs<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.379> propellant<00:00:56.010> behind<00:00:56.699> it

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
and then grabs the propellant behind it

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.299 
and then grabs the propellant behind it
now<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.090> propellant<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.230> Gunpowder<00:00:58.890> or

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
now the propellant is the Gunpowder or

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.930 
now the propellant is the Gunpowder or
what<00:00:59.699> propels<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.859> shell<00:01:01.859> out<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.640> barrel

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
what propels the shell out of the barrel

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.939 
what propels the shell out of the barrel
and<00:01:03.120> basically<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.019> projectile<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.710> for

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
and basically the projectile is for

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.340 
and basically the projectile is for
example<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.489> high-explosive<00:01:06.210> shell<00:01:06.479> now<00:01:07.320> I

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
example the high-explosive shell now I

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.440 
example the high-explosive shell now I
will<00:01:07.770> explain<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.369> how<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.729> auto<00:01:08.970> loader

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
will explain to you how the auto loader

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.510 
will explain to you how the auto loader
works<00:01:09.720> now<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.380> second<00:01:10.740> diagram<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.369> your

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
works now the second diagram to your

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.670 
works now the second diagram to your
right<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:12.000> doesn't<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.140> exact<00:01:13.590> same

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
right it doesn't have the exact same

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.520 
right it doesn't have the exact same
components<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:15.360> left<00:01:15.530> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
components to the one to your left the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.740 
components to the one to your left the
one<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.950> your<00:01:17.100> right<00:01:17.159> has<00:01:17.640> one<00:01:18.509> piece

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
one to your right has one piece

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.630 
one to your right has one piece
ammunition<00:01:19.500> while<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.890> one<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.220> your<00:01:20.400> left

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
ammunition while the one to your left

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.539 
ammunition while the one to your left
has<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.720> ammunition<00:01:21.990> split<00:01:22.680> into<00:01:22.950> two<00:01:23.280> parts

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
has the ammunition split into two parts

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.760 
has the ammunition split into two parts
that's<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.090> basic<00:01:24.420> difference<00:01:24.869> otherwise<00:01:25.470> it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
that's the basic difference otherwise it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.700 
that's the basic difference otherwise it
is<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> same<00:01:26.220> when<00:01:27.180> around<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.930> ejected<00:01:28.500> from

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
is the same when around is ejected from

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.160 
is the same when around is ejected from
the<00:01:28.950> bridge<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.729> carousel<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.630> bottom<00:01:30.930> part

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the bridge the carousel the bottom part

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.460 
the bridge the carousel the bottom part
rotates<00:01:31.860> supplying<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.420> cassette<00:01:33.930> host<00:01:34.200> with

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
rotates supplying the cassette host with

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.950 
rotates supplying the cassette host with
a<00:01:34.500> fresh<00:01:34.829> round<00:01:35.100> now<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> cassette<00:01:36.299> host

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
a fresh round now the cassette host

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.100 
a fresh round now the cassette host
grabs<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.790> projectile<00:01:38.790> first<00:01:39.150> lifts<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.960> up

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
grabs the projectile first lifts it up

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.160 
grabs the projectile first lifts it up
and<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.920> gun<00:01:41.100> rammer<00:01:41.490> pushes<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.299> then<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and the gun rammer pushes it in then the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.010 
and the gun rammer pushes it in then the
cassette<00:01:43.500> host<00:01:43.770> goes<00:01:44.040> down<00:01:44.399> again<00:01:44.810> grabs<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
cassette host goes down again grabs the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.100 
cassette host goes down again grabs the
propellant<00:01:46.560> lifts<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.369> up<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.579> again<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.899> gun

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
propellant lifts it up and again the gun

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.200 
propellant lifts it up and again the gun
rammer<00:01:49.470> pushes<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.220> then<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.970> bridge

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
rammer pushes it in then the bridge

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.990 
rammer pushes it in then the bridge
closes<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.200> gun<00:01:52.439> fires<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.579> cycle

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
closes and the gun fires and the cycle

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.959 
closes and the gun fires and the cycle
starts<00:01:54.119> again<00:01:54.710> now<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.770> go<00:01:56.070> into<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.399> modern

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
starts again now we go into a modern

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.300 
starts again now we go into a modern
type<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.540> auto<00:01:57.990> loader<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.740> basically<00:01:59.189> a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
type of auto loader this is basically a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.539 
type of auto loader this is basically a
giant<00:01:59.700> machine<00:02:00.180> gun<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.310> see

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
giant machine gun and as you can see

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.990 
giant machine gun and as you can see
when<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.180> shell<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.810> ejected<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.680> has<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.549> belt

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
when a shell is ejected it has a belt

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.139 
when a shell is ejected it has a belt
that<00:02:06.210> holds<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.990> rounds<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:08.310> Bell<00:02:08.520> rotates

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
that holds the rounds the Bell rotates

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.930 
that holds the rounds the Bell rotates
to<00:02:09.420> supply<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.440> gun<00:02:10.649> with<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> new<00:02:11.340> round<00:02:11.610> and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
to supply the gun with a new round and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.350 
to supply the gun with a new round and
then<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.390> gun<00:02:12.569> rammer

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
then the gun rammer

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.930 
then the gun rammer
purchases<00:02:13.810> in<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.440> bridge<00:02:14.710> and<00:02:14.980> then<00:02:15.700> the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
purchases in the bridge and then the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.900 
purchases in the bridge and then the
bridge<00:02:16.150> closes<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.170> gun<00:02:17.320> fires<00:02:17.730> then<00:02:18.730> the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
bridge closes and the gun fires then the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.140 
bridge closes and the gun fires then the
cycle<00:02:19.270> is<00:02:19.420> repeated<00:02:19.630> this<00:02:20.440> is<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> very<00:02:21.150> fast

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
cycle is repeated this is a very fast

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.480 
cycle is repeated this is a very fast
type<00:02:22.570> of<00:02:22.900> auto<00:02:23.290> loader<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:24.040> very<00:02:24.310> modern

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
type of auto loader it is very modern

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.090 
type of auto loader it is very modern
but<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.180> does<00:02:25.390> require<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:26.080> larger<00:02:26.590> turret<00:02:26.950> to

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
but it does require a larger turret to

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.780 
but it does require a larger turret to
house<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:28.440> now<00:02:29.440> let's<00:02:29.710> go<00:02:29.860> over<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.280> pros<00:02:30.520> and

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
house it now let's go over the pros and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.880 
house it now let's go over the pros and
cons<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.240> having<00:02:31.810> an<00:02:32.050> auto<00:02:32.230> loader

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
cons of having an auto loader

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.370 
cons of having an auto loader
let's<00:02:33.280> start<00:02:33.550> with<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.880> pros<00:02:34.150> first<00:02:34.840> off<00:02:35.110> it

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
let's start with the pros first off it

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.800 
let's start with the pros first off it
reduces<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.160> size<00:02:36.460> and<00:02:36.850> height<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.600> tank

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
reduces the size and height of the tank

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.380 
reduces the size and height of the tank
because<00:02:38.140> ello<00:02:38.680> there<00:02:38.710> need<00:02:39.220> needs<00:02:39.850> a<00:02:40.000> lot<00:02:40.150> more

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
because ello there need needs a lot more

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.750 
because ello there need needs a lot more
space<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.930> operate<00:02:41.170> them<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.950> outer<00:02:42.250> load<00:02:42.550> it

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
space to operate them and outer load it

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.140 
space to operate them and outer load it
and<00:02:43.020> this<00:02:44.020> reduction<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.800> size<00:02:44.980> also<00:02:45.370> reduces

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
and this reduction in size also reduces

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.610 
and this reduction in size also reduces
the<00:02:46.300> weight<00:02:46.480> because<00:02:46.690> there<00:02:47.080> needs<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.500> be

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
the weight because there needs to be

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.040 
the weight because there needs to be
less<00:02:48.070> armor<00:02:48.459> plating<00:02:48.940> around<00:02:49.240> and<00:02:49.540> this

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
less armor plating around and this

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.680 
less armor plating around and this
reduction<00:02:50.410> of<00:02:50.740> armor<00:02:51.100> plating<00:02:51.640> saves<00:02:52.390> the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
reduction of armor plating saves the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.100 
reduction of armor plating saves the
tank<00:02:52.930> about<00:02:53.260> 10<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.830> 30<00:02:54.130> tons<00:02:54.459> of<00:02:54.700> weight<00:02:55.150> now

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
tank about 10 to 30 tons of weight now

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.699 
tank about 10 to 30 tons of weight now
we<00:02:56.770> go<00:02:57.220> into<00:02:57.400> another<00:02:57.880> Pro<00:02:58.209> which<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.380> loads

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
we go into another Pro which is it loads

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.340 
we go into another Pro which is it loads
more<00:03:00.010> efficiently<00:03:00.610> while<00:03:00.970> driving<00:03:01.360> let's<00:03:02.140> say

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
more efficiently while driving let's say

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.470 
more efficiently while driving let's say
you<00:03:02.410> have<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.680> human<00:03:03.160> loader<00:03:03.400> in<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.940> tank<00:03:04.180> and

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
you have a human loader in the tank and

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.479 
you have a human loader in the tank and
you're<00:03:04.750> going<00:03:05.080> over<00:03:05.530> rough<00:03:05.739> ground<00:03:05.770> at<00:03:06.220> some

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
you're going over rough ground at some

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.390 
you're going over rough ground at some
speed<00:03:06.790> if<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:08.020> tank<00:03:08.230> were<00:03:08.440> still<00:03:08.860> it<00:03:09.070> would<00:03:09.250> be

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
speed if the tank were still it would be

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.420 
speed if the tank were still it would be
very<00:03:09.730> easy<00:03:10.060> for<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:11.350> loader<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.860> load<00:03:11.980> the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
very easy for the loader to load the

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.850 
very easy for the loader to load the
roundin<00:03:12.850> but<00:03:13.120> if<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.720> tank<00:03:13.959> were<00:03:14.140> moving<00:03:14.680> at

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
roundin but if the tank were moving at

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.190 
roundin but if the tank were moving at
the<00:03:15.459> bumps<00:03:15.820> would<00:03:16.030> shake<00:03:16.330> him<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.050> would

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
the bumps would shake him and it would

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.759 
the bumps would shake him and it would
be<00:03:17.440> much<00:03:17.620> tougher<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:18.730> load<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.120> shell<00:03:19.330> in

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
be much tougher to load the shell in

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.009 
be much tougher to load the shell in
another<00:03:20.769> Pro<00:03:21.130> is<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:21.790> is<00:03:22.000> more<00:03:22.450> effective

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
another Pro is that it is more effective

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.360 
another Pro is that it is more effective
with<00:03:23.170> higher<00:03:23.410> caliber<00:03:23.860> shells

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
with higher caliber shells

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.640 
with higher caliber shells
since<00:03:24.880> higher<00:03:25.120> caliber<00:03:25.540> shells<00:03:25.870> weigh<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.410> lot

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
since higher caliber shells weigh a lot

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.720 
since higher caliber shells weigh a lot
more<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.209> after<00:03:28.209> one<00:03:28.450> or<00:03:28.480> two<00:03:28.630> rounds<00:03:29.140> the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
more and after one or two rounds the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.280 
more and after one or two rounds the
human<00:03:30.730> loader<00:03:31.060> would<00:03:31.239> already<00:03:31.390> get<00:03:31.750> tired<00:03:32.019> if

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
human loader would already get tired if

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.160 
human loader would already get tired if
you<00:03:32.950> would<00:03:33.070> manage<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.940> lift<00:03:34.090> them<00:03:34.390> at<00:03:34.600> all<00:03:34.900> and

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
you would manage to lift them at all and

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.759 
you would manage to lift them at all and
therefore<00:03:35.799> an<00:03:36.250> autoloader<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.660> is<00:03:38.290> required

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
therefore an autoloader and is required

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.550 
therefore an autoloader and is required
and<00:03:39.280> this<00:03:40.030> actually<00:03:40.600> increases<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.380> rate<00:03:41.530> of

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
and this actually increases the rate of

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.160 
and this actually increases the rate of
wear<00:03:41.950> of<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.310> gun<00:03:42.489> now<00:03:43.420> let's<00:03:43.750> go<00:03:43.900> into<00:03:44.049> some

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
wear of the gun now let's go into some

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.009 
wear of the gun now let's go into some
cons<00:03:44.620> of<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.130> auto<00:03:45.310> loader<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:45.940> is<00:03:46.450> much<00:03:46.780> more

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
cons of the auto loader it is much more

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.770 
cons of the auto loader it is much more
vulnerable<00:03:47.320> to<00:03:47.680> an<00:03:48.100> ammo<00:03:48.519> rack<00:03:48.910> because<00:03:49.330> all

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
vulnerable to an ammo rack because all

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.400 
vulnerable to an ammo rack because all
the<00:03:50.019> ammo<00:03:50.350> is<00:03:50.530> stored<00:03:50.830> in<00:03:51.040> in<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.670> turret<00:03:52.000> and

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
the ammo is stored in in the turret and

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.710 
the ammo is stored in in the turret and
therefore<00:03:53.410> if<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:54.250> shell<00:03:54.640> hits<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.090> turret<00:03:55.390> the

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
therefore if a shell hits the turret the

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.470 
therefore if a shell hits the turret the
tank<00:03:55.989> will<00:03:56.200> blow<00:03:56.410> up<00:03:56.650> another<00:03:57.430> corner<00:03:57.910> of<00:03:58.060> the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
tank will blow up another corner of the

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.860 
tank will blow up another corner of the

died<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.650> loader<00:04:09.310> could<00:04:09.640> take<00:04:09.850> his<00:04:10.090> place<00:04:10.120> and

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
died the loader could take his place and

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.800 
died the loader could take his place and
drive<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.170> tank<00:04:11.380> to<00:04:11.560> safety<00:04:12.070> and<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:13.660> auto

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
drive the tank to safety and the auto

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.930 
drive the tank to safety and the auto
loader<00:04:14.170> obviously<00:04:14.769> is<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.010> dedicated<00:04:15.640> machine

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
loader obviously is a dedicated machine

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.469 
loader obviously is a dedicated machine
and<00:04:16.419> it<00:04:16.600> can't<00:04:16.900> do<00:04:17.169> this<00:04:17.410> also<00:04:18.060> with<00:04:19.060> lower

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
and it can't do this also with lower

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.719 
and it can't do this also with lower
caliber<00:04:19.989> rounds<00:04:20.500> it<00:04:20.650> has<00:04:20.979> a<00:04:21.010> slower<00:04:21.370> rate<00:04:21.700> of

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
caliber rounds it has a slower rate of

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.440 
caliber rounds it has a slower rate of
fire<00:04:21.940> than<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:23.229> human<00:04:23.740> loader<00:04:23.979> and<00:04:24.450> obviously

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
fire than a human loader and obviously

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.790 
fire than a human loader and obviously
it<00:04:25.780> can<00:04:26.140> break

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
it can break

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.670 
it can break
