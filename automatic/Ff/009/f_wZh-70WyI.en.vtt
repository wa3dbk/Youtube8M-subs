00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
Maybach engine from our tank but it was

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.859 
Maybach engine from our tank but it was
sectioned<00:01:26.920> it<00:01:27.310> was<00:01:27.520> actually<00:01:27.970> cut<00:01:28.240> in<00:01:28.420> half<00:01:28.630> to

be shown off as a teaching aid for
soldiers<00:01:30.909> so<00:01:31.840> we<00:01:32.170> were<00:01:32.320> able<00:01:32.680> to<00:01:32.710> obtain<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:33.159> HL

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
soldiers so we were able to obtain a HL

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.149 
soldiers so we were able to obtain a HL
230<00:01:34.450> engine<00:01:35.049> which<00:01:35.590> we<00:01:35.770> thought<00:01:35.979> was

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
230 engine which we thought was

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.310 
230 engine which we thought was
authentic<00:01:36.759> enough<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.180> put<00:01:37.330> in<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.540> tank<00:01:37.750> but

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
authentic enough to put in the tank but

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.170 
authentic enough to put in the tank but
we<00:01:38.470> didn't<00:01:38.860> have<00:01:39.009> those<00:01:39.220> extra<00:01:39.549> fan<00:01:39.820> drives

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180

of<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.410> original<00:02:17.890> fan<00:02:18.160> drives<00:02:18.489> drawings<00:02:19.209> that

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
of the original fan drives drawings that

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.600 
of the original fan drives drawings that
came<00:02:20.290> from<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.530> German<00:02:20.860> archiving<00:02:21.430> car

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
came from the German archiving car

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.270 
came from the German archiving car

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
blends and I'm no engineer but you only

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.460 
blends and I'm no engineer but you only
have<00:02:24.579> to<00:02:24.700> look<00:02:24.850> at<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.180> to<00:02:25.390> see<00:02:25.690> what<00:02:26.440> a

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
have to look at this to see what a

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.390 
have to look at this to see what a
complex<00:02:27.100> item<00:02:27.790> these<00:02:28.299> fan<00:02:28.630> drives<00:02:29.019> are<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:30.150> it

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
complex item these fan drives are and it

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.270 
complex item these fan drives are and it
this<00:02:31.760> complexity<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.989> had<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.500> be<00:02:33.650> copied

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
this complexity that had to be copied

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.500 
this complexity that had to be copied
and<00:02:34.610> made<00:02:35.420> into<00:02:35.870> usable<00:02:36.709> CAD<00:02:37.459> drawings<00:02:38.180> so

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
and made into usable CAD drawings so

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.240 
and made into usable CAD drawings so
that<00:02:38.689> they<00:02:38.840> could<00:02:38.989> actually<00:02:39.140> be<00:02:39.319> manufactured

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
that they could actually be manufactured

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.339 
that they could actually be manufactured
so<00:02:40.489> there<00:02:40.700> was<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.819> complex<00:02:41.390> process<00:02:41.750> of

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
so there was a complex process of

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.949 
so there was a complex process of
getting<00:02:43.340> this<00:02:43.489> information<00:02:43.700> into<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.450> usable

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
getting this information into a usable

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.979 
getting this information into a usable
format<00:02:45.849> before<00:02:46.849> we<00:02:47.000> actually<00:02:47.150> even<00:02:47.569> built<00:02:47.810> the

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
format before we actually even built the

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.949 
format before we actually even built the
fan<00:02:48.200> dries<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.890> we<00:02:49.819> have<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.269> thank<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.569> prism

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
fan dries and we have to thank the prism

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.390 
fan dries and we have to thank the prism
fund<00:02:51.319> and<00:02:51.700> also<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:53.750> wheeled<00:02:54.019> foundation<00:02:54.920> who

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
fund and also the wheeled foundation who

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.280 
fund and also the wheeled foundation who
use<00:02:55.760> some<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.150> their<00:02:56.269> engineering<00:02:56.720> skills<00:02:57.140> to

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
use some of their engineering skills to

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.710 
use some of their engineering skills to
actually<00:02:57.500> translate<00:02:58.129> this<00:02:58.549> into<00:02:58.849> useable

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
actually translate this into useable

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.020 
actually translate this into useable
drawings<00:03:00.140> for<00:03:00.319> us<00:03:00.379> so<00:03:01.370> we<00:03:01.489> could<00:03:01.609> actually<00:03:01.760> go

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
drawings for us so we could actually go

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.759 
drawings for us so we could actually go
on<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.420> manufacture<00:03:03.170> of<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.440> actual

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
on to the manufacture of the actual

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.869 
on to the manufacture of the actual
items<00:03:05.019> before<00:03:06.019> we<00:03:06.260> fit<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.859> roof<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.280> rising

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
items before we fit the roof and rising

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.360 
items before we fit the roof and rising
to<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.209> hull<00:03:08.389> of<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.540> tiger<00:03:09.049> tank<00:03:09.379> we<00:03:10.159> thought

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
to the hull of the tiger tank we thought

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.770 
to the hull of the tiger tank we thought
we<00:03:10.489> have<00:03:10.639> a<00:03:10.670> closer<00:03:10.970> look<00:03:11.150> at<00:03:11.480> them<00:03:11.629> outside

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
we have a closer look at them outside

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.440 
we have a closer look at them outside
the<00:03:12.290> vehicle<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.489> person<00:03:13.940> who's<00:03:14.060> had<00:03:14.269> to

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
the vehicle and the person who's had to

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.110 
the vehicle and the person who's had to
supervise<00:03:14.989> this<00:03:15.639> remanufacturing<00:03:16.639> project

here<00:03:19.549> at<00:03:19.639> the<00:03:19.700> Museum<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:20.599> we<00:03:20.720> thought<00:03:20.780> it'd<00:03:20.900> be

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
here at the Museum so we thought it'd be

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.449 
here at the Museum so we thought it'd be
a<00:03:20.989> good<00:03:21.109> idea<00:03:21.170> that<00:03:21.439> might<00:03:21.739> takes<00:03:22.069> us<00:03:22.250> through

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
a good idea that might takes us through

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.970 
a good idea that might takes us through
what<00:03:23.000> these<00:03:23.209> fan<00:03:23.540> drives<00:03:23.870> actually<00:03:24.230> do<00:03:24.620> and

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
what these fan drives actually do and

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.530 
what these fan drives actually do and
what<00:03:25.310> their<00:03:25.459> function<00:03:25.909> is<00:03:26.030> in<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.269> vehicle<00:03:28.540> we

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
what their function is in the vehicle we

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.929 
what their function is in the vehicle we
placed<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:30.079> two<00:03:30.590> gearboxes<00:03:30.829> as<00:03:31.489> if<00:03:31.700> they<00:03:31.879> were

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:31.939 
placed it two gearboxes as if they were

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.839 
placed it two gearboxes as if they were
in<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.450> tank<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.109> these<00:03:33.799> two<00:03:34.099> parts<00:03:34.489> in<00:03:34.639> this

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
in the tank so these two parts in this

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.059 
in the tank so these two parts in this
part<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.449> this<00:03:35.569> part<00:03:35.629> here<00:03:36.109> would<00:03:36.650> be<00:03:36.829> bolted

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
part and this part here would be bolted

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.710 
part and this part here would be bolted
to<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.489> inner<00:03:37.639> side<00:03:37.940> of<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.419> engine

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
to the inner side of the engine

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.809 
to the inner side of the engine
compartment<00:03:39.139> so<00:03:39.980> for<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.310> engine<00:03:40.639> which<00:03:40.790> is

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
compartment so for the engine which is

compartment so for the engine which is
starting<00:03:41.269> between<00:03:41.419> these<00:03:41.810> two<00:03:42.079> fun<00:03:42.379> units

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
starting between these two fun units

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.500 
starting between these two fun units
there's<00:03:43.190> a<00:03:43.310> card<00:03:43.639> and<00:03:43.760> drive<00:03:44.000> shaft<00:03:44.329> which

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
there's a card and drive shaft which

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.300 
there's a card and drive shaft which
bolts<00:03:44.870> onto<00:03:45.049> here<00:03:45.290> which<00:03:45.440> falls<00:03:45.709> onto<00:03:46.010> the

start off who's been working on the
tiger<00:05:09.180> is<00:05:09.300> just<00:05:09.540> now<00:05:09.690> introducing<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:11.190> shaft

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
tiger is just now introducing the shaft

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.720 
tiger is just now introducing the shaft
into<00:05:12.600> the<00:05:12.840> house<00:05:13.140> and<00:05:13.500> now<00:05:13.650> it's<00:05:13.680> spline<00:05:14.250> so<00:05:14.610> it

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
into the house and now it's spline so it

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.190 
into the house and now it's spline so it
takes<00:05:14.940> a<00:05:15.060> while<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.300> get<00:05:15.660> it<00:05:15.780> into<00:05:15.960> the<00:05:16.170> right

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
takes a while to get it into the right

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:30.650 
takes a while to get it into the right
position<00:05:28.460> right<00:05:29.460> so<00:05:29.700> we've<00:05:29.850> got<00:05:29.880> the<00:05:30.240> gearbox

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
position right so we've got the gearbox

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.500

now<00:05:31.020> fitted<00:05:31.320> to<00:05:31.590> the<00:05:31.740> Sun<00:05:32.220> units<00:05:32.640> just

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
now fitted to the Sun units just

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.820 
now fitted to the Sun units just
temporally<00:05:34.020> so<00:05:34.230> that<00:05:34.350> we<00:05:34.410> can<00:05:34.530> make<00:05:34.680> sure

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
temporally so that we can make sure

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.910 
temporally so that we can make sure
everything<00:05:35.250> works<00:05:35.430> and<00:05:35.880> is<00:05:36.720> okay<00:05:37.110> as<00:05:37.710> you<00:05:37.860> can
