00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
unfortunately I already unboxed it but

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.359 
unfortunately I already unboxed it but
I'm<00:00:15.780> going<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:15.990> show<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.199> what<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.859> get<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.190> it

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
I'm going to show you what you get in it

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.660 
I'm going to show you what you get in it
and<00:00:17.550> then<00:00:17.850> how<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.080> works<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:20.279> for<00:00:20.460> starters

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
and then how it works so for starters

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.000 
and then how it works so for starters
because<00:00:21.539> we<00:00:21.840> bundle<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.470> first<00:00:22.710> thing<00:00:22.890> that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
because we bundle the first thing that

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.089 
because we bundle the first thing that
you<00:00:23.130> do<00:00:23.279> get<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:24.390> course<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.650> actual

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
you do get of course is the actual

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.609 
you do get of course is the actual
lockable<00:00:26.609> case<00:00:26.849> itself<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.990> does<00:00:28.260> come

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
lockable case itself and it does come

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.160 
lockable case itself and it does come
with<00:00:28.830> an<00:00:29.010> iPad<00:00:29.609> just<00:00:30.330> kidding<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:30.960> not<00:00:31.019> a

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.289 
can use which you attach the case you so
let<00:01:26.770> me<00:01:26.830> just<00:01:26.979> get<00:01:27.100> started<00:01:27.340> with<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.850> case

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
let me just get started with the case

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.070 
let me just get started with the case
real<00:01:29.259> quickly<00:01:29.770> since<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.600> screen<00:01:31.600> protector

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
real quickly since the screen protector

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.350 
real quickly since the screen protector
is<00:01:32.110> pretty<00:01:32.500> self-explanatory<00:01:33.130> how<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.030> put

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
is pretty self-explanatory how you put

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.480 
is pretty self-explanatory how you put
you<00:01:34.630> know<00:01:34.659> that<00:01:35.080> on<00:01:35.259> well<00:01:35.920> this<00:01:36.009> is<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.280> case

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
you know that on well this is the case

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.480 
you know that on well this is the case
if<00:01:36.759> you<00:01:36.850> look<00:01:36.880> at<00:01:37.119> it<00:01:37.210> close<00:01:37.450> up<00:01:38.190> it's<00:01:39.190> nice

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
if you look at it close up it's nice

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.700 
if you look at it close up it's nice
it's<00:01:39.880> really<00:01:39.970> thin<00:01:40.869> when<00:01:41.080> you<00:01:41.170> close<00:01:41.440> it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
it's really thin when you close it

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.430 
it's really thin when you close it
so<00:01:42.220> when<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.399> close<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.789> case<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.840> locks<00:01:44.140> in

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
so when you close the case it locks in

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.380 
so when you close the case it locks in
by<00:01:45.009> itself<00:01:45.340> you<00:01:45.520> don't<00:01:45.700> need<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:45.940> Kensington

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
by itself you don't need the Kensington

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.180 
by itself you don't need the Kensington
lock<00:01:46.570> or<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.080> snaps<00:01:47.380> together<00:01:47.590> I<00:01:47.830> should<00:01:48.039> say

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
lock or it snaps together I should say

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.020 
lock or it snaps together I should say
and<00:01:48.460> it<00:01:48.820> snaps<00:01:49.149> with<00:01:49.930> these<00:01:50.350> little<00:01:50.860> nubs<00:01:51.759> you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
and it snaps with these little nubs you

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.399 
and it snaps with these little nubs you
see<00:01:52.210> that<00:01:52.360> right<00:01:52.990> you<00:01:53.560> know<00:01:53.710> there<00:01:54.159> and<00:01:55.409> there

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
see that right you know there and there

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.899 
see that right you know there and there
and<00:01:56.440> then<00:01:56.800> I've<00:01:56.920> got<00:01:57.069> the<00:01:57.159> same<00:01:57.399> things<00:01:57.729> over

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
and then I've got the same things over

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.680 
and then I've got the same things over
on<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:58.929> side<00:01:59.170> right<00:01:59.530> there<00:01:59.590> and<00:02:00.310> on<00:02:01.030> right

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
on the side right there and on right

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.529 
on the side right there and on right
there<00:02:02.110> and<00:02:02.380> so<00:02:02.979> those<00:02:03.310> lock<00:02:03.700> it<00:02:03.970> and<00:02:04.149> they<00:02:04.300> lock

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
there and so those lock it and they lock

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.930 
there and so those lock it and they lock
it<00:02:04.750> in<00:02:04.929> really<00:02:05.649> nicely<00:02:05.860> like<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.460> case<00:02:06.670> won't

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
it in really nicely like the case won't

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.449 
it in really nicely like the case won't

you<00:02:35.890> know<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:36.130> really<00:02:36.370> easy<00:02:36.579> to<00:02:36.610> carry

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
you know it's really easy to carry

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.819 
you know it's really easy to carry
around<00:02:37.030> doesn't<00:02:37.660> have<00:02:37.780> much<00:02:37.989> weight<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.440> it

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
rolls back and hi it's really so you

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.860 
rolls back and hi it's really so you
know<00:04:48.949> the<00:04:49.310> lock<00:04:49.760> itself<00:04:50.150> doesn't<00:04:50.539> get<00:04:50.660> in<00:04:50.750> any

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
know the lock itself doesn't get in any

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.500 
know the lock itself doesn't get in any
sort<00:04:51.080> of<00:04:51.169> a<00:04:51.260> way<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:51.729> when<00:04:52.729> you<00:04:52.789> rotated<00:04:53.210> is

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
sort of a way and when you rotated is

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.480 
sort of a way and when you rotated is
this<00:04:53.690> anything<00:04:53.990> no<00:04:54.680> it<00:04:54.889> doesn't<00:04:55.160> really<00:04:55.280> get

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
this anything no it doesn't really get

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.529 
this anything no it doesn't really get
in<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.669> way<00:04:55.759> at<00:04:55.849> all<00:04:55.970> so<00:04:56.120> I<00:04:56.180> think<00:04:56.270> it's<00:04:56.509> a

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
in the way at all so I think it's a

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.779 
in the way at all so I think it's a
great<00:04:56.810> stand<00:04:57.139> you<00:04:58.009> know<00:04:58.130> depending<00:04:58.520> on<00:04:58.669> what
