00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.839
 the catwalk is a delicious Italian salad typical of tuscany 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:16.859
 often used a lot in the summer months 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.159
 It is very tasty and facilitates access 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:24.309
 We are going to need poch slices of a bread that is very compact or if we can not 

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:26.119
 use a hard bread 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.269
 500 grams of cherry tomatoes 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.740
 a small cucumber the stalks of celery a red onion 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.640
 100 grams so some black and bone 50 grams of capers 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.560
 a few fresh basil leaves vinegar red wine shalit olive oil and 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.760
 Pepper 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.480
 The first thing we are going to do is cut the bread into slices of approximately 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.250
 a centimeter I'm going to use a very compact rye bread 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.870
 He advised to use a rustic bread and yes not a bread from the previous day so that the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.870
 Mine is a bit compact 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.730
 in a bowl we are going to take a glass of water 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.020
 five tablespoons of olive oil 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.020
 two tablespoons of red wine vinegar 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.890
 and pepper to our liking 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.009
 and stir a little with the help of a spoon of some rods 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.340
 let's put the slices of bread in a tray 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.570
 and we are going to pray them with the mixture that we have just made so that they remain 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.050
 all slices well wet if necessary we can add a little 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.140
 more than water and let it sit for a few minutes 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.630
 and now while the bread is resting we are going to prepare the vegetables we begin 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.290
 removing the ends to the neighbor we fight with the help of a candle vegetables 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.360
 we cut it in half and cut it into sections approximately 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.440
 half centimeter 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.570
 we continue cutting the cherry tomatoes in half that we will know washed 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.970
 previously 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.070
 on the other hand we are going to cut into thin sections the branches of action that 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.610
 It also uses the leaves because they give it a special flavor and texture 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.640
 finally we are going to peel the onion we do not contribute in half and we are going to 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.969
 section feathered cinema 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:15.310
 On the other hand, we are going to chop the capers a little bit. 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:18.819
 basil let's make a roll and we are going to chop them 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:24.529
 let's choose a large salad bowl we were going to add that all 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:26.809
 the vegetables and the legs 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:31.119
 we are going to add a little olive oil vinegar salt and pepper our 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:34.119
 taste and we will remove it very well 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:39.479
 we will choose another salad bowl that is very large and we will place it in the bottom part 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:42.439
 a few slices of soggy bread 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:47.900
 we will put on top a layer of vegetables another of the bread appointments another layer of 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.870
 vegetables and so we will alternate until we finish with all the ingredients 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.579
 and we're going to let it sit like this for an hour so that all are well integrated 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:58.439
 the flavors 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.570
 we will choose a nice serving room to serve is not so familiar 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.699
 We were going to go throwing all the ingredients 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:10.129
 we will crumble the bread a little bit but leaving it in large pieces will be 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.199
 easy because the slices of will be blandi we add points to rita oil 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.199

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.189
