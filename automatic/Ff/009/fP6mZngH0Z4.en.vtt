00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:09.390
 in progress 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:11.900
 If the stage is mentioned after the club's 20th anniversary of this year's club this year, it will be redfish bites again on the stage of j 1 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.900
 Hm 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.420
 So the stadium can be full and everyone can sing 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.420
 It's about creating a cheering song 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:39.360
 This project was written by Mr. Jay Gran who joined 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:44.310
 hardcore Avispa was iced tea supporters from around the time of j Grand sambar elementary school 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:49.030
 I thought what the gaze might eat also debut story in why 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:53.400
 It is r before you play the game . 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.090
 It's because I want to think about making such a Granter telephoto zoom 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.810
 Turn masa 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:03.300
 Well It is also cheering oh well how I Mori was saying all the way from childhood 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:07.530
 I love Abi Spa as much as I thought I would do 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.120
 I think you would like to listen to a Taj hen in the guitar . 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.540
 I do not want to have much 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:17.200
 It is a thing of Ogushi 6 and a phrase is a stadium or 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:22.500
 Recruiting from the end of June on the Avi Spa website 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.500
 If many play heads gather from heavy supporters 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.320
 I want to go 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.830
 everyone's 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:35.660
 It is a support song that is easy to sing 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.660
 It was Sakai, and the theme was that it was a great chorus of singing all together. 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.719
 Jay-Gran 's phrases gathered in early August 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.719
 Later with the players 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.920
 Say in that became a song 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.180
 5 minutes for everyone 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.910
 usually 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.300
 I can sing 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.960
 If you can 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.960
 Such as the temple 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:29.080
 A song in which everyone's feelings are filled while J Grant's hand is added to this selected phrase 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.080
 Finished 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.660
 Songwriting 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:42.370
 I think that everyone's mind is quite one, I felt this time 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.940
 I'm going to eat 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.940
 Worker 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.670
 It is difficult though 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.750
 First place a customer on the selected word 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.670
 From the earthquake to the elderly 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.420
 I received it 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.420

 A little strange story 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.280
 I want to do something 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.870
 Anzai Line and minutes 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.590
 If you ask politics, 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.590
 Cold storage teacher 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:52.579
