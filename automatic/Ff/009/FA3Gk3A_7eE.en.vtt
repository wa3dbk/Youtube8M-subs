00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
cracked it was a good idea that just

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.620 
cracked it was a good idea that just
didn't<00:01:36.750> work<00:01:36.780> okay

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.749 

okay<00:01:40.630> as<00:01:40.899> you<00:01:41.079> can<00:01:41.229> see<00:01:41.469> it<00:01:42.039> was<00:01:42.189> a<00:01:42.219> complete

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
I guess it was a good concept with the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.480 
I guess it was a good concept with the
great<00:01:49.960> going<00:01:50.259> down<00:01:50.409> about<00:01:50.649> 3/4<00:01:51.250> of<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.399> way

great going down about 3/4 of the way
into<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.000> pot<00:01:52.240> no<00:01:52.539> it<00:01:53.079> would<00:01:53.259> have<00:01:53.289> worked

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
into the pot no it would have worked

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.889 
into the pot no it would have worked
wonderful<00:01:54.250> but<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.030> pot<00:01:55.240> just<00:01:55.509> could<00:01:55.780> not

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
wonderful but the pot just could not

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.130 
wonderful but the pot just could not
handle<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.560> heat<00:01:56.969> maybe<00:01:57.969> I<00:01:58.119> got<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.450> too<00:01:58.869> hot

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
handle the heat maybe I got it too hot
