complexion i think will look nice on
darker<00:01:39.980> complexions<00:01:40.520> as<00:01:40.700> well<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:43.130> last

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
darker complexions as well the last

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.850 
darker complexions as well the last
blush<00:01:43.790> color<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.330> I<00:01:44.420> got<00:01:44.659> is<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.920> gotta<00:01:46.729> glow

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
blush color that I got is the gotta glow

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.200 
blush color that I got is the gotta glow
and<00:01:48.860> this<00:01:49.040> is<00:01:49.190> what<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.460> looks<00:01:49.640> like<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.090> it

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
and this is what it looks like and it

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.880 
and this is what it looks like and it
looks<00:01:50.390> kind<00:01:50.600> of<00:01:50.690> scary<00:01:50.840> when<00:01:51.260> you<00:01:51.380> first<00:01:51.650> see

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
looks kind of scary when you first see

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.100 
looks kind of scary when you first see
it<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:52.790> think<00:01:53.409> Coco<00:01:54.409> film<00:01:54.890> compared<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:55.850> to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
it I think Coco film compared it to

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.590 
it I think Coco film compared it to
albatross<00:01:57.110> I<00:01:57.710> think<00:01:58.010> by<00:01:58.159> NARS<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:58.909> what<00:01:59.450> it

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
albatross I think by NARS and what it

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.340 
albatross I think by NARS and what it
does<00:01:59.810> is<00:02:00.110> it<00:02:00.970> looks<00:02:01.970> like<00:02:02.240> that<00:02:02.600> on<00:02:02.780> my<00:02:02.900> finger

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
does is it looks like that on my finger

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.710 
does is it looks like that on my finger
but<00:02:03.650> it<00:02:03.710> creates<00:02:04.159> kind<00:02:04.370> of<00:02:04.549> dislike<00:02:04.760> glowy

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
but it creates kind of dislike glowy

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.430 
but it creates kind of dislike glowy
effect<00:02:06.549> on<00:02:07.549> your<00:02:07.790> skin<00:02:08.090> like<00:02:08.269> a<00:02:08.299> shimmer<00:02:08.810> can
