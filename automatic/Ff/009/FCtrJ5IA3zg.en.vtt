00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.630
 next 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.450
 I can 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.160
 8 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.080
 8 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.349
 Yes 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.979
 sad 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.309
 you have 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.549
 2 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.829
 10 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:19.960
 i think if you 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.130
 purely new at the campsite 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.070
 It is actually a big overestimate of Persie owning the land that 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.849
 if there is just no risk on the site always refused then I can agree 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.850
 according to the brand 6 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.110
 for you for the shed very small man had I did not have you 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.100
 that has 24 at the end of August each time the trail is slightly larger than in 2008 and 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.750
 2009 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.930
 knack states draws let's know it has recently signed with x one 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.660
 The license is so strengthened that it rijnsburg clubs themselves 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.010
 Wrong it is admittedly one that in the case is kilograms 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.120
 in the small world 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.650
 up to highways 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.670
 according to the baker 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.570
 within those practices from large to small 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.230
 combine with below 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.120
 derksen I knew from the exact same game of playing belt with gig one 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.890
 Stone Age The campaign finds around 72 because for the tenth month 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.510
 Deventer wished it well in recovery She simply got it now also in the context of 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.230
 gas stations 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.030
 the pieces are encamped on the side business added value is 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.400
 closure is stuck 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.020
 the school set aside is beautiful green gas and electricity and that is 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.020
 a record 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.750
 the netherlands makes it adjusted 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.610
 combined for which the wild 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.660
 when you get out I see completely filled with one 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.100
 with fat 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.500
 and then 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.080
 he is going to grow very slowly and 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.710
 those substances that are in it go slowly or should become, then there goes 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.710
 being more and more radiant is passing by, but giving more and more light 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.440
 I have you just see that we live in a society in which 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.009
 everything is getting faster 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:17.259
 and we find it just interesting to optics on the other hand it is correct 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.729
 to be the essential part of ours 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:25.629
 general experience and because it is just as important as your artist's 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.539
 going from a to b is what is between them and I also think there are six 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:30.459
 points must be 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.400
 and we always try to be open-minded to think that we can handle that 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.969
 add 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:35.039
 in the design 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:38.019
 and ultimately also in architecture 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.319
 we are again in Purmerend on a mountain on the banks of the Noordhollandskanaal 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:44.879
 who can close old market of purmerent 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.170
 and then that can close new neighborhood weidevenne that is a very big one 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:49.489
 expansion area 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.670
 and with this bridge it is an open kitchen the old city center connects the new 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.749
 the netherlands puts the sled to what 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:03.819
 the bicycle and on foot with wheelchairs and prams and can cross 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.609
 it is a bridge that can open so clubs busy shipping regularly he stands 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:09.189
 Open 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.339
 and at the same time make a run up on this bridge 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:14.799
 who always go there is true 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.760
 And then you have different ways, different speeds or are the choice 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.749
 to cross for a certain 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:22.759
 that concerns us 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.699
 to be applied under several layers in the city below 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.659
 both days delayed 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.709
 but ultimately it's about making the connection 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.969
 but also around the table it is not just the physical problems, so also for a moment 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:36.779
 take distance from the city 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:40.459
 being able to connect old and new what we think is important is that 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.339
 it becomes more than just the connection that in addition to a connection it also becomes a 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:45.629
 destination 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.899
 a place that will sit in people's minds meet ms 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:52.309
 which people like to attach to 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:56.109
 since 2000 have stood for the brand this has said the competition 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:02.419
 the pastor and I secretly deloitte I vote comic series the nec is the 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:05.419
 text that made match minutes of the match that is a piece 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:11.310
 the huge challenge if you are faced with the growing population that also goes to the 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:13.459
 city â€‹â€‹is not that 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.469
 incredible in scale 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:20.099
 but you also see that there is also an increasing appreciation for all existing ones 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:24.039
 buildings are getting married that also play heritage portal 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.050
 and therefore also China changes 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.900
 In that respect the problem is considerably less 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.370
 what we have made in the king is a bit up to date 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.900
 This one actually consists of the three existing lead heavy and a whole new state 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.600
 it is precisely those that are good in floriculture that warm a completely new building 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.879
 have draped 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:47.639
 the buildings actually has one and in everyone's industrial history 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.360
 is built in 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.069
 the society committee that was then closed was still 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:59.449
 and in January it went added aex the lowest added an indie in one 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.249
 period that china has opened and that provides a kind of layering obtineo 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.360
 we can actually always be in the city in the city and in an urban environment 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.689
 to attempt 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:10.610
 make it visible 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.919
 that the world is constantly based on lyon that we are all busy with going out 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.439
 that is in china that is of course squared 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:20.749
 and that you then put down a building that has to stand longer than that one 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:24.210
 moment that the photo is taken and m that god that you also have buildings there 

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:26.360
 what are thirty years of characters 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.160
 and that is even more difficult there than here, but the concept of change is 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:33.270
 essential in both places 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.440
 and that want it to be something we constantly own employees and that 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.600
 means for us and that that society changes but also that we 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:42.460
 understand that the building wants to build something 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.970
 and not those thirty years it will rarely use but also 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.970
 change is subject to change 

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:54.020
 Oh yeah 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.020
 8 

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:07.789
 We did come to another club as well and who deservedly received the criticism 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.699
 the research project only tackles certain themes I think it is shocking 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.699
 points from the themes also in hands again on Sunday 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.159
 I think we are more capable of that 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:24.089
 according to the maker of the youngest, the contract with other parties is interrupted 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:27.089
 fixed duration 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:38.689
 good time 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:39.189
 we have
