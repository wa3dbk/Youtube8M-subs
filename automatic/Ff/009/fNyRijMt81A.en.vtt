00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.899
 hello my name is antoine clos I 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.460
 am a teacher in the drawing studio 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.190
 in Paris in the 5th arrondissement 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.799
 I will show you how to draw a 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.780
 standing body with its proportions 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.090
 then the bodies are all different 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.439
 but the proportions are relatively 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.820
 rigid one can not get away from it 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.850
 at the risk of falling on 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.519
 morphologies that are not ben on 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.710
 will explore different proportions of the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.720
 human body so we live up to it 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.469
 overall body and we will use as 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.700
 unit of measure the height of the head 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.600
 so we're going to take the routers from the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.440
 head and if we project the height of the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.899
 head for an adult to these stones 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.500
 and we will be able to put 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.950
 approximately this time at the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.989
 height of the head in the height of the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.309
 body and 7 for the body is considered 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.649
 as being symmetrical in always a 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.510
 axis of symmetry inside it's more 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.469
 complicated that it can start from seven 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.260
 of his emotions 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.720
 symmetric accor the decomposition of these 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.090
 this author is quite curious at the end of 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.250
 account half of the body lies in 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.070
 the upper part to be composed of 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.630
 head and trunk and half 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.590
 lower will be made up of the legs 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.009
 ultimately 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.330
 so this is the first the first 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.490
 proportion that has its constraints 8 yves 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.590
 we think we're wrong that relatively 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.200
 tall and legs quite small which 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.200
 is not the case half of the body is going 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.250
 to be at half is three 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.619
 and a half so we'll be around here so these 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.140
 parties sign will represent the party 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.140
 superior composed of several parts 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.399
 whose first part is going to be this 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.980
 we said the head 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.100
 we will see the 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.970
 the torso we can take it so 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.160
 very geometric 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.020
 it's the ribcage it's a 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.430
 very rigid element inside Korean 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.020
 no articulation inside 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.890
 of which stora sic just a flexibility 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.060
 which allows to breathe to bend 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.800
 besides the abdominal part that she 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.610
 is particularly flexible on all 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.230
 movements are going to start from this of this 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.270
 zone there it belongs the most flexible 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.580
 knotted vertebrae 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.480
 so that it sticks then after having a 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.690
 rigid part that is the basin that is going 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.310
 come without limping on this part so at 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.590
 level of the second division 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.670
 the second head is going to find the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.620
 chest and will pull out the articulation of 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.250
 shoulders the shoulder joint is not 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.930
 not attached to the ribcage are 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.990
 elements that are that are free 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.300
 after we will see the important division 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.140
 with the thighs that are hung on 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:50.540
 the sides of the body 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:55.540
 the knee joint then the 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.540
 molars and the structure of the feet 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:07.110
 the proportions of body width at 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.330
 jump modo we can put a head of 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.560
 each side approximately for 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.480
 to reach the level of the shoulders 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.680
 it also depends on the build that we 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.330
 will have the size of the basin the shape 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.450
 depends on whether one has a morphology 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.590
 feminine or masculine 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.810
 male infologis and more children 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.130
 you have to very broad shoulders and 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.950
 less wide at the basin level by 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.500
 against the standard female proportion 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.180
 does that the width of the shoulders and 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.640
 approximately the width of the basin 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:49.670
 go to the arms that are hung 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:53.040
 like the femurs on the side of the body the 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.390
 particle at arm's length with 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.800
 the forearm is approximately 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.380
 at the navel 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.450
 the position of the hand is 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.989
 approximately in the third 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.340
 upper thigh to the fourth 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.620
 quarter 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.970
 so on the chest or on the chest that 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.580
 is at the second connection you can 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.390
 note the chest then at the third 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.220
 connection to third author of head to 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.530
 to be approximately the navel 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.660
 the navel a good landmark because 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.490
 that it's approximately located on the 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.540
 center of gravity the hips she by 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.610
 against are rigid 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.770
 this is where the basin does not have 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.710
 of articulation so it's one and 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.570
 single element remains going back to 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.300
 inside the body the connection enough 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.540
 complex with the blow that sinks 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.930
 quite deep in the thorax in 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:50.180
 the front part at the back we have 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.180
 muscles that are backbone 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.490
 who hold up and in front of us 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.680
 have the clavicles they and they 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.840
 hold our shoulders we saw the 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.000
 construction in terms of the proportions of the 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.220
 human body it's a phase it's enough 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.020
 rigid but after from this 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.260
 phase there we can add the shadows the 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.560
 textures and make the body more 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.560
 living
