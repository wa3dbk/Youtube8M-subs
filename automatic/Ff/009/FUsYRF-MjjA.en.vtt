through certain aspects of the game
where<00:04:12.050> I<00:04:12.080> think<00:04:12.380> it<00:04:12.500> needs<00:04:12.650> improving<00:04:13.070> little

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
where I think it needs improving little

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.820 
where I think it needs improving little
mistakes<00:04:14.330> where<00:04:14.660> players<00:04:15.140> are<00:04:15.410> running<00:04:15.680> where

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.070

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
they shouldn't be running and it's not

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.360
