00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.259
 from the good world many times you have 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.650
 said but hopes to be wrong about 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:13.179
 channel 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.870
 This is kraft and others I'll give you your 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.870
 techno world 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.820
 God tutorial show this channel 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.220
 tutorials our tutorial 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.630
 because I bring a left tutorial but 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.550
 The truth is that many people do not 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.050
 they had reported an error that causes them 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.300
 minecraft and how I am a good person 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.280
 so I can not say that so many 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.960
 people want to play their minecraft and they 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.520
 you get errors so you decide 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.320
 help them the money I'm going to show them 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.510
 how to solve the error that brings you 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.130
 minecraft when he tried to center and has 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.930
 a black screen and you get back out 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.310
 I'm going to show you the menu when 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.140
 I entered the kraftwerk trammel 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.820
 This black screen appears and returns to 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.870
 go out to what would be the menu then what 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.430
 only thing that we have to do we are going to 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.840
 have to download an application to 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.700
 do this in case you already 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.710
 have a file explorer then to 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.970
 you do not have to use this one that 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.290
 I will show good but if you do not 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.729
 has file browser not 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.530
 I recommend this matter that is here 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.080
 shawn johnson is super super father 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.149
 it works great and the truth is that it is 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.470
 very very intuitive ok once I already 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.240
 let's have what this would be like we're going to 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.950
 have to need what would be the apk of 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.240
 minecraft logically that here the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.740
 registration must be leaving for the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.420
 Two versions for 4 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.030
 but like you'll be 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.070
 leaving for the 2.3 of android ok 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.659
 well once we have the app that already 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.790
 let's have what would be the explorer of 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.439
 teams we can start good on 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.390
 first step we need to make is 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.799
 remove the version of brands that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.630
 we have installed the one that is giving us 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.520
 We will eliminate the error. I know that 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.649
 many people try to eliminate and 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.780
 reinstall the apk however you 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.670
 still giving that same mistake then no 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.110
 that's not the solution ok 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.939
 well then what we have to do 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.560
 It is to eliminate it once you already have 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.539
 eliminated we're going to have to go to what 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.240
 would be the explorer calculation and let's go to 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.530
 the folder of sd card and in game we are going to 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.780
 find a folder that is called com 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.459
 very point and here is what they would be 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.990
 your worlds if you have them please 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:07.459
 backups so that it will not be 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.319
 no problem and not after 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.060
 what they have done ok then this that 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.769
 it's called a very big thing with a point 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.630
 very well we are going to have to grab it and 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.400
 we're going to have to eliminate ok 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.590
 It eliminates what this folder would be 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.299
 and now we are going to where we have the apec 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.940
 to what would be the microsoft and in the 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.380
 version 0.11 zero point ok let's have 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.540
 that install it again what would be the 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.310
 we apply point to install to the best 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.380
 this process takes longer than 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.340
 previous 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.780
 logically you have to recreate 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.290
 all the folders have to come back 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.360
 good 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.210
 here already immediately but if you take 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.530
 more is totally acceptable ok and what 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.000
 only thing we have to do is late in 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.470
 April and we are going to hit you whatever you want 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.440
 you will be able to enjoy the latest new 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.660
 also ice cream version but from that 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.950
 is the truth is that it works very well and 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.200
 you will be able to enjoy what would be 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.140
 your minecraft and without any problem 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.090
 ok then that was the solution for the 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.800
 You and many people remain 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.600
 what would be the bad taste 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.010

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.080

 is a tutorial and a tutorial on a channel 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.970

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.230

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.580
 problem and that it was not this but what 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.220
