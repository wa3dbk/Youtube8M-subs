00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
then once i go around the entire base

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.970

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.389 
goblins to clean up but as you can see
i'm<00:00:40.440> going<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.620> do<00:00:40.710> again<00:00:40.950> right<00:00:41.129> here<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
i'm going to do again right here in the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.190 
i'm going to do again right here in the
right<00:00:41.550> flank<00:00:41.850> I'm<00:00:42.090> dropping<00:00:42.450> my<00:00:42.480> goblins<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
right flank I'm dropping my goblins and

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.779 
right flank I'm dropping my goblins and
then<00:00:43.379> I'm<00:00:43.469> gonna<00:00:43.559> drop<00:00:43.739> three<00:00:44.129> wall<00:00:44.399> breakers

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
then I'm gonna drop three wall breakers

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.610 
then I'm gonna drop three wall breakers
just<00:00:45.030> because<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.239> know<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.629> always<00:00:46.020> dies<00:00:46.230> and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
just because I know one always dies and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.569 
just because I know one always dies and
then<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> other<00:00:46.829> two<00:00:47.010> blow<00:00:47.309> through<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
then the other two blow through the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.100 
then the other two blow through the
purple<00:00:47.879> walls<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.870> really<00:00:49.020> easy

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
purple walls so it's a really easy

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.110 
purple walls so it's a really easy

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120

I'm<00:01:27.810> dropping<00:01:28.259> 20<00:01:28.409> trophies<00:01:28.860> at<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> time

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
I'm dropping 20 trophies at a time

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.249 
I'm dropping 20 trophies at a time
basically<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:30.150> my<00:01:30.299> defense<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.900> strong

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
basically but my defense is strong

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.319 
basically but my defense is strong
enough<00:01:31.380> as<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.829> guys<00:01:31.979> know<00:01:32.009> already<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
enough as you guys know already that it

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.179 
enough as you guys know already that it
is<00:01:33.570> pulling<00:01:34.049> me<00:01:34.170> back<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.740> keeping<00:01:34.979> me<00:01:35.100> in

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
is pulling me back up and keeping me in

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.620 
is pulling me back up and keeping me in
crystal<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:36.090> not<00:01:36.119> dropped<00:01:36.450> out<00:01:36.600> of

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
crystal to I have not dropped out of

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.020 
crystal to I have not dropped out of
crystal<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.229> about<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> month<00:01:38.030> probably

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
crystal to in about a month probably

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.520 
crystal to in about a month probably
bout<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> month<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.840> literally<00:01:40.259> been

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
bout a month and I just literally been

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.190 
bout a month and I just literally been
losing<00:01:40.950> from<00:01:41.310> attacking<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.140> occasionally<00:01:43.140> I

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
losing from attacking and occasionally I

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.359 
losing from attacking and occasionally I
do<00:01:43.259> win<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.680> because<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.040> good<00:01:44.159> strategy

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
do win just because it's a good strategy

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.630 
do win just because it's a good strategy
but<00:01:44.909> very<00:01:45.450> often<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.899> do<00:01:45.960> lose<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.520> is

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
but very often I do lose and this is

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.819 
but very often I do lose and this is
another<00:01:47.880> abandoned<00:01:48.420> base<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.720> guy<00:01:48.899> did<00:01:49.649> make

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
another abandoned base this guy did make

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.080 
another abandoned base this guy did make
the<00:01:49.920> mistake<00:01:50.189> he<00:01:50.220> put<00:01:50.520> all<00:01:50.640> his<00:01:50.670> buildings

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the mistake he put all his buildings

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.520 
the mistake he put all his buildings
pretty<00:01:51.299> far<00:01:51.479> out<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:51.810> I'm<00:01:51.930> going<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.079> drop<00:01:52.259> one

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
pretty far out so I'm going to drop one

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.020 
pretty far out so I'm going to drop one
Archer<00:01:52.890> per<00:01:53.220> building<00:01:53.490> that's<00:01:53.759> out<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:53.909> the

Archer per building that's out in the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.819 
Archer per building that's out in the
distance<00:01:54.420> cuz<00:01:54.659> one<00:01:55.020> archers<00:01:55.320> all<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.560> need

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
distance cuz one archers all you need

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.649 
distance cuz one archers all you need
and<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.700> don't<00:01:56.880> need<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.030> worry<00:01:57.180> I'm<00:01:57.390> trying<00:01:57.600> to

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659

wall breakers just to blow into the
areas<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.760> had<00:02:18.120> mines<00:02:18.420> because<00:02:18.720> that's

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
areas that had mines because that's

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.900 
areas that had mines because that's
where<00:02:19.050> all<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.170> loot<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.800> we're<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.670> little

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
where all the loot is and we're a little

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.190 
where all the loot is and we're a little
fun<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:21.300> one<00:02:21.450> we're<00:02:21.750> actually<00:02:21.840> going<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.140> go

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
fun this one we're actually going to go

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.600 
fun this one we're actually going to go
for<00:02:22.350> that<00:02:22.440> center<00:02:22.770> because<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.310> kind<00:02:23.490> of<00:02:23.550> a

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
for that center because it is kind of a

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.060 
for that center because it is kind of a
volt<00:02:23.880> but<00:02:24.450> it's<00:02:24.570> not<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:25.350> well<00:02:25.560> made<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:25.830> mean

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
volt but it's not that well made I mean

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.980 
volt but it's not that well made I mean
there<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.730> multi<00:02:27.030> target<00:02:27.300> infernos<00:02:27.690> so

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
there is the multi target infernos so

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.150 
there is the multi target infernos so
that<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.200> always<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.560> threat<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:28.980> need<00:02:29.100> to

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
that is always a threat you need to

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.650 
that is always a threat you need to
worry<00:02:29.370> about<00:02:29.490> especially<00:02:30.030> with<00:02:30.180> goblins

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
worry about especially with goblins

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.750 
worry about especially with goblins
because<00:02:30.810> there's<00:02:30.960> so<00:02:31.140> we<00:02:31.320> can<00:02:31.500> health<00:02:31.760> but

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
because there's so we can health but

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
because there's so we can health but
we're<00:02:32.910> gonna<00:02:33.030> go<00:02:33.120> ahead<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.270> get<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.480> last

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
we're gonna go ahead and get this last

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.020 
we're gonna go ahead and get this last
mine<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.710> as<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.340> can<00:02:35.460> see<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.640> archers<00:02:35.910> are

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
mine and as you can see the archers are

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.910 
mine and as you can see the archers are
actually<00:02:36.300> taking<00:02:36.510> out<00:02:36.690> those<00:02:36.840> army<00:02:37.560> camp<00:02:37.800> so

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
actually taking out those army camp so

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.130 
actually taking out those army camp so
in<00:02:38.040> no<00:02:38.190> trouble<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:39.510> should<00:02:39.840> have<00:02:39.960> dropped

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
in no trouble and I should have dropped

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.740 
in no trouble and I should have dropped
one<00:02:40.470> more<00:02:40.650> troop<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.730> actual<00:02:42.240> builder's

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
one more troop on that actual builder's

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.000 
one more troop on that actual builder's
hut<00:02:42.780> just<00:02:43.170> because<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.440> would<00:02:43.560> be<00:02:43.620> an<00:02:43.710> extra

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
hut just because that would be an extra

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.800 
hut just because that would be an extra
easy<00:02:44.190> point<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.700> get<00:02:44.820> but<00:02:45.420> I'm<00:02:45.510> not<00:02:45.600> going<00:02:45.750> to

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
easy point to get but I'm not going to

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
decent let's do one last one and then

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.830 
decent let's do one last one and then
we'll<00:03:41.370> look<00:03:41.700> for<00:03:41.880> some<00:03:42.060> really<00:03:42.360> awesome<00:03:42.510> on

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
we'll look for some really awesome on

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.090 
we'll look for some really awesome on
the<00:03:42.990> feed<00:03:43.200> see<00:03:43.380> if<00:03:43.440> we<00:03:43.500> can<00:03:43.620> find<00:03:43.740> someone<00:03:44.070> a

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
the feed see if we can find someone a

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.880 
the feed see if we can find someone a
good<00:03:44.340> attack<00:03:44.640> this<00:03:45.120> base<00:03:45.360> is<00:03:45.390> super<00:03:46.020> super<00:03:46.410> gem

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
good attack this base is super super gem

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.650 
good attack this base is super super gem
er<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:47.010> mean<00:03:47.190> it's<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.370> tunnel<00:03:47.550> 9<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:48.120> he<00:03:48.480> has

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
er I mean it's a tunnel 9 and he has

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.040 
er I mean it's a tunnel 9 and he has
stone<00:03:49.290> walls<00:03:49.650> black<00:03:50.010> walls<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.760> gold<00:03:51.720> and

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
stone walls black walls and gold and

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.210 
stone walls black walls and gold and
crystal<00:03:52.290> walls<00:03:52.590> so<00:03:52.710> that's<00:03:52.890> really

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
crystal walls so that's really

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.880 
crystal walls so that's really
ridiculous<00:03:53.490> looking<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.390> looks<00:03:55.230> really<00:03:55.590> bad<00:03:55.860> I

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
ridiculous looking it looks really bad I

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.080 
ridiculous looking it looks really bad I
would<00:03:56.100> never<00:03:56.250> do<00:03:56.460> that<00:03:56.490> with<00:03:56.730> my<00:03:56.760> base

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
would never do that with my base

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.790 
would never do that with my base
personally<00:03:57.630> I<00:03:57.810> think<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.560> looks<00:03:58.710> ridiculous

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
personally I think it looks ridiculous

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.740 
personally I think it looks ridiculous
but<00:03:59.370> as<00:03:59.580> you<00:03:59.730> can<00:03:59.820> see<00:03:59.970> same<00:04:00.300> strategy

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
but as you can see same strategy

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.270 
but as you can see same strategy
dropping<00:04:01.140> those<00:04:01.230> wall<00:04:01.560> breakers<00:04:01.950> dropping

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
dropping those wall breakers dropping

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.550 
dropping those wall breakers dropping

Queen are working their way around the

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.050 
Queen are working their way around the
sides<00:06:13.800> of<00:06:13.950> the<00:06:14.040> base<00:06:14.190> which<00:06:14.430> is<00:06:14.460> really<00:06:14.790> good

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
sides of the base which is really good

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.219 
sides of the base which is really good
because<00:06:15.120> they're<00:06:15.570> not<00:06:15.660> getting<00:06:15.840> attacked<00:06:16.110> by

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
because they're not getting attacked by

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:17.300 
because they're not getting attacked by
anything<00:06:16.560> so<00:06:16.650> it<00:06:16.710> is<00:06:16.800> need<00:06:16.950> to<00:06:17.010> worry<00:06:17.190> about

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
anything so it is need to worry about

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.640 
anything so it is need to worry about
them<00:06:17.520> dying<00:06:17.790> but<00:06:18.240> they<00:06:18.300> are<00:06:18.479> strong<00:06:18.900> so<00:06:19.530> they

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
them dying but they are strong so they

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.500 
them dying but they are strong so they
do<00:06:19.710> wipe<00:06:20.070> out<00:06:20.250> buildings<00:06:20.610> very<00:06:20.850> quickly<00:06:21.180> and

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
do wipe out buildings very quickly and

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.600 
do wipe out buildings very quickly and
it's<00:06:22.260> hogs<00:06:22.470> on<00:06:22.650> the<00:06:22.740> opposite<00:06:23.010> side<00:06:23.190> so<00:06:23.400> once

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
it's hogs on the opposite side so once

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.030 
it's hogs on the opposite side so once
all<00:06:23.790> those<00:06:23.910> defenses<00:06:24.450> do<00:06:24.690> go<00:06:24.900> down<00:06:25.110> he<00:06:25.740> will<00:06:26.010> be

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
all those defenses do go down he will be

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.370 
all those defenses do go down he will be
able<00:06:26.280> to<00:06:26.520> have<00:06:26.729> troops<00:06:27.479> on<00:06:27.690> both<00:06:27.900> sides<00:06:28.169> of<00:06:28.290> the

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
able to have troops on both sides of the

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.230 
able to have troops on both sides of the
base<00:06:28.590> which<00:06:29.010> will<00:06:29.160> allow<00:06:29.370> them<00:06:29.700> to<00:06:29.790> win<00:06:29.940> a<00:06:29.970> lot

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
base which will allow them to win a lot

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.440 
base which will allow them to win a lot
quicker<00:06:30.510> than<00:06:30.720> normal<00:06:31.160> and<00:06:32.160> as<00:06:32.850> you<00:06:33.300> can<00:06:33.419> see

quicker than normal and as you can see

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.230 
quicker than normal and as you can see
he's<00:06:33.630> got<00:06:33.750> 44<00:06:34.350> seconds<00:06:34.830> left<00:06:35.099> can<00:06:35.550> he<00:06:35.820> get<00:06:36.060> this

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
he's got 44 seconds left can he get this

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.690 
he's got 44 seconds left can he get this
it<00:06:36.390> always<00:06:36.630> looks<00:06:36.870> so<00:06:37.320> crazy<00:06:38.250> when<00:06:38.580> you're
