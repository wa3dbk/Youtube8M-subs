but<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.990> key<00:01:39.170> has<00:01:39.440> been<00:01:39.619> when<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:39.920> wind<00:01:40.130> blows

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
but the key has been when the wind blows

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:41.980 
but the key has been when the wind blows
you<00:01:40.459> know<00:01:40.610> we<00:01:40.789> got<00:01:40.940> overcast<00:01:41.479> which<00:01:41.690> is<00:01:41.810> just

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
you know we got overcast which is just

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.260 
you know we got overcast which is just
perfect<00:01:42.530> for<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:42.709> top<00:01:42.979> water<00:01:43.220> situation<00:01:43.850> but

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
perfect for a top water situation but

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.090 
perfect for a top water situation but
when<00:01:44.390> that<00:01:44.509> wind<00:01:44.750> gusts<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.289> really<00:01:45.709> helps<00:01:46.009> it

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
when that wind gusts it really helps it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.800 
when that wind gusts it really helps it
out<00:01:46.250> because<00:01:46.610> what<00:01:46.759> it<00:01:46.880> does<00:01:47.030> because<00:01:47.630> it

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
out because what it does because it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.389 
out because what it does because it
blurs<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.080> profile<00:01:48.740> of<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:48.979> bait<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.340> the

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
blurs the profile of the bait and the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.070 
blurs the profile of the bait and the
bass<00:01:49.610> can't<00:01:49.909> get<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.179> as<00:01:50.330> good<00:01:50.360> of<00:01:50.659> a<00:01:50.720> look<00:01:50.899> at

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
bass can't get it as good of a look at

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.899 
bass can't get it as good of a look at
it<00:01:51.200> plus<00:01:51.709> when<00:01:52.069> the<00:01:52.159> wind<00:01:52.340> blows<00:01:52.549> it<00:01:52.729> puts

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
it plus when the wind blows it puts

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.399 
it plus when the wind blows it puts
oxygen<00:01:53.330> in<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.509> water<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:53.869> it<00:01:53.959> activates

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
oxygen in the water and it activates

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.260 
oxygen in the water and it activates
shad<00:01:54.679> bluegill<00:01:55.220> bass<00:01:55.459> and<00:01:55.700> everything<00:01:56.030> in<00:01:56.179> the
