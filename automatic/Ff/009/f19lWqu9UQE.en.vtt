00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 etienne boulay 8 and the phases of 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.910
 compact camping so a way to put 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.720
 in contact with a camping band officer 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.400
 giant melee where were you talking about 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.320
 this capsule is a presentation of 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.810
 that the greatest full destination 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.270
 air 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.820
 1 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.190
 and drive home 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.640
 of guy the camper- compact talks 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.080
 and light 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.300
 and I can not believe it because I 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.770
 think we found the only bag of 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.790
 sleeping in the world with which we do not have 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.080
 need to fight to put it back 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.680
 in the packaging it's still pretty 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.370
 impressive 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.600
 and then we're going to talk about tact in fact it's 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.100
 the first thing we're going to like 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.200
 reduce employment because it's very 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.120
 easy to make limits that counts 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.980
 it's very easy with the tents done 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.140
 that they have just thinned the nylon you 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.879
 are not but sturdy hockey 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.680
 instead of using the fiber shoulder 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.480
 of classic glass but the cd paul in 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.710
 aluminum but alas auguin no ma 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.239
 question is that the quality has 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.070
 been neglected almost losc is over 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.870
 compact not at all the times are 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.239
 hit rugged but more people 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.800
 worried about the big minimalist of 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.170
 this world will not go away with a time 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.059
 but only with a canvas goes a shelter 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.040
 basic or more as always there is a 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.660
 great meeting urwin paul no we will 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.790
 serve our environment as 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.259
 branches of trees to attach oneself 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.479
 we are safe for the hustlers 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.860
 exactly the take that is in 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.390
 hockey matelotes by cons what we 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.790
 compact lightweight trip it takes a 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.530
 neglected comfort yes so some 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.100
 companies have released very textbooks 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.209
 ultra compact light like this one well 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.709
 we can see there is still a 

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:28.630
 inflated time yeah anyway pretty funny 

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.640
 we have an example here because at 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.100
 inside we can insert tibet and 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.390
 insulators this reflection is talking about 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.910
 in colder periods 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.399
 yes that's what ends at the highest 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.950
 level and a break comfort and sleep after 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.409
 if we can go in 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.369
 at the kitchen level what are we going 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.469
 go get when we want to go 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.969
 from lightweight compact and materials 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.159
 the exchange is true that instead of being 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.840
 there the standard idiom but here we have a 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.429
 example of a crazy class that stretched 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.619
 daniel light so very minimalist and 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:02.310
 have a small forceps made without 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.170
 sleeves well a pinch any hostility 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.659
 to all the pans does it anyway 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.789
 still try smart enough to 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.500
 Savings 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.000
 same thing for stoves does that the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.349
 stove right here material that the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.299
 Titanium rankings 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.680
 he 'll be as good as 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.640
 any other fails to their 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.750
 contact 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.730
 we see again it does not take 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.470
 place not exactly and for those who 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.360
 count sorrow but also the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.470
 dehydrated food does that we did 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.060
 we removed all the moisture from the 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.970
 Food is still long and lose 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.040
 wonderful duo of trying to bring everything 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.110
 alone is a beautiful being a bag the bag to 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.849
 back is still long we can establish 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.459
 the minimalists in the backpack with 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.380
 we have backpacks that are ultra light 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.910
 but we must also understand that if we 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.040
 speaks of light according to the comfort 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.139
 slightly divide with me what I 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.450
 advise what part of the trip that 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.440
 is the least lightweight is the bag in lagord 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.910
 time I know it's like a part of 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.440
 luck we do not know well inside 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.910
 of the song gets well all the 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.799
 world is playing with the same thing with the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.780
 wonderful jerks but see there is 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.790
 way to do like a compact and lightweight 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.329
 but more information but barack 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.329
 obama
