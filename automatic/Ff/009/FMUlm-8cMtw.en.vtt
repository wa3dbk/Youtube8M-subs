in case you're ever traveling somewhere
and<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.789> need<00:00:23.910> your<00:00:24.119> glider<00:00:24.330> more<00:00:24.600> compact

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
and you need your glider more compact

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.519 
and you need your glider more compact
okay<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.330> starters<00:00:27.480> take<00:00:28.140> your<00:00:28.289> glider

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
okay so for starters take your glider

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.290 
okay so for starters take your glider
out<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.800> your<00:00:29.070> bag<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.550> lay<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.179> out

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
out of your bag and lay it out

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.150 
out of your bag and lay it out
preferably<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> grass<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:31.830> since<00:00:32.009> this

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
preferably on the grass but since this

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.920 
preferably on the grass but since this
morning<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> little<00:00:33.030> wet<00:00:33.210> we've<00:00:33.690> laid<00:00:33.899> it

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
morning it's a little wet we've laid it

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.870 
morning it's a little wet we've laid it
out<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> driveway<00:00:34.500> after<00:00:34.829> we've<00:00:35.340> cleanly

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
out in the driveway after we've cleanly

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.760 
out in the driveway after we've cleanly
swept<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> entire<00:00:36.480> thing<00:00:36.989> lay<00:00:37.350> your<00:00:37.500> glider

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
swept the entire thing lay your glider

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.580 
swept the entire thing lay your glider
out<00:00:37.860> flat<00:00:38.250> along<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.879> flat<00:00:39.180> surface<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.840> then

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
out flat along a flat surface and then

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.459 
out flat along a flat surface and then
we<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:40.860> start<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> folding<00:00:41.550> process<00:00:42.410> okay<00:00:43.410> so

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
we can start the folding process okay so

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.990 
we can start the folding process okay so
first<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.920> all<00:00:44.040> once<00:00:44.280> you've<00:00:44.430> lit<00:00:44.579> laid<00:00:44.820> your

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
first of all once you've lit laid your

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.690 
first of all once you've lit laid your
glider<00:00:45.239> out<00:00:45.860> make<00:00:46.860> sure<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.340> clear<00:00:47.550> your

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
glider out make sure that you clear your

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.220 
glider out make sure that you clear your
lines<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.300> pull<00:00:48.510> them<00:00:48.660> all<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.930> way<00:00:49.050> out

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
lines and you pull them all the way out

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.779 
lines and you pull them all the way out
from<00:00:49.410> underneath<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.340> glider

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
from underneath the glider

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.700 
from underneath the glider
that<00:00:51.510> way<00:00:51.660> when<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:51.870> walk<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.199> lines<00:00:52.440> up

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
that way when we walk the lines up

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.439 
that way when we walk the lines up
there's<00:00:53.039> nothing<00:00:53.460> underneath<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.210> glider

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
there's nothing underneath the glider

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.119 
there's nothing underneath the glider
the<00:00:59.690> key<00:01:00.690> here<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.199> take<00:01:01.379> your<00:01:01.530> lines<00:01:01.770> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the key here is to take your lines and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.570 
the key here is to take your lines and
to<00:01:03.000> put<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.329> across<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:04.080> glider<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.739> make<00:01:05.369> sure

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
to put it across the glider to make sure

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.950 
to put it across the glider to make sure
that<00:01:05.729> they<00:01:05.850> end<00:01:06.060> up<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:07.020> center<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:11.960> like

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
that they end up in the center just like

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.109 
that they end up in the center just like
this<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.500> you'll<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.430> both<00:01:14.610> sides<00:01:14.939> of

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
this and you'll do this to both sides of

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.030 
this and you'll do this to both sides of
the<00:01:15.240> glider<00:01:15.509> but<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.080> sure<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.439> go<00:01:16.560> back<00:01:16.770> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the glider but be sure to go back and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.890

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.170 
pick up any of the lines that are laying
off<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> glider<00:01:19.650> underneath<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.490> set<00:01:21.000> them

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
off the glider underneath and set them

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:33.710 
off the glider underneath and set them
gently<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.570> top

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.480 

okay<00:01:34.720> now<00:01:35.230> that<00:01:35.290> we<00:01:35.500> have<00:01:35.530> both<00:01:35.920> sides<00:01:36.250> of<00:01:36.430> the

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
okay now that we have both sides of the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.190 
okay now that we have both sides of the
gliders<00:01:36.850> cleaned<00:01:37.270> up<00:01:37.390> with<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:37.630> lines<00:01:37.870> and

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
gliders cleaned up with the lines and

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.260 
gliders cleaned up with the lines and
set<00:01:38.440> in<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.710> center<00:01:39.010> we're<00:01:39.640> ready<00:01:39.850> to<00:01:40.000> start

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
set in the center we're ready to start

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.720 
set in the center we're ready to start
folding<00:01:40.480> okay<00:01:41.080> take<00:01:41.590> one<00:01:42.010> end<00:01:42.220> of<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.460> glider

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
folding okay take one end of the glider

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.870 
folding okay take one end of the glider
and<00:01:43.410> walk<00:01:44.410> it<00:01:44.620> all<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:44.890> way<00:01:45.190> to<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.670> center

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and walk it all the way to the center

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.580 
and walk it all the way to the center
just<00:01:48.880> like<00:01:49.060> this<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:50.560> sure<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.960> ends<00:01:53.410> are

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
just like this be sure that the ends are

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.399 
just like this be sure that the ends are
pulled<00:01:54.220> tight

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.950 

and<00:01:57.560> then<00:01:58.010> it's<00:01:58.220> tight<00:01:58.490> here<00:01:58.820> nice<00:01:59.689> and<00:01:59.720> flat

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
and then it's tight here nice and flat

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.679 
and then it's tight here nice and flat
okay<00:02:00.710> once<00:02:01.250> that<00:02:01.369> happens<00:02:01.880> you're<00:02:02.479> going<00:02:02.600> to

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
okay once that happens you're going to

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.719 
okay once that happens you're going to
fold<00:02:02.900> again<00:02:03.259> typically<00:02:03.979> it's<00:02:04.310> a<00:02:04.430> lot<00:02:04.580> better

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
fold again typically it's a lot better

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.910 
fold again typically it's a lot better
with<00:02:05.030> two<00:02:05.180> people<00:02:05.540> but<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:06.229> can<00:02:06.440> do<00:02:06.590> this<00:02:06.740> on

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
with two people but you can do this on

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:17.510 
with two people but you can do this on
your<00:02:07.070> own

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.490 

you<00:02:17.880> see<00:02:17.940> any<00:02:18.180> light<00:02:18.450> sticking<00:02:18.840> out<00:02:18.960> on<00:02:19.080> top<00:02:19.290> be

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
you see any light sticking out on top be

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.149 
you see any light sticking out on top be
sure<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.710> kick<00:02:20.010> those<00:02:20.160> tucked<00:02:20.430> in

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.890 

okay<00:02:25.159> and<00:02:25.400> in<00:02:25.819> this<00:02:25.939> instance<00:02:26.209> we<00:02:26.569> need<00:02:26.840> to

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
okay and in this instance we need to

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.679 
okay and in this instance we need to
fold<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.319> one<00:02:27.709> more<00:02:27.920> time<00:02:31.269> you<00:02:32.269> can<00:02:32.420> always

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
fold it one more time you can always

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.059 
fold it one more time you can always
tuck<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.019> in<00:02:33.110> right<00:02:33.290> here<00:02:33.319> to<00:02:33.650> give<00:02:33.769> it<00:02:33.799> a<00:02:33.920> nice

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
tuck it in right here to give it a nice

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:41.290 
tuck it in right here to give it a nice
bowl

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.729

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
now we're done with this side for now

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.149 
now we're done with this side for now
and<00:02:46.269> we'll<00:02:46.569> do<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.840> exact<00:02:47.140> same<00:02:47.170> thing<00:02:47.680> on<00:02:47.920> the

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
and we'll do the exact same thing on the

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.130 
and we'll do the exact same thing on the
other<00:02:48.310> now<00:02:48.909> that<00:02:48.940> you<00:02:49.239> have<00:02:49.360> both<00:02:49.569> sides<00:02:49.930> of

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
other now that you have both sides of

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.530 
other now that you have both sides of
your<00:02:50.230> glider<00:02:50.500> folded<00:02:51.129> just<00:02:51.159> like<00:02:51.580> this<00:02:51.819> you're

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
your glider folded just like this you're

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.869 
your glider folded just like this you're
ready<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.959> kind<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.290> roll<00:02:53.680> out<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:54.400> air<00:02:54.580> that's

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
ready to kind of roll out the air that's

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.119 
ready to kind of roll out the air that's
compressed<00:02:55.390> inside<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.470> let<00:02:56.620> me<00:02:56.709> show<00:02:56.920> you<00:02:56.950> how

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
compressed inside so let me show you how

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.449 
compressed inside so let me show you how
to<00:02:57.190> do<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.489> this<00:02:57.819> is<00:02:57.940> kind<00:02:58.150> of<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.299> fun<00:02:58.480> part

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.369 

lay<00:03:03.459> across<00:03:03.700> your<00:03:04.060> glider<00:03:04.299> just<00:03:05.019> like<00:03:05.200> this

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
lay across your glider just like this

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.640 
lay across your glider just like this
and<00:03:05.819> be<00:03:06.819> sure<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.269> when<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:07.569> roll<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:08.440> roll

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
and be sure that when you roll you roll

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.770 
and be sure that when you roll you roll
towards<00:03:09.250> these<00:03:09.459> cells<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.629> air<00:03:10.750> has

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
towards these cells so that the air has

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.140 
towards these cells so that the air has
a<00:03:11.019> way<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.260> escape

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
a way to escape

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:26.250 
a way to escape
be<00:03:13.150> sure<00:03:13.329> to<00:03:13.480> roll<00:03:13.629> evenly<00:03:14.019> too<00:03:14.230> by<00:03:14.379> the<00:03:14.409> way

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.380 

okay<00:03:27.260> so<00:03:28.070> that<00:03:28.250> compressed<00:03:28.700> out<00:03:28.850> quite<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.210> bit

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
okay so that compressed out quite a bit

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.410 
okay so that compressed out quite a bit
of<00:03:29.510> air<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:29.930> now<00:03:30.410> we<00:03:30.470> can<00:03:30.740> fold<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.100> again<00:03:31.420> okay

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
of air and now we can fold it again okay

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.880 
of air and now we can fold it again okay
so<00:03:32.480> now<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:32.900> we're<00:03:32.990> ready<00:03:33.140> for<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.500> final

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
so now that we're ready for the final

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.680 
so now that we're ready for the final
parts<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.340> folding<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:35.300> want<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.570> make

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
parts of the folding you want to make

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.330 
parts of the folding you want to make
sure<00:03:35.720> that<00:03:35.960> you<00:03:36.110> grab<00:03:36.320> your<00:03:36.590> risers<00:03:36.830> at<00:03:37.190> the

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
end and tuck them into the glider just

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.590 
end and tuck them into the glider just
like<00:03:43.880> this<00:03:45.490> make<00:03:46.490> sure<00:03:46.670> any<00:03:46.970> loose<00:03:47.240> strings

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
like this make sure any loose strings

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.930 
like this make sure any loose strings
are<00:03:47.840> tucked<00:03:48.110> inside<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.890> we'll<00:03:49.310> do<00:03:49.460> the<00:03:49.580> final

are tucked inside and we'll do the final
parts<00:03:50.210> the<00:03:50.390> folding<00:03:50.780> okay

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
parts the folding okay

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.380 
parts the folding okay
so<00:03:51.770> we're<00:03:51.890> gonna<00:03:51.980> take<00:03:52.280> this<00:03:52.550> side<00:03:52.820> we're

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
so we're gonna take this side we're

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.600 
so we're gonna take this side we're
gonna<00:03:53.450> fold<00:03:53.750> it<00:03:53.900> in<00:03:53.960> half<00:03:54.020> one<00:03:54.410> more<00:03:54.620> time

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.580 

make<00:03:59.610> a<00:03:59.640> nice<00:03:59.880> little<00:03:59.910> crease<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:02.330> fold<00:04:03.590> we're

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
make a nice little crease and fold we're

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.780 
make a nice little crease and fold we're
going<00:04:04.710> to<00:04:04.770> do<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:04.980> same<00:04:05.220> thing<00:04:05.490> to<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:05.760> other

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
going to do the same thing to the other

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.730 
going to do the same thing to the other
side<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.720> we're<00:04:06.930> going<00:04:07.020> to<00:04:07.080> roll<00:04:07.350> over<00:04:07.380> it

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
side and we're going to roll over it

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.070 
side and we're going to roll over it
again<00:04:08.030> be<00:04:09.030> sure<00:04:09.060> that<00:04:09.420> when<00:04:09.540> you<00:04:09.660> get<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.930> this

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
again be sure that when you get to this

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.400 
again be sure that when you get to this
side<00:04:10.380> you<00:04:10.700> fold<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.880> remaining<00:04:12.330> end<00:04:12.690> over<00:04:13.140> top

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
side you fold the remaining end over top

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.740 
side you fold the remaining end over top
of<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.650> glider<00:04:13.860> just<00:04:14.640> like<00:04:14.850> this<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:18.239> as<00:04:18.570> you

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
of the glider just like this and as you

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.420 
of the glider just like this and as you
can<00:04:18.930> see<00:04:19.140> we've<00:04:19.470> kind<00:04:19.680> of<00:04:19.770> started<00:04:20.100> filling<00:04:20.250> up

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
can see we've kind of started filling up

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.250 
can see we've kind of started filling up
with<00:04:20.550> air<00:04:20.760> again<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.600> we'll<00:04:21.780> need<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:21.989> roll

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
with air again so we'll need to roll

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.620 
with air again so we'll need to roll
this<00:04:22.440> out<00:04:22.620> maybe<00:04:23.160> once<00:04:23.460> or<00:04:23.730> two<00:04:24.240> more<00:04:24.420> times

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
this out maybe once or two more times

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.200 
this out maybe once or two more times
okay<00:04:25.650> once<00:04:26.100> you've<00:04:26.310> rolled<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:26.700> out<00:04:26.820> just<00:04:27.060> like

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
okay once you've rolled it out just like

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.760 
okay once you've rolled it out just like
I<00:04:27.390> have<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.630> get<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.020> last<00:04:28.230> of<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.530> air<00:04:28.650> up

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
I have to get the last of the air up

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.340 
I have to get the last of the air up
you're<00:04:29.280> ready<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.670> start<00:04:29.910> folding<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:30.930> be<00:04:31.110> sure

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
you're ready to start folding so be sure

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.500 
you're ready to start folding so be sure
that<00:04:32.040> you<00:04:32.160> have<00:04:32.190> your<00:04:32.370> glider<00:04:32.670> strap<00:04:33.060> ready<00:04:33.330> to

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
that you have your glider strap ready to

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.530 
that you have your glider strap ready to
go<00:04:34.280> what<00:04:35.280> we<00:04:35.400> want<00:04:35.580> to<00:04:35.670> do<00:04:35.790> is<00:04:35.940> fold<00:04:36.180> from<00:04:36.360> the

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
go what we want to do is fold from the

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.900 
go what we want to do is fold from the
end<00:04:36.720> where<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.560> toggles<00:04:37.980> are<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.580> trailing

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
end where the toggles are the trailing

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.600 
end where the toggles are the trailing
edge<00:04:39.210> up<00:04:39.660> into<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.350> leading<00:04:40.560> edge<00:04:40.860> so<00:04:41.490> the

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
edge up into the leading edge so the

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.550 
edge up into the leading edge so the
last<00:04:41.820> of<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.120> air<00:04:42.300> comes<00:04:42.660> out<00:04:42.900> as<00:04:43.080> we're

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
last of the air comes out as we're

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.840 
last of the air comes out as we're
folding<00:04:43.800> it's<00:04:44.400> going<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.610> be<00:04:44.670> really

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
folding it's going to be really
