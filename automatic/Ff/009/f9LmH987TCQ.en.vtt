 We are very happy to be here and that the US Embassy has sponsored this wonderful installation. 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.680
 And I would like to celebrate one of my favorite American export items, which is fun. 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.520
 So I invite you all to come and have fun! 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.300
 And I would like to congratulate Martin PoÅ¡ta on the SIGNAL festival and Jen Lewin, who will say something more about this amazing work. 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.300
 We are very excited to be able to install in this great public place. 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.580
 We invite you to come and play every night. 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:03.960
 This installation was designed to put people together to connect you not only with art, but with all around. 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.220
 So please come and play! 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.400
 There are over 106 small independent drivers. 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.600
 In spite of this, when someone steps on a circle, it works much like operating a mobile phone. 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.120
 So we control 60,000 LED lights, we can animate and change them. 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.320
 Installation is controlled wirelessly through tablets, computers are used to debug the installation. 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.960
 However, the installation can work without the main control computer because the individual parts communicate with each other. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.140
 The inspiration for the installation came when I was camping in Australia. 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.520
 I was camping in the place where the tide was coming, it was about 40 miles from the sea because the area was completely flat. 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.854
 When the tide fell, small ponds were left for miles away, wherever you watched. 

00:02:07.854 --> 00:02:13.154
 We went at night and when the Moon came out, it reflected in all those ponds 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.220
 and we were surrounded by illuminated ponds and of course we ran in them. 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.080
 It affected me a lot, I felt great inspiration and I wanted to create something like that, 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.040
 which took years to figure out how to implement it and before I learned to use modern technology.
