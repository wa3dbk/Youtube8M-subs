00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.769
 welcome to the new texture 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.420
 pack review namely my new pack that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:22.230
 user of explicitly blue angel 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.990
 That means that and there we are there too 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.230
 I now double Schippmann 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.080
 old chrome has his witches back on 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.180
 every case had the gag in the beginning 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.620
 just be 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.570
 Here is the enchantment sees 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.920
 in my opinion very very horny 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.900
 Here you can get more detailed here 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.540
 Watch that they are pretty cool right now 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.300
 out and then we come directly to 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.890
 armor the armor is so standard 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.900
 I do not know if that's another pack 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.180
 In any case, she does not look now 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.409
 too special but it is already 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.820
 be quite cool pack generally 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.989
 the armor is beautiful smith i know 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.559
 I just do not like this quite okay 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.670
 Of course, that could be a bit 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.530
 failed 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.070
 but that fits especially when 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.070
 sowing 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.390
 I do not like these black edges 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.390
 It 's okay 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.130
 So I put away all the power 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.840
 is terrible people in any case the 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.509
 swords the heaviest in my opinion 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.670
 after pretty pretty cool white he is 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.939
 This angel thing and that looks so cool 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.990
 somehow I do not really know 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:35.090
 A different and I think that mach 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.740
 The pack also looks really cool 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.549
 is somebody of course again in sword 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.549
 special moderately 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.800
 then the exter are quite normal 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.630
 except for the gold here this example 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.460
 now done differently than the others 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.500
 Apartment finished by another pack 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.880
 use the vehicle also looks quite 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.310
 cool and the fire is pretty good 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.040
 conspicuous because you do not tap so fast 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.380
 again the souks striking red there 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.060
 you have to get used to it, but if 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.760
 I got used to it so I have 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.780
 I can do that then 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.820
 The bow is also a natural one 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.979
 highlight so that you just right 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.220
 good from the color change does not fit 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.420
 perfect but it's just really cool 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.420
 a name in my opinion 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.930
 so 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.480
 then we come to the other stuff like 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.220
 said the axes and a better each 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.740
 iron picks and so were 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.880
 I think that changes quite cool 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:36.400
 Tnt is standard bucket of water too 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.010
 and the angel I think that's right 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.170
 cool with this thing here so that looks 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.940
 you really have to be really good 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.459
 Of course it will only be ejected 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.170
 This looks really good and then stop 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.489
 still the standards thing here I believe 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.269
 only the animal was changed 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.220
 I like iron and normal 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.280
 the gold apple title still really cool 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.709
 From here you can see the boxes 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.570
 are pretty striking so that 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.769
 For example, they go to one 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.600
 can recognize immediately 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.180
 It has helped me a lot so far 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.310
 if example, here is always such a box 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.610
 immediately falls in the eye even if it is 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.050
 so tonight is ultra important the 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.250
 Of course it also changes a bit 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.200
 Cool made healed compass 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.350
 by default and always this 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.970
 transparent to inventory my times 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.860
 I do not use too much, but in the 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.480
 pvp definitely helps me 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.540
 bit the overview better too 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.709
 save 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.780
 Generally the environment stops 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.000
 pretty vanilla let you out you have to 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.130
 just say but like it 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.049
 my pack just as much as I do 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.640
 I can not do that here again 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.920
 I have not yet shown arrows 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.720
 they are a bit too inconspicuous for me 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.400
 just in boxes if that one 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.740
 are crate and even if you are on the ground 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.730
 but it can not be all in mpeg 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.700
 be perfect for oneself and the 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.680
 Drinks are standard off 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.270
 also many things taken over by spex 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.570
 I quite okay for a truly than 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.300
 becks like 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:14.180
 and that was it already with me 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.239
 of course, the pack of golden apple still 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.070
 tells also cool from the enchantment ex 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.920
 Tour definitely looks clean too 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.690
 cool and yes so I say goodbye 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.540
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.890
 max linked in the description and we 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.890
 see us then ring next time
