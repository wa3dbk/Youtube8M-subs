that running a sixteen foot board across
the<00:00:39.850> table<00:00:40.210> saw<00:00:40.420> it's<00:00:40.900> hard<00:00:41.110> to<00:00:41.229> hold

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
the table saw it's hard to hold

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.840 
the table saw it's hard to hold
alignment<00:00:42.010> so<00:00:42.220> that<00:00:42.250> you<00:00:42.460> can<00:00:42.580> make<00:00:42.729> an

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
alignment so that you can make an

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.079 
alignment so that you can make an
accurate<00:00:43.150> cut<00:00:43.540> to<00:00:44.470> do<00:00:44.650> that<00:00:44.909> we're<00:00:45.909> going<00:00:46.030> to

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
accurate cut to do that we're going to

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:48.689 
accurate cut to do that we're going to
use<00:00:46.239> something<00:00:46.540> called<00:00:46.720> a<00:00:46.989> feather<00:00:47.260> board<00:00:47.699> it

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
use something called a feather board it

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.430 
use something called a feather board it
looks<00:00:48.729> like<00:00:49.059> this<00:00:49.299> it's<00:00:50.049> got<00:00:50.199> a<00:00:50.229> lot<00:00:50.409> of

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
looks like this it's got a lot of

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.549 
looks like this it's got a lot of
fingers<00:00:51.190> cut<00:00:51.430> in<00:00:51.580> it<00:00:51.699> and<00:00:52.049> we're<00:00:53.049> going<00:00:53.170> to<00:00:53.199> set

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
fingers cut in it and we're going to set

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.619 
fingers cut in it and we're going to set
it<00:00:53.589> up<00:00:53.799> on<00:00:53.949> our<00:00:54.070> table<00:00:54.760> saw<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:55.180> hold<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.449> wood

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
it up on our table saw to hold the wood

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.200 
it up on our table saw to hold the wood
in<00:00:55.750> place<00:00:56.040> just<00:00:57.040> step<00:00:57.250> if<00:00:57.670> we<00:00:57.760> look<00:00:57.909> over<00:00:58.059> here

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
in place just step if we look over here

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.910 
in place just step if we look over here
I'll<00:00:58.809> show<00:00:58.989> you<00:00:59.080> how<00:00:59.170> to<00:00:59.229> do<00:00:59.439> it<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.710> here<00:01:02.890> we

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
I'll show you how to do it so here we

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.880 
I'll show you how to do it so here we
have<00:01:03.159> a<00:01:03.189> sixteen<00:01:03.610> foot<00:01:03.820> board<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:05.619> want<00:01:05.740> to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
have a sixteen foot board you want to

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.880 
have a sixteen foot board you want to
run<00:01:06.040> across<00:01:06.369> this<00:01:06.520> table<00:01:06.729> saw<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:08.350> problem<00:01:08.740> is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
run across this table saw the problem is

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.550 
run across this table saw the problem is
that<00:01:09.460> in<00:01:09.580> doing<00:01:09.729> so<00:01:09.850> two<00:01:10.240> things<00:01:10.479> could<00:01:11.289> happen

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
that in doing so two things could happen

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.849 
that in doing so two things could happen
as<00:01:11.950> we're<00:01:12.130> handling<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.820> wood<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.380> board

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:14.859 
as we're handling the wood as the board

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:15.569 
as we're handling the wood as the board
comes<00:01:15.159> across

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
comes across

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:18.749 
comes across
we<00:01:16.359> may<00:01:16.509> actually<00:01:16.750> rise<00:01:17.200> up<00:01:17.590> off<00:01:18.219> the<00:01:18.549> table

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
we may actually rise up off the table

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.270 
we may actually rise up off the table
and<00:01:19.450> that<00:01:20.020> makes<00:01:20.259> it<00:01:20.380> hard<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:20.740> control<00:01:21.039> the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
and that makes it hard to control the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.910 
and that makes it hard to control the
board<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:21.700> make<00:01:21.789> an<00:01:21.909> accurate<00:01:22.210> cut<00:01:22.920> more

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
board and make an accurate cut more

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.700 
board and make an accurate cut more
importantly<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:25.780> need<00:01:25.929> to<00:01:26.049> keep<00:01:26.229> this<00:01:26.439> wood

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
importantly we need to keep this wood

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.989 
importantly we need to keep this wood
forced<00:01:27.579> against<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.210> fence<00:01:28.539> that<00:01:29.289> guides<00:01:29.999> the

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:30.999 
forced against the fence that guides the

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:35.370 
forced against the fence that guides the
wood<00:01:31.210> along<00:01:32.009> its<00:01:33.009> path<00:01:33.369> as<00:01:33.609> we<00:01:33.729> cut<00:01:33.969> it<00:01:34.380> so

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
wood along its path as we cut it so

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.730 
wood along its path as we cut it so
we're<00:01:35.740> going<00:01:35.859> to<00:01:35.950> apply<00:01:36.310> two<00:01:36.369> devices<00:01:36.939> to<00:01:37.929> this

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
we're going to apply two devices to this

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.569 
we're going to apply two devices to this
table<00:01:39.219> saw<00:01:39.399> to<00:01:39.759> control<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:41.409> movement<00:01:42.399> of<00:01:42.460> the

lumber<00:02:16.190> right<00:02:17.190> along<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.670> top<00:02:17.700> we've<00:02:18.090> got<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
lumber right along the top we've got the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.600 
lumber right along the top we've got the
board<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:19.110> we<00:02:19.230> want<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.500> cut<00:02:19.710> laying<00:02:20.100> on<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
board that we want to cut laying on the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.210 
board that we want to cut laying on the
table<00:02:21.350> and<00:02:22.350> we're<00:02:22.470> gonna<00:02:22.590> take<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:25.650> clamp<00:02:25.950> and

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
table and we're gonna take the clamp and

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.350 
table and we're gonna take the clamp and
this<00:02:26.310> takes<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.940> pretty<00:02:27.150> sizable<00:02:27.750> clamp<00:02:29.360> so

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
this takes a pretty sizable clamp so

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.010 
this takes a pretty sizable clamp so
what<00:02:30.480> we<00:02:30.600> have<00:02:30.750> on<00:02:30.930> man<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:34.440> sit<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:35.660> on<00:02:36.660> top

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
what we have on man and sit this on top

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.490 
what we have on man and sit this on top
clamping<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:37.950> board<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.400> place<00:02:39.380> we're<00:02:40.380> gonna

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
clamping this board in place we're gonna

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.900 
clamping this board in place we're gonna
prevent<00:02:42.860> these<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.040> we<00:02:44.160> want<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.459> cut<00:02:44.670> from

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
prevent these that we want to cut from

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.370 
prevent these that we want to cut from
riding<00:02:45.120> up<00:02:45.330> over<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.750> blade<00:02:47.989> so<00:02:48.989> as<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.260> can

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
riding up over the blade so as you can

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.440 
riding up over the blade so as you can
see<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.310> slide<00:02:50.580> back<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.000> forth<00:02:51.090> in

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
see this can slide back and forth in

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.840 
see this can slide back and forth in
here

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
here

but it can't lift off the table in the
same<00:02:57.650> way<00:02:57.890> we're<00:02:58.100> going<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.250> take<00:02:58.460> our<00:02:58.670> feather

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
same way we're going to take our feather

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.470 
same way we're going to take our feather
board<00:03:00.640> we're<00:03:01.640> going<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.820> place<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.270> just

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
board we're going to place it just

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.460 
board we're going to place it just
behind<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:03.200> blade<00:03:04.150> now<00:03:05.150> when<00:03:05.870> we<00:03:05.990> lay<00:03:06.170> it<00:03:06.230> here

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
behind the blade now when we lay it here

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.590 
behind the blade now when we lay it here
these<00:03:07.040> angled<00:03:07.460> fingers<00:03:07.880> will<00:03:08.390> allow<00:03:08.540> the

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
these angled fingers will allow the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.530 
these angled fingers will allow the
patent<00:03:09.260> board<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.710> pass<00:03:09.920> forward<00:03:10.390> if<00:03:11.390> they

flex<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:12.020> little<00:03:12.050> bit<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.470> they'll<00:03:12.560> keep<00:03:12.740> it

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
flex a little bit and they'll keep it

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:20.980

clamps<00:03:21.860> will<00:03:21.980> keep<00:03:22.520> it<00:03:22.670> on<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.910> table

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.550 

now<00:03:30.820> we<00:03:30.880> can<00:03:31.150> run<00:03:31.330> this<00:03:31.540> board<00:03:31.900> if<00:03:32.110> you<00:03:32.290> notice

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
now we can run this board if you notice

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.260 
now we can run this board if you notice
it<00:03:32.710> won't<00:03:32.950> it'll<00:03:33.220> feed<00:03:33.400> forward<00:03:33.700> but<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.090> won't

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
it won't it'll feed forward but it won't

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.330 
it won't it'll feed forward but it won't
pull<00:03:34.480> back<00:03:34.720> its<00:03:35.020> it<00:03:35.380> pulls<00:03:35.650> back<00:03:35.800> a<00:03:35.860> little<00:03:36.190> bit

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
pull back its it pulls back a little bit

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.320 
pull back its it pulls back a little bit
but<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.270> would<00:03:37.420> keep<00:03:37.600> it<00:03:37.810> from<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:39.430> would<00:03:40.000> reduce

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
but it would keep it from I would reduce

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.740 
but it would keep it from I would reduce
kickback<00:03:40.720> in<00:03:40.900> a<00:03:40.960> cut<00:03:41.200> so<00:03:41.920> now<00:03:42.160> as<00:03:43.090> we<00:03:43.300> feed<00:03:43.540> this

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
kickback in a cut so now as we feed this

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.940 
kickback in a cut so now as we feed this
forward<00:03:43.990> we<00:03:44.230> don't<00:03:44.410> have<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.620> worry<00:03:44.860> about

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
forward we don't have to worry about

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.460 
forward we don't have to worry about
this<00:03:45.310> thing<00:03:45.370> shifting<00:03:45.940> from<00:03:46.060> side<00:03:46.300> to<00:03:46.360> side<00:03:46.540> we

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
this thing shifting from side to side we

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.960 
this thing shifting from side to side we
don't<00:03:47.620> have<00:03:47.710> to<00:03:47.800> worry<00:03:48.010> about<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.490> lifting<00:03:48.850> off

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
don't have to worry about it lifting off

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.370 
don't have to worry about it lifting off
the<00:03:49.120> blade<00:03:49.330> we<00:03:49.660> can<00:03:49.840> just<00:03:49.990> feed<00:03:50.200> it<00:03:50.350> through

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
the blade we can just feed it through

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.210 
the blade we can just feed it through
and<00:03:51.930> it'll<00:03:52.930> make<00:03:53.080> the<00:03:53.560> three<00:03:53.800> quarter<00:03:54.070> inch

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
and it'll make the three quarter inch

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.110 
and it'll make the three quarter inch
cut<00:03:54.490> that<00:03:54.670> we<00:03:54.850> need<00:03:55.090> for<00:03:55.840> our<00:03:55.960> project<00:03:55.990> today

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
cut that we need for our project today

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.430 
cut that we need for our project today
so<00:03:58.120> this<00:03:58.240> is<00:03:58.300> how<00:03:58.660> you<00:03:58.720> set<00:03:58.960> up<00:03:58.990> a<00:03:59.200> feather

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
so this is how you set up a feather

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.080 
so this is how you set up a feather
board<00:03:59.710> to<00:03:59.860> control<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.370> position<00:04:00.640> of<00:04:00.940> your
