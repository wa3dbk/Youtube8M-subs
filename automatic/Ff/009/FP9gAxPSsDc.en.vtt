00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.519
 my dream is a pipe dream 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.000
 if you deal with this question 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.780
 then we deal with 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.880
 klien number one of us men 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:22.369
 Strategy and that is the theme of the goal 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.050
 clarity so people dealing with the 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.390
 question is my dream one 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.050
 illusions are in the following situation 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.090
 they have two voices and a 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.399
 agree b these two are the ones who say 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.890
 different things are the same 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.239
 loud and because the same equal 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.190
 We are also powerful in the 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.850
 situation that we doubt and 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.969
 think 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.280
 Our dream is a fantasy 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.170
 say the two votes agree says that 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.019
 does not sound right says the will 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.120
 they make that a say your dream 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.280
 is a figment of imagination agree de says something 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.289
 completely different voice as I said that 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.690
 is really super fast as I said 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:03.589
 that will work and agree b says 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.960
 do that for as long as the two agree 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.000
 we are not loud at the same time 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.560
 this is our task 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.510
 is it the balance between these 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.840
 Both are disturbing as we do 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.880
 the 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.270
 We'll do that the way we do 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.790
 want that voice gets louder than 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.920
 then we just have to go 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.840
 and the people who visit say 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.310
 your dream is a fantasy that will 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.409
 do not work and how will she do it 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.640
 make sense if we often enough from the outside 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.110
 holland that our dream 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.399
 then we believe 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.250
 At some point we believe that someday 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.950
 and if that leaves us from our dream if 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.270
 but we want that to be quieter 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.310
 and agree b gets bigger than voice and 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.780
 gets louder and then becomes more powerful 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.859
 we have to and now that is 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.420
 crucial step and the 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:50.890
 key message from this video 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.250
 then we have to look for role models 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.469
 role models are people who ever 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.570
 have realized similar dreams as we have 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.250
 straight in the head you'll be in groups 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.270
 you will find the forums you 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.920
 you will be on different 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.719
 find websites and there must be 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.009
 a little rum suggestion if you are there 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.200
 then you will contact me 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.420
 realize that your dream is not 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.130
 it's just that you are simple 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.720
 just have to know what's next 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.490
 step what are the next steps 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.710

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.660
 realize message on this 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.550
 job seeks the role models active steps 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.280
 their books were in contact with them 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.920
 then go to the lectures book then seminaries and 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.310
 look what's the next step 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.310
