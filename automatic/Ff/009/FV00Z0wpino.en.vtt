00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.080
 hello guys in this video we will go to 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.139
 see how to use the tool 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.490
 cutter is the straighten tool for 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.859
 first we notice that on the tab 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.869
 this little cutter is present 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.050
 downwards which indicates a 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.910
 window menu just press and hold with 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.789
 mouse over the icon and that's it 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.500
 our menu appears raw camera gives us 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.320
 the possibility of choosing clippings 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.809
 already preset proportions like 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.430
 for example one by one 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.480
 still here holding the mouse and 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.550
 dragging it towards one of the four 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.309
 corners 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.210
 here we have ours ours 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.649
 paul proportion maintained the same 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.030
 what if we go to one of the four 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.870
 corners to zoom in or out on 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.650
 but our clipping though 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.880
 always the same proportions 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.570
 we also have the opportunity to 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.549
 choose us 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:18.630
 here is the personal clipping 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:25.979
 we of values for example 25 will have a 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:29.310
 very useful panoramic cut 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.720
 also this function shows 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:38.159
 overlap that comes up and comes 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:41.570
 off this useful grid to hold 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.570
 account of the rule of thirds 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.290
 finally we have the possibility of 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.450
 cancel the cropping or of course 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.850
 set it again as in the photo 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:58.500
 start another little trick if 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.060
 we want if we want to use a 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.689
 cut to our liking 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:08.550
 we set on the normal take the photo 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.420
 that is, we create our own cutting e 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.970
 keeping the shift key pressed 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.870
 will keep 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.470
 in proportions to the body it will maintain 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.950
 these proportions 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:27.930
 let's also see the tool 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.930
 straighten we delete our clipping 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.690
 tool straightens this is a lot 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.730
 simple 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.460
 serves as can be seen from the name 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.300
 it serves precisely to straighten out ours 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.010
 photo 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.140
 in this case we see here that 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.420
 the horizon slightly inclined towards 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:55.660
 the lower right so we 'll go to 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:01.380
 count on the horizon hold 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:04.000
 drawing a line will suffice to put it 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.850
 perfectly leave on the horizon 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.340
 mouse and here is the camera raw effect 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.550
 this little one this little one 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.330
 inclination we go to click two 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.120
 times 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:20.200
 inside the photo and here for ours 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.390
 photo is perfectly straight guys with 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.360
 this is all I greet you and see you 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.420
 for the next appointment in which vi 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.080
 I'll talk about stain removal 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.080
 Hi everyone
