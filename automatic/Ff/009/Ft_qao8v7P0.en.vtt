00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:10.450
 or it's a bit of a break because it's 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.480
 August but before going on vacation 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.830
 I'm going to leave you one last recipe 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.180
 very simple a classic and very 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.100
 summer sangria 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.350
 we need a big jug 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.240
 we put the bottle of red wine how much 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.890
 the better the wine, the better the 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.210
 sangria but the truth is that as we go 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.400
 to add many other ingredients 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.650
 does not make much sense to spend 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.720
 money in a super expensive wine also will 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.730
 we add a couple of tablespoons of sugar 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.920
 and now we are going to stir well until 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.199
 dissolves you have to have patience there 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.300
 to be there and removing 23 minutes 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:44.519
 at least and then we peel the 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.519
 peaches and are the key to the recipe 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.930
 we chop them 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.940
 and we incorporate them 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.180
 stir well 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.969
 and now let's add the juice of 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.969
 orange 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.200
 we squeeze the oranges 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.880
 and we add the juice 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.830
 we remove again well 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.650
 and finally we are going to put a 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.110
 little trickle of gin 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.689
 vermouth time encounter who puts rum 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.280
 the touch of liquor because it goes to tastes of 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.590
 done to me what I like the most is the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.810
 peach well macerated back we move 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.729
 well and we're going to leave a fridge a 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.770
 minimum of two hours in what it is 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.720
 is that the peach absorb how much 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.149
 more liquid better spent that time 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.789
 let's add siphon is the drink 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.979
 carbonated that will give a gaseous touch 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.690
 to the sangria we remove again if not 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.370
 it's cold enough, you put more 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.989
 ice although I recommend that the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.819
 ice is put in the glasses and not in the 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.959
 bleeding so that it is not water and this already 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.360
 It's good I hope you liked it 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.540
 Holiday delights from a hug up 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.540
 then
