00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.340
 for the mission 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.430
 top 10 biggest threats to the 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.430
 human civilization 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.740
 and artificial intelligence our 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.630
 quality of life has improved a lot 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.060
 thanks to the development of computers and 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.800
 increasingly complex robots but it 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.570
 there is a risk that these machines will 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.970
 make smarter than your own 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.760
 people and then constitute a 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.710
 real threat to the human race there are already 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.650
 robots that are capable of feeding on 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.420
 the biomass of nature so if 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.489
 they became aware that their 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.170
 food is not unlimited could 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.930
 organize to take over the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.820
 natural resources scientists 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.589
 establish the probabilities of said 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.589
 scenario between 0 and 10% 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.820
 something unknown everyone knows that 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.739
 we do not know everything there may be 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.020
 other civilizations in the universe with 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.700
 which we have not yet contacted and 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.560
 that when the time comes, it's because 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.230
 that civilization wants to take over 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.090
 our planet can also be that 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.610
 scientists simply discover 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.500
 some unknown phenomenon that results 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.229
 very dangerous for the survival of 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.540
 the human race the clearest example is 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.000
 that of aerosols whose intensive use 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.150
 was destroying the ozone layer what 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.530
 which was discovered after many years 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.450
 the odds of something like that 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.450
 occur are from 0 01% 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.520
 biochemical attack the human being in his 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.830
 industrial activity uses pathogens 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.869
 that if they are released to the environment 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.180
 they could attack their own 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.070
 human or damage some aspect of the 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.799
 ecosystem that is key to the race 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.049
 human, but not only could it be 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.909
 root of a fortuitous accident in the 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.009
 In recent years, the 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.330
 number of terrorists in the world and 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.659
 these could use agents 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.039
 biochemicals as a weapon of destruction 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.989
 the odds of something like that 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.989
 occur are 0.01 percent 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.650
 extreme climate change the change 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.450
 climatic has become the 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.849
 recent years in a great challenge for the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.620
 humanity there are many meetings of 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.989
 rulers in which the 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.910
 responsibilities of each country and in 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.040
 that small goals are set as 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.950
 objective but you never get to 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.830
 comply if climate change reaches 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.780
 to be extreme there would be great famines and 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.930
 large migrations of people from areas 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.220
 of the planet that would be uninhabitable 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.769
 the odds of something like that 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.120
 occur are 0 01 percent in the 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.120
 next 200 years 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.090
 nuclear war there is a lot of armament 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.920
 nuclear scattered around the world and that 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.470
 despite the efforts of the nations 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.390
 united to reduce their number the 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.310
 Recent conflict in Eastern Europe- a 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.080
 root of the Ukrainian crisis has 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.930
 rekindled the old tensions between 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.240
 russia and usa and he reminded us of the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.040
 risk of a nuclear war there 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.290
 enough nuclear weapons to 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.240
 destroy almost all of humanity and the 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.520
 few who remained would be unable to 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.220
 survive the nuclear radiation would 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.960
 impossible any way of life 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.510
 odds that something like this will happen 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.020
 are 0 01 percent in the next 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.020
 100 years 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.210
 impact of an asteroid the theory that 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.720
 explains the extinction of dinosaurs 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.520
 65 million years ago is that a 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.520
 great asteroid hit the planet 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.440
 land every 20 million years is usually 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.840
 drop an asteroid of about 5 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.730
 kilometers in diameter size with which 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.040
 the destruction of countries would take place 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.780
 complete and with which the climate would remain 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.330
 so touched that survival in the 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.070
 planet would be very difficult the 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.680
 odds that something like this will happen 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.680
 they are 00001 3% 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.489
 global pandemic in recent years 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.280
 has been repeatedly alerted by the 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:18.130
 possibility of a global pandemic in 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.419
 2014 was a virus with the Ebola virus 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.669
 for which there is no treatment 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.110
 effective and that managed to expand 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.150
 widely by Africa and that 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.270
 subsequently caused some contagion 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.729
 in europe and usa the world is so 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.650
 interconnected that any virus can 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.410
 expand quickly and infect 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.990
 millions of people if the virus were 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.240
 very contagious could infect so much 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.160
 people that the drastic reduction of 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.770
 world population would make it very difficult 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.510
 survival of the human race the 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.910
 odds that something like this will happen 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.910
 they are 0000 1% 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.069
 supervolcano throughout history has 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.719
 there were large volcanic eruptions that 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:03.090
 have produced terror and destruction 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:05.090
 large-scale vesuvian eruption 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.800
 destroyed the city of pompeii 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.020
 belonging to the old Roman empire and 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.879
 three thousand years ago civilization 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.580
 Minoan was also razed by another 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:17.039
 volcano a great volcano could pour 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.719
 as much dust and ashes into the atmosphere that 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.029
 would be able to cause a quick 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:22.770
 cooling the planet the 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:26.900
 odds that something like this will happen 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.900
 are from 0 0 0 0 1 % 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.160
 collapse of the capitalist system the 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.840
 causes of such collapse could be bad 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.760
 decisions of the rulers of the 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.100
 countries that will cause anger and 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.110
 uprising of the population or also 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.930
 conflicts between nations over the domain 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.700
 of natural resources the areas in 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.950
 the one that the confrontations grow with 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.780
 faster are those in which 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.600
 There is more economic difference between your 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.100
 people may not clashes 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.800
 result in the collapse of the system 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.870
 capitalist but they could originate 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.870
 very dangerous totalitarian movements 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.919
 ecological collapse every year they become extinct 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:14.219
 a large number of animals and species of 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:16.499
 plants our life and the lives of others 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:18.779
 animals depends on the balance of a 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:20.490
 ecosystem complex so if the 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:22.680
 extinctions came to affect 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.969
 key links of the ecosystem are 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.969
 it would produce a catastrophic collapse 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.240
 if the video you found informative 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.880
 please give thumb up and share 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.670
 with your friends would help me to be able 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.370
 keep doing jobs so you can 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.200
 add me on twitter and facebook has you 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.470
 spoken ozymandias and I wish you good
