00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
bit we're gonna catch up to the group of

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.960 
bit we're gonna catch up to the group of
smaller<00:04:50.980> cars<00:04:51.250> because<00:04:51.460> they<00:04:51.580> let<00:04:51.760> out<00:04:51.880> all

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
smaller cars because they let out all

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.490 
smaller cars because they let out all
the<00:04:52.120> fast<00:04:52.330> cars<00:04:52.570> do<00:04:52.720> a<00:04:52.750> half<00:04:52.960> alive<00:04:53.170> and<00:04:53.230> then

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
the fast cars do a half alive and then

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.650 
the fast cars do a half alive and then
the<00:04:53.620> smaller<00:04:53.950> ones<00:04:54.250> so<00:04:54.730> basis<00:04:55.090> of<00:04:55.210> a<00:04:55.300> bean's<00:04:55.540> is

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
the smaller ones so basis of a bean's is

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.420 
the smaller ones so basis of a bean's is
you're<00:04:55.810> doing<00:04:55.930> about<00:04:56.230> three-quarters<00:04:57.190> of<00:04:57.220> a

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
you're doing about three-quarters of a

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.610 
you're doing about three-quarters of a
lap<00:04:57.640> without<00:04:57.880> any<00:04:58.210> trouble<00:04:58.720> and<00:04:58.900> then<00:04:59.350> you<00:04:59.470> run

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
lap without any trouble and then you run

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.470 
lap without any trouble and then you run
into<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.950> slower<00:05:00.190> people<00:05:00.520> which<00:05:00.640> is<00:05:00.670> a<00:05:00.970> skill

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
into the slower people which is a skill

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.810 
into the slower people which is a skill
of<00:05:01.630> how<00:05:01.750> can<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.080> dodge<00:05:02.380> them<00:05:02.710> and<00:05:02.920> this<00:05:03.670> is

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
of how can you dodge them and this is

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.430 
of how can you dodge them and this is
