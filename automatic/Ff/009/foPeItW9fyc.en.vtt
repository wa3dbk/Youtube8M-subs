00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
it's actually pretty cool and you can

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.660 
it's actually pretty cool and you can
turn<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.230> off<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.920> where<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.219> not<00:00:35.340> always

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
turn this off to where it's not always

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.389 
turn this off to where it's not always
on<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.450> if<00:00:36.570> we<00:00:36.719> scroll<00:00:36.989> down<00:00:37.050> here<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.160> see

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
on so if we scroll down here you can see

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.369 
on so if we scroll down here you can see
the<00:00:38.760> 3d<00:00:39.059> card<00:00:39.480> view<00:00:39.660> right<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:39.899> we'll<00:00:40.230> turn

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
the 3d card view right here we'll turn

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.020 
the 3d card view right here we'll turn
that<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.770> where<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.040> not<00:00:41.160> always<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.820> and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
that to where it's not always on and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.240 
that to where it's not always on and
that<00:00:42.510> way<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:43.230> exactly<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.800> same<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.160> it

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
that way it's exactly the same as it

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.400 
that way it's exactly the same as it
usually<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.610> except<00:00:45.120> when<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.329> scroll<00:00:45.719> which

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
usually is except when you scroll which

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.619 
usually is except when you scroll which
is<00:00:46.559> actually<00:00:46.890> my<00:00:47.160> favorite<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:48.239> for<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.570> to

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
is actually my favorite I like for it to

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.529 
is actually my favorite I like for it to
be<00:00:49.039> upright<00:00:50.039> until<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.610> start<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.940> scroll<00:00:51.239> and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
be upright until you start to scroll and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.260 
be upright until you start to scroll and
then<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.079> turns<00:00:52.320> into<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.829> 3d<00:00:53.460> view<00:00:53.879> it

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
then it turns into that 3d view it

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.000 
then it turns into that 3d view it
actually<00:00:54.660> looks<00:00:54.899> pretty<00:00:54.989> cool<00:00:55.199> now<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:55.860> go

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
actually looks pretty cool now if we go

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.529 
actually looks pretty cool now if we go
back<00:00:56.190> into<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.640> settings<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.360> look

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
back into the settings here and we look

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.630 
back into the settings here and we look
at<00:00:57.690> some<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.140> options<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.489> have
