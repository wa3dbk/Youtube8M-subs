in<00:00:11.550> this<00:00:12.510> segment<00:00:12.750> we're<00:00:13.050> going<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.200> add<00:00:13.380> a

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
in this segment we're going to add a

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.070 
in this segment we're going to add a
little<00:00:13.650> noise<00:00:13.889> back<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:14.580> our<00:00:15.180> image<00:00:15.360> to

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
little noise back in our image to

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.340 
little noise back in our image to
compensate<00:00:17.270> for<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.360> fact<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.720> we<00:00:18.930> ran<00:00:19.140> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
compensate for the fact that we ran the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.650 
compensate for the fact that we ran the
noise<00:00:19.529> reduction<00:00:19.920> filter<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.820> what<00:00:21.570> I'm

we're not going to want uniform will
choose<00:01:06.900> Gaussian<00:01:07.470> because<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.010> little

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
choose Gaussian because it's a little

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.320 
choose Gaussian because it's a little
more<00:01:08.340> random<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.060> we'll<00:01:09.150> choose

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
more random and we'll choose

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.630 
more random and we'll choose
monochromatic<00:01:10.080> before<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:10.950> add<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.400> this

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
monochromatic before we add it like this

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.399 
monochromatic before we add it like this
let's<00:01:12.270> change<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.810> blending<00:01:13.140> mode<00:01:13.170> to

let's change the blending mode to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.320 
let's change the blending mode to
overlay<00:01:13.980> which<00:01:14.190> is<00:01:14.370> what<00:01:14.520> will<00:01:14.670> eventually<00:01:14.790> do

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
overlay which is what will eventually do

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.880

context<00:01:20.390> let's<00:01:21.390> go<00:01:21.720> into<00:01:21.960> two<00:01:22.170> hundred

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.810 
context let's go into two hundred
percent<00:01:24.829> we'll<00:01:25.829> see<00:01:26.040> what<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> noise<00:01:26.430> does

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820

here<00:01:27.180> we'll<00:01:28.079> go<00:01:28.200> filter<00:01:28.649> noise<00:01:29.340> add<00:01:30.110> noise

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
here we'll go filter noise add noise

here we'll go filter noise add noise
we're<00:01:32.579> going<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.790> choose<00:01:33.000> Gaussian<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.840> see

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
we're going to choose Gaussian and see

we're going to choose Gaussian and see
the<00:01:34.680> color<00:01:34.920> noise<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.430> actually<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.969> byproduct

the color noise is actually a byproduct

of a digital camera sensor if we choose

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.550 
of a digital camera sensor if we choose
monochromatic<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:41.430> almost<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
monochromatic it's almost going to

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.600 
monochromatic it's almost going to
approximate<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.770> old<00:01:43.890> kind<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.250> noise<00:01:44.430> you

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
approximate the old kind of noise you

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.389 
approximate the old kind of noise you
get<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:45.090> film<00:01:45.420> grain<00:01:45.719> which<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.829> it

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
get like film grain which is it

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.069 
get like film grain which is it
complements<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> colors<00:01:48.600> now<00:01:48.780> we're<00:01:48.990> going

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
complements the colors now we're going

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.330 
complements the colors now we're going
to<00:01:49.140> go<00:01:49.200> way<00:01:49.560> down<00:01:50.009> about<00:01:50.670> two<00:01:50.969> percent<00:01:51.149> noise

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
to go way down about two percent noise

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.730 
to go way down about two percent noise
see<00:01:53.340> how<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:54.539> adds<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.930> little<00:01:55.259> bit<00:01:55.409> of

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.219 

like<00:01:58.740> grain<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.630> this<00:02:00.630> might<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> little

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
like grain to it this might be a little

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.670 
like grain to it this might be a little
too<00:02:01.350> much<00:02:01.649> i'll<00:02:01.859> go<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.159> 1.5<00:02:03.289> and<00:02:04.289> just<00:02:04.560> a

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
too much i'll go like 1.5 and just a

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.069 
too much i'll go like 1.5 and just a
little<00:02:04.799> bit<00:02:05.070> i<00:02:05.390> think<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.750> would<00:02:06.960> work

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
little bit i think this would work

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.499 
little bit i think this would work
better<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.619> portrait<00:02:08.399> than<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.360> with

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
better on a portrait than really with

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.720 
better on a portrait than really with
these<00:02:09.690> dogs<00:02:09.960> but<00:02:10.320> want<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.250> show<00:02:11.460> you<00:02:11.520> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
these dogs but want to show you the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.030 
these dogs but want to show you the
technique<00:02:12.000> here<00:02:12.420> anyway<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.350> we'll<00:02:13.530> set<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.800> to

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
technique here anyway so we'll set it to

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.910 
technique here anyway so we'll set it to
like<00:02:14.160> 1.5<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.690> we<00:02:16.050> can<00:02:16.200> set<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.650> off<00:02:16.890> a

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
like 1.5 and we can set this off a

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.070 
like 1.5 and we can set this off a
little<00:02:17.250> bit<00:02:17.430> if<00:02:17.700> we<00:02:17.880> blur<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.300> noise<00:02:18.480> slightly

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
little bit if we blur the noise slightly

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.610 
little bit if we blur the noise slightly
so<00:02:19.320> i'm<00:02:19.410> going<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.590> go<00:02:19.800> filter<00:02:20.720> blur<00:02:21.720> Gaussian

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
so i'm going to go filter blur Gaussian

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.890 
so i'm going to go filter blur Gaussian
blur<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.160> give<00:02:23.820> it<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.060> minimum<00:02:24.480> blur<00:02:24.690> that

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
blur and give it the minimum blur that

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.250 
blur and give it the minimum blur that
you<00:02:24.990> can

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
you can

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.759 
you can
even<00:02:25.470> apply<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.959> 0.3<00:02:27.959> is<00:02:28.049> about<00:02:28.290> all<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.680> will

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
even apply is 0.3 is about all it will

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.390 
even apply is 0.3 is about all it will
take<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:29.959> turn<00:02:30.959> off<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.200> preview<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.040> can<00:02:32.069> see

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
take I turn off the preview you can see

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.699 
take I turn off the preview you can see
how<00:02:32.519> it's<00:02:32.670> having<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.060> slight<00:02:33.329> effect<00:02:33.709> probably

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
how it's having a slight effect probably

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.190 
how it's having a slight effect probably
better<00:02:34.860> see<00:02:35.189> it<00:02:35.280> here<00:02:35.519> in<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.760> window<00:02:36.239> see

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
better see it here in this window see

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.740 
better see it here in this window see
how<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.379> blurring<00:02:38.189> is<00:02:38.459> just<00:02:38.730> softening<00:02:39.599> it

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
how the blurring is just softening it

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.020 
how the blurring is just softening it
slightly<00:02:41.150> there<00:02:42.150> we<00:02:42.329> go<00:02:43.519> now<00:02:44.519> let's<00:02:44.670> have<00:02:44.909> a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
slightly there we go now let's have a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.850 
slightly there we go now let's have a
look<00:02:45.090> here<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.970> there's<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.110> before<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.829> the

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
look here and there's the before and the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.750 
look here and there's the before and the
after<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.030> can<00:02:51.629> see<00:02:51.840> how<00:02:52.019> it<00:02:52.400> this<00:02:53.400> isn't

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
after and you can see how it this isn't

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.940 
after and you can see how it this isn't
skin<00:02:54.090> texture<00:02:54.569> for<00:02:54.780> skin<00:02:55.019> texture<00:02:55.470> would<00:02:55.739> work

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
skin texture for skin texture would work

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.069 
skin texture for skin texture would work
great<00:02:56.220> but<00:02:56.790> even<00:02:57.030> though<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:57.329> is<00:02:57.540> fur<00:02:57.840> you

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
great but even though this is fur you

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.229 
great but even though this is fur you
can<00:02:58.230> see<00:02:58.440> how<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.620> kind<00:02:58.859> of<00:02:58.980> helps<00:02:59.879> clear<00:03:00.209> up

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
can see how it kind of helps clear up

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.059 
can see how it kind of helps clear up
these<00:03:00.569> areas<00:03:01.049> that<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.440> noise<00:03:01.680> reduction

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
these areas that the noise reduction

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.390 
these areas that the noise reduction
filter<00:03:02.700> hit<00:03:03.049> it<00:03:04.049> just<00:03:04.290> makes<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:04.709> smooth

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
filter hit it just makes it so smooth

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.849 
filter hit it just makes it so smooth
that<00:03:05.430> like<00:03:06.120> right<00:03:06.389> here<00:03:06.659> even<00:03:06.959> even<00:03:07.709> with<00:03:07.829> a

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
that like right here even even with a

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.129 
that like right here even even with a
background<00:03:08.129> gradient<00:03:08.639> it's<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:09.750> smooth<00:03:10.109> that

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
background gradient it's so smooth that

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.379 
background gradient it's so smooth that
it<00:03:10.440> looks<00:03:10.620> kind<00:03:10.889> of<00:03:10.950> fake<00:03:11.159> but<00:03:11.489> this<00:03:11.760> adds<00:03:12.000> a

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
it looks kind of fake but this adds a

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.280 
it looks kind of fake but this adds a
little<00:03:12.959> bit<00:03:13.109> of<00:03:13.230> look<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.709> film<00:03:13.950> grain<00:03:14.310> to<00:03:14.670> it

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
little bit of look of film grain to it

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.140 
little bit of look of film grain to it
now<00:03:16.290> I'm<00:03:16.980> going<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.340> back<00:03:17.549> off<00:03:17.790> from<00:03:17.819> the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
now I'm going to back off from the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.240 
now I'm going to back off from the
opacity<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.780> little<00:03:19.109> bit<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.470> just<00:03:19.709> dial<00:03:20.040> in

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
opacity a little bit and just dial in

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.460 
opacity a little bit and just dial in
enough<00:03:20.549> where<00:03:20.849> it's<00:03:21.060> just<00:03:21.299> starting<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.230> be

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
enough where it's just starting to be

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.449 
enough where it's just starting to be
noticeable<00:03:23.959> depending<00:03:24.959> on<00:03:25.079> your<00:03:25.290> uses<00:03:26.280> like

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
noticeable depending on your uses like

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.149 
noticeable depending on your uses like
say<00:03:26.879> it's<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.120> portrait<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:28.500> facial<00:03:28.799> layers

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
say it's a portrait on facial layers

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.860 
say it's a portrait on facial layers
this<00:03:29.489> will<00:03:29.639> work<00:03:29.760> real<00:03:30.030> well<00:03:30.060> it'll<00:03:30.449> give<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.810> a

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
this will work real well it'll give it a

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.680 
this will work real well it'll give it a
skin<00:03:31.470> tone<00:03:31.709> kind<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.099> look<00:03:32.810> there<00:03:35.510> we'll<00:03:36.510> keep

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
skin tone kind of look there we'll keep

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.420 
skin tone kind of look there we'll keep
it<00:03:36.870> about<00:03:37.019> like<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.290> another<00:03:37.949> trick<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.370> can

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
it about like that another trick you can

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.879 
it about like that another trick you can
do<00:03:38.760> i<00:03:38.790> call<00:03:39.359> it<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.540> olive<00:03:39.959> in<00:03:40.079> the<00:03:40.169> martini<00:03:40.620> is

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
do i call it the olive in the martini is

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.520 
do i call it the olive in the martini is
to<00:03:41.459> add<00:03:41.579> another<00:03:41.730> layer<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.239> noise<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:43.410> i'm

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
to add another layer of noise and i'm

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.990 
to add another layer of noise and i'm
going<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.739> call<00:03:43.949> this<00:03:44.129> one<00:03:44.190> fine<00:03:45.000> noise<00:03:47.000> same

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
going to call this one fine noise same

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.559 
going to call this one fine noise same
thing<00:03:48.299> shift<00:03:49.109> f5<00:03:49.349> we're<00:03:49.919> going<00:03:50.069> to<00:03:50.389> fill<00:03:51.389> this

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
thing shift f5 we're going to fill this

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.110 
thing shift f5 we're going to fill this
with<00:03:51.840> fifty<00:03:52.230> percent<00:03:52.590> gray<00:03:52.949> and<00:03:53.790> set<00:03:53.970> the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
with fifty percent gray and set the

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.039 
with fifty percent gray and set the
blending<00:03:54.449> mode<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.690> overlay<00:03:56.840> lock<00:03:57.840> its

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
blending mode to overlay lock its

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.800 
blending mode to overlay lock its
position<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:59.400> this<00:04:00.000> time<00:04:00.209> i'm<00:04:00.389> going<00:04:00.569> to<00:04:00.660> add

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
position and this time i'm going to add

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.059 
position and this time i'm going to add
noise<00:04:01.970> same<00:04:02.970> thing<00:04:03.560> but<00:04:04.560> i'm<00:04:04.709> going<00:04:04.859> to<00:04:04.919> add

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
noise same thing but i'm going to add

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.640 
noise same thing but i'm going to add
the<00:04:05.310> minimum<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:06.239> will<00:04:06.389> even<00:04:06.660> take<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.260> that

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
the minimum that will even take and that

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.360 
the minimum that will even take and that
is<00:04:07.829> 0.5<00:04:08.819> any<00:04:09.269> lower<00:04:09.720> than<00:04:09.870> this<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:11.159> won't

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
is 0.5 any lower than this and you won't

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.039 
is 0.5 any lower than this and you won't
even<00:04:11.489> notice<00:04:11.819> it<00:04:12.150> in<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.299> window<00:04:12.540> let's<00:04:12.870> try

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
even notice it in the window let's try

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:21.020 
even notice it in the window let's try
0.3<00:04:17.570> you<00:04:18.570> can<00:04:18.750> barely<00:04:19.139> see<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.680> 0.5<00:04:20.549> is<00:04:20.760> about

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
0.3 you can barely see it 0.5 is about

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.089 
0.3 you can barely see it 0.5 is about
the<00:04:21.150> minimum<00:04:21.510> that<00:04:21.810> will<00:04:22.019> even<00:04:22.289> register<00:04:22.830> and

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
the minimum that will even register and

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.460 
the minimum that will even register and
it's<00:04:23.729> so<00:04:23.940> fine<00:04:24.330> that<00:04:26.870> you<00:04:27.870> can<00:04:28.080> see<00:04:28.349> it<00:04:28.440> a

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
it's so fine that you can see it a

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.160 
it's so fine that you can see it a
little<00:04:28.560> bit<00:04:28.800> let's<00:04:28.979> zoom<00:04:29.370> in<00:04:29.490> some

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.340 

let's<00:04:36.170> look<00:04:36.410> it<00:04:36.590> over<00:04:36.710> here<00:04:37.660> you<00:04:38.660> can<00:04:38.930> see<00:04:39.200> the

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
let's look it over here you can see the

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.400 
let's look it over here you can see the
difference<00:04:40.480> there<00:04:41.480> we<00:04:41.630> go<00:04:43.510> 0.5<00:04:44.510> just<00:04:44.840> smallest

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
difference there we go 0.5 just smallest

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.210 
difference there we go 0.5 just smallest
amount<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:47.630> next<00:04:47.840> step<00:04:48.140> just<00:04:48.500> consists

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
amount and the next step just consists

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.650 
amount and the next step just consists
in<00:04:49.780> mixing<00:04:50.780> our<00:04:51.400> layers<00:04:52.400> to<00:04:53.060> get<00:04:53.270> just<00:04:53.540> the

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
in mixing our layers to get just the

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.150 
in mixing our layers to get just the
perfect<00:04:53.870> effect<00:04:54.440> on<00:04:56.230> the<00:04:57.230> noise<00:04:57.380> reduction<00:04:57.830> in

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
perfect effect on the noise reduction in

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.220 
perfect effect on the noise reduction in
sharpening<00:04:58.670> layer<00:04:58.940> I've<00:04:59.240> got<00:04:59.600> a<00:04:59.630> hundred

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
sharpening layer I've got a hundred

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.610 
sharpening layer I've got a hundred
percent<00:05:00.380> of<00:05:00.710> opacity<00:05:01.100> now<00:05:01.760> if<00:05:02.000> you<00:05:02.780> sharpen<00:05:03.530> a

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
percent of opacity now if you sharpen a

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.050 
percent of opacity now if you sharpen a
little<00:05:03.860> bit<00:05:03.980> too<00:05:04.160> much<00:05:04.370> or<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.700> effect<00:05:04.760> was

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
little bit too much or the effect was

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.760 
little bit too much or the effect was
too<00:05:05.270> strong<00:05:05.570> you<00:05:05.630> could<00:05:05.960> back<00:05:06.170> off<00:05:06.200> in<00:05:06.650> this

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
too strong you could back off in this

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.430 
too strong you could back off in this
case<00:05:07.010> I<00:05:07.190> like<00:05:07.430> it<00:05:07.640> but<00:05:07.880> I<00:05:08.150> can<00:05:09.050> back<00:05:09.200> off<00:05:09.380> a

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
case I like it but I can back off a

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.850 
case I like it but I can back off a
little<00:05:09.740> bit<00:05:09.950> I<00:05:10.190> kept<00:05:11.030> less<00:05:12.020> than<00:05:12.230> half<00:05:12.470> of<00:05:12.680> this

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
little bit I kept less than half of this

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.080 
little bit I kept less than half of this
layers<00:05:13.160> noise<00:05:13.550> and<00:05:15.010> maybe<00:05:16.010> this<00:05:16.280> fine<00:05:16.550> noise<00:05:16.850> I

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
layers noise and maybe this fine noise I

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.580 
layers noise and maybe this fine noise I
won't<00:05:17.300> even<00:05:17.480> keep<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:17.780> total<00:05:18.320> hundred

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
won't even keep the total hundred

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.180 
won't even keep the total hundred
percent<00:05:19.810> but<00:05:20.810> that<00:05:20.990> fine<00:05:21.320> noise<00:05:21.590> works<00:05:21.950> real

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
percent but that fine noise works real

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.820 
percent but that fine noise works real
well<00:05:22.220> just<00:05:23.210> to<00:05:23.330> cover<00:05:23.570> that<00:05:24.200> way<00:05:24.320> you<00:05:24.380> don't<00:05:24.620> go

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
well just to cover that way you don't go

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.350 
well just to cover that way you don't go
too<00:05:24.890> much<00:05:25.250> with<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:25.610> rough<00:05:25.790> noise<00:05:26.030> which

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
too much with the rough noise which

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.560 
too much with the rough noise which
approximates<00:05:27.110> on<00:05:27.590> a<00:05:27.620> portrait<00:05:28.180> pours<00:05:29.180> on<00:05:29.420> the

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
approximates on a portrait pours on the

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.520 
approximates on a portrait pours on the
skin<00:05:30.160> but<00:05:31.160> then<00:05:31.370> this<00:05:31.580> one<00:05:31.850> just<00:05:32.530> approximates

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
skin but then this one just approximates

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.360 
skin but then this one just approximates
the<00:05:33.650> finest<00:05:34.250> film<00:05:35.150> grain<00:05:35.950> now<00:05:36.950> let's<00:05:37.190> look

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
the finest film grain now let's look

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.130 
the finest film grain now let's look
over<00:05:37.550> here<00:05:37.850> where<00:05:38.060> two<00:05:38.330> hundred<00:05:38.600> percent<00:05:38.960> so

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
over here where two hundred percent so

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.710 
over here where two hundred percent so
she<00:05:39.200> should<00:05:39.560> be<00:05:39.680> able<00:05:39.770> to<00:05:39.920> see<00:05:40.100> it<00:05:40.130> pretty<00:05:40.340> well

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
she should be able to see it pretty well

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.330 
she should be able to see it pretty well
even<00:05:41.720> this<00:05:41.870> I'm<00:05:42.170> going<00:05:42.380> to<00:05:42.440> drop<00:05:42.950> it<00:05:43.010> a<00:05:43.220> little

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
even this I'm going to drop it a little

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.770 
even this I'm going to drop it a little
bit<00:05:44.560> but<00:05:45.560> between<00:05:45.860> the<00:05:45.980> two<00:05:46.280> layers<00:05:46.520> that<00:05:47.180> adds

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
bit but between the two layers that adds

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.660 
bit but between the two layers that adds
just<00:05:48.140> that<00:05:48.290> little<00:05:48.440> element<00:05:48.980> of<00:05:49.070> film<00:05:49.370> grain

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
just that little element of film grain

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.790 
just that little element of film grain
and<00:05:49.970> it<00:05:50.540> looks<00:05:50.720> real<00:05:50.960> nice<00:05:51.140> when<00:05:51.440> it's<00:05:51.530> printed

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
and it looks real nice when it's printed

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.450 
and it looks real nice when it's printed
down<00:05:52.070> on<00:05:52.280> paper<00:05:53.080> seaward<00:05:54.080> hundred<00:05:54.860> percent<00:05:55.250> so

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
down on paper seaward hundred percent so

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.790 
down on paper seaward hundred percent so
I<00:05:55.490> doubt<00:05:55.700> you<00:05:55.850> can<00:05:56.030> see<00:05:56.210> it<00:05:56.330> too<00:05:56.510> well<00:05:56.540> it's<00:05:56.900> to

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
I doubt you can see it too well it's to

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.970 
I doubt you can see it too well it's to
wrap<00:05:57.980> up<00:05:58.220> here<00:05:58.430> let's<00:05:58.640> just<00:05:58.730> go<00:05:58.970> to<00:05:59.830> let<00:06:00.830> this

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
wrap up here let's just go to let this

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.330 
wrap up here let's just go to let this
area<00:06:01.400> down<00:06:01.610> here<00:06:01.640> where<00:06:02.090> the<00:06:02.180> grass<00:06:02.420> is<00:06:02.450> were

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
area down here where the grass is were

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.470 
area down here where the grass is were
here<00:06:04.340> we<00:06:04.460> go<00:06:05.980> and<00:06:06.980> see<00:06:07.040> how<00:06:07.430> our<00:06:07.610> there's

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.480 
here we go and see how our there's

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.560 
here we go and see how our there's
before<00:06:09.400> and<00:06:10.400> see<00:06:10.580> before<00:06:11.240> the<00:06:11.360> noise

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
before and see before the noise

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.020 
before and see before the noise
reduction<00:06:12.530> was<00:06:12.920> done<00:06:13.130> we<00:06:13.310> had<00:06:13.520> a<00:06:13.550> little<00:06:13.820> bit

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
reduction was done we had a little bit

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.480 
reduction was done we had a little bit
of<00:06:14.060> graininess<00:06:14.540> although<00:06:15.440> there's<00:06:16.160> color

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
of graininess although there's color

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.820 
of graininess although there's color
noise<00:06:16.730> in<00:06:17.060> there<00:06:17.240> which<00:06:17.780> produces<00:06:18.470> color

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
noise in there which produces color

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.550 
noise in there which produces color
splotches<00:06:19.310> see<00:06:20.210> it<00:06:20.300> right<00:06:20.480> in<00:06:20.630> here<00:06:20.930> which<00:06:21.380> is

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
splotches see it right in here which is

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.860 
splotches see it right in here which is
not<00:06:21.770> a<00:06:21.800> very<00:06:22.040> desirable<00:06:22.550> thing<00:06:23.120> but<00:06:23.330> if<00:06:23.450> we<00:06:23.600> go

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
not a very desirable thing but if we go

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.130 
not a very desirable thing but if we go
back<00:06:24.080> and<00:06:24.730> add<00:06:25.730> our<00:06:25.760> new<00:06:26.150> noise<00:06:26.390> see<00:06:26.720> how<00:06:26.930> nice

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.140 
back and add our new noise see how nice

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.890 
back and add our new noise see how nice
that<00:06:27.170> looks<00:06:27.410> I<00:06:28.330> hope<00:06:29.330> you<00:06:29.450> can<00:06:29.600> see<00:06:29.780> the

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
that looks I hope you can see the

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.050 
that looks I hope you can see the
benefits<00:06:30.380> here<00:06:30.620> of<00:06:30.770> adding<00:06:31.280> the<00:06:31.400> noise<00:06:31.580> to<00:06:31.610> a

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
benefits here of adding the noise to a

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.020 
benefits here of adding the noise to a
separate<00:06:32.570> layer<00:06:33.040> for<00:06:34.040> one<00:06:34.190> it's<00:06:34.430> dodging<00:06:34.700> and

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
separate layer for one it's dodging and

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.550 
separate layer for one it's dodging and
burning<00:06:35.090> so<00:06:35.510> it's<00:06:35.660> not<00:06:35.780> destroying<00:06:36.320> any

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
burning so it's not destroying any

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.490 
burning so it's not destroying any
pixels<00:06:37.070> here<00:06:37.430> and<00:06:37.610> also<00:06:38.090> if<00:06:38.540> we<00:06:38.600> were<00:06:39.110> applying

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
pixels here and also if we were applying

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.950 
pixels here and also if we were applying
the<00:06:39.710> noise<00:06:39.890> directly<00:06:40.520> to<00:06:40.880> a<00:06:40.910> layer<00:06:41.300> we

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
the noise directly to a layer we

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.210 
the noise directly to a layer we
wouldn't<00:06:42.230> be<00:06:42.320> able<00:06:42.440> to<00:06:42.590> blur<00:06:42.830> the<00:06:43.040> noise

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
wouldn't be able to blur the noise

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.320 
without blurring the actual pixels of

without blurring the actual pixels of
our<00:06:45.470> image<00:06:45.770> but<00:06:46.580> here<00:06:46.730> we<00:06:46.880> were<00:06:47.030> actually

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 
our image but here we were actually

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:49.429 
our image but here we were actually
the<00:06:47.759> blur<00:06:47.939> that<00:06:48.180> noise<00:06:48.360> to<00:06:48.629> soften<00:06:49.050> it<00:06:49.169> a<00:06:49.259> bit

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:49.439 
the blur that noise to soften it a bit

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:51.770 
the blur that noise to soften it a bit
the<00:06:50.159> next<00:06:50.460> segment<00:06:50.639> will<00:06:50.969> be<00:06:51.120> the<00:06:51.270> last<00:06:51.449> video

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
the next segment will be the last video

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.929 
the next segment will be the last video
