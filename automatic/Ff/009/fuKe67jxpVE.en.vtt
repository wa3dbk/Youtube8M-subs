00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
where we left off yesterday with the

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.230 
where we left off yesterday with the
video<00:00:09.300> called<00:00:09.660> saplings<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.469> skis<00:00:11.240> obviously

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
video called saplings and skis obviously

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.440 
video called saplings and skis obviously
could<00:00:12.389> use<00:00:12.540> sticks<00:00:12.840> as<00:00:13.049> well<00:00:13.969> and<00:00:14.969> was<00:00:15.210> someone

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
could use sticks as well and was someone

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.359 
could use sticks as well and was someone
on<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.630> forum<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.049> was<00:00:16.859> cool<00:00:17.100> enough<00:00:17.310> to

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
on the forum that was cool enough to

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.230 
on the forum that was cool enough to
recommend<00:00:17.760> me<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.060> use<00:00:18.770> a<00:00:19.770> non<00:00:20.490> piston-powered

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
recommend me to use a non piston-powered

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.359 
recommend me to use a non piston-powered
tea<00:00:22.020> but<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.650> bud<00:00:23.130> switch<00:00:24.080> so<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.130> try<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.160> use

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
tea but the bud switch so I try to use

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.679 
tea but the bud switch so I try to use
this<00:00:27.080> sort<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.109> compact<00:00:28.680> power<00:00:29.400> drill<00:00:29.820> bud

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
this sort of compact power drill bud

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.709 
this sort of compact power drill bud
switch<00:00:31.279> but<00:00:32.450> it's<00:00:33.450> sort<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.809> disappointed<00:00:34.590> me

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
switch but it's sort of disappointed me

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:43.430 
switch but it's sort of disappointed me
it<00:00:36.719> works<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:40.430> place<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.460> sound<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.510> then

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
it works so place the sound and then

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.080 
it works so place the sound and then
when<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.770> goes<00:00:43.920> off<00:00:45.289> that's<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> same<00:00:46.620> thing

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
when it goes off that's the same thing

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.389 
when it goes off that's the same thing
however<00:00:48.410> if<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.590> were<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.860> approach<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
however if you were to approach the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.510 
however if you were to approach the
furnace<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.660> what<00:00:52.440> you'd<00:00:52.739> want<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
furnace like this and what you'd want to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.360 
furnace like this and what you'd want to
use<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.180> right<00:00:54.449> click<00:00:55.010> you'd<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.160> wrong

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
use it so you right click you'd be wrong

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.400 
use it so you right click you'd be wrong
because<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.090> did<00:00:57.210> get<00:00:57.360> transported<00:00:58.140> through

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
because you did get transported through

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.920 
because you did get transported through
the<00:00:58.530> wall<00:00:58.710> into<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.340> into<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> mine<00:01:00.539> cart<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
the wall into the into the mine cart and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.000 
the wall into the into the mine cart and
it's<00:01:01.920> ridiculous<00:01:02.760> being<00:01:03.059> over<00:01:03.420> here<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
it's ridiculous being over here and

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.050 
it's ridiculous being over here and
being<00:01:05.010> transported<00:01:05.549> into<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> mine<00:01:06.240> cart<00:01:06.680> so

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
being transported into the mine cart so

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.910 
being transported into the mine cart so
didn't<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.810> got<00:01:09.990> even<00:01:10.170> worse<00:01:10.320> so

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
didn't like that it got even worse so

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.960 
didn't like that it got even worse so
when<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.189> was<00:01:11.280> building<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.880> most<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:13.020> ah

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
when I was building this most like ah

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.020 
when I was building this most like ah
yeah<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.030> know<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> think<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:16.850> should<00:01:17.850> put

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
yeah you know what I think I should put

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.530 
yeah you know what I think I should put
a<00:01:18.090> redstone<00:01:18.540> torch<00:01:18.900> there<00:01:19.409> oh<00:01:20.060> now<00:01:21.060> you're

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
a redstone torch there oh now you're

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.410 
a redstone torch there oh now you're
wrong<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.140> can't<00:01:23.060> because<00:01:24.060> you'll<00:01:24.240> get

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
wrong you can't because you'll get

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.950 
wrong you can't because you'll get
transported<00:01:25.080> into<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.500> mine<00:01:25.680> cart<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.960> after

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
transported into the mine cart so after

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.660 
transported into the mine cart so after
working<00:01:28.500> with<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.130> two<00:01:29.430> minutes

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
working with that for like two minutes

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.420 
working with that for like two minutes
was<00:01:30.000> like<00:01:30.210> no<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.810> retarded<00:01:31.250> let's<00:01:32.250> go

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
was like no this is retarded let's go

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.359 
was like no this is retarded let's go
back<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.670> Old<00:01:33.450> Faithful<00:01:33.840> which<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.950> piston

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
back to Old Faithful which is the piston

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.859 
back to Old Faithful which is the piston
powered<00:01:35.689> bud<00:01:36.689> switch<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:38.430> how<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> setup

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
powered bud switch so how is the setup

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.719 
powered bud switch so how is the setup
in<00:01:40.710> my<00:01:41.040> original<00:01:42.020> sampling<00:01:43.020> video<00:01:43.579> you<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.700> a

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
in my original sampling video you have a

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.020 
in my original sampling video you have a
bud<00:01:44.970> switch<00:01:45.950> it's<00:01:46.950> not<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.159> toggle<00:01:47.460> paths<00:01:47.790> which

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
bud switch it's not a toggle paths which

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.830 
bud switch it's not a toggle paths which
just<00:01:48.360> one<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.259> gives<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.619> pulse<00:01:50.570> I'm<00:01:51.570> using

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
just one that gives a pulse I'm using

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.800 
just one that gives a pulse I'm using
this<00:01:52.049> one<00:01:52.290> with<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.890> yeah<00:01:53.490> one<00:01:53.729> white<00:01:54.149> design

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
this one with the yeah one white design

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.209 
this one with the yeah one white design
because<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.850> incredibly<00:01:56.850> compact<00:01:58.189> when<00:01:59.189> I

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
because it's incredibly compact when I

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.590 
because it's incredibly compact when I
was<00:01:59.369> messing<00:01:59.549> around<00:01:59.729> with<00:01:59.909> bud<00:02:00.149> switches

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
was messing around with bud switches

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.830 
was messing around with bud switches
actually<00:02:00.960> also<00:02:01.079> came<00:02:01.350> up<00:02:01.500> with<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:02.840> yeah

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
actually also came up with this yeah

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.889 
actually also came up with this yeah
this<00:02:03.990> circuit<00:02:04.759> so<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:06.420> not<00:02:06.630> anything

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
this circuit so it's not anything

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.410 
this circuit so it's not anything
special<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.590> think<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:08.429> lot<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:09.000> people<00:02:09.090> have

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
special I think a lot of people have

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.610 
special I think a lot of people have
stumbled<00:02:09.750> upon<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.289> design

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
stumbled upon this design

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.190 
stumbled upon this design
this<00:02:11.709> is<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:11.980> as<00:02:12.129> compact<00:02:13.030> as<00:02:13.209> you<00:02:13.360> can<00:02:13.629> can

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
this is it as compact as you can can

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.920 
this is it as compact as you can can
possibly<00:02:14.560> get<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:15.120> value<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.420> signal<00:02:16.810> from

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
possibly get it value is the signal from

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.160 
possibly get it value is the signal from
the<00:02:17.760> bud<00:02:18.760> switch<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.330> feed<00:02:19.599> you<00:02:19.629> some<00:02:19.959> note

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
the bud switch I feed you some note

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.000 
the bud switch I feed you some note
blocks<00:02:20.500> over<00:02:20.769> here<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.750> let's<00:02:22.930> place<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:23.739> a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
blocks over here so let's place it a

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.330 
blocks over here so let's place it a
ding<00:02:24.310> dong<00:02:24.519> sound<00:02:25.980> but<00:02:26.980> that's<00:02:27.159> less

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
ding dong sound but that's less

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.490 
ding dong sound but that's less
important<00:02:27.970> but<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.269> also<00:02:28.480> gets<00:02:28.870> faded<00:02:29.200> into

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
important but it also gets faded into

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.780 
important but it also gets faded into
this<00:02:29.769> delay<00:02:30.340> circuit<00:02:32.280> actually<00:02:33.280> two<00:02:33.489> wires

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
this delay circuit actually two wires

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.210 
this delay circuit actually two wires
one<00:02:34.690> wire<00:02:34.900> with<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.230> toothache<00:02:35.590> delay<00:02:35.890> and

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
one wire with a toothache delay and

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.410 
one wire with a toothache delay and
another<00:02:36.489> wire<00:02:36.959> with<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:38.579> 50<00:02:39.579> to<00:02:39.730> take<00:02:40.060> delay<00:02:40.420> and

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
another wire with a 50 to take delay and

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.530 
another wire with a 50 to take delay and
both<00:02:43.420> signals<00:02:44.459> then<00:02:45.459> get<00:02:45.730> feed<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.150> into<00:02:46.329> an

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
both signals then get feed it into an

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.520 
both signals then get feed it into an
and<00:02:46.750> gate<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:49.239> if<00:02:49.359> both<00:02:49.510> signals<00:02:49.930> arrive<00:02:50.260> at

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
and gate and if both signals arrive at

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.640 
and gate and if both signals arrive at
the<00:02:50.620> same<00:02:50.859> time<00:02:51.209> this<00:02:52.209> dust<00:02:52.569> gets<00:02:52.900> turned<00:02:53.440> off

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
the same time this dust gets turned off

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.130 
the same time this dust gets turned off
in<00:02:54.400> turn<00:02:54.940> turning<00:02:55.540> on<00:02:55.690> this<00:02:56.609> redstone<00:02:57.609> torch

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
in turn turning on this redstone torch

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.809 
in turn turning on this redstone torch
so<00:02:59.140> that<00:02:59.319> gives<00:02:59.470> like<00:02:59.709> a<00:02:59.739> short<00:03:00.099> signal<00:03:00.370> which

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
so that gives like a short signal which

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.960 
so that gives like a short signal which
gets<00:03:01.060> feed<00:03:01.299> it<00:03:01.450> into<00:03:01.599> this<00:03:01.780> D<00:03:02.019> flip-flop

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
gets feed it into this D flip-flop

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.559 
gets feed it into this D flip-flop
piston<00:03:04.379> pushes<00:03:05.379> the<00:03:05.620> block<00:03:05.879> like<00:03:06.879> former<00:03:07.329> door

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
piston pushes the block like former door

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.580 
piston pushes the block like former door
pulls<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:07.930> back<00:03:08.109> and<00:03:09.180> one<00:03:10.180> that's<00:03:10.390> done<00:03:10.690> when

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
pulls it back and one that's done when

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.399 
pulls it back and one that's done when
it's<00:03:11.739> in<00:03:12.159> position<00:03:12.700> like<00:03:12.879> this<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:14.230> T

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
it's in position like this the T

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.770 
it's in position like this the T
flip-flop<00:03:14.859> would<00:03:15.150> allow<00:03:16.150> this<00:03:16.389> redstone

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
flip-flop would allow this redstone

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.449 
flip-flop would allow this redstone
torch<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.500> transmit<00:03:18.069> its<00:03:18.370> power<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:20.190> ya<00:03:21.190> this

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
torch to transmit its power to ya this

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:29.159 
torch to transmit its power to ya this
jab<00:03:21.790> door<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:24.760> I<00:03:27.209> give<00:03:28.209> another<00:03:28.480> pulse<00:03:28.840> it

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
jab door and if I give another pulse it

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.979 
jab door and if I give another pulse it
removes<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.829> block<00:03:30.359> which<00:03:31.359> removes<00:03:31.810> the

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
removes the block which removes the

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.879 
removes the block which removes the
signal<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:33.569> that's<00:03:34.569> how<00:03:34.720> it<00:03:34.840> works<00:03:35.049> so<00:03:35.440> let's

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
signal and that's how it works so let's

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.300 
signal and that's how it works so let's
see<00:03:36.099> it<00:03:36.160> in<00:03:36.250> action<00:03:36.430> so<00:03:37.120> doors<00:03:37.450> no<00:03:37.660> open<00:03:38.310> but

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
see it in action so doors no open but

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.289 
see it in action so doors no open but
let's<00:03:39.760> wait<00:03:40.299> one<00:03:40.629> sibling<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.910> now<00:03:43.030> you<00:03:43.090> see

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
let's wait one sibling so now you see

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.159 
let's wait one sibling so now you see
the<00:03:43.419> delay<00:03:43.720> going<00:03:44.819> in<00:03:45.819> at<00:03:46.299> this<00:03:46.419> exact<00:03:46.930> same

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
the delay going in at this exact same

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:52.470 
the delay going in at this exact same
time<00:03:48.389> the<00:03:49.389> other<00:03:49.510> signal<00:03:50.549> arrives<00:03:51.549> when<00:03:52.030> the

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
time the other signal arrives when the

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.520 
time the other signal arrives when the
oven<00:03:52.870> gets<00:03:53.019> turned<00:03:53.349> off<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:54.660> yeah<00:03:55.660> goes<00:03:56.260> like

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
oven gets turned off and yeah goes like

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.530 
oven gets turned off and yeah goes like
that<00:03:56.650> so<00:03:56.889> let<00:03:57.040> me<00:03:57.099> just<00:03:57.250> show<00:03:57.430> one<00:03:58.090> more<00:03:58.120> time<00:03:58.510> I

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
that so let me just show one more time I

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.720 
that so let me just show one more time I
think<00:04:01.540> there<00:04:01.690> should<00:04:01.870> be<00:04:01.989> enough<00:04:02.579> for<00:04:03.579> you

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
think there should be enough for you

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.990 
think there should be enough for you
guys<00:04:03.910> to<00:04:04.090> build<00:04:04.239> it<00:04:05.819> it's<00:04:06.819> nothing

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
guys to build it it's nothing

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.460 
guys to build it it's nothing
complicated<00:04:09.540> you<00:04:10.540> actually<00:04:10.810> see<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.079> signal

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
complicated you actually see the signal

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.849 
complicated you actually see the signal
traveling<00:04:11.859> twice<00:04:12.160> which<00:04:12.579> is<00:04:12.760> from<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.239> moment

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
traveling twice which is from the moment

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.090 
traveling twice which is from the moment
the<00:04:14.859> oven<00:04:15.129> turned<00:04:15.430> off

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
the oven turned off

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.650 
the oven turned off
uh

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.600 

stage<00:04:20.660> Oh

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
stage Oh

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.640 
stage Oh
let's<00:04:23.610> change<00:04:23.819> it<00:04:23.969> to<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.150> day<00:04:24.449> again

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
let's change it to the day again

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.340 
let's change it to the day again
the<00:04:27.280> ley<00:04:27.430> line<00:04:27.639> is<00:04:27.820> nice<00:04:28.030> though<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:30.280> uses<00:04:30.490> some

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
the ley line is nice though it uses some

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.219 
the ley line is nice though it uses some
yeah<00:04:32.350> some<00:04:33.030> properties<00:04:34.030> of<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.419> Pistons<00:04:34.990> to

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
yeah some properties of the Pistons to

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.680 
yeah some properties of the Pistons to
not<00:04:35.500> make<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:35.830> signals<00:04:36.449> interfere<00:04:37.449> with<00:04:37.630> each

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
not make the signals interfere with each

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.020 
not make the signals interfere with each
other<00:04:37.930> and<00:04:38.710> if<00:04:38.830> you<00:04:38.949> mix<00:04:39.190> them<00:04:39.370> up<00:04:39.490> a<00:04:39.610> bit<00:04:39.639> you

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
other and if you mix them up a bit you

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.120 
other and if you mix them up a bit you
can<00:04:40.470> extend<00:04:41.470> this<00:04:41.710> for<00:04:42.070> quite<00:04:42.490> some<00:04:42.729> time<00:04:44.130> and

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
can extend this for quite some time and

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.170 
can extend this for quite some time and
gate<00:04:46.080> yeah<00:04:47.080> it's<00:04:47.320> not<00:04:47.470> more<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:47.830> say<00:04:48.070> I<00:04:48.340> think

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
gate yeah it's not more to say I think

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.490 
gate yeah it's not more to say I think
in<00:04:49.750> my<00:04:49.930> videos<00:04:50.370> me<00:04:51.370> showing<00:04:51.669> you<00:04:52.500> and

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
in my videos me showing you and

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.210 
in my videos me showing you and
basically<00:04:54.190> by<00:04:54.460> hand<00:04:54.789> how<00:04:55.120> to<00:04:55.180> build<00:04:55.570> this<00:04:55.810> is

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
basically by hand how to build this is

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.900 
basically by hand how to build this is
not<00:04:57.220> very<00:04:57.490> fun<00:04:57.789> to<00:04:58.000> watch<00:04:58.680> but<00:04:59.680> yeah<00:05:00.430> if<00:05:00.520> I<00:05:00.639> sort

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
not very fun to watch but yeah if I sort

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.100 
not very fun to watch but yeah if I sort
of<00:05:01.590> scroll<00:05:02.590> through<00:05:02.919> how<00:05:03.190> everything<00:05:03.639> looks

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
of scroll through how everything looks

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.570 
of scroll through how everything looks
you<00:05:05.110> guys<00:05:05.320> should<00:05:05.560> be<00:05:05.680> able<00:05:05.770> to<00:05:06.539> recreate<00:05:07.539> the

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
you guys should be able to recreate the

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.950 
you guys should be able to recreate the
setup

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
setup

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.710 
setup
just<00:05:11.680> show<00:05:11.860> the<00:05:11.889> teapots<00:05:12.580> which<00:05:12.819> is<00:05:13.330> right

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
just show the teapots which is right

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.390 
just show the teapots which is right
sweet<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.680> t<00:05:14.860> flip-flop

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.430 

so<00:05:18.090> no<00:05:18.180> torch<00:05:18.509> on<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.840> new<00:05:18.930> if<00:05:18.990> they're<00:05:19.199> just

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
so no torch on the new if they're just

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.730 
so no torch on the new if they're just
redstone<00:05:19.860> dust

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
redstone dust
