00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
livestream I did actually mention this

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.299 
livestream I did actually mention this
on<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> stream<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.410> they<00:00:34.770> actually<00:00:35.130> said

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
on the stream and they actually said

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.979 
on the stream and they actually said
they<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.850> actually<00:00:36.120> thought<00:00:36.360> about<00:00:36.570> it

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
they have actually thought about it

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.630 
they have actually thought about it
they've<00:00:37.350> not<00:00:37.559> brought<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.920> into<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.250> game<00:00:38.430> but

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
they've not brought it into the game but

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.819 
they've not brought it into the game but
they<00:00:39.000> have<00:00:39.030> thought<00:00:39.570> about<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.620> means

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
they have thought about it so that means

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.590 
they have thought about it so that means
they<00:00:41.070> are<00:00:41.219> thinking<00:00:41.670> about<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.420> could

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
they are thinking about it and it could

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.750 
they are thinking about it and it could
possibly<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:43.050> bought<00:00:43.320> into<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.890> game<00:00:44.129> now

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
what this could do is make them

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.220 
what this could do is make them
understand<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> lot<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.420> people<00:00:54.539> do<00:00:55.050> want

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
this in the game so we could be seeing

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.630 
this in the game so we could be seeing
this<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> future<00:00:58.170> now<00:00:58.980> what<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> think<00:00:59.520> they

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
this in the future now what I think they

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.549 
this in the future now what I think they
could<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.390> game<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.140> make<00:01:01.289> more

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
could do on this game on to make more

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.049 
could do on this game on to make more
people<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:02.070> able<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.340> play<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.699> instead<00:01:02.940> of

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
actual guerdon at the end before you

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.359 
actual guerdon at the end before you

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
take it off by crazy Dave no you don't

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.310 
take it off by crazy Dave no you don't
really<00:01:14.640> get<00:01:14.850> many<00:01:15.150> cons<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.869> game<00:01:16.080> old

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
really get many cons in that game old

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.200 
really get many cons in that game old
what<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.830> honestly<00:01:17.310> think<00:01:17.520> they<00:01:17.700> should<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.060> is

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
what I honestly think they should do is

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.870 
what I honestly think they should do is
for<00:01:18.659> every<00:01:18.930> wave<00:01:19.200> maybe<00:01:19.560> after<00:01:19.979> 10<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.700> earn

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
for every wave maybe after 10 you earn

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.420 
for every wave maybe after 10 you earn
coins<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.900> example<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.500> get<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.770> round<00:01:22.920> 11

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
coins for example if you get to round 11

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.520 
coins for example if you get to round 11
you<00:01:23.729> weren't<00:01:23.880> maybe<00:01:24.150> an<00:01:24.330> extra<00:01:24.600> bonus<00:01:24.780> 500

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
you weren't maybe an extra bonus 500

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.370 
you weren't maybe an extra bonus 500
coins<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.520> get<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.790> round<00:01:26.939> 12<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.900> earn<00:01:28.110> an

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
coins if you get to round 12 you earn an

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.760 
coins if you get to round 12 you earn an
extra<00:01:28.500> 500<00:01:28.950> coins<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.590> they

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
extra 500 coins and so and so on so they

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.770

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
garden ops this I think can be really

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.160 
garden ops this I think can be really
really<00:01:38.280> fun<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.119> would<00:01:39.299> love<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.720> see<00:01:39.990> how

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
far I could get in the game I'm sure a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.420 
far I could get in the game I'm sure a
lot<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.659> guys<00:01:42.689> would<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:43.439> well<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:44.220> who

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
lot of you guys would as well but who

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.370

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
the future I hope it does because I

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that you will do it gets harder and

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.109 
that you will do it gets harder and
harder<00:01:52.079> they<00:01:52.979> could<00:01:53.130> also<00:01:53.250> implement<00:01:53.790> more

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119
