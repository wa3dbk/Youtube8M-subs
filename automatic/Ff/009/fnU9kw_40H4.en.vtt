00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
place in a folder so instead of 12 you

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.320 
place in a folder so instead of 12 you
can<00:01:22.350> add<00:01:22.560> infinite<00:01:23.100> applications<00:01:23.790> inside<00:01:24.150> the

can add infinite applications inside the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.560 
can add infinite applications inside the
folder<00:01:25.369> let's<00:01:26.369> try<00:01:26.670> another<00:01:26.850> folder<00:01:29.570> so

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
folder let's try another folder so

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.680 
folder let's try another folder so
that's<00:01:30.869> infinite<00:01:31.470> folder

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
that's infinite folder

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.640 
that's infinite folder
the<00:01:34.560> last<00:01:34.740> one<00:01:34.980> is<00:01:35.120> sbsettings<00:01:36.320> by<00:01:37.320> sliding

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
the last one is sbsettings by sliding
