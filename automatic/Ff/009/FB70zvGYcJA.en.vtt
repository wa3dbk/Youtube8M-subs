00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.349 
I usually don't recommend feeding in the
enclosure<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:27.840> because<00:00:28.560> she's<00:00:29.550> been<00:00:30.060> so

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
enclosure but because she's been so

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.609 
enclosure but because she's been so
difficult<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:30.929> she<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.289> come<00:00:31.410> out<00:00:31.529> of

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
hibernation she still kind of getting

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.360 
hibernation she still kind of getting
into<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.200> swing<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.469> things<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:35.329> I<00:00:37.309> let<00:00:38.309> her

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
into the swing of things so I let her

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.360

eat<00:00:38.550> enclosure<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:41.180> she<00:00:42.180> should<00:00:42.360> be<00:00:42.480> okay

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
eat enclosure and she should be okay

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.160 
eat enclosure and she should be okay
a<00:00:44.399> lot<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.030> times<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.390> leave<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> shower<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.079> have

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
a lot of times I leave the shower I have

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.170 
a lot of times I leave the shower I have
another<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.680> back<00:00:46.860> here<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> lot<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.000> times

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
another one back here but a lot of times

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.010 
another one back here but a lot of times
I'll<00:00:48.329> leave<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> shell<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:50.719> and<00:00:51.719> she<00:00:51.840> looks

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
I'll leave the shell on and she looks

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.410 
I'll leave the shell on and she looks
like<00:00:52.110> she's<00:00:52.410> about<00:00:52.440> done<00:00:52.920> her<00:00:53.850> appetite<00:00:54.300> is

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
like she's about done her appetite is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.670 
like she's about done her appetite is
definitely<00:00:54.809> not<00:00:54.960> back<00:00:55.170> where<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.469> should<00:00:55.500> be

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
definitely not back where it should be

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.260 
definitely not back where it should be
because<00:00:55.860> she<00:00:56.190> could<00:00:56.340> easily<00:00:56.489> eat<00:00:56.820> two<00:00:57.030> whole

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
because she could easily eat two whole

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.819 
because she could easily eat two whole
eggs<00:00:58.850> she<00:00:59.850> might<00:01:00.030> not<00:01:00.180> be<00:01:00.239> finished<00:01:00.829> she's

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
eggs she might not be finished she's

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.090 
eggs she might not be finished she's
eating<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.129> yolk<00:01:02.399> yolks<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.539> best<00:01:03.750> part<00:01:04.100> but

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
eating the yolk yolks the best part but

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.649

anyway um
the<00:01:07.350> reason<00:01:07.740> why<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.860> made<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.220> video<00:01:08.400> mostly

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the reason why I made this video mostly

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.429 
the reason why I made this video mostly
is<00:01:09.090> because<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:10.640> Riley<00:01:11.640> has<00:01:12.439> destroyed

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
is because of this Riley has destroyed

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.700 
is because of this Riley has destroyed
her<00:01:13.890> vent<00:01:14.630> this<00:01:15.630> used<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.020> go<00:01:16.170> up<00:01:16.200> there<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.330 
her vent this used to go up there and
she's<00:01:17.130> broke<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.580> off<00:01:17.700> completely<00:01:19.340> every

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
she's broke it off completely every

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.480 
she's broke it off completely every
