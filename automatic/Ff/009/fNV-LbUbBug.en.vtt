 Windows 8 exists in dozens of languages 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.250
 different if for some reason you want 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.110
 change the interface language that is 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.940
 you know as input language what we can 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.370
 do the best thing is that in any 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.859
 you can return to the language 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.020
 previous or any other without having 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.359
 biggest problems what we're going to do 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.119
 is on the home screen type the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.519

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.480
 input methods I'm going to enter 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.250
 any of them will take us 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.649
 exactly the same place 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.739
 we are seeing here that says change your 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.289
 language preferences and below says 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.570
 add the languages ​​you want to use to 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.309
 This list shows the first language in the list 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.530
 it is the primary language that you want 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.590
 show and use more frequently 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.199
 we have this button that says add a 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.410
 language if we press it will appear 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.809
 a list of all the languages ​​that 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.630

 click on them you will be able to select 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.630
 I will add the English language here 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.539
 I have it I am going to select this option 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.600
 double-clicking on it and we see how 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:21.030
 different versions appear the one that 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.220
 It's interesting to me, it's going to be the English of the USA 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.479
 because I am in america in fact I live 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.100
 very close to the usa I'm going to click and 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.909
 we see how a button appears below 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.149
 says add I'm going to select it and already 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.890
 appears in this area but we see how 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.500
 says language to show windows 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.619
 available for download this is because 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.959
 the default languages do not 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.209
 they come installed in windows only 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.890
 the one that brought the system from the factory 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.439
 operative that in the case is the language 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.000
 Spanish from Mexico although during the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.459
 installation can be selected I think 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.280
 also Spanish from Spain I will do 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:01.799
 double click on it and we see that it appears 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.390

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.030
 windows there is a language pack of 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.560

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.679

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.569

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.650
 say yes and it automatically goes to 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.000
 start the download as we can see 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.790

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.250
 megabytes once you download it goes 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.520

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.160
 to be able to select it from this area 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.350
 Windows will automatically change 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.730
 the interface language that is everything 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.100
 we are seeing at the moment 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.050
 example control panel see what 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.820
 language all this will change to english 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.440
 which is the language that I'm installing 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.630
 Of course it will also depend 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.630
 of the language that we have installed
