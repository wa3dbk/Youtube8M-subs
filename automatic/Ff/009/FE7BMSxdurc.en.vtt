00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.980 
it's funny how the manga cut again Tom I
think<00:01:50.520> it's<00:01:50.790> like<00:01:50.880> one<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> only<00:01:51.360> few<00:01:51.750> long

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
think it's like one of the only few long

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.039 
think it's like one of the only few long
hookah<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.350> has<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.829> cojones<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:54.180> actually

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
hookah that has the cojones to actually

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.499 
hookah that has the cojones to actually
step<00:01:55.470> up<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.950> say<00:01:56.369> something<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
step up and say something like that in a

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.120 
step up and say something like that in a
chapter<00:01:57.810> or<00:01:57.960> an<00:01:58.170> episode<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.890> that's

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
chapter or an episode that that's

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.249 
chapter or an episode that that's
impressive<00:01:59.520> beyond<00:02:00.000> belief<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.750> really

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
impressive beyond belief that it really

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.249 
impressive beyond belief that it really
is<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.950> Tim<00:02:02.250> points<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.000> Monica<00:02:03.540> for<00:02:03.960> being

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
is so Tim points to the Monica for being

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.160 
is so Tim points to the Monica for being
able<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.680> write<00:02:05.130> something<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.390> it's

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
able to write something like that it's

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.440 
able to write something like that it's
very<00:02:07.320> funny<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.860> really<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.520> just<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.149> can't

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
very funny it really is I just I can't

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.750 
very funny it really is I just I can't
believe<00:02:10.009> something<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.310> was<00:02:11.430> revealed

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
believe something like that was revealed

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.760 
believe something like that was revealed
but<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:12.510> brings<00:02:13.020> up<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
but this brings up the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.350 
but this brings up the
important<00:02:14.280> question<00:02:14.760> when<00:02:14.820> I've<00:02:14.970> noticed

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360
