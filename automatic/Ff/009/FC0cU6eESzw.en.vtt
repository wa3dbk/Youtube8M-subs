hey guys and welcome to another redstone

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.590 
hey guys and welcome to another redstone
tutorial<00:00:04.110> just<00:00:05.009> import<00:00:05.400> this<00:00:05.580> world<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:06.029> 1.8

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
tutorial just import this world to 1.8

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.780 
tutorial just import this world to 1.8
previously<00:00:07.170> it<00:00:07.259> only<00:00:07.470> used<00:00:07.710> in<00:00:07.950> older

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
previously it only used in older

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.629 
previously it only used in older
versions<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.510> come<00:00:10.440> across<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> few<00:00:11.219> weird

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
versions and come across a few weird

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.759 
versions and come across a few weird
issues<00:00:12.389> not<00:00:13.019> sure<00:00:13.170> if<00:00:13.290> any<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.620> guys<00:00:13.710> have

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
issues not sure if any of you guys have

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.160 
issues not sure if any of you guys have
imported<00:00:14.280> an<00:00:14.549> old<00:00:14.790> world<00:00:15.089> 1.8<00:00:15.750> but<00:00:15.990> there's

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
imported an old world 1.8 but there's

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.560 
imported an old world 1.8 but there's
some<00:00:16.350> weird<00:00:16.529> by<00:00:16.859> shadowing<00:00:17.609> issues<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.330> stuff

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
some weird by shadowing issues and stuff

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.500 
some weird by shadowing issues and stuff
where<00:00:18.949> sometimes<00:00:19.949> things<00:00:20.699> will<00:00:20.910> show<00:00:21.119> up<00:00:21.300> like

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
where sometimes things will show up like

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.849 
where sometimes things will show up like
very<00:00:21.900> very<00:00:22.320> dark<00:00:22.730> but<00:00:23.730> um<00:00:23.910> anyways<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.470> by

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
very very dark but um anyways this is by

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.670 
very very dark but um anyways this is by
request<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.699> how<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.029> make<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.720> piston<00:00:28.109> push

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
request on how to make a piston push

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.650 
request on how to make a piston push
down<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.010> piston<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.699> have<00:00:29.910> both<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.300> them

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
down a piston and have both of them

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.830 
down a piston and have both of them
extend<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.560> then<00:00:31.890> retract<00:00:32.309> again<00:00:32.660> you<00:00:33.660> don't

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
extend and then retract again you don't

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.510 
extend and then retract again you don't
have<00:00:34.050> use<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.590> as<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> door<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.280> use<00:00:35.489> it

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
have use this as a door you can use it

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.150 
have use this as a door you can use it
for<00:00:35.820> whatever<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.270> you're<00:00:36.450> wanting<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
for whatever it is you're wanting to and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.430 
for whatever it is you're wanting to and
I<00:00:38.160> power<00:00:38.760> them<00:00:39.059> here<00:00:39.420> by<00:00:39.600> two<00:00:39.660> pressure<00:00:40.110> plates

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
I power them here by two pressure plates

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.560 
I power them here by two pressure plates
you<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:40.800> use<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> button<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.239> use<00:00:42.540> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
you can use a button you can use a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.630 
you can use a button you can use a
switch<00:00:43.320> or<00:00:43.620> lever<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.129> know<00:00:44.250> whatever<00:00:44.579> you

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
switch or lever you know whatever you

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.810 
switch or lever you know whatever you
want<00:00:44.870> anyways<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.079> know<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.860> step<00:00:47.070> here<00:00:47.340> they

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
want anyways you know we step here they

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.330 
want anyways you know we step here they
retract<00:00:48.350> walkthrough<00:00:49.350> they<00:00:49.800> come<00:00:49.980> back<00:00:50.129> down

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
retract walkthrough they come back down

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.270 
retract walkthrough they come back down
again<00:00:50.489> pretty<00:00:51.300> basic<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:52.530> now<00:00:52.649> if<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:52.980> walk

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
again pretty basic so now if we walk

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.560 
again pretty basic so now if we walk
down<00:00:53.309> underneath<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:54.180> will<00:00:54.329> see<00:00:54.539> some

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
down underneath we will see some

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.439 
down underneath we will see some
circuitry<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:56.520> two<00:00:56.730> pressure<00:00:57.090> plates

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
circuitry here the two pressure plates

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.959 
circuitry here the two pressure plates
are<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.140> here<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.820> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
are here and here so this is the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.930 
are here and here so this is the
redstone<00:01:00.629> wire<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.350> its<00:01:01.590> powers<00:01:02.100> comes

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
redstone wire that its powers comes

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.479 
redstone wire that its powers comes
through<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.470> tiny<00:01:04.830> bit<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.339> delay

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
through this is just a tiny bit of delay

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.640 
through this is just a tiny bit of delay
just<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.210> they<00:01:06.689> don't<00:01:06.840> open<00:01:07.290> until<00:01:07.380> you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
just so that they don't open until you

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.219 
just so that they don't open until you
start<00:01:08.100> moving<00:01:08.310> forward<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.330> way<00:01:09.540> they<00:01:10.200> don't

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
start moving forward that way they don't

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.580 
start moving forward that way they don't
come<00:01:10.740> down<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.310> top<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:12.110> we<00:01:13.110> come<00:01:13.290> through

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
come down on top of you we come through

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.679 
come down on top of you we come through
and<00:01:14.100> then<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> wire<00:01:15.000> come<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:15.479> up

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
and then we have the wire come out up

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.080 
and then we have the wire come out up
over<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:19.340> come<00:01:20.340> up<00:01:20.490> here<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.909> now<00:01:21.030> we're

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
over here come up here and now we're

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.200 
over here come up here and now we're
charging<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.229> block<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.460> this

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
charging this block here and this

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.030 
charging this block here and this
redstone<00:01:24.570> torch<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.170> what<00:01:25.320> we're<00:01:25.439> using<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
redstone torch is what we're using to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.819 
redstone torch is what we're using to
invert<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> signal<00:01:27.270> because<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:28.439> want<00:01:28.590> these

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
invert the signal because we want these

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.249 
invert the signal because we want these
guys<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.430> extended<00:01:30.090> most<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> time<00:01:30.750> now<00:01:31.110> if

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
guys to be extended most the time now if

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.830 
guys to be extended most the time now if
you<00:01:31.409> want<00:01:31.590> them<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.799> be<00:01:31.979> retracted<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.000> then

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
you want them to be retracted and then

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.020 
you want them to be retracted and then
have<00:01:34.140> them<00:01:34.350> extend<00:01:34.920> when<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.490> activate<00:01:36.000> your

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
have them extend when you activate your

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.210 
have them extend when you activate your
switch<00:01:36.479> or<00:01:36.659> pressure<00:01:36.869> plate<00:01:37.200> then<00:01:37.829> simply

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
switch or pressure plate then simply

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.190 
switch or pressure plate then simply
delete<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.210> whole<00:01:39.420> step<00:01:39.720> right<00:01:39.900> here<00:01:40.079> and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
delete this whole step right here and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.870 
delete this whole step right here and
just<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.710> redstone<00:01:41.100> wire<00:01:41.340> climb<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:41.850> up

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
just have the redstone wire climb on up

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.450 
just have the redstone wire climb on up
but<00:01:42.780> for<00:01:43.020> our<00:01:43.049> intents<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.680> purposes<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.340> are

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
but for our intents and purposes we are

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.550 
but for our intents and purposes we are
using<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.909> redstone<00:01:45.299> torch<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.960> invert<00:01:46.380> or

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
using the redstone torch to invert or

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.280 
using the redstone torch to invert or
signal<00:01:47.030> so<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> redstone<00:01:48.810> wire<00:01:49.049> come

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
signal so we have a redstone wire come

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.740 
signal so we have a redstone wire come
up<00:01:49.409> here's<00:01:49.770> where<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:50.250> split<00:01:50.640> now<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.420> wire

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
up here's where we split now this wire

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.800 
up here's where we split now this wire
here<00:01:51.780> comes<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.159> powers<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.970> top<00:01:54.329> two

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
here comes up and powers the top two

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.980 
here comes up and powers the top two
Pistons<00:01:57.810> now<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.159> set<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.670> one<00:02:00.270> tick

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
Pistons now we have this set to one tick

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.889 
Pistons now we have this set to one tick
of<00:02:01.200> delay<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.060> they<00:02:03.479> will<00:02:03.630> not

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
of delay this is so that they will not

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.440 
of delay this is so that they will not
retract<00:02:04.649> until<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.700> bottom<00:02:06.090> ones<00:02:06.299> are

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
retract until the bottom ones are

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.859 
retract until the bottom ones are
already<00:02:06.869> finished<00:02:07.350> retracting<00:02:08.090> because<00:02:09.090> if<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
already finished retracting because if a

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.809 
already finished retracting because if a
sticky<00:02:10.739> piston<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.400> another<00:02:11.730> piston

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
sticky piston is on another piston

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.420 
sticky piston is on another piston
in<00:02:12.909> that<00:02:13.150> piston<00:02:13.629> is<00:02:13.810> even<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.200> tiny<00:02:14.499> bit<00:02:14.620> out<00:02:14.950> it

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
in that piston is even a tiny bit out it

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.059 
in that piston is even a tiny bit out it
will<00:02:15.579> not<00:02:15.790> stick<00:02:16.329> to<00:02:16.629> the<00:02:16.959> sticky<00:02:17.290> piston<00:02:17.680> so

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
will not stick to the sticky piston so

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.610 
will not stick to the sticky piston so
the<00:02:18.189> sticky<00:02:18.459> piston<00:02:18.790> will<00:02:18.939> retract<00:02:19.409> but<00:02:20.409> you

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
the sticky piston will retract but you

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.289 
the sticky piston will retract but you
will<00:02:20.829> end<00:02:21.010> up<00:02:21.189> with<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.700> other<00:02:21.849> piston

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
will end up with the other piston

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.009 
will end up with the other piston
staying<00:02:22.930> down<00:02:23.739> below<00:02:24.129> it<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:25.030> we<00:02:25.540> want<00:02:25.749> the

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
staying down below it so we want the

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.470 
staying down below it so we want the
lower<00:02:26.499> Pistons<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.189> retract<00:02:27.549> and<00:02:27.879> then<00:02:28.269> the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
lower Pistons to retract and then the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.660 
lower Pistons to retract and then the
upper<00:02:28.719> ones<00:02:28.930> too<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.769> that's<00:02:30.099> why<00:02:30.340> we<00:02:30.370> have

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
upper ones too so that's why we have

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.830 
upper ones too so that's why we have
this<00:02:30.879> here<00:02:31.829> now<00:02:32.829> for<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.549> lower<00:02:33.909> Pistons<00:02:34.510> we

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
this here now for the lower Pistons we

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.619 
this here now for the lower Pistons we
have<00:02:35.079> this<00:02:35.920> wire<00:02:36.219> here<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.969> this<00:02:37.359> wire<00:02:37.599> here

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
have this wire here and this wire here

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.559 
have this wire here and this wire here
and<00:02:38.200> basically<00:02:38.769> this<00:02:39.280> comes<00:02:39.489> down<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.150> if<00:02:40.419> you

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
and basically this comes down and if you

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.879 
and basically this comes down and if you
notice<00:02:40.750> right<00:02:41.709> now<00:02:41.950> it<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.459> extended<00:02:43.650> let's<00:02:44.650> go

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
notice right now it is extended let's go

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:51.089 
notice right now it is extended let's go
through<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:46.739> take<00:02:47.739> this<00:02:47.980> out<00:02:49.919> now<00:02:50.919> you'll

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
through and take this out now you'll

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.670 
through and take this out now you'll
snow<00:02:51.340> tsk<00:02:51.969> I<00:02:52.060> right<00:02:52.239> now<00:02:52.389> is<00:02:52.629> above<00:02:53.079> this<00:02:53.379> wire

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
snow tsk I right now is above this wire

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.649 
snow tsk I right now is above this wire
so<00:02:54.010> if<00:02:54.129> this<00:02:54.250> wire<00:02:54.519> were<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.909> charge<00:02:55.150> this

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
so if this wire were to charge this

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:57.809 
so if this wire were to charge this
piston<00:02:56.169> the<00:02:56.349> lower<00:02:56.530> piston<00:02:56.949> would<00:02:57.129> not<00:02:57.370> extend

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
piston the lower piston would not extend

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.709 
piston the lower piston would not extend
it<00:02:58.719> won't<00:02:58.930> extend<00:02:59.319> until<00:02:59.730> this<00:03:00.730> guy<00:03:01.000> pushes<00:03:01.569> it

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:01.719 
it won't extend until this guy pushes it

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.929 
it won't extend until this guy pushes it
down<00:03:01.930> in<00:03:02.260> which<00:03:02.919> case<00:03:03.129> it'll<00:03:03.370> come<00:03:03.609> in<00:03:03.730> contact

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:03.939 
down in which case it'll come in contact

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.270 
down in which case it'll come in contact
with<00:03:04.239> this<00:03:04.540> powered<00:03:04.989> brick<00:03:05.290> which<00:03:05.949> will<00:03:06.159> then

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
with this powered brick which will then

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.520 
with this powered brick which will then
extend<00:03:06.760> it<00:03:06.879> also<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:07.870> we<00:03:08.109> have<00:03:08.199> the<00:03:08.319> same

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
extend it also and we have the same

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.199 
extend it also and we have the same
thing<00:03:08.739> on<00:03:08.889> this<00:03:09.040> side<00:03:09.099> only<00:03:09.579> you<00:03:09.730> can't<00:03:09.939> really

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
thing on this side only you can't really

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.300 
thing on this side only you can't really
see<00:03:10.419> it<00:03:10.449> because<00:03:10.930> it's<00:03:11.169> underneath<00:03:11.620> this<00:03:11.949> dirt

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
see it because it's underneath this dirt

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:20.069 
see it because it's underneath this dirt
here<00:03:14.879> so<00:03:15.879> you<00:03:16.239> can<00:03:16.359> see<00:03:16.389> it<00:03:16.599> right<00:03:16.719> here<00:03:18.959> so<00:03:19.959> if

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
here so you can see it right here so if

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.300 
here so you can see it right here so if
we<00:03:20.199> go<00:03:20.349> through<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.889> we<00:03:20.949> just<00:03:21.609> back<00:03:21.819> up<00:03:22.030> again

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
we go through and we just back up again

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.030 
we go through and we just back up again
notice<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.549> soon<00:03:25.180> as<00:03:25.329> these<00:03:25.509> guys<00:03:26.009> get<00:03:27.009> power

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
notice that soon as these guys get power

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.509 
notice that soon as these guys get power
they<00:03:30.040> extend<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:31.810> it's<00:03:31.989> a<00:03:32.049> pretty<00:03:32.169> basic<00:03:32.519> setup

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
they extend so it's a pretty basic setup

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.839 
they extend so it's a pretty basic setup
you<00:03:33.819> can<00:03:33.849> do<00:03:34.449> that<00:03:34.659> vertical<00:03:35.259> also<00:03:35.849> it

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
you can do that vertical also it

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.539 
you can do that vertical also it
requires<00:03:37.000> it's<00:03:37.870> not<00:03:38.109> as<00:03:38.229> easy<00:03:38.379> to<00:03:38.560> hide<00:03:38.889> if<00:03:39.400> you

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
requires it's not as easy to hide if you

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:40.979 
requires it's not as easy to hide if you
notice<00:03:39.849> right<00:03:40.000> now<00:03:40.180> we<00:03:40.629> can<00:03:40.750> walk<00:03:40.959> through

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
notice right now we can walk through

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.780 
notice right now we can walk through
this<00:03:41.290> tunnel<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:41.949> you<00:03:42.069> can't<00:03:42.310> really<00:03:42.430> tell

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
this tunnel and you can't really tell

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.149 
this tunnel and you can't really tell
there's<00:03:43.060> any<00:03:43.269> circuitry<00:03:43.900> anywhere<00:03:44.229> if<00:03:44.979> they

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
there's any circuitry anywhere if they

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.249 
there's any circuitry anywhere if they
come<00:03:45.340> up<00:03:45.519> from<00:03:45.759> the<00:03:45.879> bottom<00:03:46.120> that's<00:03:46.959> not

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:47.259 
come up from the bottom that's not

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.219 
come up from the bottom that's not
really<00:03:47.590> as<00:03:47.650> easy<00:03:47.829> to<00:03:48.009> do<00:03:48.280> because<00:03:48.840> this<00:03:49.840> block

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:50.229 
really as easy to do because this block

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.080 
really as easy to do because this block
right<00:03:50.259> here<00:03:50.530> which<00:03:50.979> gets<00:03:51.189> powered<00:03:51.639> for<00:03:51.939> them

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
right here which gets powered for them

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.879 
right here which gets powered for them
coming<00:03:52.359> up<00:03:52.449> the<00:03:52.569> second<00:03:52.930> time<00:03:53.139> the<00:03:53.439> second<00:03:53.769> set

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
coming up the second time the second set

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.879 
coming up the second time the second set
of<00:03:54.009> Pistons<00:03:54.159> would<00:03:55.030> have<00:03:55.209> to<00:03:55.389> be<00:03:55.479> down<00:03:55.750> here

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
of Pistons would have to be down here

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.589 
of Pistons would have to be down here
with<00:03:56.889> nothing<00:03:57.129> on<00:03:57.370> top<00:03:57.639> of<00:03:57.819> it<00:03:57.909> which<00:03:58.209> means

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
with nothing on top of it which means

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.349 
with nothing on top of it which means
that<00:03:58.930> you<00:04:01.620> know<00:04:02.729> from<00:04:03.729> inside<00:04:04.090> because<00:04:04.329> it

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
that you know from inside because it

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.309 
that you know from inside because it
would<00:04:04.569> be<00:04:04.719> right<00:04:05.560> here

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.009 

now<00:04:09.280> you<00:04:09.340> can<00:04:09.609> also<00:04:09.760> make<00:04:10.090> them<00:04:10.239> come<00:04:10.569> from<00:04:10.599> the

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
now you can also make them come from the

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.099 
now you can also make them come from the
sides<00:04:11.700> but<00:04:12.700> that<00:04:12.879> also<00:04:13.090> gets<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.599> little<00:04:13.870> bit

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
sides but that also gets a little bit

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:15.539 
sides but that also gets a little bit
more<00:04:14.260> messy<00:04:14.409> because<00:04:14.709> then<00:04:15.069> you<00:04:15.189> have<00:04:15.219> to<00:04:15.430> have

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
more messy because then you have to have

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.909 
more messy because then you have to have
wires<00:04:15.819> run<00:04:16.150> on<00:04:16.269> one<00:04:16.479> side<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.169> then<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.739> other

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
wires run on one side and then the other

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.740 
wires run on one side and then the other
wires<00:04:18.370> run<00:04:18.759> on<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.000> other<00:04:19.180> side<00:04:19.449> so<00:04:19.600> if<00:04:19.690> you

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
wires run on the other side so if you

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.449 
wires run on the other side so if you
have<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:19.900> piston<00:04:20.320> at<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.560> second<00:04:20.949> level<00:04:21.070> here

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
have a piston at the second level here

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.010 
have a piston at the second level here
you<00:04:22.000> probably<00:04:22.240> want<00:04:22.539> you<00:04:22.660> know<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.840> wires

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
you probably want you know the wires

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.800 
you probably want you know the wires
here<00:04:23.560> or<00:04:23.740> here<00:04:24.130> for<00:04:24.849> the<00:04:24.970> one<00:04:25.150> underneath<00:04:25.449> it

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
here or here for the one underneath it

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.089 
here or here for the one underneath it
they<00:04:25.990> would<00:04:26.110> need<00:04:26.229> to<00:04:26.289> be<00:04:26.380> on<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.650> opposite

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
they would need to be on the opposite

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.129 
they would need to be on the opposite
side<00:04:27.310> so<00:04:27.550> if<00:04:27.669> this<00:04:27.789> guy's<00:04:28.030> wires<00:04:28.389> were<00:04:28.660> here

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
side so if this guy's wires were here

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.960 
side so if this guy's wires were here
this<00:04:29.740> guy's<00:04:29.919> wires<00:04:30.190> would<00:04:30.460> have<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.699> be<00:04:30.820> on

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
this guy's wires would have to be on

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.189 
this guy's wires would have to be on
this<00:04:31.150> side<00:04:32.340> but<00:04:33.340> basically<00:04:33.880> it's<00:04:34.180> a<00:04:34.360> very

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
this side but basically it's a very

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.800 
this side but basically it's a very
basic<00:04:35.620> setup<00:04:36.280> you<00:04:37.210> can<00:04:37.240> use<00:04:37.449> it<00:04:37.570> for<00:04:37.690> whatever

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
basic setup you can use it for whatever

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.420 
basic setup you can use it for whatever
you<00:04:38.080> like<00:04:38.229> you<00:04:38.259> can<00:04:38.500> also<00:04:38.650> come<00:04:38.979> up<00:04:39.160> from<00:04:39.400> the

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
you like you can also come up from the

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.900 
you like you can also come up from the
bottom<00:04:39.759> and<00:04:40.120> have<00:04:40.690> sand<00:04:41.139> or<00:04:41.349> gravel<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.979> have

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
bottom and have sand or gravel and have

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.249 
bottom and have sand or gravel and have
the<00:04:43.090> Pistons<00:04:43.509> completely<00:04:43.960> buried

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
the Pistons completely buried

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.080 
the Pistons completely buried
underground<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:45.070> just<00:04:45.220> push<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.669> sand<00:04:45.940> or

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
underground and just push the sand or

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.540 
underground and just push the sand or
gravel<00:04:46.270> up<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:47.080> only<00:04:47.259> downside<00:04:47.830> is<00:04:47.860> this<00:04:48.310> is

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
gravel up the only downside is this is

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.230 
gravel up the only downside is this is
when<00:04:49.000> it<00:04:49.120> retracts<00:04:49.810> it<00:04:50.880> takes<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:52.000> while<00:04:52.120> you

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
when it retracts it takes a while you

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.670 
when it retracts it takes a while you
have<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:52.389> add<00:04:52.509> a<00:04:52.539> lot<00:04:52.840> of<00:04:53.020> time<00:04:53.259> in<00:04:53.470> there

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
have to add a lot of time in there

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.629 
have to add a lot of time in there
otherwise<00:04:54.660> you<00:04:55.660> will<00:04:55.780> end<00:04:55.840> up<00:04:56.139> with<00:04:56.639> the

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
otherwise you will end up with the

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.700 
otherwise you will end up with the
Pistons<00:04:58.000> not<00:04:58.150> retracting<00:04:58.690> properly<00:04:59.139> because

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
Pistons not retracting properly because

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.650 
Pistons not retracting properly because
you<00:04:59.919> had<00:05:00.039> to<00:05:00.130> do<00:05:00.220> it<00:05:00.340> as<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.789> sand<00:05:01.030> falls<00:05:01.360> down

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
you had to do it as the sand falls down

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.980 
you had to do it as the sand falls down
and<00:05:01.900> it<00:05:02.889> can<00:05:03.039> get<00:05:03.190> really<00:05:03.759> really<00:05:04.300> complicated

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
and it can get really really complicated

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.529 
and it can get really really complicated
on<00:05:05.259> on<00:05:05.500> a<00:05:05.560> server<00:05:06.340> from<00:05:06.699> some<00:05:07.120> guys<00:05:07.300> I<00:05:07.479> know

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
on on a server from some guys I know

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.930 
on on a server from some guys I know
they<00:05:08.289> have<00:05:08.440> a<00:05:08.470> very<00:05:08.740> large<00:05:08.949> door<00:05:09.370> set<00:05:09.639> up<00:05:09.759> like

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
they have a very large door set up like

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.180 
they have a very large door set up like
this<00:05:10.150> and<00:05:10.419> the<00:05:10.810> circuitry<00:05:11.320> would<00:05:11.740> fill<00:05:12.039> up

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
this and the circuitry would fill up

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.120 
this and the circuitry would fill up
this<00:05:12.400> whole<00:05:12.639> entire<00:05:13.300> room<00:05:13.690> or<00:05:13.990> root<00:05:14.770> nut<00:05:14.919> room

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
this whole entire room or root nut room

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.510 
this whole entire room or root nut room
but<00:05:15.370> this<00:05:15.550> whole<00:05:15.699> area<00:05:16.210> here<00:05:16.449> it's<00:05:16.960> very<00:05:17.139> large

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
but this whole area here it's very large

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.640 
but this whole area here it's very large
but<00:05:18.520> anyways<00:05:18.940> um<00:05:19.270> that's<00:05:19.840> it<00:05:20.050> for<00:05:20.229> now<00:05:20.349> and

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
but anyways um that's it for now and

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.729 
but anyways um that's it for now and
I'll<00:05:21.190> see<00:05:21.340> you<00:05:21.460> guys<00:05:21.520> later
