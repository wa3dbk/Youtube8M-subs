both<00:01:03.030> passively<00:01:03.870> meaning<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.500> they're

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
both passively meaning that they're

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.880 
both passively meaning that they're
closed<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.339> actively<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.960> cancels<00:01:07.350> out<00:01:07.470> 20

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
closed and actively it cancels out 20

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.560 
closed and actively it cancels out 20
decibels<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.490> sound<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.000> when<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.450> your

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
decibels of sound so when it's on your

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
decibels of sound so when it's on your
head<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.200> really<00:01:10.439> can't<00:01:10.619> hear<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.130> much

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
head you really can't hear that much

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.520 
head you really can't hear that much
going<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.299> still<00:01:12.510> hear<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.409> it

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
going on I can still hear it but it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.469 
going on I can still hear it but it
attenuates<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.430> little<00:01:14.729> bit<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.850> sound<00:01:15.150> so

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
attenuates that little bit of sound so

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.120 
attenuates that little bit of sound so
it<00:01:15.869> really<00:01:16.170> does<00:01:16.350> cancel<00:01:16.710> them<00:01:16.830> once<00:01:16.979> you're

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.469 
cans actually have built in 15
millimeter<00:03:44.919> drivers<00:03:45.549> so<00:03:45.879> but<00:03:46.150> that<00:03:46.299> means

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:46.479 
millimeter drivers so but that means

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:47.879 
millimeter drivers so but that means
it's<00:03:46.689> general<00:03:46.900> they<00:03:46.989> can<00:03:47.169> produce<00:03:47.290> more<00:03:47.650> bass

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
it's general they can produce more bass

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.469 
it's general they can produce more bass
not<00:03:48.159> meaning<00:03:48.549> that<00:03:48.639> they<00:03:48.790> actually<00:03:48.939> always

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:49.479 
not meaning that they actually always

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.229 
not meaning that they actually always
are<00:03:50.229> or<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:50.590> 50<00:03:51.340> millimeters<00:03:51.849> is<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.090> only

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
are or that 50 millimeters is the only

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.360 
are or that 50 millimeters is the only
one<00:03:52.389> capable<00:03:52.540> 40<00:03:53.169> can<00:03:53.319> do<00:03:53.439> it<00:03:53.530> as<00:03:53.620> well<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:54.340> just

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
one capable 40 can do it as well it just

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.490 
one capable 40 can do it as well it just
happens<00:03:54.909> to<00:03:54.970> be<00:03:55.060> that<00:03:55.209> usually<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.900> larger

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
happens to be that usually a larger

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.129 
happens to be that usually a larger
driver<00:03:57.310> can<00:03:57.729> create<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.120> better<00:03:58.419> base<00:03:58.780> at<00:03:59.109> a

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
driver can create a better base at a

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.069 
driver can create a better base at a
cheaper<00:03:59.500> price<00:03:59.609> so<00:04:00.609> these<00:04:01.209> are<00:04:01.269> able<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:01.989> do

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
cheaper price so these are able to do

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.770 
cheaper price so these are able to do
that<00:04:02.259> pretty<00:04:02.590> well<00:04:02.680> so<00:04:03.269> you're<00:04:04.269> not<00:04:04.419> getting

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
that pretty well so you're not getting

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.129 
that pretty well so you're not getting
up<00:04:05.049> a<00:04:06.299> ridiculously<00:04:07.299> expensive<00:04:07.599> pair<00:04:08.079> of

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
up a ridiculously expensive pair of

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.170 
up a ridiculously expensive pair of
headphones<00:04:08.349> as<00:04:08.799> far<00:04:09.009> as<00:04:09.099> audio<00:04:09.400> goes<00:04:09.609> you're

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
headphones as far as audio goes you're

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.300 
headphones as far as audio goes you're
not<00:04:10.329> getting<00:04:10.509> in<00:04:10.720> HD<00:04:11.049> 380<00:04:11.500> you're<00:04:11.799> getting<00:04:12.159> a

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
not getting in HD 380 you're getting a

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.699 
not getting in HD 380 you're getting a
headset<00:04:13.299> that<00:04:13.540> is<00:04:13.689> meant<00:04:13.900> for<00:04:14.109> gaming<00:04:14.439> it<00:04:14.560> has

it<00:04:24.110> has<00:04:24.320> a<00:04:24.520> very<00:04:25.520> narrow<00:04:26.090> scope<00:04:26.540> in<00:04:26.720> which<00:04:26.840> it

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
it has a very narrow scope in which it

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.050 
it has a very narrow scope in which it
captures<00:04:27.410> it's<00:04:27.620> very<00:04:27.889> tinny<00:04:28.220> generally

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
captures it's very tinny generally

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.960 
captures it's very tinny generally
relatively<00:04:29.750> nasally<00:04:30.260> and<00:04:31.070> it<00:04:31.190> is<00:04:31.310> designed<00:04:31.820> to

Milos what exactly I sound like how

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.700 
Milos what exactly I sound like how
special<00:05:03.770> I<00:05:04.070> feel<00:05:04.600> monologuing<00:05:05.600> into<00:05:06.020> a<00:05:06.050> closed

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
special I feel monologuing into a closed

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.730 
special I feel monologuing into a closed
active<00:05:07.700> sound<00:05:07.970> canceling<00:05:08.450> headphones<00:05:08.870> with

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
active sound canceling headphones with

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.050 
active sound canceling headphones with
my<00:05:09.889> cat<00:05:10.100> staring<00:05:10.400> at<00:05:10.610> me<00:05:10.700> finally<00:05:11.260> here<00:05:12.260> you<00:05:12.350> go

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
my cat staring at me finally here you go

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.680 
my cat staring at me finally here you go
as<00:05:14.680> you<00:05:15.680> can<00:05:15.800> see<00:05:16.010> relatively<00:05:16.729> easily<00:05:17.120> and

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
as you can see relatively easily and

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.590 
as you can see relatively easily and
tinny<00:05:18.500> but<00:05:18.889> you<00:05:19.160> know<00:05:19.310> it<00:05:19.970> does<00:05:20.120> a<00:05:20.150> guy<00:05:20.360> who<00:05:20.419> is

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
tinny but you know it does a guy who is

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.360 
tinny but you know it does a guy who is
supposed<00:05:20.750> to<00:05:20.990> do<00:05:21.139> give<00:05:21.440> you<00:05:21.560> a<00:05:21.620> clean<00:05:21.919> clear

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
supposed to do give you a clean clear

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.340 
supposed to do give you a clean clear
audio<00:05:23.180> sound<00:05:23.510> so<00:05:23.750> that<00:05:23.900> way<00:05:24.020> when<00:05:24.139> there's<00:05:24.320> a

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
audio sound so that way when there's a

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.840 
audio sound so that way when there's a
lot<00:05:24.470> of<00:05:24.500> noise<00:05:24.770> going<00:05:24.800> on<00:05:25.100> the<00:05:25.220> background<00:05:25.430> you

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
lot of noise going on the background you

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.520 
lot of noise going on the background you
can<00:05:26.000> always<00:05:26.450> hear<00:05:26.690> what<00:05:26.870> the<00:05:26.960> person<00:05:27.290> saying

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
can always hear what the person saying

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.600 
can always hear what the person saying
so<00:05:28.160> if<00:05:28.580> you<00:05:28.760> like<00:05:28.880> diablo<00:05:29.330> 3<00:05:29.570> and<00:05:30.100> you<00:05:31.100> like<00:05:31.340> red

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
so if you like diablo 3 and you like red

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.159 
so if you like diablo 3 and you like red
well<00:05:32.150> then<00:05:32.360> i<00:05:32.539> think<00:05:32.600> you'll<00:05:32.840> pretty<00:05:33.020> much

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169
