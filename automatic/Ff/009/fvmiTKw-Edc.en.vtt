00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.260
 hello welcome to new like in this 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.790
 video I will teach you how to do this 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.790
 small catapult very simple 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.810
 to make the video that we are going to 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.539
 need we are going to need these 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.480
 typical ice cream sticks 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.919
 we will take about 10 or 9 depending on 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.060
 little the thickness that you want and 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:31.200
 Also depending on how they are the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.850
 sticks between 5 and 9 rubbers there is forgiveness between 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.460
 5 and 6 rubber 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.640
 I will initially only use 5 but good 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.079
 I would have one more just in case the plug 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.839
 a normal plastic bottle 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.239
 and tail of this snapshot and a bit of 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.739
 adhesive tape the instant tail i 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.969
 I recommend that you have not seen the 6's 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.010
 used once then the guards in the 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.469
 refrigerator is much better preserved and does not 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.399
 is going to stick walls is going to be 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:01:00.260
 unused so it will be saved 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:03.280
 let's start the first thing is to join 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.280
 five chopsticks 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.410
 so 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.340
 and with the elastic bands we are going to fix 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.340
 by the two extremes 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.460
 to go around and around and so we 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.460
 we will fix 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.240
 here we have one let's do the other 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.240
 extreme 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.340
 We already have it very fixed, I ride it 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.929
 I will leave as I said sometimes 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.539
 I will use more or less gums depends on 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.820
 the clubs and in this case in this first 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.190
 after piece we will leave it like this 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.880
 now with the following that we are going to 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.939
 do we will put 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.590
 2 and 2 in such a way we will fix it by 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.590
 here and we would see it 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.340
 let's open like this 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.780
 to go around here and explore 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.370
 our every tip so to give them 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.560
 a little more resistance to the envelope 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.600
 all to the clubs that are going to go over 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.490
 I 'm going to put adhesive tape on this 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.290
 way they will have more game 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.240
 in fact I'm going to do it with a better one 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.550
 that if not with two will be more too 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.010
 rigid let's do it at the end then 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.990
 with eight clubs and what we're going to do 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.820
 now it's putting duct tape all over 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.280
 the bread because because with this intensive 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.280
 we will make the wood does not break 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.860
 the elasticity is going to take the 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.880
 adhesive tape then we go rolling 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.880
 well little by little 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.080
 and so in this way we will prevent the 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.590
 stick is broken and breaks as the 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.340
 elasticity is going to wear the tape 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.340
 and it is already 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.540
 and here now we have the stick that will go 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.150
 above 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.520
 done what we're going to do now here is 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.140
 fix these 3 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.140
 for those with another rubber 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.100
 fix it here that are well aligned 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.460
 we fix you the more a bit the end 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.460
 best 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.260
 and you go 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.000
 and we here and now what 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.120
 we have to do especially remember 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.400
 the stick that has the adhesive tape will go 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.850
 from above 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.790
 we put like this we introduce it 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.150
 we look at them to focus and now with another 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.850
 tape and with another rubber we will go 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.120
 fixing 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.830
 let's take a few turns 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.830
 that stays well to the bottom 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.820
 and here to go around in such tracks 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.820
 way that sees you 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.420
 as central as possible 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.610
 and now we see that it does not stay a little 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.320
 twisted let's put another rubber 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.710
 to give it a little more strength towards 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.710
 the other side 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.209
 Here we already have it, we see how it has 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.400
 stayed and this is where now 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.840
 we have to hook our plug if 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.400
 we would not have put the adhesive tape 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.530
 in the top stick surely by 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.030
 Here already we have broken it but 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.850
 putting the adhesive tape we have 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.100
 got the stick more elastic 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.790
 now the last thing that we will lack is to put 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.710
 a little tail to hook the 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.960
 projectile support and then already what 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.040
 we can launch we are going to put with the 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.040
 Quick care with this 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.280
 we can with the quick on light in the 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.280
 extreme 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.780
 you do not have to put much 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.780
 enough for him to persist 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.460
 the plug 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.460
 and then we hooked it 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.770
 we wait a few seconds 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.409
 and we let it out and now I will show you 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.300
 how he fired 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.709
 very well once we got hooked 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.280
 we just have to place the 

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:18.360
 projectile and we can launch 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.340
 let's see it better 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.039
 ok here we have our little each 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.659
 tip as I said we can place the 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.910
 projectile 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:29.700
 we take from behind 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.100
 and let's see how to launch is very simple 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.380
 make simple quick and to play with 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.120
 children is perfect and with this could 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.650
 be some war or whatever with the 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.270
 boy 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.610
 at the table to watch to touch some 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.060
 figures or whatever it is so good as 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.610
 see is quite fun and not just 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.190
 with materials without having to use anything 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.140
 that can do anything so good to the child 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.850
