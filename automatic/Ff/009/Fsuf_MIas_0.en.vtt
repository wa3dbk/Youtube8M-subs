 sketch with a brief description of the

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.059
 in the sketch we put the data 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.450
 where it puts the vehicle and what we call 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.780

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.780
 box 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.610
 Let's imagine that the accident happened 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.070

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:01.030
 time the location has occurred 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.910
 espaÃ±a roberto luiz 15 madrid has not

 there were victims vehicles other than 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.310
 neighbor's law and different objects no 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.290
 as the accident consists of a 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.690
 vehicle roundabout was circulating 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.820
 in the right lane and the 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.220
 vehicle has been crossed from the 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.619
 inner lane as we fill the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.920

 the policy number if the driver is 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.900
 the same because we put the same if it were 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.850
 another driver other than the owner of the 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.759
