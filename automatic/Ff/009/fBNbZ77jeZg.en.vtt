chicken breast tenderloins the tenders

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.240 
chicken breast tenderloins the tenders
will<00:02:40.870> cook<00:02:40.989> up<00:02:41.140> better<00:02:41.410> than<00:02:41.500> just<00:02:42.190> the

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
will cook up better than just the

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.690 
will cook up better than just the
chicken<00:02:42.580> breasts<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.150> prefer<00:02:43.810> these<00:02:44.550> over<00:02:45.550> the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
chicken breasts I prefer these over the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.550 
chicken breasts I prefer these over the
regular<00:02:46.060> breasts<00:02:46.360> because<00:02:46.660> they<00:02:46.780> cook<00:02:46.989> faster

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
regular breasts because they cook faster

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.380 
regular breasts because they cook faster
and<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:47.800> think<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.190> they're<00:02:48.370> just<00:02:48.670> better<00:02:49.180> in

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
and I think that they're just better in

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.160 
and I think that they're just better in
general<00:02:49.780> with<00:02:50.380> this<00:02:50.620> particular<00:02:51.220> recipe<00:02:51.400> and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.460 
going to be doing that today so if my
gravy<00:03:16.030> tends<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:16.570> get<00:03:16.720> too<00:03:16.870> thick<00:03:17.110> I'll<00:03:17.260> just

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
gravy tends to get too thick I'll just

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.960 
gravy tends to get too thick I'll just
add<00:03:17.680> water<00:03:17.920> what-have-you

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.470 
the crock pot I'm going to open all
these<00:03:27.010> cans<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:27.640> add<00:03:27.730> those<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.269> crock

these cans and add those to the crock

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.180 
these cans and add those to the crock
pot<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.989> then<00:03:29.080> I'm<00:03:29.170> going<00:03:29.320> to<00:03:29.350> add<00:03:29.560> my<00:03:29.830> carrots

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
pot and then I'm going to add my carrots

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.890 
pot and then I'm going to add my carrots
to<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.400> crock<00:03:30.580> pot<00:03:30.610> I'm<00:03:31.180> going<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.570> stir<00:03:31.780> it

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
to the crock pot I'm going to stir it

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.350 
to the crock pot I'm going to stir it
all<00:03:32.080> up<00:03:32.110> in<00:03:32.470> crock<00:03:32.709> pot<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.280> then<00:03:33.910> I'm<00:03:34.030> going

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
all up in crock pot and then I'm going

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.140 
all up in crock pot and then I'm going
to<00:03:34.540> set<00:03:35.110> it<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:35.230> high<00:03:35.560> for<00:03:36.220> four<00:03:36.459> hours<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.060> the

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
to set it to high for four hours and the

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.270 
to set it to high for four hours and the
reason<00:03:37.450> I'm<00:03:37.540> doing<00:03:37.570> that<00:03:37.810> is<00:03:38.200> because<00:03:38.680> it's

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
reason I'm doing that is because it's

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.850 
reason I'm doing that is because it's
already<00:03:39.610> noon<00:03:39.820> here<00:03:40.269> so<00:03:41.170> that<00:03:41.320> means<00:03:41.470> it'll<00:03:41.769> be

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
already noon here so that means it'll be

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.440 
already noon here so that means it'll be
done<00:03:42.040> around<00:03:42.250> four<00:03:42.640> o'clock<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:43.209> then<00:03:43.329> I'll

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
done around four o'clock and then I'll

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.150 
done around four o'clock and then I'll
just<00:03:43.600> set<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:43.900> warm<00:03:44.260> until<00:03:44.739> we're<00:03:44.890> ready<00:03:45.040> to

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
just set it to warm until we're ready to

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.120 
just set it to warm until we're ready to
eat<00:03:45.190> dinner<00:03:45.459> if<00:03:46.390> I<00:03:46.540> had<00:03:46.930> started<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:47.799> earlier

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
eat dinner if I had started it earlier

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.860 
eat dinner if I had started it earlier
this<00:03:48.310> morning<00:03:48.579> I<00:03:48.820> could<00:03:49.030> have<00:03:49.120> done<00:03:49.269> it<00:03:49.329> on<00:03:49.570> low

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
this morning I could have done it on low

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.949 
this morning I could have done it on low
for<00:03:50.230> eight<00:03:50.440> hours<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:51.820> basically<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.660> can<00:03:52.810> do

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
for eight hours so basically you can do

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.680 
for eight hours so basically you can do
high<00:03:53.170> for<00:03:53.470> four<00:03:53.709> or<00:03:54.070> low<00:03:54.400> for<00:03:54.760> eight<00:03:54.940> just<00:03:55.510> make

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
high for four or low for eight just make

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.090 
high for four or low for eight just make
sure<00:03:55.840> when<00:03:56.019> it's<00:03:56.170> done<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:56.590> check<00:03:56.860> the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
sure when it's done that you check the

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.620 
sure when it's done that you check the
to<00:03:57.549> make<00:03:57.670> sure<00:03:57.730> that<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.120> chicken<00:03:58.299> is<00:03:58.510> done

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
to make sure that the chicken is done

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.509 
to make sure that the chicken is done
and<00:03:58.840> everything<00:03:59.230> you<00:03:59.650> do<00:03:59.799> the<00:03:59.950> on<00:04:00.130> low<00:04:00.310> for

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
and everything you do the on low for

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.160 
and everything you do the on low for
eight<00:04:00.640> hours<00:04:00.790> it's<00:04:01.180> typically<00:04:01.660> done<00:04:01.690> in<00:04:01.989> like

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
eight hours it's typically done in like

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.259 
eight hours it's typically done in like
six<00:04:02.530> sometimes<00:04:02.890> a<00:04:03.370> little<00:04:03.489> bit<00:04:03.610> more<00:04:03.940> a<00:04:03.970> little

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
six sometimes a little bit more a little

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.240 
six sometimes a little bit more a little
bit<00:04:04.299> less<00:04:04.600> so<00:04:05.230> you<00:04:05.290> just<00:04:05.500> have<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.799> check<00:04:06.010> it<00:04:06.160> at

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
bit less so you just have to check it at

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.630 
bit less so you just have to check it at
six<00:04:06.489> hours<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:07.030> if<00:04:07.120> it's<00:04:07.269> done

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
six hours and if it's done

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.880 
six hours and if it's done
you<00:04:07.670> can<00:04:07.790> just<00:04:07.970> turn<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.330> to<00:04:08.360> warm<00:04:08.750> or<00:04:09.230> low<00:04:09.560> heat

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
you can just turn it to warm or low heat

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.620 
you can just turn it to warm or low heat
until<00:04:10.100> you<00:04:10.670> guys<00:04:10.760> are<00:04:11.000> ready<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.210> eat<00:04:11.330> dinner

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
until you guys are ready to eat dinner

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.570 
until you guys are ready to eat dinner
so<00:04:11.750> it's<00:04:12.080> a<00:04:12.140> super<00:04:12.319> easy<00:04:12.500> recipe<00:04:12.770> so

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
so it's a super easy recipe so

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.070 
so it's a super easy recipe so
everything<00:04:14.180> that's<00:04:14.330> in<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.569> crock<00:04:14.780> pot<00:04:15.050> is

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
everything that's in the crock pot is

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.300 
everything that's in the crock pot is
like<00:04:15.530> your<00:04:16.180> gravy<00:04:17.180> or<00:04:17.450> your<00:04:18.040> topping<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.130> guess

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
like your gravy or your topping I guess

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.039 
like your gravy or your topping I guess
for<00:04:19.549> your<00:04:19.670> rice<00:04:19.850> so<00:04:20.269> then<00:04:20.420> typically<00:04:20.810> I'll

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
for your rice so then typically I'll

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.290 
for your rice so then typically I'll
make<00:04:21.260> like<00:04:21.500> four<00:04:22.220> David<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:22.730> I'll<00:04:22.850> make<00:04:23.150> about

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
make like four David and I'll make about

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.870 
make like four David and I'll make about
two<00:04:23.720> cups<00:04:23.960> of<00:04:24.169> white<00:04:24.350> rice<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:24.890> then<00:04:25.220> they<00:04:25.460> at

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
two cups of white rice and then they at

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.880 
two cups of white rice and then they at
Cracker<00:04:26.270> Barrel<00:04:26.600> if<00:04:26.660> they<00:04:26.780> mix<00:04:27.020> it<00:04:27.169> with<00:04:27.350> a<00:04:27.590> cup

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
Cracker Barrel if they mix it with a cup

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.120 
Cracker Barrel if they mix it with a cup
of<00:04:28.070> rice<00:04:28.250> pilaf<00:04:28.580> so<00:04:29.060> they<00:04:29.570> mix<00:04:29.840> white<00:04:30.590> rice<00:04:30.830> and

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
of rice pilaf so they mix white rice and

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.850 
of rice pilaf so they mix white rice and
rice<00:04:31.580> pilaf<00:04:31.940> together<00:04:32.510> and<00:04:32.900> then<00:04:33.350> they<00:04:33.530> serve

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
rice pilaf together and then they serve

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.180 
rice pilaf together and then they serve
the<00:04:34.370> chicken<00:04:34.610> carrot<00:04:35.540> um<00:04:35.750> creamy<00:04:36.500> gravy<00:04:36.740> over

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
the chicken carrot um creamy gravy over

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.620 
the chicken carrot um creamy gravy over
top<00:04:37.460> of<00:04:37.490> it

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
top of it

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.320 
top of it
David's<00:04:39.110> not<00:04:39.140> the<00:04:39.320> biggest<00:04:39.590> fan<00:04:39.830> of<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:41.120> rice

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
David's not the biggest fan of the rice

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.630 
David's not the biggest fan of the rice
pilaf<00:04:41.630> so<00:04:42.200> I<00:04:42.230> just<00:04:42.560> do<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.890> white<00:04:43.070> rice<00:04:43.310> but

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
pilaf so I just do the white rice but

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.820 
pilaf so I just do the white rice but
you<00:04:43.910> know<00:04:44.390> you<00:04:44.450> can<00:04:44.810> add<00:04:44.960> both<00:04:45.290> I<00:04:45.530> think<00:04:45.740> it

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
you know you can add both I think it

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.920 
you know you can add both I think it
just<00:04:45.980> gives<00:04:46.100> it<00:04:46.310> more<00:04:46.490> texture<00:04:46.910> more<00:04:47.540> flavor

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
just gives it more texture more flavor

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.570

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
I'll come back and check sometimes it'll

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.800 
I'll come back and check sometimes it'll
take<00:05:24.590> longer<00:05:24.830> sometimes<00:05:25.370> it'll<00:05:26.270> be<00:05:26.390> like<00:05:26.570> way

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
take longer sometimes it'll be like way

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.409 
take longer sometimes it'll be like way
done<00:05:27.080> by<00:05:27.260> then<00:05:27.440> it<00:05:27.620> really<00:05:27.770> just<00:05:27.979> depends<00:05:28.419> so

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
done by then it really just depends so

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.540 
done by then it really just depends so
that's<00:05:30.140> basically<00:05:30.560> how<00:05:30.680> you<00:05:30.860> make<00:05:31.160> it<00:05:31.190> and

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.960 
that's basically how you make it and
then<00:05:32.510> when<00:05:32.900> I<00:05:32.930> think<00:05:33.229> that<00:05:33.380> the<00:05:33.530> crock<00:05:33.740> pot

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
then when I think that the crock pot

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.150 
then when I think that the crock pot
gravy<00:05:34.970> is<00:05:35.150> done<00:05:35.360> I'll<00:05:35.630> prepare<00:05:36.200> like<00:05:36.470> I<00:05:36.740> don't

know like two cups of white rice and

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.540 
know like two cups of white rice and
then<00:05:39.020> you<00:05:39.140> just<00:05:39.380> serve<00:05:39.650> this<00:05:39.919> over<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.400> white

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550
