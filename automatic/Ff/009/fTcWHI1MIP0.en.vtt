a shade that's a couple times lighter

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.170

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.990 
your skin tone and that'll cover them up
just<00:02:12.080> as<00:02:12.319> well<00:02:12.530> don't<00:02:13.129> forget<00:02:13.250> your<00:02:13.640> upper

just as well don't forget your upper
lids<00:02:14.239> if<00:02:14.480> especially<00:02:14.810> if<00:02:15.140> they're<00:02:15.290> uneven

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
lids if especially if they're uneven

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.130 
lids if especially if they're uneven
like<00:02:15.980> mine<00:02:16.189> I'll<00:02:16.670> take<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.269> darker<00:02:17.629> color<00:02:17.870> in

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
like mine I'll take the darker color in

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.679 
like mine I'll take the darker color in
the<00:02:18.290> palette<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.860> put<00:02:19.549> that<00:02:19.700> on<00:02:19.970> my<00:02:20.239> lids

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
the palette and put that on my lids

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.210 
the palette and put that on my lids
so<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:20.959> they're<00:02:21.170> even<00:02:21.530> but<00:02:21.799> they're<00:02:21.950> not<00:02:22.040> as

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
so that they're even but they're not as

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.640 
so that they're even but they're not as
bright<00:02:22.489> as<00:02:22.610> my<00:02:22.730> under-eye<00:02:22.970> circles<00:02:23.470> or<00:02:24.470> my

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.100 
bright as my under-eye circles or my
under-eye<00:02:24.920> area<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:26.150> just<00:02:26.390> remember<00:02:26.599> to<00:02:26.750> even

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110

out<00:02:27.230> your<00:02:27.349> inner<00:02:27.560> corners<00:02:28.010> because<00:02:28.459> those<00:02:28.819> can

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
out your inner corners because those can

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.479

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.690 
corners and on the lids this is optional
but<00:03:10.780> sometimes<00:03:11.200> I'll<00:03:11.410> go<00:03:11.560> into<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:11.920> powder<00:03:12.400> like

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
but sometimes I'll go into a powder like

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.880 
but sometimes I'll go into a powder like
this<00:03:13.090> one<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:13.540> just<00:03:14.110> make<00:03:14.530> sure<00:03:14.560> that

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
this one and just make sure that

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.309 
this one and just make sure that
everything<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.400> set<00:03:15.700> in<00:03:15.940> place<00:03:16.390> but<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:16.959> don't

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
everything is set in place but I don't

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.479 
everything is set in place but I don't
do<00:03:17.440> this<00:03:17.590> all<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:17.799> time<00:03:17.890> because<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.340> have<00:03:18.459> a

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
do this all the time because I have a

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.030 
do this all the time because I have a
really<00:03:18.760> dry<00:03:19.209> skin<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.290> find<00:03:20.769> that<00:03:20.860> it<00:03:21.010> just

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
really dry skin and I find that it just

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.690 
really dry skin and I find that it just
settles<00:03:21.430> into<00:03:21.849> my<00:03:21.970> fine<00:03:22.269> lines<00:03:22.599> so<00:03:23.519> if<00:03:24.519> I'm

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700
