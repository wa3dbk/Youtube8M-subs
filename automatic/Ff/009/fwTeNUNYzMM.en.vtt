00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.850 
character and he really did and with
this<00:03:09.050> film<00:03:09.320> what<00:03:09.470> I<00:03:09.500> thought<00:03:09.680> would<00:03:09.800> be

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
this film what I thought would be

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.540 
this film what I thought would be
different<00:03:10.280> is<00:03:10.400> he<00:03:11.830> spends<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:12.950> lot<00:03:13.100> of<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.280> film

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
different is he spends a lot of the film

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.640 
different is he spends a lot of the film
you<00:03:14.390> know<00:03:14.480> he's<00:03:14.630> out<00:03:14.780> there<00:03:14.840> in<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.230> world<00:03:15.380> I

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
you know he's out there in the world I

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.080 
you know he's out there in the world I
thought<00:03:15.830> oh<00:03:15.860> he<00:03:16.220> hide<00:03:16.670> in<00:03:16.820> plain<00:03:16.970> sight

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
thought oh he hide in plain sight

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.170 
thought oh he hide in plain sight
there's<00:03:17.840> Michael<00:03:18.110> Myers<00:03:18.410> maybe<00:03:18.680> he's<00:03:18.890> that
