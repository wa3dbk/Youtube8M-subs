pick these up the other day and this is
a<00:00:14.849> great<00:00:15.690> system<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:17.630> one<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> nice

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
a great system and one of the nice

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.140 
a great system and one of the nice
things<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.410> each<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.460> these<00:00:20.640> tanks<00:00:20.970> can

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
things is that each of these tanks can

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.210 
things is that each of these tanks can
be<00:00:21.180> used<00:00:21.449> independently<00:00:21.810> or<00:00:22.260> they<00:00:22.800> can<00:00:22.949> be<00:00:23.039> put

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
be used independently or they can be put

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.810 
be used independently or they can be put
together<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.900> to<00:00:24.900> process<00:00:25.410> even<00:00:25.560> more<00:00:25.820> film

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
together to to process even more film

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.620 
together to to process even more film
this<00:00:27.060> holds<00:00:27.570> was<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.500> one<00:00:28.949> one<00:00:29.429> real<00:00:29.760> one<00:00:30.390> roll

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
this holds was it one one real one roll

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.639 
this holds was it one one real one roll
of<00:00:30.769> 135<00:00:31.769> millimeter<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:33.059> holds<00:00:33.649> four

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
of 135 millimeter and this holds four

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.200 
of 135 millimeter and this holds four
rolls<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.160> 135<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.660> together<00:00:38.030> maybe<00:00:39.030> together

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
rolls of 135 so together maybe together

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.080 
rolls of 135 so together maybe together
they<00:00:39.480> hold<00:00:39.660> four<00:00:39.960> I'm<00:00:40.440> not<00:00:40.620> sure<00:00:40.829> anyway<00:00:41.399> but

they hold four I'm not sure anyway but
the<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.660> an<00:00:42.780> expandable<00:00:43.260> system<00:00:43.500> which<00:00:43.920> is

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
the it's an expandable system which is

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.860 
the it's an expandable system which is
pretty<00:00:44.280> nice<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.210> I'm<00:00:45.270> gonna<00:00:45.360> start<00:00:45.629> I'm<00:00:45.719> going

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
to take off the lid you can see how this

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.880 
to take off the lid you can see how this
it<00:00:48.989> only<00:00:49.110> came<00:00:49.289> with<00:00:49.469> two<00:00:49.620> reels

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
it only came with two reels

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.420 
it only came with two reels
unfortunately<00:00:51.320> there<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:52.440> go<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.160> these<00:00:53.280> are

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
unfortunately there we go so these are

the 1540 tank and here is the lid and
the<00:01:01.890> lid<00:01:02.070> was<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.489> there<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:02.879> as<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.149> see

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the lid was on there but as you can see

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.020 
the lid was on there but as you can see
I<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.690> put<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.049> onto<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.040> 1510<00:01:05.700> pretty<00:01:06.000> simply

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
I can put it onto the 1510 pretty simply

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.810 
I can put it onto the 1510 pretty simply
now<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.360> develop<00:01:09.689> one<00:01:09.900> just<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.799> roll<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
now I can develop one just one roll and

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.320 
now I can develop one just one roll and
fortunately<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.860> setup<00:01:14.220> also<00:01:14.460> came<00:01:14.880> with<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
fortunately the setup also came with the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.200 
fortunately the setup also came with the
one<00:01:15.540> roll<00:01:15.780> spindle<00:01:16.549> or<00:01:17.549> whatever<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.119> called

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
one roll spindle or whatever it's called

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.140 
one roll spindle or whatever it's called
that<00:01:18.509> goes<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> middle<00:01:19.020> there<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.850> plat

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
that goes in the middle there the plat

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.679 
that goes in the middle there the plat
they're<00:01:21.420> plastic<00:01:22.820> reels<00:01:23.820> they<00:01:24.509> work<00:01:24.659> just

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
they're plastic reels they work just

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.480 
they're plastic reels they work just
like<00:01:25.020> any<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.470> plastic<00:01:25.650> reels<00:01:26.040> if<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.280> see

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
like any of the plastic reels if you see

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.999 
like any of the plastic reels if you see
my<00:01:26.670> how<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.880> load<00:01:27.150> 35<00:01:27.659> millimeter<00:01:28.110> video<00:01:28.409> these

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
my how to load 35 millimeter video these

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.450 
my how to load 35 millimeter video these
work<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.400> same<00:01:29.610> way<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:31.100> they<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.340> that

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
work the same way and they can do that

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.859 
work the same way and they can do that
safely<00:01:32.820> they're<00:01:33.810> expandable<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:35.280> 120<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.780> now

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
safely they're expandable to 120 so now

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.030 
safely they're expandable to 120 so now
they<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.049> take<00:01:37.170> 120<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:40.170> then<00:01:40.619> they<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:40.920> take

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
they can take 120 and then they can take

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.859 
they can take 120 and then they can take
35<00:01:41.460> 35<00:01:42.240> there<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:42.570> go

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
35 35 there we go

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.050 
35 35 there we go
they<00:01:43.259> cannot<00:01:43.530> however<00:01:43.770> take<00:01:45.619> 127<00:01:46.619> film<00:01:47.060> which

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
they cannot however take 127 film which

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.960 
they cannot however take 127 film which
is<00:01:48.180> okay<00:01:48.479> because<00:01:48.659> there<00:01:49.020> aren't<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.350> many

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
is okay because there aren't that many

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.039 
is okay because there aren't that many

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
how to use some something very similar

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.920 
how to use some something very similar
to<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:04.340> other<00:02:05.340> than<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.719> once<00:02:06.719> you

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
to that and other than that once you

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.249 
to that and other than that once you
have<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:08.310> way<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.489> actually<00:02:08.789> properly<00:02:09.629> used

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
have the way to actually properly used

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.460 
have the way to actually properly used
we<00:02:10.619> should<00:02:10.739> probably<00:02:10.950> do<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:12.200> is<00:02:13.200> once

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
we should probably do that is once

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.800 
we should probably do that is once
they're<00:02:13.680> assembled<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.909> this<00:02:15.269> is<00:02:15.420> me<00:02:15.599> I'm

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
they're assembled and this is me I'm

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.039 
they're assembled and this is me I'm
going<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:17.060> make<00:02:18.060> sure<00:02:18.209> these<00:02:18.420> are<00:02:18.480> lined<00:02:18.870> up

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
going to make sure these are lined up

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.039 
going to make sure these are lined up
because<00:02:19.440> otherwise<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:20.010> will<00:02:20.069> freak<00:02:20.519> out<00:02:21.049> okay

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
because otherwise I will freak out okay

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.699 
because otherwise I will freak out okay
so<00:02:22.849> there<00:02:23.849> we<00:02:23.909> go<00:02:24.030> that's<00:02:24.269> not<00:02:25.170> quite<00:02:25.440> clipped

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
so there we go that's not quite clipped

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.920 
so there we go that's not quite clipped
in<00:02:25.860> place<00:02:26.069> it's<00:02:26.310> not<00:02:26.489> able<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:27.030> wrote<00:02:27.540> if<00:02:27.780> it's

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
in place it's not able to wrote if it's

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.420 
in place it's not able to wrote if it's
clipped<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.290> place<00:02:28.470> properly<00:02:28.769> that<00:02:29.220> won't

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
clipped in place properly that won't

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.259 
clipped in place properly that won't
rotate<00:02:31.310> there<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.430> go<00:02:32.549> now<00:02:32.760> it's<00:02:32.910> clipped<00:02:33.090> in

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
rotate there we go now it's clipped in

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.350 
rotate there we go now it's clipped in
place<00:02:33.299> you<00:02:33.629> can<00:02:33.720> hear<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:33.989> clip<00:02:35.120> once<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.239> have

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
place you can hear it clip once you have

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.330 
place you can hear it clip once you have
the<00:02:36.510> remembering<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.680> any<00:02:37.829> time<00:02:38.069> you<00:02:38.220> load

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
the remembering that any time you load

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.250 
the remembering that any time you load
film<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.760> have<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.030> be<00:02:39.150> in<00:02:39.269> complete<00:02:39.720> darkness

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
film you have to be in complete darkness

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.500 
film you have to be in complete darkness
if<00:02:40.860> your<00:02:41.040> film<00:02:41.280> was<00:02:41.370> exposed<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.849> light<00:02:42.060> before

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
if your film was exposed to light before

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.479 
if your film was exposed to light before
or<00:02:42.810> after<00:02:43.379> you<00:02:43.500> expose<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.280> camera

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
or after you expose it in the camera

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.710 
or after you expose it in the camera
it's<00:02:45.150> ruined

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
it's ruined

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.720 
it's ruined
so<00:02:46.379> in<00:02:46.650> complete<00:02:47.010> darkness<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.459> would<00:02:47.579> load

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
so in complete darkness you would load

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.580 
so in complete darkness you would load
up<00:02:47.910> however<00:02:48.120> many<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.450> these<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.720> have<00:02:48.930> put

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
up however many of these you have put

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.130 
up however many of these you have put
them<00:02:49.739> into<00:02:49.859> the<00:02:49.980> container

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.740 

and<00:02:56.800> there<00:02:57.100> you<00:02:57.220> go<00:02:57.330> let<00:02:58.330> me<00:02:58.420> try<00:02:58.570> that<00:02:58.600> again

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
and there you go let me try that again

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.820 
and there you go let me try that again
yeah<00:02:59.170> that's<00:02:59.500> better

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
yeah that's better

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.860 
yeah that's better

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
you've got to seat the components

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.050 
you've got to seat the components
properly<00:03:02.620> otherwise<00:03:02.980> they<00:03:03.430> won't<00:03:03.550> clip<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.000> in

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
properly otherwise they won't clip it in

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.890 
properly otherwise they won't clip it in
place<00:03:04.270> and<00:03:04.860> once<00:03:05.860> everything's<00:03:06.250> loaded
