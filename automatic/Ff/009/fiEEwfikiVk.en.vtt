00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
problem and if you look at the

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.090 
problem and if you look at the
irrespective<00:02:01.220> of<00:02:01.450> whether<00:02:02.450> that's

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
irrespective of whether that's

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.530 
irrespective of whether that's
contributed<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:04.220> some<00:02:04.490> way<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:04.790> what<00:02:05.150> happened

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
contributed in some way to what happened

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.800 
contributed in some way to what happened
I<00:02:05.750> think<00:02:06.079> it's<00:02:06.350> clear<00:02:06.650> that<00:02:06.680> even<00:02:06.950> if<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:07.579> had

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
I think it's clear that even if you had

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.699 
I think it's clear that even if you had
welfare<00:02:08.810> reform<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.170> they<00:02:09.439> weren't

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
welfare reform and they weren't

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.680 
welfare reform and they weren't
receiving<00:02:09.950> that<00:02:10.220> amount<00:02:10.429> of<00:02:10.489> money

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
receiving that amount of money

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.330 
receiving that amount of money
what<00:02:11.870> happened<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:12.380> this<00:02:12.500> situation<00:02:13.070> was<00:02:13.220> an

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
what happened in this situation was an

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.560 
what happened in this situation was an
awful<00:02:13.970> awful<00:02:14.290> terrible<00:02:15.290> tragedy<00:02:16.100> it<00:02:16.610> was<00:02:16.910> so

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
awful awful terrible tragedy it was so

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.240 
awful awful terrible tragedy it was so
complicated<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.530> it<00:02:18.740> really<00:02:19.010> has<00:02:19.220> very

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
complicated and it really has very

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.310 
complicated and it really has very
little<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:19.940> think<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.660> consequences<00:02:21.260> of

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
little I think the the consequences of

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.140 
little I think the the consequences of
what<00:02:21.470> happened<00:02:21.770> have<00:02:22.220> very<00:02:22.430> little<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.970> do

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
what happened have very little to do

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.920 
what happened have very little to do
with<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:24.020> situation<00:02:24.710> in<00:02:25.310> terms<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:26.120> benefits

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
with the situation in terms of benefits

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.310 
with the situation in terms of benefits
that<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.140> family<00:02:27.500> received<00:02:27.890> but<00:02:28.670> largely

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
that the family received but largely

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.810 
that the family received but largely
