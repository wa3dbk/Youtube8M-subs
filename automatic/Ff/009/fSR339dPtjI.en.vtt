00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.700
 circumstances things as if they were yesterday 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.830

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.899
 my mom singing me the song I 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.270
 Chinita disguising her being 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.149

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.250
 I was recharging and is waiting for 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.259
 I will be knocked on the wall and suddenly 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.920
 many children pass by when I 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.780
 I fainted and this memory I remember 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.990
 Well, the wooden horse that always 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.420
 It made you feel like a day of 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.009
 longing for something that is missing as from 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.450
 I long for something that was left without 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.450
 solve then are many songs 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.450
 magical 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.660
 tell me about the most demanding public and the 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.459
 more special that is what you have in your 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.160
 house your children by listening to this 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.500
 material what were the reactions you 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.850
 I tell you that this material was 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.760
 especially for them or this is this one 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.450
 It was some models that I did to 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.489
 my children for my house together I do not have 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.020
 planned to take out a disk or later to do 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:38.569
 animated videos nothing that came up because 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.540
 well I had a joint with gunpowder from a 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.860
 meson about me an album that I'm 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.900
 doing right now in study that is the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.910
 disc that follows him to first row 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.459
 habitat always the disc of 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.230
 study and suddenly I said I heard you by 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.320
 I'm going to send you those songs 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.769
 that for my children here at home as he loves 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.360
 that has some songs for your children 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.600
 impossible to play the songs 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.250
 he unnerved at that moment he called arming and 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.360
 we started the project in two 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.360
 weeks it was all over 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.640
 you would even think of calling lorenzo 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.180
 Antonio to sing adult with you in 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.760
 the area 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:28.180
 joanito farÃ­a nice ideas are not you 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.180
 giving him a good hand queen 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.470
 he really listens that yes yes I believe that no 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.340
 I know that gives you the fortune to make a 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.319
 volume that they can in others have 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.480
 too many surprises 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.340
 too many these dreams fulfilled by 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.610
 example for me singing with chabelo would be 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.610
 divine 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.659
 and often he talked about that 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.510
 has invited you to be part of realities 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:05.569
 as the voice would think you would accept 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.849
 some time this take this project 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.010
 as the voice alone voice kids notice that 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.650
 from the first the second voice but 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.500
 I always have this guest not always 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:19.170
 They have been with the desire that I 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.020
 participate I am very good for 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.230
 judge etcetera but I would not like 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.600
 have the fate of someone in my hands 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.570
 because I have to make the choice of 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.060
 one or the other because there is room for all 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.070
 then this part is the one that I do not 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.080
 convinces because there is room for all 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.130
 and I'm not someone to take away the 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.130
 dreams to someone 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.910

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.360
