00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
of the head of the mask so this is going

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.260 
of the head of the mask so this is going
to<00:04:52.930> be<00:04:53.050> hidden<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:54.220> then<00:04:54.490> I'm<00:04:54.610> just<00:04:54.760> going<00:04:54.970> to

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
mask so I didn't leave any space for

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.390 
mask so I didn't leave any space for
your<00:05:00.910> head<00:05:01.150> to<00:05:01.180> actually<00:05:01.810> fit<00:05:02.169> and<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:03.010> figure

your head to actually fit and I figure
this<00:05:03.520> out<00:05:03.990> after<00:05:04.990> it<00:05:05.080> had<00:05:05.200> dried<00:05:05.440> so<00:05:05.710> I'll<00:05:05.830> give

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
this out after it had dried so I'll give

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.770 
this out after it had dried so I'll give
you<00:05:06.130> guys<00:05:06.250> a<00:05:06.310> solution<00:05:06.910> to<00:05:07.030> this<00:05:07.180> as<00:05:07.390> well<00:05:07.510> so

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
you guys a solution to this as well so

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.350 
you guys a solution to this as well so
I'm<00:05:07.900> just<00:05:07.930> adding<00:05:08.169> some<00:05:08.530> more<00:05:08.650> glue<00:05:09.180> for<00:05:10.180> the

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.659 
I'm just adding some more glue for the
flowers<00:05:11.080> so<00:05:11.530> I'm<00:05:11.650> gonna<00:05:11.830> add<00:05:12.040> the<00:05:12.310> yellow

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
flowers so I'm gonna add the yellow

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:13.620 
flowers so I'm gonna add the yellow
flowers<00:05:13.090> first

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
flowers first

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.110 
flowers first
then<00:05:14.440> I'm<00:05:14.620> going<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:14.890> add<00:05:15.070> two<00:05:15.400> red<00:05:15.640> flowers

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
then I'm going to add two red flowers

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.369 
then I'm going to add two red flowers
along<00:05:16.600> the<00:05:16.810> top<00:05:17.020> to<00:05:17.710> represent<00:05:18.580> her<00:05:19.150> hat

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:21.379 
along the top to represent her hat

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:23.809 
along the top to represent her hat
so<00:05:22.379> this<00:05:23.009> is<00:05:23.189> what<00:05:23.309> I<00:05:23.339> was<00:05:23.460> talking<00:05:23.759> about

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:23.819 
so this is what I was talking about

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:25.489 
so this is what I was talking about
there's<00:05:24.180> no<00:05:24.300> space<00:05:24.569> for<00:05:24.599> your<00:05:24.930> head<00:05:25.110> to<00:05:25.139> fit

00:05:25.489 --> 00:05:25.499 
there's no space for your head to fit

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:26.899 
there's no space for your head to fit
through<00:05:25.800> so<00:05:26.039> I'm<00:05:26.159> just<00:05:26.309> going<00:05:26.430> to<00:05:26.460> grab<00:05:26.669> some

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909

but<00:05:43.770> since<00:05:44.039> the<00:05:44.219> lace<00:05:44.430> is<00:05:44.699> so<00:05:44.809> there's<00:05:45.809> so<00:05:45.930> many

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
but since the lace is so there's so many

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.869 
but since the lace is so there's so many
holes<00:05:46.349> in<00:05:46.499> it<00:05:46.680> it<00:05:46.830> just<00:05:47.189> wouldn't<00:05:47.460> have<00:05:47.610> worked

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
holes in it it just wouldn't have worked
