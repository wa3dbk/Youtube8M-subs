Goerke and David Lynch we wanted to find
out<00:00:25.920> if<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.340> could<00:00:26.550> swim<00:00:26.910> water<00:00:27.660> into

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
out if you could swim water into

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.490 
out if you could swim water into
hydrogen<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.949> oxygen<00:00:29.840> because<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:31.170> are<00:00:31.289> both

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.469 
I'm coming drinky and I'm here to show
you<00:01:09.710> how<00:01:09.799> you<00:01:09.979> really<00:01:10.549> split<00:01:10.939> water<00:01:11.180> and

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
you how you really split water and

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.920 
you how you really split water and
hygiene<00:01:11.689> in<00:01:12.080> oxygen<00:01:12.790> first<00:01:13.790> we<00:01:14.360> sharpen<00:01:14.750> two

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
hygiene in oxygen first we sharpen two

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.910 
hygiene in oxygen first we sharpen two
pencils<00:01:15.500> on<00:01:15.710> both<00:01:16.100> ends<00:01:16.549> okay<00:01:17.170> then<00:01:18.170> we<00:01:18.680> put

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
pencils on both ends okay then we put

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.430 
pencils on both ends okay then we put
poke<00:01:19.580> two<00:01:19.970> holes<00:01:20.000> in<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.420> cardboard<00:01:20.990> and

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
poke two holes in the cardboard and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.020 
poke two holes in the cardboard and
stuck<00:01:21.799> them<00:01:22.009> in<00:01:22.190> like<00:01:22.399> so<00:01:23.409> okay<00:01:24.880> now<00:01:25.880> we're

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
stuck them in like so okay now we're

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.270 
stuck them in like so okay now we're
going<00:01:26.119> to<00:01:26.180> want<00:01:26.390> to<00:01:26.420> teaspoon<00:01:27.409> of<00:01:27.590> salt<00:01:27.799> into

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
going to want to teaspoon of salt into

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.969 
going to want to teaspoon of salt into
the<00:01:28.610> hot<00:01:28.939> water<00:01:28.970> hot<00:01:29.930> tap<00:01:30.259> one<00:01:32.590> we're<00:01:33.590> going<00:01:33.890> to

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
the hot water hot tap one we're going to

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.130 
the hot water hot tap one we're going to
put<00:01:34.070> this<00:01:34.399> over<00:01:36.250> yeah<00:01:37.250> I<00:01:37.610> know<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:38.750> guys<00:01:38.899> all

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
put this over yeah I know you guys all

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.020 
put this over yeah I know you guys all
want<00:01:39.319> me<00:01:39.440> to<00:01:39.470> connect<00:01:39.800> the<00:01:39.920> large<00:01:40.100> for<00:01:40.729> me<00:01:40.880> too

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
want me to connect the large for me too

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.410 
want me to connect the large for me too
let's<00:01:41.330> review<00:01:41.720> our<00:01:41.780> hypothesis<00:01:43.060> using<00:01:44.060> the

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
let's review our hypothesis using the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.270 
let's review our hypothesis using the
hydrogen<00:01:44.810> will<00:01:44.960> gather<00:01:45.200> on<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.679> pencil<00:01:46.100> and

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
hydrogen will gather on the pencil and

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.460 
hydrogen will gather on the pencil and
the<00:01:46.429> oxygen<00:01:46.970> going<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.630> air<00:01:47.840> because

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
the oxygen going to the air because

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.740 
the oxygen going to the air because
oxygen<00:01:48.740> is<00:01:49.159> all<00:01:49.460> over<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.240> air<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.659> the

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
oxygen is all over the air and the

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.020 
oxygen is all over the air and the
oxygen<00:01:50.890> from<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:51.950> water<00:01:52.039> will<00:01:52.670> join<00:01:52.880> the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
oxygen from the water will join the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.380 
oxygen from the water will join the
oxygen<00:01:53.539> with<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.810> rest<00:01:54.110> of<00:01:54.319> the<00:01:54.470> air<00:01:55.390> the

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
oxygen with the rest of the air the

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.660 
oxygen with the rest of the air the
hydrogen<00:01:56.959> will<00:01:57.319> stay<00:01:57.590> in<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:57.979> water<00:01:58.190> because

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
hydrogen will stay in the water because

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.719 
hydrogen will stay in the water because
there's<00:01:58.909> not<00:01:59.509> much<00:01:59.840> hydrogen<00:02:00.440> in<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.740> air<00:02:00.920> for

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
there's not much hydrogen in the air for

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.330 
there's not much hydrogen in the air for
the<00:02:01.819> height<00:02:02.080> for<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.289> hydrogen<00:02:03.649> in<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.100> water

rising<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:06.159> the<00:03:06.190> top<00:03:06.280> now<00:03:07.239> as<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:07.720> can<00:03:07.840> see<00:03:07.900> on

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
rising to the top now as you can see on

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.990 
rising to the top now as you can see on
the<00:03:08.260> positive<00:03:08.799> side<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.220> battery<00:03:09.250> the

the positive side of the battery the
pink<00:03:10.269> pencil<00:03:10.480> we<00:03:11.349> got<00:03:11.560> your<00:03:12.069> chlorine<00:03:12.579> now

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
pink pencil we got your chlorine now

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.300 
pink pencil we got your chlorine now
since<00:03:13.900> we're<00:03:14.049> putting<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.620> salt<00:03:14.859> in<00:03:15.099> the

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
since we're putting the salt in the

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.229 
since we're putting the salt in the
chlorine<00:03:16.060> is<00:03:16.239> sticking<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.530> pencil<00:03:18.010> and

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
chlorine is sticking to the pencil and

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.819 
chlorine is sticking to the pencil and
the<00:03:19.239> bubbles<00:03:19.690> are<00:03:19.870> not<00:03:19.930> moving<00:03:20.379> because

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
the bubbles are not moving because

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.160 
the bubbles are not moving because
chlorine<00:03:21.160> weighs<00:03:21.609> more<00:03:21.940> than<00:03:22.239> hydrogen<00:03:22.930> and

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
chlorine weighs more than hydrogen and

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.559 
chlorine weighs more than hydrogen and
now<00:03:26.170> let's<00:03:26.739> reintroduce<00:03:27.159> my<00:03:27.670> partner<00:03:28.120> David

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
now let's reintroduce my partner David

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.210 
now let's reintroduce my partner David
to<00:03:28.870> explain<00:03:29.260> about<00:03:29.379> the<00:03:29.620> results<00:03:30.040> and

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
to explain about the results and

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:38.040 
to explain about the results and
conclusion

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.000 

now<00:03:39.050> I<00:03:39.410> will<00:03:39.890> be<00:03:40.100> stating<00:03:41.060> our<00:03:41.240> conclusion<00:03:42.010> the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
now I will be stating our conclusion the

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.730 
now I will be stating our conclusion the

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
hydrogen gathered to the pencil was the

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.550 
hydrogen gathered to the pencil was the
negative<00:03:45.920> stars<00:03:46.520> battery<00:03:47.140> chlorine<00:03:48.140> from<00:03:48.410> the

negative stars battery chlorine from the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.100 
negative stars battery chlorine from the
salt<00:03:48.830> gathered<00:03:49.370> around<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:50.000> positive<00:03:50.450> charge

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
salt gathered around the positive charge

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.070 
salt gathered around the positive charge
pencil<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:52.400> hydrogen<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:53.240> chlorine<00:03:53.420> from

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
pencil the hydrogen and chlorine from

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.400 
pencil the hydrogen and chlorine from
and<00:03:54.460> chlorine<00:03:55.460> both<00:03:55.760> made<00:03:56.090> bubbles<00:03:56.600> the

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
and chlorine both made bubbles the

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.650 
and chlorine both made bubbles the
hydrogen<00:03:57.890> is<00:03:58.040> layer<00:03:58.250> so<00:03:58.790> it<00:03:58.940> went<00:03:59.150> up<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.510> the

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
hydrogen is layer so it went up to the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.310 
hydrogen is layer so it went up to the
surface

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
surface

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.950

the<00:04:01.010> chloramine<00:04:01.520> wasn't<00:04:01.880> as<00:04:01.970> light<00:04:02.210> so<00:04:02.780> it

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
the chloramine wasn't as light so it

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.530 
the chloramine wasn't as light so it
stayed<00:04:03.200> around<00:04:03.350> the<00:04:03.680> pencils<00:04:04.160> but<00:04:05.030> actually

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
stayed around the pencils but actually

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.300 
stayed around the pencils but actually
in<00:04:05.600> combined<00:04:05.930> with<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.290> salt<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:06.680> stayed<00:04:07.100> as

in combined with the salt and stayed as

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.340 
in combined with the salt and stayed as
the<00:04:07.520> water<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:08.420> water<00:04:08.630> was<00:04:08.900> basically

hydrogen now we will be saying our

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.460 
hydrogen now we will be saying our
results<00:04:18.730> we<00:04:19.730> found<00:04:20.030> out<00:04:20.270> that<00:04:20.540> it<00:04:20.750> is<00:04:20.900> possible

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
results we found out that it is possible

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.400 
results we found out that it is possible
to<00:04:21.530> split<00:04:21.950> water<00:04:22.190> into<00:04:22.700> hydrogen<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.330> oxygen

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
to split water into hydrogen and oxygen

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.520 
to split water into hydrogen and oxygen
since<00:04:25.130> higher<00:04:25.340> hydrogen<00:04:25.970> is<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:27.050> first<00:04:27.320> on

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
since higher hydrogen is the first on

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.800 
since higher hydrogen is the first on
the<00:04:27.650> periodic<00:04:28.130> table<00:04:28.340> it<00:04:28.760> is<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.630> lyse

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
the periodic table it is the lyse

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
and stayed as the rest to the wire

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.990 
and stayed as the rest to the wire
without<00:04:41.720> what<00:04:41.930> Tigard<00:04:42.470> we<00:04:43.370> can't<00:04:43.670> tell<00:04:43.850> the

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
without what Tigard we can't tell the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.780 
without what Tigard we can't tell the
difference<00:04:44.300> between<00:04:44.480> the<00:04:44.900> h2o<00:04:45.440> and<00:04:45.830> oxygen

difference between the h2o and oxygen
and<00:04:46.940> chlorine<00:04:47.150> so<00:04:47.960> we<00:04:48.080> didn't<00:04:48.380> find<00:04:48.620> exactly

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
and chlorine so we didn't find exactly

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.390 
and chlorine so we didn't find exactly
what<00:04:49.580> we<00:04:49.730> were<00:04:49.910> looking<00:04:50.240> for<00:04:50.710> we<00:04:51.710> got<00:04:51.950> to<00:04:52.190> see

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
what we were looking for we got to see

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.980 
what we were looking for we got to see
the<00:04:52.610> hydrogen<00:04:52.910> rise<00:04:53.300> up<00:04:53.540> to<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.720> surface

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
the hydrogen rise up to the surface

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.490 
the hydrogen rise up to the surface
which<00:04:54.770> was<00:04:55.040> pretty<00:04:55.610> neat<00:04:55.940> now<00:04:56.930> we'll<00:04:57.350> be

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
which was pretty neat now we'll be

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.040 
which was pretty neat now we'll be
talking<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:57.950> Kevin<00:04:58.370> to<00:04:58.520> see<00:04:59.150> where<00:04:59.630> we<00:04:59.810> got
