00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
are some notches in there so they're

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.339 
are some notches in there so they're
designed<00:02:02.800> for<00:02:03.039> specific<00:02:03.610> rod<00:02:03.910> holders<00:02:04.360> so<00:02:04.660> the

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:05.349 
designed for specific rod holders so the

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:07.639 
designed for specific rod holders so the
rod<00:02:05.560> won't<00:02:05.830> spin<00:02:06.340> pull<00:02:06.700> in<00:02:06.849> the<00:02:06.970> rod<00:02:07.149> holder

the<00:02:08.649> reel<00:02:08.860> seats<00:02:09.160> got<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.489> double<00:02:09.910> locking<00:02:10.119> nut

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
the reel seats got a double locking nut

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.990 
the reel seats got a double locking nut
so<00:02:10.869> your<00:02:11.770> reel<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:12.130> never<00:02:12.340> going<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.610> come<00:02:12.760> off

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000
