once<00:01:41.400> again<00:01:41.520> i<00:01:41.729> can't<00:01:42.030> really<00:01:42.210> comment<00:01:42.540> on

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810

once again i can't really comment on
frame<00:01:43.140> rate<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.649> i'm<00:01:43.710> going<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.040> assume<00:01:44.189> that

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
frame rate so i'm going to assume that

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.160

60<00:01:46.649> FPS<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.460> looked<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.180> 30<00:01:48.450> or<00:01:48.600> 60<00:01:48.930> on

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079

60 FPS it looked like it was 30 or 60 on
the<00:01:49.110> Xbox<00:01:49.530> there<00:01:49.710> was<00:01:49.829> no<00:01:49.979> stuttering<00:01:50.369> there

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
the Xbox there was no stuttering there

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.719 
hasn't held the pc version looked like
it<00:01:52.560> was<00:01:52.649> running<00:01:52.890> heavier<00:01:53.189> because<00:01:53.369> they<00:01:53.670> were

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
it was running heavier because they were

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.670 
it was running heavier because they were
running<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.299> beta<00:01:54.570> build<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.590> was

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
running this like beta build and it was

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.200 
running this like beta build and it was
closer<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.040> finished<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.640> consoles<00:01:57.090> but

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
closer to finished on the consoles but

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.730 
closer to finished on the consoles but
i'm<00:01:57.329> sure<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.659> finished<00:01:57.930> pc<00:01:58.259> build<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.619> going

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
i'm sure the finished pc build is going

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.950 
i'm sure the finished pc build is going
to<00:01:58.799> run<00:01:58.950> smoothly<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.570> it<00:02:00.570> didn't<00:02:00.840> look<00:02:00.899> like

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
to run smoothly to it didn't look like

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.450 
to run smoothly to it didn't look like
there<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.229> any<00:02:01.439> screen<00:02:01.740> tearing<00:02:01.979> didn't<00:02:02.399> look

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
there is any screen tearing didn't look

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.280 
there is any screen tearing didn't look
like<00:02:02.520> there<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.820> any<00:02:03.060> micro<00:02:03.390> stutter<00:02:03.630> well<00:02:04.259> i

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
like there is any micro stutter well i

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.510 
like there is any micro stutter well i
mean<00:02:04.409> obviously<00:02:04.770> there's<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.040> convenient

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
mean obviously there's a convenient

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.039 
mean obviously there's a convenient
micro<00:02:05.759> stutter<00:02:05.969> because<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.479> single<00:02:06.750> GPU

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
micro stutter because it's a single GPU

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.389 
micro stutter because it's a single GPU
but<00:02:07.380> day<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.590> never<00:02:07.770> know<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.069> could<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.280> a

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.839 
problem my only gripe about the xbox
version<00:02:10.709> was<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.220> maybe<00:02:11.430> there<00:02:11.700> was<00:02:11.819> a

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
version was that maybe there was a

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.910 
version was that maybe there was a
little<00:02:12.120> bit<00:02:12.330> less<00:02:12.510> anti-aliasing<00:02:13.379> but

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
little bit less anti-aliasing but

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.589 
little bit less anti-aliasing but
if<00:02:13.980> we're<00:02:14.250> going<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.459> go<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:14.730> 1080p<00:02:15.209> and

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
if we're going to go on 1080p and

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.990 
if we're going to go on 1080p and
sometime<00:02:16.530> in<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.680> future<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:17.130> 4k<00:02:17.400> displays

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
sometime in the future on 4k displays

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.699 
sometime in the future on 4k displays
anti-aliasing<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:18.989> going<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.170> get<00:02:19.260> phased<00:02:19.500> out

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
anti-aliasing is going to get phased out

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.559 
anti-aliasing is going to get phased out
so<00:02:20.370> again<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.819> really<00:02:21.030> doesn't<00:02:21.270> matter<00:02:21.330> the

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
so again it really doesn't matter the

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.360 
so again it really doesn't matter the
denser<00:02:21.959> that<00:02:22.110> our<00:02:22.200> pixels<00:02:22.590> get<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.010> less<00:02:23.190> we

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
denser that our pixels get the less we

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.800 
denser that our pixels get the less we
need<00:02:23.520> anti-aliasing<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.420> more<00:02:24.599> we<00:02:24.630> need

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
need anti-aliasing and the more we need

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.890 
need anti-aliasing and the more we need
vram<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.310> apu<00:02:26.730> setup<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.270> kind<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.599> smart

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
vram so the apu setup is kind of smart

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.979 
vram so the apu setup is kind of smart
because<00:02:28.739> instead<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.550> using<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.910> fast<00:02:30.239> GPU<00:02:30.870> to

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
because instead of using a fast GPU to

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.290 
because instead of using a fast GPU to
do<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.230> anti-aliasing<00:02:31.850> instead<00:02:32.850> we<00:02:33.000> can<00:02:33.150> use

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
do the anti-aliasing instead we can use

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.780 
do the anti-aliasing instead we can use
a<00:02:33.330> big<00:02:33.600> block<00:02:33.989> of<00:02:34.020> fucking<00:02:34.620> vram<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.340> do<00:02:35.520> high

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
a big block of fucking vram to do high

a big block of fucking vram to do high

there's a little bit less anti-aliasing

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.140 
there's a little bit less anti-aliasing
