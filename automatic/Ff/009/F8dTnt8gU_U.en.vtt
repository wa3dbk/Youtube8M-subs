00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:14.410
 recently 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.410
 my program entry was referred 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:22.190
 a person to a color character that 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.980
 He wears a hat like me but he's not from 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:28.620
 wool is to appear as swimming 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.900
 he also wears glasses 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.760
 He speaks with a strange accent but he is not 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.610
 to discredit those who follow us 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.400
 South Americans that you have a native 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.870
 peculiar and admirable because you feel 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.570
 proud of the provenance as 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.650
 I feel of mine if it was not just for 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.910
 make a value consideration 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.500
 respect is in chairs per cent 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.290
 they created a lot of people 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.910
 and some even said that this 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.320
 character was better condition than me 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.330
 I guess he meant that he was capable 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.520
 to do more push-ups and run more than 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.340
 that does not fit any doubt 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.790
 because I do not even do push-ups 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.790
 nor to run 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.630
 fast road like the cardio well fine 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.600
 done well executed as we said 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.880
 many times and if it ran it could be 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.899
 behind someone 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.899
 never go ahead 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.490
 I think you should reflect on 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.750
 little bit about your comments 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.780
 and I think that 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.480
 although I particularly may not fall 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.550
 you are exceedingly well 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.470
 if you should see behind my aspect to 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:42.260
 someone trying to get people to learn 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.860
 and above all two consciences 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.700
 that stupidity has been established in 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.700
 our country 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.420
 because if programs like that have 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.420
 quorum 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.300
 is that really those who follow him 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.900
 you deserve what I will give you 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.940
 surely humiliation submission 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.290
 the barbarities 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.840
 they attract you 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.000
 you have a problem 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.950
 with this I also want to make a 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.370
 review 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.530
 to all of us who get up and go to 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.819
 the demonstrations 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.200
 against 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.200
 of the invasion of Iraq 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.760
 but we do not mobilize when 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.810
 they put the blue zone the municipalities 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.420
 when they put the cars with 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.180
 built-in photo cameras for 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.130
 take the pictures when the cranes do not 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.430
 stop 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.590
 when politicians steal us 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.849
 and when now in parliament is going to be 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.819
 a law that will regulate 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.739
 manifestations 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.599
 making those who manifest 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.450
 close to parliament 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.459
 go with sunglasses or 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.530
 balaclavas are identified as 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.930
 terrorists 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.020
 let's see if we stop being pigs and 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.270
 some memos 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.350
 we get going and we make this 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.350
 change substantially 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.720
 because in the background 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.450
 the programs that give us the means of 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.379
 Mass communication 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.379
 just a reflection 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.200
 of the society in which we live and the 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.200
 society in which we live 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.080
 we form it among all 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.750
 I hope this post will serve to 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:51.020
 reflect on all this 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:55.870
 and you get going 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.870
 to change the established 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.500
 Because it is not 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.500
 what we really deserve 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.359
 those of us who have a bit of objectivity 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.000
 and intelligence 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:19.570
 7 smart and do not be one more of 

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:23.100
 those mediocre people who wander like 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.100
 zombies through our streets 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.250
 Y 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.190
 two
