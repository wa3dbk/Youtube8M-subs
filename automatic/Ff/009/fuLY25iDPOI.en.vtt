easier<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:01.890> my<00:01:02.160> layers<00:01:03.379> looks<00:01:04.379> pretty

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
easier to see all my layers looks pretty

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.260 
easier to see all my layers looks pretty
good<00:01:05.900> if<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.650> need<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.250> could<00:01:08.729> change<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
good if I need to I could change the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.870 
good if I need to I could change the
timeline<00:01:09.689> frame<00:01:10.200> rate<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.650> assign<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> true

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
video frame rate and if necessary I

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.690

could choose the panel options to make

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
could choose the panel options to make
it<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.939> bit<00:01:18.090> easier<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:19.140> all<00:01:19.470> my<00:01:19.500> thumbnails

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
it a bit easier to see all my thumbnails

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.749 
it a bit easier to see all my thumbnails
alright<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.960> looks<00:01:21.990> pretty<00:01:22.259> good<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.710> left<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
and press ctrl or command e makes it a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.580 
and press ctrl or command e makes it a
bit<00:01:34.110> simpler<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.180> I<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.840> what

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
bit simpler and I like that and what

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.109 
bit simpler and I like that and what
we're<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.310> make<00:01:38.490> each<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:39.000> these

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
we're going to do is make each of these

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.960 
we're going to do is make each of these
a<00:01:39.390> smart<00:01:39.869> object<00:01:40.049> by<00:01:41.040> right<00:01:41.369> clicking<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
a smart object by right clicking and

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.469 
a smart object by right clicking and
converting<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.930> smart<00:01:43.259> objects<00:01:44.270> what<00:01:45.270> this

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
converting to smart objects what this

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.080 
converting to smart objects what this
does<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.890> will<00:01:47.040> embed<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> full<00:01:47.850> resolution

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
does is it will embed a full resolution

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.740 
does is it will embed a full resolution
copy<00:01:48.840> inside<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.920> layer<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:51.299> opens<00:01:51.630> up

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
copy inside the layer and it opens up

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.499 
copy inside the layer and it opens up
the<00:01:51.930> ability<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.470> use<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.520> transform<00:01:54.090> command

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
the ability to use the transform command

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.609 
the ability to use the transform command
with<00:01:54.840> keyframes<00:01:55.460> there<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.549> go

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
with keyframes there we go

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.289 
with keyframes there we go
twirling<00:01:58.619> each<00:01:58.829> one<00:01:59.130> down<00:01:59.399> we<00:01:59.790> can<00:01:59.939> start<00:02:00.210> to

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
twirling each one down we can start to

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.539 
twirling each one down we can start to
animate

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
animate

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.380 
animate
let's<00:02:02.549> take<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.880> word<00:02:03.030> raster<00:02:03.869> first

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.260 

I'll<00:02:07.780> come<00:02:08.140> to<00:02:08.290> the<00:02:08.320> three-second<00:02:09.040> mark<00:02:12.270> twirl

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
I'll come to the three-second mark twirl

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.530 
I'll come to the three-second mark twirl
it<00:02:13.450> down<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:14.040> you'll<00:02:15.040> see<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.670> keyframe<00:02:16.270> for

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
it down and you'll see the keyframe for

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.440 
it down and you'll see the keyframe for
transform<00:02:17.050> I'll<00:02:17.400> turn<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.520> on<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.880> enable<00:02:19.360> a

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
transform I'll turn that on to enable a

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.300 
transform I'll turn that on to enable a

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.900 
and move pressing return you'll see that
the<00:02:39.550> object<00:02:39.970> lands<00:02:40.300> into<00:02:40.540> place<00:02:41.880> now<00:02:42.880> that

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
the object lands into place now that

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.840 
the object lands into place now that
worked<00:02:43.330> nicely<00:02:43.420> for<00:02:43.960> a<00:02:43.990> simple<00:02:44.410> animation

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
worked nicely for a simple animation

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.270 
worked nicely for a simple animation
let's<00:02:45.850> keep<00:02:46.030> going<00:02:46.420> with<00:02:46.450> another<00:02:46.720> layer<00:02:47.280> well

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
let's keep going with another layer well

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.640 
let's keep going with another layer well
grab<00:02:48.459> vector<00:02:48.940> here<00:02:49.180> turn<00:02:50.110> on<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.380> stopwatch

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
grab vector here turn on the stopwatch

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.880 
grab vector here turn on the stopwatch
and<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:52.240> visibility<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:55.530> we'll<00:02:56.530> jump<00:02:56.830> back

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
and the visibility and we'll jump back

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.550 
and the visibility and we'll jump back
to<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:58.390> same<00:02:58.690> starting<00:02:59.050> point<00:03:00.360> ctrl<00:03:01.360> T<00:03:01.600> there

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
to the same starting point ctrl T there

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.640 
to the same starting point ctrl T there
it<00:03:02.680> is<00:03:02.830> if<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:04.600> want<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:04.930> adjust<00:03:05.020> where<00:03:05.530> it

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
it is if I want to adjust where it

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.430 
it is if I want to adjust where it
rotates<00:03:06.100> around<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.670> could<00:03:07.090> drag<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.630> rotation

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
rotates around I could drag the rotation

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.840 
rotates around I could drag the rotation
point<00:03:08.620> there<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:10.170> what<00:03:11.170> I'll<00:03:11.290> do<00:03:11.530> is<00:03:11.860> rotate

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
point there and what I'll do is rotate

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:23.559 
point there and what I'll do is rotate
this<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:16.080> pull<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.200> off<00:03:17.320> screen

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.130 

and<00:03:24.569> they<00:03:24.690> both<00:03:24.840> land<00:03:25.260> at<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.530> same<00:03:25.560> time

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
and they both land at the same time

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.820 
and they both land at the same time
that's<00:03:28.140> looking<00:03:28.409> pretty<00:03:28.440> good

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
that's looking pretty good

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.420 
that's looking pretty good
I'll<00:03:29.040> just<00:03:29.340> scale<00:03:29.640> this<00:03:29.819> first<00:03:30.060> one<00:03:30.299> up<00:03:34.430> and

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
I'll just scale this first one up and

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.900 
I'll just scale this first one up and
pull<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.360> off<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.569> bit<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:40.280> they<00:03:41.280> tumble<00:03:41.700> into

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
pull that off a bit and they tumble into

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.869 
pull that off a bit and they tumble into
place<00:03:43.010> now<00:03:44.010> if<00:03:44.160> you<00:03:44.280> want<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.549> change<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
place now if you want to change the

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.940 
place now if you want to change the
stacking<00:03:45.120> order<00:03:45.599> just<00:03:46.110> adjust<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.680> heights

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
stacking order just adjust the heights

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.550 
stacking order just adjust the heights
in<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.519> layers<00:03:47.700> panel<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.299> you'll<00:03:49.079> see<00:03:49.349> that

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
in the layers panel and you'll see that

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.930 
in the layers panel and you'll see that
one<00:03:49.890> will<00:03:50.129> sit<00:03:50.430> on<00:03:50.459> top<00:03:50.579> of<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.120> other<00:03:51.269> now<00:03:52.940> all

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
one will sit on top of the other now all

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.259 
one will sit on top of the other now all
right

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
right

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.050 
right
that's<00:03:54.540> looking<00:03:54.870> nice<00:03:55.610> right<00:03:56.610> about<00:03:56.819> in<00:03:56.970> the

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
that's looking nice right about in the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.780 
that's looking nice right about in the
middle<00:03:57.709> I'm<00:03:58.709> going<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.040> bring<00:03:59.250> on<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.610> other

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
middle I'm going to bring on the other

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.140 
middle I'm going to bring on the other
two<00:04:00.209> boxes<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:02.010> there's<00:04:02.160> my<00:04:02.340> red<00:04:02.579> square<00:04:02.940> and

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
two boxes so there's my red square and

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.240 
two boxes so there's my red square and
my<00:04:03.629> black<00:04:03.900> square<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.470> I'll<00:04:04.739> just<00:04:04.890> use<00:04:05.010> the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
my black square and I'll just use the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.750 
my black square and I'll just use the
opacity<00:04:05.579> controls<00:04:06.299> here<00:04:06.569> and<00:04:07.489> we'll<00:04:08.489> set

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
opacity controls here and we'll set

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:18.229 
opacity controls here and we'll set
those<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.450> zero<00:04:14.269> and<00:04:16.519> then<00:04:17.519> go<00:04:17.850> a<00:04:17.880> little<00:04:18.090> bit

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
those to zero and then go a little bit

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.270 
those to zero and then go a little bit
forward<00:04:18.829> to<00:04:19.829> about<00:04:20.010> 310<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:21.979> take<00:04:22.979> them<00:04:23.130> back

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
forward to about 310 and take them back

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:30.860 
forward to about 310 and take them back
up<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.520> 100

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.590 

so<00:04:31.500> if<00:04:31.680> we<00:04:31.830> play<00:04:32.010> that<00:04:32.220> back<00:04:32.460> you'll<00:04:33.389> notice

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
so if we play that back you'll notice

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.260 
so if we play that back you'll notice
that<00:04:33.960> they<00:04:34.139> animate<00:04:34.830> by<00:04:35.100> fading<00:04:35.580> into<00:04:35.910> place

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
that they animate by fading into place

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.350 
that they animate by fading into place
as<00:04:37.580> things<00:04:38.580> go<00:04:38.790> past<00:04:40.370> remember<00:04:41.370> if<00:04:41.550> you'd<00:04:42.150> like

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
as things go past remember if you'd like

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.400 
as things go past remember if you'd like
you<00:04:42.750> can<00:04:42.960> uncheck<00:04:43.590> linear<00:04:44.070> interpolation<00:04:44.940> and

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
you can uncheck linear interpolation and

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.870 
you can uncheck linear interpolation and
it<00:04:46.410> will<00:04:46.530> have<00:04:46.650> a<00:04:46.680> little<00:04:46.979> bit<00:04:47.070> more<00:04:47.250> smoothing

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
it will have a little bit more smoothing

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.969 
it will have a little bit more smoothing
into<00:04:48.150> place

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
into place

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.990 
into place
alright<00:04:49.979> that's<00:04:50.160> looking<00:04:50.280> pretty<00:04:50.460> good<00:04:50.669> let's

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
alright that's looking pretty good let's

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.080 
alright that's looking pretty good let's
just<00:04:51.210> round<00:04:51.449> that<00:04:51.690> out<00:04:52.400> we've<00:04:53.400> got<00:04:53.430> our<00:04:53.669> line

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
just round that out we've got our line

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.140 
just round that out we've got our line
and<00:04:55.400> I<00:04:56.400> want<00:04:56.669> that<00:04:56.850> to<00:04:57.060> build<00:04:58.790> right<00:04:59.790> as<00:04:59.970> those

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
and I want that to build right as those

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.950 
and I want that to build right as those
come<00:05:00.419> in<00:05:01.340> so<00:05:02.340> we'll<00:05:02.520> do<00:05:02.639> transformation<00:05:05.960> there

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
come in so we'll do transformation there

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.260 
come in so we'll do transformation there
we<00:05:07.110> go<00:05:07.229> and<00:05:08.810> coming<00:05:09.810> to<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:09.990> top<00:05:10.260> here<00:05:11.270> we'll

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
we go and coming to the top here we'll

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.250 
we go and coming to the top here we'll
simply<00:05:12.660> press<00:05:12.930> ctrl<00:05:13.470> T<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:14.540> we'll<00:05:15.540> uncheck

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
simply press ctrl T and we'll uncheck

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.600 
simply press ctrl T and we'll uncheck
the<00:05:16.500> width<00:05:16.740> up<00:05:16.950> here<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.400> set<00:05:18.330> that<00:05:18.510> to<00:05:18.660> zero

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
the width up here and set that to zero

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.670 
the width up here and set that to zero
what<00:05:20.610> that<00:05:20.790> will<00:05:20.970> do<00:05:21.180> is<00:05:21.210> scale<00:05:22.110> it<00:05:22.320> from<00:05:22.560> the

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
what that will do is scale it from the

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.140 
what that will do is scale it from the
middle<00:05:24.710> now<00:05:25.710> what's<00:05:25.950> important<00:05:26.550> is<00:05:26.729> you<00:05:26.940> want

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
middle now what's important is you want

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.840 
middle now what's important is you want
to<00:05:27.270> check<00:05:27.510> your<00:05:27.570> keyframes<00:05:28.229> making<00:05:28.740> sure<00:05:29.010> that

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
to check your keyframes making sure that

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.170 
to check your keyframes making sure that
as<00:05:30.060> you<00:05:30.240> select<00:05:30.630> them<00:05:31.699> that<00:05:32.699> looks<00:05:33.030> pretty

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
as you select them that looks pretty

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.430 
as you select them that looks pretty
good<00:05:33.500> there's<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:34.740> first<00:05:34.889> one<00:05:36.260> make<00:05:37.260> sure

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
good there's the first one make sure

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.120 
good there's the first one make sure
it's<00:05:37.560> selected<00:05:37.770> ctrl<00:05:38.639> T<00:05:38.910> and<00:05:39.770> I'm<00:05:40.770> going<00:05:41.100> to
