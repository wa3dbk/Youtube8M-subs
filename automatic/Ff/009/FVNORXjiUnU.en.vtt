00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.879
 Welcome to the superior germany's 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.390
 next topmodel and konrad I'm finally 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.490
 right in it 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.860
 So I have to ask the thought of the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.940
 It's not such a great casting phase 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.710
 but i like it totally and 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.300
 therefore different reasons before for 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.400
 I like the details of one 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.539
 people are arguing 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.550
 bitch war is always dÃ¶rfel 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.350
 really made that big announced all the way 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.480
 erika and co yes i want to be here a lot 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.189
 good shootings and there is uncertain pep 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.380
 there no scene is too long 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.640
 that has a good blue yes I do 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.579
 be that helicopter studies already 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.160
 Even the whole thing is good 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.540
 we start at the beginning so there was yes 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.300
 immediately after the fight again 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.710
 decision because there you have to last 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.370
 week all candidates go the name me 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.899
 no longer knows 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.910
 and then the erika got over it 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.739
 excited because he laura the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.270
 progressed is allegedly at all 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.329
 that she actually no longer 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.190
 participate 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.690
 I mean, that's normal for everyone 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.129
 sometimes have situation in ours 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.660
 even bear to say it any 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.160
 no longer bother learning pixel and that 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.180
 It's normal for me to say that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.549
 simply you should not overestimate 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.780
 or say ten times a day as well 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.520
 even as already said it will be no 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.110
 youtube videos there are people mosel 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.299
 sometime the team celebration 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.409
 exhibit or on the way the other 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.210
 course also shown again 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.860
 but how the asocial the erika one 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.840
 little assiut and handling so she finds 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.320
 really think if properly what 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.850
 I really as I realize you are real 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.860
 that they really eat poorly educated 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.520
 also from a against I think where comes 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.759
 thus etiquette and communication 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.579
 articulation has not so well so 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.770
 very natural and like other stereotypes 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.500
 possible a turn or I will 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.240
 That's how the skin looked like for over 30 years 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.320
 text man to the office could actually 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.110
 to have arisen exactly 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.579
 but perhaps very briefly only so 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.710
 in short, the girls will be under 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.590
 a lot of stress on the way we have short 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.060
 had talked about that 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.280
 a neat program just as well 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.159
 here are these three exciters called dubai 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.079
 fly 19 speaks and records like us 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.119
 are twelve hours business class 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.050
 flown and that was a long time ago 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.800
 already talked about the possibility 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.360
 from three fly 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.549
 on the only one said they are 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.170
 of course, all these 17 18 these 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.750
 Field beans from school earlier 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.459
 to get up and say for hours 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.049
 to sit still and not flare 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.510
 So I would not do it now 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.920
 longer stand must be shut down so long 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.160
 without constantly looking around the phone 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.049
 go out snacks drinks maybe 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.510
 she does not need to know what to hold 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.920
 So everything makes phone calls for that 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.470
 I found helicopter shooting quite cool 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.360
 because it was a mixture of the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.069
 shooting of season 3 and six 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.140
 not in the desert but this season 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.579
 3 at that time that was it by the way 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.890
 I think I remember correctly also 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.150
 kristian schuller made it there 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.620
 was the one he still left both there 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.480
 which made such a shooting before that 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.610
 want to get medicopter or get in 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.560
 background stands and then into the season 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.209
 even when the rebecca was more up and running 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.470
 Did you say the video in the desert 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.780
 made where the eyes with 53 abandoned 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.790
 have orders picked up more correctly 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.889
 Some have had some 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.670
 some of the helicopters are not among the 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.220
 first three 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.290
 But it had to be believed by some 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.599
 I always think that 's the pose 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.370
 also medicopter was not as great as 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.639
 maybe the one on the floor 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.840
 but done well because a bit 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.690
 action can kristian the schuller 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.819
 and really really great photos makes so 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.340
 her son is the bomb school integration 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.980
 shown a little bit 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.139
 I think a jury had to or clearly 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.450
 I get to know more of the photographers 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:41.389
 I feel that manager extremely little 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.370
 of him with flying colors so I know that the 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.669
 System problems leave the shoulder 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.940
 watch 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:49.160
 The film also produces less 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.100
 exactly is known not rum 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.560
 or something 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.740
 or it is not shown the choice 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.930
 her name was dieter 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.000
 jumped in is the fallen thought 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.530
 me and ouch and it's really then 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.660
 still a guest in the plane and in 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.940
 dubai and i read the job i got 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.240
 and yes it can be a real eye 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.380
 otherwise already jumps have to curtsy 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.240
 other neat the axis 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.820
 Broken 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.590
 I do not understand on the other side 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.540
 it's all about the model 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.209
 traffic jam is run into 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.650
 I never gave it to healer healed 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.750
 I would not try to run 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.980
 I imagine it is a bit 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.890
 I'm difficult to train 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.480
 honestly i would i would go there 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.720
 If I would join in, I would 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.480
 He can be perfect on 1 run 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.150
 she still has a big foot job 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.220
 The sarah does not have that in Dubai 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.080
 Iran fits quite well what I had 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:48.180
 a bit funny it was not quite 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:51.690
 funny in the market, however, the hardness of 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.390
 from hama has rested the sarah is 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.570
 gone and yes but I like the the 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.760
 Ware then also and is 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.470
 I have to say that I have to go on 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.060
 but what follow me these extreme 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.670
 shocked was the rausschmiss of 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.530
 Giovanna because I am very fond of myself 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.880
 find that she is not one of the strongest 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.890
 Candidates are called that one must already 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.990
 fair enough , they do not say but me 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.290
 think she was from abroad now that 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.200
 is still the cost for me one 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:22.640
 better candidates than erika but he 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.720
 you can make it more likely 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.250
 but america does manage that in it 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.810
 I was very shocked because it was there 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.590
 I thought that the really vivantes 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.530
 I am very sad 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.260
 lena comes out as comprehensible 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.050
 I found toxic active in extremely 100 it 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.730
 Dusseldorf was the near the beautiful 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.230
 I did not like the face at all 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.390
 and not at the end the reasons 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:46.470
 kicked out that I found even so 08 15 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:48.060
 so that was legitimate though 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.460
 So overall, it was a pretty good one 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.900
 follow and people ready 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.330
 I think that's good 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.750
 was neat are neat minds 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.490
 rolled 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.919
 next week it goes on and on 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.180
 erika made everyone right because of that 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.889
 was not even curious how the after 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.080
 stay inside and write us yours 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.240
 comments that you liked please 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.530
 every quote and comment and 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.300
 write something about her 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:15.389
 rauswurf of giovanna thinks and does it 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.389
 Well
