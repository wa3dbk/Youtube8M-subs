completely done yet but we have for LAN
parties<00:00:19.920> we<00:00:20.460> have<00:00:20.610> lighting<00:00:20.910> effects<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.540 
parties we have lighting effects for the

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.370 
parties we have lighting effects for the
top<00:00:21.960> part<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.380> also<00:00:22.740> for<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:24.080> front<00:00:25.080> part

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
top part and also for the front part

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.700 
top part and also for the front part
okay<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.810> the<00:00:27.810> effect<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.200> will<00:00:28.380> have<00:00:28.440> on

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
okay and the effect that will have on

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.490 
okay and the effect that will have on
this<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.369> we're<00:00:29.610> going<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.850> have<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.720> breathing

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
this is we're going to have a breathing

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.240 
this is we're going to have a breathing
rapid<00:00:32.279> fire<00:00:32.489> mode<00:00:32.699> which<00:00:33.150> is<00:00:33.330> when<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.629> click

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
rapid fire mode which is when you click

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.590 
rapid fire mode which is when you click
and<00:00:35.250> play<00:00:35.520> games<00:00:35.760> you'll<00:00:36.150> shoot<00:00:36.390> out<00:00:36.570> like

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
and play games you'll shoot out like

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.250 
and play games you'll shoot out like
beads<00:00:37.050> okay<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.090> change<00:00:39.449> up<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.870> seven

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
beads okay you can change up to seven

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.950 
beads okay you can change up to seven
colors<00:00:40.850> currently<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.030> only<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.659> five

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
colors currently we only have five

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.719 
colors currently we only have five
because<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.769> we're<00:00:44.010> still<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.280> development

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:44.729 
because it's we're still in development

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:49.329 
because it's we're still in development
phase<00:00:44.909> so<00:00:45.720> you<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.989> see<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.290> trans<00:00:46.949> blue

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.900 

green<00:00:51.500> purple

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.410 

Turkish<00:00:55.840> and<00:00:56.550> there<00:00:57.550> will<00:00:57.670> be<00:00:57.790> other<00:00:57.940> other

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
Turkish and there will be other other

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.180 
Turkish and there will be other other
colors<00:00:58.870> as<00:00:59.020> well<00:00:59.050> later<00:00:59.410> on<00:00:59.710> ok<00:01:01.080> 44<00:01:02.080> for<00:01:03.070> the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
colors as well later on ok 44 for the

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.430 
colors as well later on ok 44 for the
display<00:01:03.610> for<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.180> DPI<00:01:04.750> display<00:01:05.080> we<00:01:05.229> have<00:01:05.410> 0

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
display for the DPI display we have 0

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.580 
display for the DPI display we have 0
lead<00:01:05.920> okay<00:01:06.460> and<00:01:06.880> basically<00:01:07.750> we<00:01:08.140> can<00:01:08.260> adjust

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
lead okay and basically we can adjust

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.359 
lead okay and basically we can adjust
X&amp;Y<00:01:09.310> independently<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:11.010> I'll<00:01:12.010> just<00:01:12.190> do<00:01:12.340> a

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
X&amp;Y independently and I'll just do a

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.250 
X&amp;Y independently and I'll just do a
sample<00:01:12.670> right<00:01:13.090> here<00:01:13.360> it<00:01:14.140> smells<00:01:14.440> 5,000<00:01:15.130> DPI<00:01:16.260> of

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
sample right here it smells 5,000 DPI of

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.050 
sample right here it smells 5,000 DPI of
course<00:01:17.560> they'll<00:01:17.740> be<00:01:17.770> coupled<00:01:18.340> with<00:01:18.460> what<00:01:19.030> I

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
course they'll be coupled with what I

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.480 
course they'll be coupled with what I
believe<00:01:19.420> like<00:01:19.780> strong<00:01:20.110> firmware<00:01:20.560> which<00:01:20.979> was

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
believe like strong firmware which was

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.620 
believe like strong firmware which was
your<00:01:21.640> land<00:01:21.940> at<00:01:22.810> computex<00:01:23.380> mm-hmm<00:01:24.040> okay<00:01:24.540> at<00:01:25.540> the

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
your land at computex mm-hmm okay at the

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.740 
your land at computex mm-hmm okay at the
bottom<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.590> see<00:01:26.890> that<00:01:27.130> we<00:01:27.340> have<00:01:27.369> way<00:01:28.330> systems

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
bottom to see that we have way systems

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:37.950 
bottom to see that we have way systems
there<00:01:29.649> 4.5<00:01:30.399> grams<00:01:30.610> each<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:36.270> our<00:01:37.270> sensors<00:01:37.750> is

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
there 4.5 grams each and our sensors is

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.590 
there 4.5 grams each and our sensors is
using<00:01:38.680> deployed<00:01:39.220> effects<00:01:39.520> sensors<00:01:39.970> twin

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
using deployed effects sensors twin

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.040 
using deployed effects sensors twin
laser<00:01:41.320> sensor<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:43.570> moves<00:01:43.810> us<00:01:43.960> into<00:01:43.990> thinking

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
laser sensor we moves us into thinking

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.440 
laser sensor we moves us into thinking
this<00:01:47.050> area<00:01:47.410> here<00:01:47.649> will<00:01:47.830> be<00:01:47.979> fully<00:01:48.550> it's<00:01:49.210> not

this area here will be fully it's not

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.749 
this area here will be fully it's not
complete<00:01:49.810> yet<00:01:50.020> but<00:01:50.259> will<00:01:50.380> be<00:01:50.500> fully<00:01:50.830> in<00:01:51.130> rubber

Kelvin<00:01:52.410> can<00:01:53.410> we<00:01:53.590> have<00:01:53.710> eight<00:01:53.890> buttons<00:01:54.160> all

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
Kelvin can we have eight buttons all

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.230 
Kelvin can we have eight buttons all

right-handed<00:02:11.200> users<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:13.740> one<00:02:14.740> other<00:02:14.920> feature

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
right-handed users and one other feature

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.559 
right-handed users and one other feature
is<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:17.020> see<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.260> storm<00:02:17.500> logo<00:02:17.830> here<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:19.300> can<00:02:19.480> be

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
is you see the storm logo here it can be

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.780 
is you see the storm logo here it can be
changed<00:02:19.930> through<00:02:19.959> software<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:21.040> gaming<00:02:21.520> teams

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
changed through software so gaming teams

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.260 
changed through software so gaming teams
can<00:02:22.120> tag<00:02:22.360> their<00:02:22.569> own<00:02:22.720> logos<00:02:23.970> for<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.090> most

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
can tag their own logos for this most

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.010 
can tag their own logos for this most
and<00:02:25.590> that's<00:02:26.590> pretty<00:02:26.800> much<00:02:26.920> it
