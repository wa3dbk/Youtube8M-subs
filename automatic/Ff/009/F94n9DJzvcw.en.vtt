00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.050
 in meanwhile fifth part of our 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.730
 quicktipp series we deal with 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.530
 This time, the question becomes how you look 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.890
 actually defend against tv rockets 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.540
 can 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.670
 the simplest solutions are here 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.110
 of course, first of all, look for cover so that 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.689
 the tip before Sagittarius no line of sight 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.670
 has more out of goal or secondly project 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.200
 tanks use a strike cash 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.129
 and then later the armor again 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.960
 fix it 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.060
 the solution we want to show here 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.920
 is a bit more difficult but clear 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.450
 nice man no tv okay there namely 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.250
 Just shoot that is special 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.079
 good with the mobile air defense 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.329
 all you need is one 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.190
 network rescue factor of the possible 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.960
 Another parked is that he goes 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.090
 in principle for the application of tva 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.130
 Kathe and if possible on zoom 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.649
 optics because the tv is a relative 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.760
 small goal what you have to meet here 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.840
 this method works very well 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.670
 if you have a gedi to maximum 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.200
 must make reach he can 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.970
 namely the tv rocket no longer in 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.830
 but a bow must fly in 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.260
 a straight line to fly the power 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.210
 it's particularly easy the tvg actually 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.470
 How to apply in the background right now 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.990
 It has also been seen several times 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.000
 not necessary the tv chain several 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.590
 seconds to keep it in the reticule 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.299
 is actually enough if you have one or 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.729
 Two hip brand on the terrorist act 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.860
 then what gets the next one 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.810
 problem complex cuts because the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.700
 hit registration on the tv rockets 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.100
 is anything but optimal 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.830
 sometimes you can see how the balls 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.200
 on the rocket strike despite this 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.360
 for a no hit brand returns tv 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.280
 box is also available when intercepting 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.409
 In the background you can still see them 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.970
 how to draw around a rocket 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.009
 in an arc flies to a 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.479
 Do not forget to catch the tv goes 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.159
 is relatively fast accordingly 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.280
 far one must hold on to actually 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.600
 to land a hit 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.979
 many thanks for being if you like 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.030
 then looks at the other 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.040
 quicktipps to whom we so far 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.170
 have published or you look at 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.170
 The city assembly of Pidgin over
