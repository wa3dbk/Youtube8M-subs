00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
and that's it so that always works for

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.960 
and that's it so that always works for
me<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.140> comes<00:01:13.890> with<00:01:14.010> these<00:01:14.159> little<00:01:14.700> brushes

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
me and comes with these little brushes

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.969 
me and comes with these little brushes
which<00:01:15.390> are<00:01:15.689> horrible<00:01:16.170> for<00:01:16.380> actually<00:01:16.710> applying

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
which are horrible for actually applying

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.440 
which are horrible for actually applying
your<00:01:17.159> makeup<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:17.640> these<00:01:17.820> are<00:01:17.970> really<00:01:18.210> good

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
your makeup but these are really good

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.870 
your makeup but these are really good
for<00:01:18.750> contouring<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.070> tend<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> keep<00:01:20.610> these

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
for contouring so I tend to keep these

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.789 
for contouring so I tend to keep these
around<00:01:21.210> just<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.049> contour<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.560> know<00:01:22.650> your

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
cheekbones or anything like that so I

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.630 
cheekbones or anything like that so I
actually<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.439> use<00:01:25.740> these<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.189> they<00:01:26.310> really
