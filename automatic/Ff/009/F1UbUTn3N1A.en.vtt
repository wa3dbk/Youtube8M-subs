00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 Speak up today and I'll show you. 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.440
 a project I did of a softer 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.139
 cardboard 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.929
 it is very simple and very easy to 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.900
 do with things you find in the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.070
 your house and I'm going to tell you what it is 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.699
 need to take the measurements and then I 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.199
 I'll show you a simulation I did one 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:33.750
 good first you need a pipe 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.460
 paper is a plain paper plug with 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.450
 barbecue stick 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:43.079
 this plugin you can use is durepox 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.160
 to make him and the barbecue stick 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:52.140
 You will put it small and it will fit 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:55.829
 it's not in that thing to crack porks well 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.030
 He's the trigger too. 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:04.369
 I recommend doing durepox and with a hole 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:10.650
 in the middle you should do more or less 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:15.590
 How are you there in the office alloy image? 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:20.520
 and you will tie in the water trade and 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.100
 magnifying glass at the end of the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.920
 barbecue 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:33.140
 now it's up to me to show her measurements 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.140
 you there the first measures 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.000
 then these 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:58.220
 There it is now I'll show the simulation 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.340
 to you so that you try to understand 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:06.409
 A little more confusion will not 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:10.099
 system and soon I'll be posting the 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:15.580
 video I making the gun to give it to 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.580
 you better understand in practice
