means<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> good<00:00:42.030> battery<00:00:42.239> here<00:00:45.440> we

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
means we have a good battery here we

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.619 
means we have a good battery here we
also<00:00:46.620> have<00:00:46.920> another<00:00:47.160> tester<00:00:47.670> which<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.420> an

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
also have another tester which is an

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.930 
also have another tester which is an
older-style<00:00:48.930> analog<00:00:49.770> tester<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.520> actually

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
older-style analog tester that actually

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.880 
older-style analog tester that actually
will<00:00:51.090> put<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> load<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.020> battery<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.739> would

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
will put a load on the battery it would

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.939 
will put a load on the battery it would
be<00:00:53.039> more<00:00:53.570> real<00:00:54.570> life<00:00:54.870> as<00:00:55.079> far<00:00:55.260> as<00:00:55.410> starting<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
be more real life as far as starting the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.799 
be more real life as far as starting the
car<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.610> load<00:00:56.850> that's<00:00:57.059> put<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> battery

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
car the load that's put on the battery

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:08.020 
car the load that's put on the battery
when<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.199> happens<00:01:04.489> positive<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.810> negative

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
when that happens positive and negative

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.820 
when that happens positive and negative
now<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.390> an<00:01:09.570> inductive<00:01:10.080> probe<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.680> will

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
now this is an inductive probe that will

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.800 
now this is an inductive probe that will
actually<00:01:11.250> tell<00:01:11.520> us<00:01:11.700> how<00:01:11.909> much<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.330> load<00:01:12.600> we

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
actually tell us how much of a load we

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.050 
actually tell us how much of a load we
are<00:01:12.869> putting<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.350> car<00:01:13.680> battery<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.909> that

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
are putting on the car battery so that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:36.440 
are putting on the car battery so that
we<00:01:15.180> will<00:01:15.360> know<00:01:15.770> not<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.060> overextend<00:01:18.060> that

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.600 

and<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.380> see<00:01:37.590> our<00:01:37.619> battery<00:01:38.070> maintained

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
and as we can see our battery maintained

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.990 
and as we can see our battery maintained
a<00:01:38.640> nine<00:01:39.030> nine<00:01:39.810> volt<00:01:40.140> level<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.820> know

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
a nine nine volt level so that we know

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.139 
a nine nine volt level so that we know
that<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.270> battery<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:42.960> good<00:01:43.110> shape<00:01:44.149> now

on for ten minutes so we're now we're
going<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.390> see<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.110> call<00:02:16.290> will<00:02:16.500> start<00:02:16.830> I

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
going to see that the call will start I

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.930 
going to see that the call will start I
pretty<00:02:19.620> much<00:02:19.830> tells<00:02:20.100> us<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.370> our<00:02:20.430> battery<00:02:20.850> is

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
pretty much tells us that our battery is

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.990 
pretty much tells us that our battery is
in<00:02:21.180> good<00:02:21.390> shape<00:02:21.660> now<00:02:22.430> it's<00:02:23.430> something<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.850> make

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
in good shape now it's something to make

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.120 
in good shape now it's something to make
sure<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.390> because<00:02:24.810> extreme<00:02:25.680> changes<00:02:26.069> in
