00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
the north american version of this phone

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.209 
the north american version of this phone
what<00:00:36.660> i<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.770> rogers<00:00:38.930> version<00:00:40.219> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
what i have is the rogers version the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:52.369 
what i have is the rogers version the
SGH<00:00:42.649> i747<00:00:43.649> em<00:00:45.200> just<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.350> show<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.710> guys<00:00:51.379> there

SGH i747 em just to show you guys there

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:02.450 
SGH i747 em just to show you guys there
it<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:56.329> so<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> problem<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.989> that<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.949> LED

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it is and so the problem is that the LED

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.429 
it is and so the problem is that the LED
lights<00:01:02.750> do<00:01:03.750> not<00:01:04.049> display<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.619> correct<00:01:05.129> color

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
lights do not display the correct color

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.690 
lights do not display the correct color
so<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.560> know<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.010> some<00:01:08.220> apps<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.670> can

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
so you know in some apps you can

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.410 
so you know in some apps you can
customize<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:10.280> what<00:01:11.280> color<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.820> want<00:01:11.850> your

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
customize on what color you want your

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.130 
customize on what color you want your
notification<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.170> be<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.710> say<00:01:14.689> texts<00:01:15.689> would<00:01:15.990> be

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
notification to be so say texts would be

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.850 
notification to be so say texts would be
green<00:01:16.439> called<00:01:17.040> would<00:01:17.400> be<00:01:17.580> blue<00:01:18.170> etc<00:01:19.170> etc<00:01:19.259> so

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
green called would be blue etc etc so

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.280 
green called would be blue etc etc so

problem so it's called there's a there's

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.120 
problem so it's called there's a there's
an<00:02:39.900> app<00:02:40.110> called<00:02:40.320> light<00:02:40.620> flow<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
there's a developer website I guess and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.220 
there's a developer website I guess and
in<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.350> known<00:02:46.560> issues<00:02:47.270> shows<00:02:48.270> you<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.660> the
