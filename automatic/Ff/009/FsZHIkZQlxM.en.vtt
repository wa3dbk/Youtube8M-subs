to<00:02:21.900> move<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.290> around<00:02:22.380> mr.<00:02:22.680> frog<00:02:23.180> but<00:02:24.180> as<00:02:24.840> you

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
to move you around mr. frog but as you

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.900 
to move you around mr. frog but as you
can<00:02:25.170> see<00:02:25.230> as<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:26.190> leaves<00:02:26.400> get<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.610> little<00:02:26.820> bit

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
can see as the leaves get a little bit

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.830 
can see as the leaves get a little bit
older<00:02:27.830> they<00:02:28.830> yell<00:02:29.100> oh<00:02:29.220> just<00:02:29.910> cut<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.300> off<00:02:30.510> cut

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
older they yell oh just cut this off cut

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.890 
older they yell oh just cut this off cut
it<00:02:30.870> off<00:02:31.020> right<00:02:31.500> at<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.710> base<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.450> follow<00:02:33.780> that

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
it off right at the base so follow that

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.200 
it off right at the base so follow that
all<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.290> way<00:02:34.440> down<00:02:34.680> right<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.850> bottom<00:02:36.180> of

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
all the way down right to the bottom of

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.970 
all the way down right to the bottom of
the<00:02:36.300> plant<00:02:36.540> each<00:02:37.410> one<00:02:37.770> of<00:02:37.860> these<00:02:38.240> these<00:02:39.980> stems

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
the plant each one of these these stems

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.000 
the plant each one of these these stems
is<00:02:41.370> basically<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.330> leaf<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:43.620> would<00:02:43.740> think<00:02:43.890> of

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
is basically a leaf you would think of

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.330 
is basically a leaf you would think of
it<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.250> more<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.700> like<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.880> palm<00:02:45.240> tree<00:02:45.500> with<00:02:46.500> a

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
it it more of like a palm tree with a

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.230 
it it more of like a palm tree with a
big<00:02:47.610> palm<00:02:47.850> frond<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:50.550> these<00:02:50.820> these

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
big palm frond and and these these

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.540 
big palm frond and and these these
little<00:02:51.480> leaves<00:02:51.840> are<00:02:52.170> just<00:02:52.560> like<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.280> the

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
little leaves are just like the the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.500 
little leaves are just like the the
leaves<00:02:53.760> on<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> palm<00:02:54.360> frond<00:02:54.770> so<00:02:55.970> if<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.330> were<00:02:57.420> to

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
leaves on a palm frond so if you were to

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.620 
leaves on a palm frond so if you were to
cut<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.780> back<00:02:57.900> here<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:59.880> could<00:03:00.030> do<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.390> it

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
cut it back here you could do that it

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
cut it back here you could do that it
would<00:03:00.750> just<00:03:00.840> look<00:03:00.930> silly<00:03:01.260> but<00:03:01.730> if<00:03:02.990> say<00:03:03.990> the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
would just look silly but if say the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.910 
would just look silly but if say the
leaves<00:03:04.860> up<00:03:05.100> top<00:03:05.340> turned<00:03:05.940> turned<00:03:06.690> yellow<00:03:06.930> up<00:03:07.260> to

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
leaves up top turned turned yellow up to

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.160 
leaves up top turned turned yellow up to
this<00:03:08.040> point<00:03:08.280> if<00:03:08.550> your<00:03:09.060> plant<00:03:09.330> was<00:03:09.480> small<00:03:09.720> you

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
this point if your plant was small you

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.970 
this point if your plant was small you
could<00:03:10.620> cut<00:03:10.740> it<00:03:10.830> off<00:03:10.920> here<00:03:11.220> no<00:03:11.400> problem<00:03:12.980> these

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
could cut it off here no problem these

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.680 
could cut it off here no problem these
these<00:03:14.310> are<00:03:14.490> very<00:03:14.640> interesting<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:15.120> propagate

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
these are very interesting to propagate

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.560 
these are very interesting to propagate
I<00:03:15.870> have<00:03:16.080> done<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:16.440> in<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.560> past<00:03:17.300> you'll<00:03:18.300> take

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
I have done it in the past you'll take

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.970 
I have done it in the past you'll take
one<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.840> these<00:03:18.930> leaves<00:03:19.200> off<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.800> just

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
one of these leaves off and just

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.830 
one of these leaves off and just
basically<00:03:20.340> put<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:20.640> in<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.790> soil<00:03:20.970> it's<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.630> long

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
basically put it in the soil it's a long

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.320 
basically put it in the soil it's a long
process<00:03:22.310> takes<00:03:23.310> about<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.550> year<00:03:23.940> before<00:03:24.120> you

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
process takes about a year before you

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.010 
process takes about a year before you
see<00:03:24.570> any<00:03:24.600> growth<00:03:24.990> but<00:03:25.850> it<00:03:26.850> happens<00:03:27.270> and<00:03:27.510> in<00:03:27.930> a

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
see any growth but it happens and in a

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.800 
see any growth but it happens and in a
future<00:03:28.320> video<00:03:28.440> I'll<00:03:29.390> follow<00:03:30.390> this<00:03:30.570> through

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
future video I'll follow this through

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.870 
future video I'll follow this through
with<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.020> guys<00:03:31.340> but<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.370> just<00:03:32.430> thought<00:03:32.730> I'd

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
with you guys but I just thought I'd

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.210 
with you guys but I just thought I'd
show<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.390> this<00:03:33.630> easy<00:03:33.870> plant<00:03:34.260> this<00:03:34.860> is<00:03:35.010> mine

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
show you this easy plant this is mine

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.690 
show you this easy plant this is mine
this<00:03:35.250> is<00:03:35.610> probably<00:03:36.590> three<00:03:37.590> years<00:03:37.860> old<00:03:38.130> now<00:03:38.430> I

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
this is probably three years old now I

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.420 
this is probably three years old now I
got<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:39.360> it<00:03:39.480> was<00:03:39.510> very<00:03:39.600> small<00:03:40.020> and<00:03:40.890> it's<00:03:41.100> it's

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
got it it was very small and it's it's

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.780 
got it it was very small and it's it's
been<00:03:41.700> reported<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.470> think<00:03:43.520> three<00:03:44.520> or<00:03:44.550> four

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
been reported I think three or four

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.790 
been reported I think three or four
times<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:46.020> three<00:03:46.440> years<00:03:46.709> so<00:03:47.780> for<00:03:48.800> typically

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
times in three years so for typically

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.920 
times in three years so for typically
slow<00:03:50.280> growing<00:03:50.580> plants<00:03:51.090> it's<00:03:51.270> it's<00:03:51.570> quite<00:03:51.900> a

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
slow growing plants it's it's quite a

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.280 
slow growing plants it's it's quite a
fast<00:03:52.290> growing<00:03:52.620> plant<00:03:52.950> because<00:03:53.420> if<00:03:54.420> if<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:55.080> slow

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
fast growing plant because if if a slow

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.960 
fast growing plant because if if a slow
growing<00:03:55.560> plant<00:03:55.800> needs<00:03:55.920> to<00:03:56.040> be<00:03:56.130> repotted<00:03:56.220> every

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
growing plant needs to be repotted every

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.610 
growing plant needs to be repotted every
year<00:03:57.240> then<00:03:57.450> I<00:03:57.750> don't<00:03:58.200> know<00:03:58.260> if<00:03:58.380> it<00:03:58.470> could<00:03:58.560> be

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
year then I don't know if it could be

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.430 
year then I don't know if it could be
considered<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:59.400> slow<00:03:59.640> growing<00:04:00.000> plant<00:04:00.300> and<00:04:00.570> I

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
considered a slow growing plant and I

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.740 
considered a slow growing plant and I
have<00:04:01.650> cut<00:04:01.920> out<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:02.130> lot<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.490> a<00:04:02.940> lot<00:04:03.209> of<00:04:03.330> growth<00:04:03.540> in

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
have cut out a lot of a lot of growth in

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.330 
have cut out a lot of a lot of growth in
here<00:04:03.930> but<00:04:04.110> but<00:04:04.620> as<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.860> can<00:04:04.950> see<00:04:05.010> there's

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
here but but as you can see there's

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.880 
here but but as you can see there's
still<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.580> lot<00:04:05.760> of<00:04:05.790> stems<00:04:06.380> what<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.410> have<00:04:07.680> noticed

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
still a lot of stems what I have noticed

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.160 
still a lot of stems what I have noticed
with<00:04:08.130> this<00:04:08.310> plant<00:04:08.610> is<00:04:08.790> though<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.390> it<00:04:09.930> does

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
with this plant is though it it does

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.910 
with this plant is though it it does
suffer<00:04:10.470> from<00:04:10.590> scale<00:04:11.360> insect<00:04:12.360> on<00:04:12.600> on<00:04:12.840> my<00:04:13.230> on<00:04:13.860> my

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
suffer from scale insect on on my on my

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.780 
suffer from scale insect on on my on my
end<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.610> don't<00:04:14.670> know<00:04:14.850> if<00:04:14.970> yours<00:04:15.209> will<00:04:16.760> but<00:04:17.760> just

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
end I don't know if yours will but just

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.479 
end I don't know if yours will but just
because<00:04:18.210> the<00:04:18.479> I<00:04:18.859> don't<00:04:19.859> know<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:19.950> leaves<00:04:20.280> are

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
because the I don't know the leaves are

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.690 
because the I don't know the leaves are
really<00:04:20.880> thick<00:04:21.270> and<00:04:21.419> fleshy<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.870> think<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.229> the

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
really thick and fleshy I think that the

bright indirect light location so it

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.230
