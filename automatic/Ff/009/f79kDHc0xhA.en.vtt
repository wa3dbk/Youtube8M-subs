below<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:43.120> I<00:00:44.120> actually<00:00:44.660> prefer<00:00:45.320> this<00:00:45.470> one<00:00:45.650> to

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
below and I actually prefer this one to

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.320 
below and I actually prefer this one to
the<00:00:45.890> Sephora<00:00:46.280> one<00:00:47.590> basically<00:00:48.910> because<00:00:49.910> it's<00:00:50.210> a

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
the Sephora one basically because it's a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.150 
the Sephora one basically because it's a
lot<00:00:50.510> longer<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.320> I<00:00:51.379> have<00:00:51.530> super<00:00:51.980> long<00:00:52.010> hair

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
lot longer and I have super long hair

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.820 
lot longer and I have super long hair
and<00:00:52.580> it's<00:00:52.699> also<00:00:52.879> a<00:00:53.000> lot<00:00:53.239> thicker<00:00:53.600> I<00:00:53.989> don't<00:00:54.739> know

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
and it's also a lot thicker I don't know

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.860 
and it's also a lot thicker I don't know
why<00:00:55.190> they<00:00:55.370> made<00:00:55.549> this<00:00:55.699> one<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.150> thin<00:00:56.479> but<00:00:56.720> now

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
why they made this one so thin but now

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.530 
why they made this one so thin but now
that<00:00:57.049> I<00:00:57.080> compare<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.620> two<00:00:57.909> this<00:00:58.909> one's<00:00:59.150> so

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
that I compare the two this one's so

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.259 
that I compare the two this one's so
much<00:00:59.690> thicker<00:00:59.930> so<00:01:00.379> I<00:01:00.620> know<00:01:01.610> this<00:01:01.970> one<00:01:02.120> just

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
much thicker so I know this one just

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.240 
much thicker so I know this one just
tends<00:01:02.540> to<00:01:02.720> look<00:01:02.870> better<00:01:03.110> and<00:01:03.260> it<00:01:03.500> also<00:01:03.650> stands

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
tends to look better and it also stands

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.280 
tends to look better and it also stands
out<00:01:04.489> more<00:01:04.729> so<00:01:05.030> I<00:01:05.059> use<00:01:05.299> this<00:01:05.420> one<00:01:05.659> more<00:01:05.900> often

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
out more so I use this one more often

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.190 
out more so I use this one more often
but<00:01:07.130> what<00:01:07.610> I<00:01:07.640> do<00:01:07.729> for<00:01:08.240> clip<00:01:08.510> in<00:01:08.659> extension

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200
