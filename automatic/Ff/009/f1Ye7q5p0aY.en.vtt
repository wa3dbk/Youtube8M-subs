I'm going to draw you a little picture

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.110 
I'm going to draw you a little picture
here<00:00:39.170> consider<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.440> one<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.460> these<00:00:41.700> chambers

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
here consider this one of these chambers

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.600 
here consider this one of these chambers
in<00:00:42.629> cross-section<00:00:44.960> inside<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.260> have

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
in cross-section inside we have

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.910 
in cross-section inside we have
insulation<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.480> insulation<00:00:48.989> fills

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
insulation and that insulation fills

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.580 
insulation and that insulation fills
that<00:00:50.280> chamber<00:00:52.910> completely<00:00:53.910> now<00:00:54.590> something

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
that chamber completely now something

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.990 
that chamber completely now something
that<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.770> exclusive<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.430> X<00:00:56.699> bed<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.710> this

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
that is exclusive to X bed is this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.500 
that is exclusive to X bed is this
technology<00:01:00.000> where<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.359> bond<00:01:02.030> that<00:01:03.030> insulation

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
technology where we bond that insulation

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.010 
technology where we bond that insulation
to<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.930> top<00:01:04.350> piece<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.519> mat<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.869> also

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
to the top piece of the mat and we also

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.820 
to the top piece of the mat and we also
bond<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.100> insulation<00:01:08.760> down<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.830> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
bond that insulation down here and the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.039 
bond that insulation down here and the
bottom<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.220> mat<00:01:11.540> now<00:01:12.540> that's<00:01:12.750> really

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
bottom of the mat now that's really

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.679 
bottom of the mat now that's really
important<00:01:13.680> because<00:01:13.909> you<00:01:14.909> want<00:01:15.270> this

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
important because you want this

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.740 
important because you want this
insulation<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.560> fill<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.040> entire<00:01:17.750> chamber

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
insulation to fill the entire chamber

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.100 
insulation to fill the entire chamber
that's<00:01:19.229> how<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.590> get<00:01:20.580> those<00:01:20.850> high<00:01:21.210> R<00:01:21.540> values

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
that's how you get those high R values

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.469 
that's how you get those high R values
that<00:01:22.320> X<00:01:22.530> bed<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.040> well<00:01:23.250> known<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.479> you've

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
that X bed is so well known for you've

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.570 
that X bed is so well known for you've
got<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.930> fill<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.290> chamber<00:01:25.619> completely<00:01:26.400> if

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
got to fill that chamber completely if

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.960 
got to fill that chamber completely if
you<00:01:26.970> don't<00:01:27.299> bond<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.049> top<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.530> bottom<00:01:29.250> you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
you don't bond it top and bottom you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.810 
you don't bond it top and bottom you
can't<00:01:30.360> pull<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.020> stuff<00:01:31.680> apart<00:01:32.100> pull<00:01:32.640> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
can't pull that stuff apart pull that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.030 
can't pull that stuff apart pull that
insulation<00:01:33.270> apart<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.990> fill<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.829> entire

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
insulation apart and fill the entire

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.300 
insulation apart and fill the entire
chamber<00:01:35.400> now<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:36.210> illustrate<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.130> we've<00:01:38.130> got

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
chamber now to illustrate that we've got

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.160 
chamber now to illustrate that we've got
a<00:01:38.340> piece<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.790> railroad<00:01:39.090> tie<00:01:41.329> to<00:01:42.329> simulate<00:01:42.659> what

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
a piece of railroad tie to simulate what

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.789 
a piece of railroad tie to simulate what
happens<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:44.399> insulation<00:01:45.240> when<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.470> been

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
happens to insulation when it's been

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.240 
happens to insulation when it's been
stored<00:01:47.130> when<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.700> been<00:01:47.990> compressed<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.890> does

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
stored when it's been compressed it does

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.020 
stored when it's been compressed it does
not<00:01:50.430> fill<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.180> chamber<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.560> when<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.670> have

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
not fill the chamber so when you have

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.080 
not fill the chamber so when you have
bonded<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.810> top<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.649> bottom<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.340> that

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
bonded the top and the bottom of that

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.050 
bonded the top and the bottom of that
insulation<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.290> inflate<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.310> mat<00:01:59.549> you

insulation and you inflate the mat you
fill<00:02:00.570> completely<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:02.310> chamber

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
fill completely that chamber

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.999 
fill completely that chamber
you<00:02:03.880> have<00:02:04.060> very<00:02:04.509> very<00:02:04.780> good<00:02:05.320> insulation<00:02:05.770> at

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
you have very very good insulation at

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.649 
you have very very good insulation at
that<00:02:06.159> point<00:02:06.460> so<00:02:06.880> that's<00:02:07.060> what's<00:02:07.240> going<00:02:07.540> on
