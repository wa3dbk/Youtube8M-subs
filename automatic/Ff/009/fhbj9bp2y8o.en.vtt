cause kind of hoping it would be dry by
now<00:02:05.319> but<00:02:05.619> that's<00:02:05.740> that's<00:02:05.979> not<00:02:06.219> you<00:02:06.459> know

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
now but that's that's not you know

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.219 
now but that's that's not you know
that's<00:02:06.729> not<00:02:06.969> happening<00:02:07.420> which<00:02:07.569> really<00:02:07.810> sucks

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
that's not happening which really sucks

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.499 
that's not happening which really sucks
on<00:02:08.530> top<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.130> I<00:02:09.280> also<00:02:09.550> have<00:02:10.150> to<00:02:10.300> go<00:02:10.390> ahead

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
on top of that I also have to go ahead

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.990 
on top of that I also have to go ahead
and

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
and

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.700 
and
another<00:02:11.390> layer<00:02:11.630> on<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.990> smoke<00:02:12.290> over<00:02:12.410> here<00:02:12.680> I

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
another layer on the smoke over here I

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.050 
another layer on the smoke over here I
put<00:02:12.800> down<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.250> blue<00:02:13.430> because<00:02:13.760> that's<00:02:13.910> the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
put down the blue because that's the

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.880 
put down the blue because that's the
color<00:02:14.300> coming<00:02:14.690> off<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.080> 3d<00:02:15.500> but<00:02:15.740> that

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
color coming off of the 3d but that

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.920 
color coming off of the 3d but that
color<00:02:16.130> kind<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.490> dissipates<00:02:17.030> as<00:02:17.210> the<00:02:17.600> smoke

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
color kind of dissipates as the smoke

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.170 
color kind of dissipates as the smoke
dissipates<00:02:18.440> right<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.070> as<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.550> smoke<00:02:19.850> goes

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
dissipates right so as the smoke goes

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.090 
dissipates right so as the smoke goes
into<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.540> distance<00:02:20.930> this<00:02:21.260> color<00:02:21.620> has<00:02:21.800> turned

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
into the distance this color has turned

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.400 
into the distance this color has turned
more<00:02:22.250> into<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.550> white<00:02:22.880> it's<00:02:23.120> about<00:02:23.300> 10:30<00:02:23.930> still

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
more into a white it's about 10:30 still

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.270 
more into a white it's about 10:30 still

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
exact just because a lot of this is

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.630 
exact just because a lot of this is
going<00:05:02.960> to<00:05:03.020> be<00:05:03.080> blurred<00:05:03.290> anyway<00:05:03.860> or<00:05:04.130> a<00:05:04.400> lot<00:05:04.580> of

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
going to be blurred anyway or a lot of

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.580 
going to be blurred anyway or a lot of
this<00:05:04.760> gonna<00:05:04.940> be<00:05:05.030> blended<00:05:05.390> rather<00:05:05.630> but<00:05:06.350> you've

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
this gonna be blended rather but you've

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.710 
this gonna be blended rather but you've
got<00:05:06.740> a<00:05:06.770> paint<00:05:07.100> going<00:05:07.580> towards<00:05:08.330> the<00:05:08.510> vanishing

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
got a paint going towards the vanishing

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.740 
got a paint going towards the vanishing
point<00:05:09.140> that's<00:05:09.260> gonna<00:05:09.350> add<00:05:09.650> some<00:05:10.370> depth<00:05:10.760> now

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
point that's gonna add some depth now

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.030 
point that's gonna add some depth now
the<00:05:11.810> reason<00:05:12.140> this<00:05:12.200> is<00:05:12.320> gonna<00:05:12.440> work<00:05:12.620> is<00:05:12.770> because

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
the reason this is gonna work is because

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.370 
the reason this is gonna work is because
when<00:05:13.220> you<00:05:13.280> look<00:05:13.460> at<00:05:13.730> one<00:05:14.360> shade<00:05:14.690> from<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:14.960> next

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
when you look at one shade from the next

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.900 
when you look at one shade from the next
you're<00:05:15.500> gonna<00:05:15.590> see<00:05:15.950> this<00:05:16.160> line<00:05:16.460> that<00:05:16.640> points

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
you're gonna see this line that points

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.310 
you're gonna see this line that points
towards<00:05:17.300> the<00:05:17.330> vanishing<00:05:17.570> point<00:05:17.990> and<00:05:18.110> that's

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
towards the vanishing point and that's

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.280 
towards the vanishing point and that's
gonna<00:05:18.500> convince<00:05:19.310> the<00:05:19.580> eye<00:05:19.610> that<00:05:20.060> this<00:05:20.420> formed

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
gonna convince the eye that this formed

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.760 
gonna convince the eye that this formed
this<00:05:21.440> shape<00:05:22.030> goes<00:05:23.030> in<00:05:23.300> that<00:05:23.540> direction<00:05:23.810> which

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
this shape goes in that direction which

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.260 
this shape goes in that direction which
is<00:05:24.890> gonna<00:05:25.010> give<00:05:25.220> it<00:05:25.250> the<00:05:25.550> illusion<00:05:25.880> that<00:05:26.150> it

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
is gonna give it the illusion that it

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.150 
is gonna give it the illusion that it
has<00:05:26.300> volume<00:05:26.900> right<00:05:27.290> now<00:05:27.470> what<00:05:27.620> we're<00:05:27.770> doing<00:05:28.040> is

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
has volume right now what we're doing is

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.680 
has volume right now what we're doing is
we're<00:05:28.280> working<00:05:28.550> on<00:05:28.670> just<00:05:28.850> color<00:05:29.120> correcting

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
we're working on just color correcting

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.190 
we're working on just color correcting
the<00:05:29.930> entire<00:05:30.560> flesh<00:05:31.460> and<00:05:32.000> this<00:05:32.690> whole<00:05:32.930> color

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
the entire flesh and this whole color

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.840 
the entire flesh and this whole color
correction<00:05:33.620> process<00:05:33.980> is<00:05:34.100> gonna<00:05:34.190> take<00:05:34.520> place

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
correction process is gonna take place

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.660 
correction process is gonna take place
over<00:05:35.750> quite<00:05:35.960> some<00:05:36.140> times<00:05:36.380> so<00:05:36.680> that's<00:05:37.490> what

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
over quite some times so that's what

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.040 
over quite some times so that's what
we're<00:05:37.790> working<00:05:37.880> on<00:05:38.120> now<00:05:38.180> and<00:05:38.750> just<00:05:38.930> before

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
we're working on now and just before

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.600 
we're working on now and just before
recording<00:05:39.560> us<00:05:39.650> I<00:05:39.770> was<00:05:39.890> working<00:05:40.130> on<00:05:40.190> putting<00:05:40.490> in

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
recording us I was working on putting in

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.160 
recording us I was working on putting in
this<00:05:40.820> little<00:05:41.120> shadow<00:05:41.360> over<00:05:41.570> here<00:05:41.750> which<00:05:41.960> as

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.170 
this little shadow over here which as

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.990 
this little shadow over here which as
you<00:05:42.320> can<00:05:42.470> see<00:05:42.740> if<00:05:42.890> we<00:05:42.950> zoom<00:05:43.220> in<00:05:43.400> this<00:05:43.640> is<00:05:43.850> the

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
you can see if we zoom in this is the

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.210 
you can see if we zoom in this is the
new<00:05:44.210> layer<00:05:44.480> and<00:05:44.810> this<00:05:44.990> was<00:05:45.230> the<00:05:45.470> last<00:05:45.710> layer<00:05:45.980> so

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
new layer and this was the last layer so

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.770 
new layer and this was the last layer so
it<00:05:46.340> looks<00:05:46.550> quite<00:05:46.910> different<00:05:47.390> the<00:05:47.450> shadows<00:05:47.750> a

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
it looks quite different the shadows a

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.240 
it looks quite different the shadows a
lot<00:05:47.960> more<00:05:48.140> pronounced<00:05:48.590> in<00:05:48.680> this<00:05:48.800> area<00:05:49.100> the

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
lot more pronounced in this area the

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.010 
lot more pronounced in this area the
same<00:05:49.430> thing<00:05:49.640> goes<00:05:49.790> for<00:05:49.820> this<00:05:50.360> bottom<00:05:50.750> layer<00:05:50.840> I

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
same thing goes for this bottom layer I

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.540 
same thing goes for this bottom layer I
still<00:05:51.230> have<00:05:51.350> to<00:05:51.500> go<00:05:51.620> ahead<00:05:51.860> and<00:05:52.010> blend<00:05:52.220> a<00:05:52.400> lot

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
still have to go ahead and blend a lot

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.920 
still have to go ahead and blend a lot
of<00:05:52.640> the<00:05:52.730> stuff<00:05:52.940> in<00:05:53.090> because<00:05:53.210> I<00:05:53.330> disrupt<00:05:53.720> in<00:05:53.840> the

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
of the stuff in because I disrupt in the

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.030 
of the stuff in because I disrupt in the
colors<00:05:54.230> right<00:05:54.500> now<00:05:54.650> I've<00:05:54.770> pretty<00:05:54.980> much

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
colors right now I've pretty much

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.530 
colors right now I've pretty much
finished<00:05:55.400> another<00:05:55.520> layer<00:05:55.790> of<00:05:55.940> paint<00:05:56.150> on<00:05:56.390> the

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
finished another layer of paint on the

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.910 
finished another layer of paint on the
leg<00:05:56.720> it<00:05:56.870> looks<00:05:57.050> quite<00:05:57.380> different<00:05:57.710> from<00:05:57.770> what

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
leg it looks quite different from what

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.400 
leg it looks quite different from what
it<00:05:58.010> used<00:05:58.040> to<00:05:58.280> but<00:05:59.090> we're<00:05:59.270> working<00:05:59.660> on<00:05:59.840> this

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
it used to but we're working on this

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.310 
it used to but we're working on this
highlight<00:06:01.160> down<00:06:01.490> this<00:06:01.790> way<00:06:02.030> that<00:06:02.990> real<00:06:03.290> real

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
highlight down this way that real real

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.730 
highlight down this way that real real
really<00:06:04.100> bright<00:06:04.460> highlight<00:06:05.030> and<00:06:05.270> I<00:06:06.050> figured

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
really bright highlight and I figured

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.010 
really bright highlight and I figured
this<00:06:06.890> is<00:06:06.950> a<00:06:07.100> great<00:06:07.430> opportunity<00:06:08.120> to<00:06:08.750> talk<00:06:08.960> a

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
this is a great opportunity to talk a

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.180 
this is a great opportunity to talk a
little<00:06:09.260> bit<00:06:09.410> about<00:06:09.440> highlights<00:06:09.950> cuz<00:06:10.100> I

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
little bit about highlights cuz I

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.710 
little bit about highlights cuz I
haven't<00:06:10.340> had<00:06:10.580> much<00:06:10.850> of<00:06:10.910> an<00:06:11.060> opportunity<00:06:11.420> to<00:06:11.540> do

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
haven't had much of an opportunity to do

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.390 
haven't had much of an opportunity to do
that<00:06:11.900> yet<00:06:12.110> now<00:06:12.410> a<00:06:12.440> lot<00:06:12.650> of<00:06:12.680> times<00:06:12.770> when<00:06:13.220> newer

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
that yet now a lot of times when newer

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.070 
that yet now a lot of times when newer
artists<00:06:13.850> think<00:06:14.060> of<00:06:14.180> highlights<00:06:14.600> they<00:06:14.900> think

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
artists think of highlights they think

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.690 
artists think of highlights they think
it<00:06:15.170> has<00:06:15.290> to<00:06:15.410> be<00:06:15.470> white<00:06:16.010> they<00:06:16.340> think<00:06:16.490> has<00:06:16.580> to<00:06:16.670> be

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
it has to be white they think has to be

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.340 
it has to be white they think has to be
really<00:06:17.150> bright<00:06:17.390> and<00:06:17.450> that's<00:06:17.720> not<00:06:17.900> always<00:06:18.170> the

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
really bright and that's not always the

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.800 
really bright and that's not always the
case<00:06:18.380> you'll<00:06:19.310> be<00:06:19.430> surprised<00:06:19.850> at<00:06:20.150> how<00:06:20.270> dark

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
case you'll be surprised at how dark

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.930 
case you'll be surprised at how dark
some<00:06:21.260> highlights<00:06:21.620> can<00:06:21.800> actually<00:06:22.250> be<00:06:22.430> once<00:06:22.760> you

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
some highlights can actually be once you

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.270 
some highlights can actually be once you
get<00:06:23.780> in<00:06:23.870> there<00:06:24.050> and<00:06:24.080> take<00:06:24.260> a<00:06:24.320> look<00:06:24.410> at<00:06:24.680> them<00:06:24.860> if

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
get in there and take a look at them if

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.160 
get in there and take a look at them if
I<00:06:25.460> were<00:06:25.580> to<00:06:25.670> replace<00:06:25.790> that<00:06:26.390> darker<00:06:26.780> color<00:06:26.810> with

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
I were to replace that darker color with

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.530 
I were to replace that darker color with
a<00:06:27.200> pure<00:06:27.590> white<00:06:27.860> it<00:06:28.130> would<00:06:28.280> look<00:06:28.580> weird<00:06:29.120> and<00:06:29.450> but
