we<00:00:05.010> believe<00:00:05.340> technology<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:06.360> that<00:00:06.420> it's<00:00:06.750> very

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
we believe technology is that it's very

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.090 
we believe technology is that it's very
best<00:00:07.260> and<00:00:07.890> it's<00:00:08.100> invisible

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.100 
best and it's invisible

when<00:00:10.670> you're<00:00:10.790> conscious<00:00:11.240> only<00:00:11.360> of<00:00:11.660> what

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
when you're conscious only of what

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.200 
when you're conscious only of what
you're<00:00:11.990> doing<00:00:12.320> not<00:00:13.310> the<00:00:13.520> device<00:00:13.760> you're<00:00:13.970> doing

you're doing not the device you're doing
it<00:00:14.300> with<00:00:14.480> an<00:00:15.520> iPad<00:00:16.520> is<00:00:16.790> the<00:00:17.210> perfect

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
it with an iPad is the perfect

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.290 
it with an iPad is the perfect
expression<00:00:17.900> of<00:00:18.140> that<00:00:18.500> idea<00:00:18.880> it's<00:00:19.880> just<00:00:20.180> this

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
expression of that idea it's just this

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.510 
expression of that idea it's just this
magical<00:00:20.840> pane<00:00:21.050> of<00:00:21.170> glass<00:00:21.250> it<00:00:22.250> can<00:00:22.400> become

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
magical pane of glass it can become

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.410 
magical pane of glass it can become
anything<00:00:22.970> you<00:00:23.210> want<00:00:23.420> it<00:00:23.510> to<00:00:23.540> be<00:00:23.750> and<00:00:25.420> that's

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
anything you want it to be and that's

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.750 
anything you want it to be and that's
why<00:00:26.570> so<00:00:26.840> many<00:00:26.900> people<00:00:27.110> in<00:00:27.590> so<00:00:28.190> many<00:00:28.490> different

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
why so many people in so many different

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.210 
why so many people in so many different
places<00:00:29.000> are<00:00:29.560> using<00:00:30.560> it<00:00:30.650> for<00:00:30.890> so<00:00:31.070> many

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
places are using it for so many

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.910 
places are using it for so many
different<00:00:31.430> things<00:00:32.170> it's<00:00:33.170> a<00:00:33.290> more<00:00:33.470> personal

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
different things it's a more personal

different things it's a more personal
experience<00:00:34.400> with<00:00:34.550> technology<00:00:35.150> and<00:00:35.330> people
