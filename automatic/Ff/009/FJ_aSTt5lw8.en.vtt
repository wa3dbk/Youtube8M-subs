00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.670
 so she joins the little video to complete those on the customer care 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:13.569
 as said to show that you can change a dollar to get 1 opening 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:18.089
 or else really very effective it changes aesthetic arrangements that 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.849
 is much heavier much more practical and in any case much more 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:22.599
 effective at the opening 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.779
 we have an excellent bottle opener I repeat again at the level of seizures 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.779
 count one is not very far from what would be the origin 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.820
 having the hand they sent on top 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.360
 there we go there 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.820
 and the Brazilian on top so to have a maximum approach and go 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.820
 really an opening carries well with this system m 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.300
 object I saw the man I could see we know we can do it differently 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.000
 in this 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 very simply a model from blackrock 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.430
 the fact that the right completely aligned raikkonen already clinched six 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.810
 minutes bottle opener 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.040
 I had to see 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.440
 repeatedly a relatively quick dollar exit 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.900
 I'm mad, I'm furious 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.000
 and cohesion simply 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.640
 slip into the project 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.640
 singles it works also on Bordeaux wines 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.970
 no problem 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.220
 so taking inspiration from that line 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.220
 a total of 6 ft 2 in can also be modified 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.050
 that very slightly 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.090
 so I tell myself we'll have 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.150
 not downward she testified 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.260
 that kind of modification because there you doubt it that with a project 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.040
 as important and so important an opening we have a really 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.910
 huge no matter the support no matter the support and no worries 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.740
 thereupon 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.800
 we can go 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.180
 basing on that kind of product there if you go out that out of your pocket 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.270
 We'll see 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.060
 for the coach at the second 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.710
 it goes very well 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.600
 posted behind 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.690
 it goes very well also very good approach 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.410
 we can do it also 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.620
 to attest 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.719
 I felt close to mabhouh 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:12.359
 it also goes very well too 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.789
 the ultimate test 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:18.439
 we can do tactical racket with the wii so we'll test 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.439
 right now 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:27.049
 so on it no worries q this is the ultimate test for him i can not 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.049
 do it and tactically it's useless to take place 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:35.139
 here is now we really have to bagua by the ubs must show that we can just 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.799
 changed only slightly 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.889
 and from there we also have quality or equipped by m
