you guys look for it for a more
affordable<00:01:05.850> price<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.630> $700<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.560> just

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
affordable price because $700 is just

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.130

way too high for a point shoot camera in

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.840 
way too high for a point shoot camera in
my<00:01:10.260> opinion<00:01:10.740> there's<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.280> no<00:01:11.460> way<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.640> I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
my opinion there's just no way that I

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.370 
my opinion there's just no way that I
was<00:01:11.909> gonna<00:01:12.030> buy<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.510> price<00:01:12.720> Danny<00:01:13.080> I'm

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
compare it to I know when I was

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.749

researching this camera to purchase I

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.399 
researching this camera to purchase I
wanted<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.390> able<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.750> see<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.110> actual

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.080 
plan on putting a screen protector on
here<00:02:47.560> but<00:02:47.709> upon<00:02:47.950> picking<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.520> up<00:02:48.550> I<00:02:48.820> feel<00:02:48.970> like

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
here but upon picking it up I feel like

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.729 
here but upon picking it up I feel like
it's<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.300> really<00:02:49.480> good<00:02:49.600> weight<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:50.320> feel<00:02:50.590> like

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
it's a really good weight I feel like

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.560 
it's a really good weight I feel like
it's<00:02:50.860> very<00:02:50.950> actually<00:02:51.670> comparable<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.330> the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
it's very actually comparable to the

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.260 
it's very actually comparable to the
ELPH<00:02:53.470> line<00:02:53.800> it<00:02:54.100> actually<00:02:54.160> does<00:02:54.640> not<00:02:54.760> feel<00:02:55.060> too

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
ELPH line it actually does not feel too

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.199 
ELPH line it actually does not feel too
much<00:02:55.300> heavier<00:02:55.780> or<00:02:56.020> both<00:02:56.200> here<00:02:56.470> than<00:02:56.830> my<00:02:57.220> ELPH

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
much heavier or both here than my ELPH

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.440 
much heavier or both here than my ELPH
330<00:02:58.870> HSB<00:02:59.620> seems<00:02:59.860> very<00:03:00.010> similar<00:03:00.580> looking<00:03:01.150> at<00:03:01.300> it

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
330 HSB seems very similar looking at it

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.000 
330 HSB seems very similar looking at it
you<00:03:01.510> can<00:03:01.570> see<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:02.050> a<00:03:02.110> little<00:03:02.380> bit<00:03:02.500> wider<00:03:02.830> I

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
you can see it is a little bit wider I

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.949 
you can see it is a little bit wider I
will<00:03:03.250> have<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.459> buy<00:03:03.550> a<00:03:03.580> new<00:03:03.700> case<00:03:04.030> what<00:03:04.660> else<00:03:04.810> is

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
will have to buy a new case what else is

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.150 
will have to buy a new case what else is
really<00:03:05.110> cool<00:03:05.410> is<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.769> have<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.010> whole

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
really cool is you have the whole

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.949 
really cool is you have the whole
setting<00:03:06.550> dial<00:03:06.760> right<00:03:07.030> here<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.660> think<00:03:07.690> that's

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
setting dial right here I think that's

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.690 
setting dial right here I think that's
really<00:03:08.260> really<00:03:08.380> cool<00:03:08.800> going<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.459> sides

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
really really cool going to the sides

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.160 
really really cool going to the sides
obviously<00:03:09.970> there<00:03:10.420> is<00:03:10.540> a<00:03:10.570> difference<00:03:10.959> in<00:03:11.080> the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
obviously there is a difference in the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.870 
obviously there is a difference in the
two<00:03:11.320> cameras<00:03:11.739> but<00:03:12.160> overall<00:03:12.459> I'm<00:03:12.850> really

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
two cameras but overall I'm really

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.310 
two cameras but overall I'm really
excited<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.600> have<00:03:13.690> this<00:03:13.930> as<00:03:14.140> my

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
excited to have this as my

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.990 
excited to have this as my
point-and-shoot<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:15.130> before<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.400> get<00:03:15.610> into<00:03:15.850> too

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
point-and-shoot so before I get into too

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.789 
point-and-shoot so before I get into too
much<00:03:16.030> specifics<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.900> am<00:03:17.049> gonna<00:03:17.260> go<00:03:17.350> ahead<00:03:17.590> and

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
focus as well as the exposure now I'm

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.030 
focus as well as the exposure now I'm
gonna<00:03:40.360> walk<00:03:40.540> out<00:03:40.720> because<00:03:41.079> generally<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.560> go<00:03:41.860> in

and out of this room so I'm gonna walk
out<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.350> show<00:03:44.560> how<00:03:44.769> it<00:03:44.950> changes<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.060> exposure

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
out to show how it changes the exposure

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.660

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
both of them set to zero so they both

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.710 
both of them set to zero so they both
are<00:03:51.459> on<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.700> exact<00:03:52.000> same<00:03:52.180> settings<00:03:52.480> they're
