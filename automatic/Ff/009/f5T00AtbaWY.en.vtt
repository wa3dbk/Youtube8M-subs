00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
drew the system but I do believe that

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.150 
drew the system but I do believe that
he'll<00:03:12.430> be<00:03:12.580> out<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:13.090> jail<00:03:13.450> today<00:03:13.840> I<00:03:14.290> don't<00:03:14.950> think

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
he'll be out of jail today I don't think

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.860 
he'll be out of jail today I don't think

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
they would really hold you for marijuana

they would really hold you for marijuana
charges<00:03:17.380> i<00:03:17.650> don't<00:03:17.800> believe<00:03:17.980> you'd<00:03:18.130> have<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.370> do

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
any time for that i could be wrong I

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.320 
any time for that i could be wrong I
could<00:03:20.590> be<00:03:20.680> completely<00:03:20.830> wrong<00:03:21.190> but<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:22.060> really

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
could be completely wrong but I really

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.370 
could be completely wrong but I really
don't<00:03:22.600> believe<00:03:22.660> you<00:03:22.930> would<00:03:23.049> do<00:03:23.140> time<00:03:23.350> for

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
marijuana charges and I don't think he

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.340 
marijuana charges and I don't think he
should<00:03:25.030> either<00:03:25.450> because<00:03:26.049> like<00:03:26.170> I<00:03:26.290> said

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350

definitely do anytime you land somebody
in<00:04:28.150> jail<00:04:28.200> for<00:04:29.200> a<00:04:29.229> prank

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
in jail for a prank

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.700 
in jail for a prank
I<00:04:30.120> just<00:04:30.389> think<00:04:30.570> that's<00:04:30.630> something<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.320> you

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
I just think that's something that you

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.990 
I just think that's something that you
definitely<00:04:31.919> have<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.490> quit<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:32.700> think<00:04:32.940> if

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
definitely have to quit I think if

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.370 
definitely have to quit I think if
anybody<00:04:33.210> lands<00:04:33.570> in<00:04:33.720> jail<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:33.990> should<00:04:34.139> be<00:04:34.260> the

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
anybody lands in jail it should be the

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.780 
anybody lands in jail it should be the
kid<00:04:34.530> who<00:04:34.590> called<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:35.010> SWAT<00:04:35.250> team<00:04:35.280> for<00:04:35.700> no

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
kid who called the SWAT team for no

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.970 
kid who called the SWAT team for no
reason<00:04:36.270> although<00:04:36.600> they<00:04:37.050> did<00:04:37.230> find<00:04:37.500> somebody

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
reason although they did find somebody

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.320 
reason although they did find somebody
