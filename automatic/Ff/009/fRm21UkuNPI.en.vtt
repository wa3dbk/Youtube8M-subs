00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.180
 hello everyone and i'm actually writing 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.400
 This guide is already the second time because 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.709
 the first time I wrote everything down zara he 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.510
 gave but the sound quality turned out 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.130
 somehow secret because something 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.099
 do with your mic 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.740
 he after i have already rendered everything 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.980
 I did something and the microphone became again 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.259
 normal and okay get down to business and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.589
 Today I would like to tell you about 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:34.350
 the legendary grenade modifier and the first 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.820
 modifier expired he'll show it 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.430
 fire bee 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.430
 the main problem of this grenade is that 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.590
 you can get it by chance that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.740
 there is either from any chest or from any 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.600
 the enemy and accordingly I 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.610
 It turned out such a problem that for all 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.830
 I have never received my passes 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.100
 this modifier but it is kind of me 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.100
 provided and I make this guide like 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.890
 would be like best if you are going 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.680
 just farm this grenade and and get 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.259
 from the pita pen let's move to a special effect and 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.230
 on this modifier it reads bees 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.450
 fly thanks to this wonderful floor 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.430
 the bee always has a fiery elemental 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.310
 the effect is spat fire in a circular motion 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.800
 and in addition shoots small fiery 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.290
 missiles by the way on the video I show 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.600
 a grenade with a prefix new god how i his 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.550
 call thanks to it out for pigs 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.460
 the grenade flies right to the place where 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.920
 exit 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.110
 thanks to this modifier u you can 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.869
 protect very effectively and groups 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.710
 gangsters for example in the arena or in narrow 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.229
 spaces 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.869
 but you have to be very careful because 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.450
 she has pretty yes what's there 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.970
 pretty very big damage in 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.790
 Anyway on you if you happen to 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.610
 ask and you have to run fast under your feet and 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.490
 this video was too short 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.490
 but I do not know it without me 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.539
 the second time overwrite well maybe 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.270
 and no, but I hope I told everything I could 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.100
 appear to him a modifier or 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.229
 it is clear that you were already there a bunch 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.810
 subtleties of use tell but 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.060
 the main thing i said the main thing is not to throw under 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.630
 legs are understandable and damage is done 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.280
 pretty good 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.920
 thanks for watching and if you 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.840
 like this very small guide 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.840
 yes a little
