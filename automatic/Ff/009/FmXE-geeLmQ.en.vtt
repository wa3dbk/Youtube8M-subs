00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
you because of this is a grid module and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.010 
you because of this is a grid module and
you<00:01:16.410> have<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.680> individual<00:01:17.280> controlled<00:01:18.020> LEDs

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
you have this individual controlled LEDs

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.889 
you have this individual controlled LEDs
and<00:01:19.290> what<00:01:19.890> they<00:01:19.979> do<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.310> they<00:01:20.899> they
