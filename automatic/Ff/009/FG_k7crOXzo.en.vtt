one as well got me down from my mind and
up<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.550> top<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.760> wire<00:00:36.030> base<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:37.370> under<00:00:38.370> a

day and I was talking about this is um
I've<00:01:11.939> seen<00:01:12.299> people<00:01:12.479> making<00:01:12.990> elevators<00:01:13.560> where

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
I've seen people making elevators where

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.760 
I've seen people making elevators where
you<00:01:14.040> get<00:01:14.250> one<00:01:15.240> person<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.810> pushes<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.320> up<00:01:16.409> and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you get one person it pushes you up and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.130 
you get one person it pushes you up and
then<00:01:17.119> another<00:01:18.119> patient<00:01:18.540> push<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> piston

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
then another patient push the piston

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.050 
then another patient push the piston
pushes<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.100> side<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.610> then<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:20.880> again

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
pushes you to the side and then up again

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.410 
pushes you to the side and then up again
to<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> side<00:01:21.810> then<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:22.170> again<00:01:22.610> but<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.759> seeing

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
to the side then up again but it seeing

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.140 
to the side then up again but it seeing
is<00:01:24.570> one<00:01:24.780> piston<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.560> think<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.340> lifts<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.880> about

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
is one piston I think it lifts you about

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.450 
is one piston I think it lifts you about
seven<00:01:27.540> blocks<00:01:27.829> you're<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> need<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.250> lot

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
seven blocks you're going to need a lot

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.120 
seven blocks you're going to need a lot
of<00:01:29.490> pistons<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.110> seven<00:01:31.710> then<00:01:31.860> across

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
of pistons for the seven then across

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.850 
of pistons for the seven then across
seven<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.700> across<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.299> one<00:01:33.710> why<00:01:34.710> don't

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
seven and across and this one why don't

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.230 
seven and across and this one why don't
I<00:01:34.890> give<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.270> now<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.689> won't<00:01:37.320> give<00:01:37.470> an<00:01:37.560> example

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
actually I will ya we'll go over to my

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:47.569 
actually I will ya we'll go over to my
mine<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.979> we'll<00:01:44.189> show<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.399> how<00:01:46.250> far<00:01:47.250> it

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
mine and we'll show you how far it

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.320 
mine and we'll show you how far it
boosts<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.509> in

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
boosts you in

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.790 
boosts you in
a<00:01:49.620> short<00:01:50.620> amount<00:01:50.740> of<00:01:50.950> time<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:53.520> they're<00:01:55.800> the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
a short amount of time that they're the

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.950 
a short amount of time that they're the
only<00:01:56.980> difference<00:01:57.550> with<00:01:57.760> this<00:01:57.910> one<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.840> the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
only difference with this one to the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.940 
only difference with this one to the
other<00:01:58.990> elevators<00:01:59.680> is<00:01:59.860> you're<00:02:00.070> gonna<00:02:00.220> need<00:02:00.370> a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
other elevators is you're gonna need a

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.910 
other elevators is you're gonna need a
water<00:02:02.950> break<00:02:03.160> to<00:02:03.700> get<00:02:04.260> like<00:02:05.260> if<00:02:05.410> you<00:02:05.590> want<00:02:05.710> to

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
water break to get like if you want to

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.840 
water break to get like if you want to
go<00:02:06.580> down<00:02:06.820> low<00:02:07.090> but<00:02:07.450> at<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.619> top<00:02:08.860> I<00:02:09.070> thought<00:02:09.700> you

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
go down low but at the top I thought you

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:10.920 
go down low but at the top I thought you
need<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.119> water<00:02:10.270> break<00:02:10.540> but<00:02:10.690> all<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.899> really

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
need to water break but all you really

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.170 
need to water break but all you really
need<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.470> block<00:02:11.770> up<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.250> top<00:02:12.460> you<00:02:12.850> can<00:02:13.000> make

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
need is a block up the top you can make

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.240 
need is a block up the top you can make
a<00:02:13.210> roof<00:02:13.480> or<00:02:13.690> two<00:02:13.900> blocks<00:02:14.230> would<00:02:14.410> have<00:02:14.560> but<00:02:14.800> one

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
a roof or two blocks would have but one

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.280 
a roof or two blocks would have but one
block<00:02:15.460> so<00:02:15.610> we<00:02:15.730> need<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:16.930> stand<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.230> the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
block so we need so you stand in the

forward and as long as he hit forward

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.270 
forward and as long as he hit forward
you'll<00:02:22.540> help<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.900> block<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.560> it'll<00:02:23.860> put<00:02:24.220> you

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
you'll help that block and it'll put you

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.550 
you'll help that block and it'll put you
down<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:25.540> that's<00:02:25.750> not<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.110> whole<00:02:26.140> way<00:02:26.500> you

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
down but that's not the whole way you

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.500 
down but that's not the whole way you
know<00:02:28.200> if<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.410> don't<00:02:29.650> go<00:02:29.830> forward<00:02:30.250> that<00:02:30.510> didn't

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
know if you don't go forward that didn't

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.100 
know if you don't go forward that didn't
work<00:02:32.340> let's<00:02:33.340> be<00:02:33.490> getting<00:02:33.610> away<00:02:33.970> if<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.900> don't

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
work let's be getting away if you don't

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.690 
work let's be getting away if you don't
hit<00:02:35.230> forward<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.920> go<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.220> high<00:02:38.490> let's<00:02:39.490> go

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
hit forward you go that high let's go

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.030 
hit forward you go that high let's go
back<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:39.970> my<00:02:41.670> example<00:02:43.320> this<00:02:44.320> isn't<00:02:44.680> too<00:02:44.800> hard

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
back to my example this isn't too hard

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.940 
back to my example this isn't too hard
to<00:02:45.160> make<00:02:45.959> really<00:02:46.959> can't<00:02:47.230> be<00:02:47.410> because<00:02:47.620> I've

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
to make really can't be because I've

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.949 
to make really can't be because I've
managed<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.280> do<00:02:48.490> and<00:02:48.670> I'm<00:02:48.820> really<00:02:49.120> really

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
managed to do and I'm really really

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.170 
managed to do and I'm really really
it<00:02:50.110> redstone<00:02:50.800> I<00:02:51.070> don't<00:02:52.060> understand<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:52.720> at<00:02:52.870> all

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
it redstone I don't understand it at all

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.880 
it redstone I don't understand it at all
but<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.300> basics<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:55.989> are<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.230> place<00:02:56.709> your

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
but the basics of it are you place your

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.960 
but the basics of it are you place your
four<00:02:57.130> Pistons<00:02:57.580> down<00:02:57.790> like<00:02:57.970> that<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:59.850> made<00:03:00.850> this

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
four Pistons down like that I made this

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.449 
four Pistons down like that I made this
because<00:03:01.239> no<00:03:01.420> one<00:03:01.570> really<00:03:01.600> has<00:03:02.200> any<00:03:02.530> of<00:03:03.250> the

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
because no one really has any of the

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.390 
because no one really has any of the
tutorial<00:03:03.640> of<00:03:04.060> them<00:03:04.150> if<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:05.560> good<00:03:05.769> for<00:03:06.040> business

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
tutorial of them if so good for business

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.800 
tutorial of them if so good for business
out<00:03:06.550> like<00:03:06.670> that<00:03:06.820> make<00:03:07.090> sure<00:03:07.239> you<00:03:07.330> right<00:03:07.600> click

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
out like that make sure you right click

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.160 
out like that make sure you right click
on<00:03:07.989> them<00:03:08.140> all<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:08.560> they're<00:03:08.709> facing<00:03:09.010> upwards

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
on them all so they're facing upwards

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.710 
on them all so they're facing upwards
you<00:03:11.170> can<00:03:11.350> use<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.620> lever<00:03:12.489> or<00:03:12.910> a<00:03:12.940> button<00:03:13.269> like<00:03:13.540> I

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
you can use a lever or a button like I

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.070 
you can use a lever or a button like I
have<00:03:13.989> or<00:03:14.700> some<00:03:15.700> sort<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.090> crazy<00:03:16.330> redstone

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
have or some sort of crazy redstone

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.259 
have or some sort of crazy redstone
circuitry<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:19.019> what<00:03:20.019> you<00:03:20.110> do<00:03:20.290> is

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
circuitry and what you do is

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.759 
circuitry and what you do is
the<00:03:22.269> way<00:03:22.420> i<00:03:22.450> have<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:22.989> set<00:03:23.019> up<00:03:23.230> there's

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
the way i have it set up there's

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.190 
the way i have it set up there's
possibly<00:03:24.670> awake<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.209> either<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.600> redstone<00:03:25.989> i

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
possibly awake and either the redstone i

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.229 
possibly awake and either the redstone i
have<00:03:26.350> no<00:03:26.530> idea<00:03:26.650> if<00:03:26.920> there<00:03:27.160> e<00:03:29.940> let<00:03:30.940> me<00:03:31.030> try

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
have no idea if there e let me try

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:45.440 
have no idea if there e let me try
something<00:03:35.160> hmmm<00:03:36.840> let's<00:03:37.840> aim<00:03:37.989> for<00:03:38.019> work<00:03:39.360> 30

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:57.420 

sugar<00:03:46.450> water<00:03:46.630> show<00:03:55.890> I'm<00:03:56.890> really<00:03:57.100> bad<00:03:57.400> with

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
sugar water show I'm really bad with

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.410 
sugar water show I'm really bad with
redstone<00:04:02.640> now<00:04:03.640> you<00:04:03.730> could<00:04:03.880> probably<00:04:04.090> just

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
redstone now you could probably just

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.900 
redstone now you could probably just
cover<00:04:04.690> it<00:04:04.780> up<00:04:04.930> whatever<00:04:05.530> I'll<00:04:06.310> just<00:04:06.370> place<00:04:06.700> all

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
cover it up whatever I'll just place all

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:14.040 
cover it up whatever I'll just place all
this<00:04:07.030> back<00:04:11.460> no<00:04:12.460> point<00:04:12.790> may<00:04:12.940> try<00:04:13.210> an<00:04:13.270> experiment

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
this back no point may try an experiment

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.259 
this back no point may try an experiment
during<00:04:14.350> a<00:04:14.440> tutorial<00:04:14.740> I'd<00:04:16.230> just<00:04:17.230> stick<00:04:17.440> with<00:04:17.560> 10

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
during a tutorial I'd just stick with 10

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.900 
during a tutorial I'd just stick with 10
so<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:20.410> way<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.590> won't<00:04:21.160> set<00:04:21.430> up<00:04:21.549> is<00:04:21.730> that

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
so the way I won't set up is that

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.510 
so the way I won't set up is that
there's<00:04:22.630> one<00:04:22.870> person<00:04:23.140> just<00:04:23.860> turn<00:04:24.130> this<00:04:24.250> lever

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
there's one person just turn this lever

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.980 
there's one person just turn this lever
off<00:04:25.950> then<00:04:26.950> you<00:04:27.520> get<00:04:27.790> this<00:04:27.940> one<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:28.510> you<00:04:28.780> bring

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
off then you get this one and you bring

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.150 
off then you get this one and you bring
it<00:04:29.140> around<00:04:30.210> too<00:04:31.210> tight<00:04:31.720> around<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.650> sides<00:04:32.950> of

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
it around too tight around the sides of

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.680 
it around too tight around the sides of
all<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.430> other<00:04:33.460> three<00:04:33.850> pieces<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.390> so<00:04:34.540> it's

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
all the other three pieces and so it's

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.140 
all the other three pieces and so it's
not<00:04:34.870> too<00:04:35.050> complicated<00:04:35.230> oh<00:04:37.950> come<00:04:38.950> on<00:04:39.150> they're

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
not too complicated oh come on they're

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.470 
not too complicated oh come on they're
all<00:04:40.360> four<00:04:40.660> go<00:04:40.840> up<00:04:41.020> I'll<00:04:41.580> w<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:42.880> water<00:04:43.090> because

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
all four go up I'll w the water because

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.370 
all four go up I'll w the water because
I<00:04:43.510> need<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.470> water<00:04:44.770> break<00:04:44.980> to<00:04:45.670> come<00:04:45.910> down<00:04:46.120> on<00:04:46.380> bit

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
I need a water break to come down on bit

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:56.159 
I need a water break to come down on bit
up<00:04:48.000> I<00:04:49.950> don't<00:04:50.950> feel<00:04:51.250> like<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:51.520> full<00:04:51.730> boost<00:04:55.169> what

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
up I don't feel like the full boost what

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:07.730 
up I don't feel like the full boost what
up<00:04:56.320> let<00:04:56.590> me<00:04:56.740> check<00:05:00.780> there<00:05:01.780> we<00:05:02.290> go<00:05:04.260> Jesus<00:05:05.260> hey

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
up let me check there we go Jesus hey

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.460 
up let me check there we go Jesus hey
yeah<00:05:08.740> so<00:05:09.550> that's<00:05:09.910> how<00:05:10.030> I<00:05:10.180> get<00:05:10.690> launched<00:05:11.140> if<00:05:11.350> you

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
yeah so that's how I get launched if you

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.930 
yeah so that's how I get launched if you
do<00:05:11.620> it<00:05:11.800> if<00:05:12.760> you<00:05:12.910> stand<00:05:13.180> correctly<00:05:14.730> and<00:05:15.730> believe

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
do it if you stand correctly and believe

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.280 
do it if you stand correctly and believe
me<00:05:16.090> it's<00:05:16.210> not<00:05:16.330> too<00:05:16.510> hard<00:05:16.750> to<00:05:16.900> get<00:05:17.080> in<00:05:17.230> the

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
me it's not too hard to get in the

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.909 
me it's not too hard to get in the
correct<00:05:17.530> position<00:05:17.710> to<00:05:18.480> get<00:05:19.480> launched<00:05:19.930> all

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
correct position to get launched all

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.500 
correct position to get launched all
right<00:05:21.450> it's<00:05:22.450> just<00:05:22.660> a<00:05:23.220> baby<00:05:24.220> want<00:05:24.550> one<00:05:25.150> in<00:05:25.300> ten

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
right it's just a baby want one in ten

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.780 
right it's just a baby want one in ten
times<00:05:25.750> it<00:05:26.230> doesn't<00:05:27.060> position<00:05:28.060> your<00:05:28.210> right<00:05:28.419> and

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
times it doesn't position your right and

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.770 
times it doesn't position your right and
you<00:05:30.790> don't<00:05:31.000> get<00:05:31.150> launched<00:05:31.360> all<00:05:31.540> the<00:05:31.660> way

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
you don't get launched all the way

you don't get launched all the way
that's<00:05:32.080> another<00:05:32.440> reason<00:05:32.680> for<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:33.010> water

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
that's another reason for the water

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.100 
that's another reason for the water
breaking<00:05:33.700> in<00:05:33.820> my<00:05:33.850> mind<00:05:34.240> it's<00:05:34.450> not<00:05:34.540> just<00:05:34.870> for<00:05:34.990> me

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
breaking in my mind it's not just for me

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.530 
breaking in my mind it's not just for me
getting<00:05:35.320> down<00:05:35.820> originally<00:05:36.820> I<00:05:36.850> didn't<00:05:37.270> have<00:05:37.419> it

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
getting down originally I didn't have it

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.970 
getting down originally I didn't have it
forgetting<00:05:37.960> again<00:05:38.169> at<00:05:38.290> all<00:05:38.470> and<00:05:38.710> was<00:05:38.800> just

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
forgetting again at all and was just

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.330 
forgetting again at all and was just
there<00:05:39.250> in<00:05:39.430> case<00:05:39.460> I<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:41.470> old<00:05:41.620> chance<00:05:41.950> that<00:05:42.310> I

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
there in case I the old chance that I

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.740 
there in case I the old chance that I
didn't<00:05:42.880> make<00:05:43.240> it<00:05:43.300> all<00:05:43.510> the<00:05:43.570> way<00:05:43.690> I<00:05:45.750> got

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750

didn't make it all the way I got
everything

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
everything

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.290 
everything
better<00:05:48.830> yeah<00:05:49.430> that<00:05:49.669> didn't<00:05:49.910> make<00:05:50.000> it<00:05:50.060> all<00:05:50.240> the

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
better yeah that didn't make it all the

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.900 
better yeah that didn't make it all the
way<00:05:50.389> I'm<00:05:50.870> might<00:05:51.740> have<00:05:51.860> accidentally<00:05:52.699> stood

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
way I'm might have accidentally stood

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.860 
way I'm might have accidentally stood
there<00:05:53.120> trying<00:05:53.360> to<00:05:53.479> get<00:05:53.630> out<00:05:53.780> quick<00:05:54.080> and<00:05:54.490> I'm

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
there trying to get out quick and I'm

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.150

falling<00:05:56.870> down<00:05:57.110> didn't<00:05:57.530> get<00:05:57.620> the<00:05:57.770> whole<00:05:57.889> boost

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
falling down didn't get the whole boost

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.820 
falling down didn't get the whole boost
and<00:05:58.570> I've<00:05:59.570> hit<00:05:59.780> a<00:05:59.810> water<00:06:00.050> break<00:06:00.289> but<00:06:00.500> then<00:06:00.650> I

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830
