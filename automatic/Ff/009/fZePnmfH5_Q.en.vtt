00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 hello everyone here is a small box like 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.120
 once upon a time was promised only 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:17.850
 nothing fu and but as it normally plays 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:21.660
 two with 12 there is such a small sport 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.539
 34 hertz settings turned out though 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.170
 should have been track 6 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:33.890
 but the amplifier is actually the same everywhere 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.750
 same xls 2000 it waylaid 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.710
 now measure the power of flying speakers 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:49.739
 nothing so just anything for the sake of 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:51.410
 interest to the more or less we fall into 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.149
 box setting 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.149
 therefore, practical care 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.840
 Well, somehow it looks like this in general 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.740
 soon his 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.560
 my show from carpet speakers almost 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.910
 cold slightly warm now order 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:23.730
 150 watts flew on each because not 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:27.910
 connected per channel 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:31.569
 Let the whole box be sheathed . 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.630
