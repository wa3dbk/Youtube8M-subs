00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.560 
this thing is ip67 water-resistant what
that<00:01:31.890> means<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.909> can't<00:01:33.150> really<00:01:33.240> go

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that means is you can't really go

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.390 
that means is you can't really go
swimming<00:01:33.990> with<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.950> dunk<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.250> in

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
swimming with it but if you dunk it in

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.620 
swimming with it but if you dunk it in
water<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.729> should<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:36.119> fine

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
water it should be fine

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.999 
water it should be fine
I<00:01:36.659> believe<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.200> like<00:01:37.380> if<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.619> dunk<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.920> in

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
I believe it's like if you dunk it in

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.090 
I believe it's like if you dunk it in
water<00:01:38.220> for<00:01:38.390> one<00:01:39.390> meter<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.350> half<00:01:40.829> an<00:01:40.950> hour

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
water for one meter for a half an hour

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.920 
water for one meter for a half an hour
it'll<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:41.820> fine<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.329> after<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.570> bring<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.869> out

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
it'll be fine and after you bring it out

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.069 
it'll be fine and after you bring it out
that<00:01:43.140> was<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.350> test<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.540> why<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.810> relevant

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
that was the test so why is it relevant

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.410 
that was the test so why is it relevant

time I wash my hands it's just the way
it<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.649> my<00:02:10.190> basic<00:02:10.550> point<00:02:10.700> is<00:02:11.000> they<00:02:11.450> got<00:02:11.630> that

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
it is my basic point is they got that

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.170 
it is my basic point is they got that
right<00:02:12.080> making<00:02:12.739> a<00:02:12.890> watch<00:02:13.099> water-resistant<00:02:14.000> was

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
right making a watch water-resistant was

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.520 
right making a watch water-resistant was
crucial<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.810> it's<00:02:14.989> something<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.410> comes

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
crucial and it's something that comes

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.320 
crucial and it's something that comes
with<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.860> normal<00:02:16.160> watches<00:02:16.550> so<00:02:16.760> why<00:02:16.940> not<00:02:17.120> come

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
with the normal watches so why not come

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.330 
with the normal watches so why not come
with<00:02:17.360> smart<00:02:17.690> watches<00:02:17.950> another<00:02:18.950> thing<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.280> have

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
with smart watches another thing I have

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.040 
with smart watches another thing I have
to<00:02:19.459> talk<00:02:19.610> about<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:20.000> comfort<00:02:20.360> ability<00:02:20.569> not

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
to talk about is comfort ability not

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.470 
to talk about is comfort ability not
only<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.440> band<00:02:21.680> but<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.340> watch<00:02:22.489> itself<00:02:22.880> the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
only the band but the watch itself the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.570 
only the band but the watch itself the
watch<00:02:23.660> itself<00:02:24.050> is<00:02:24.290> pretty<00:02:24.470> big<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.069> at<00:02:25.400> first

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
watch itself is pretty big and at first

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.220 
watch itself is pretty big and at first
I<00:02:25.760> expected<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.480> be<00:02:26.569> like<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.049> average

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
I expected it to be like the average

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.170 
I expected it to be like the average
metal<00:02:27.680> watch<00:02:27.860> which<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:28.250> wear<00:02:28.580> for<00:02:28.790> like<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:28.910> day
