00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.189 
packet like this it was actually in my
mailbox<00:00:16.560> instead<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:17.820> my<00:00:18.090> door<00:00:18.390> though

mailbox instead of on my door though

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.960 
mailbox instead of on my door though
yeah<00:00:21.199> yeah<00:00:22.199> here<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.189> there's<00:00:23.880> a

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
yeah yeah here it is and there's a

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.580 
yeah yeah here it is and there's a
little<00:00:24.240> rip<00:00:24.449> down<00:00:24.630> there<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> corner<00:00:25.380> I

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
little rip down there on the corner I

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.730 
little rip down there on the corner I
don't<00:00:26.119> stuff<00:00:27.119> happens<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:28.019> guess<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.529> kind

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
don't stuff happens so I guess it's kind

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.370 
don't stuff happens so I guess it's kind
of<00:00:28.890> expected<00:00:29.630> but<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.869> packaging<00:00:31.289> was

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
of expected but the packaging was

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.659 
of expected but the packaging was
actually<00:00:31.679> pretty<00:00:31.800> poor<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.219> time<00:00:32.399> um

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
actually pretty poor this time um

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.180 
actually pretty poor this time um
usually<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.750> wouldn't<00:00:33.989> be<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.230> thin<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.980> as

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
usually it wouldn't be this thin like as

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.000 
usually it wouldn't be this thin like as
in<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.760> bag<00:00:36.660> that's<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.649> can<00:00:37.770> see<00:00:37.890> right

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
in the bag that's and you can see right

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.700 
in the bag that's and you can see right
there<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:38.430> really<00:00:38.579> easily<00:00:38.969> ripped<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
there it's really easily ripped so the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.110 
there it's really easily ripped so the
only<00:00:40.920> thing<00:00:41.160> that's<00:00:41.309> protecting<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.820> bubble

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
only thing that's protecting is bubble

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.090 
only thing that's protecting is bubble
wrap<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.540> if<00:00:43.170> someone<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.530> happens<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.829> rip

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
wrap so if someone just happens to rip

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.010 
wrap so if someone just happens to rip
open<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.520> thing<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.969> whatever<00:00:45.239> reason<00:00:45.660> then

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
open this thing for whatever reason then

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.569 
open this thing for whatever reason then
you're<00:00:46.320> basically<00:00:46.530> screwed<00:00:48.230> yeah<00:00:49.399> it<00:00:50.399> is

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
you're basically screwed yeah it is

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.420 
you're basically screwed yeah it is
wrapped<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.270> bow<00:00:51.420> wrapping<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:51.989> me<00:00:52.250> trying<00:00:53.250> to
