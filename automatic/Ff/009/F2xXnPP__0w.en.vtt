00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 There just wake up and pilot the car 18 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.340
 arrived in excellent condition to stock 1 in 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.519
 back here on the street circuit of 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.160
 salvador circuit that I like a lot 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.650
 to win last year how to start 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.020
 return 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.550
 who has a new chicane wants the year 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.619
 past era of fourth gear is now 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.650
 second or first gear very tight 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:31.070
 here the finish line for April 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.770
 here as the curve is easily spiked 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.420
 in fourth gear something that was 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.410
 Pleasant to do but as I think it is 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.020
 tighter 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.879
 quietly aggravated that you 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.340
 arrives in fourth gear here in this 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:47.210
 50's board a little further on 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.410
 already in second gear a good curve 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.120
 ability you have to always seek 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.920
 here in the middle goes very close to the wall 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.690
 now I'm seeing one of the biggest falls 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.269
 strong does not make a decision arrives 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.610
 crossing the track here and injured more than 50 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.320
 meters 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.420
 is a stretch that usually or very well 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.040
 this curve that the hair pink some 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.610
 pilots make first and second 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.300
 martyr 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.300
 the climb 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.119
 which comes for a very pleasant 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.729
 track also arrives in fourth gear 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.340
 brake slightly after 50 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.520
 have for the second gear here and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.649
 first here in this little old man and 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.250
 pro bow out perhaps the most challenging 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.229
 From Brazil, today it 's the crowd that people 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.200
 makes around 180 degrees per hour 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.009
 almost was recorded passing very close 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.009
 of the wall here 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.659
 also practically the accumulation of the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.100
 inside the outside the outside and 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.470
 Here a very important party as well 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:58.990
 that a franchise that arrives very fast 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:02.259
 strong cold from 50 meters that will 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.450
 have a car well inside the curve 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.440
 The traction is very important to me. 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.440
 when it accelerates now 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.590
 and the last one is the Chinese girl who is well 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.769
 slow to very challenging 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.810
 I suffered a little after 50 megs do 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:22.959
 It takes a lot to do here too. 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.959
 it's over grandma
