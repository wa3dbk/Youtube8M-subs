does<00:00:45.880> seem<00:00:46.060> like<00:00:46.210> a<00:00:46.240> bit<00:00:46.600> of<00:00:46.630> a<00:00:46.750> bold<00:00:47.050> move<00:00:47.410> I

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740 
does seem like a bit of a bold move I

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.410 
does seem like a bit of a bold move I
haven't<00:00:48.190> actually<00:00:48.280> played<00:00:48.640> it<00:00:48.760> myself<00:00:48.940> but

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
any watered down it's going to be the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.120 
any watered down it's going to be the
same<00:01:10.240> gameplay<00:01:10.479> that<00:01:11.080> we<00:01:11.200> enjoyed<00:01:11.500> in<00:01:11.650> fantasy

on<00:01:13.960> Intel's<00:01:14.350> handheld<00:01:14.710> well<00:01:15.250> honestly<00:01:16.030> I

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
on Intel's handheld well honestly I

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.940 
on Intel's handheld well honestly I
think<00:01:16.270> it'll<00:01:16.630> probably<00:01:16.690> do<00:01:17.080> even<00:01:17.500> better<00:01:17.650> than

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
think it'll probably do even better than

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.770 
think it'll probably do even better than
its<00:01:18.100> predecessor<00:01:18.240> primarily<00:01:19.240> just<00:01:19.510> because

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
its predecessor primarily just because

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.289 
its predecessor primarily just because
the<00:01:20.500> install<00:01:20.979> base<00:01:21.130> for<00:01:21.400> smartphones<00:01:21.880> is<00:01:22.000> so

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
the install base for smartphones is so

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.850 
the install base for smartphones is so
much<00:01:22.600> greater<00:01:22.930> than<00:01:23.200> that<00:01:23.320> of<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.530> 3ds

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
much greater than that of the 3ds

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.710 
much greater than that of the 3ds
however<00:01:24.729> there's<00:01:24.970> no<00:01:25.090> word<00:01:25.299> as<00:01:25.479> to<00:01:25.570> whether

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
however there's no word as to whether

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.120 
however there's no word as to whether
it's<00:01:25.900> coming<00:01:26.140> over<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.440> West<00:01:26.620> just<00:01:26.890> yet

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
it's coming over to the West just yet

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.190 
it's coming over to the West just yet
it's<00:01:27.310> only<00:01:27.460> confirmed<00:01:27.940> for<00:01:28.090> Japan<00:01:28.390> but<00:01:28.600> I

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
it's only confirmed for Japan but I

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.420 
it's only confirmed for Japan but I
would<00:01:29.290> be<00:01:29.409> surprised<00:01:29.740> if<00:01:29.860> we<00:01:29.920> didn't<00:01:30.250> see<00:01:30.340> it

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
would be surprised if we didn't see it

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.920 
would be surprised if we didn't see it
at<00:01:30.520> some<00:01:30.549> point<00:01:30.760> and<00:01:31.060> this<00:01:31.210> could<00:01:31.270> be<00:01:31.479> some

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
the smartphones but generally it's

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.820 
the smartphones but generally it's
insanely<00:02:04.689> difficult<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.530> there's<00:02:05.710> only

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
insanely difficult and there's only

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.800 
insanely difficult and there's only
really<00:02:06.159> one<00:02:06.310> option<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:06.939> that's<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.540> spend

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
really one option and that's to spend

really one option and that's to spend
real<00:02:08.170> money<00:02:08.200> however<00:02:08.979> playing<00:02:09.399> for<00:02:09.610> free<00:02:09.849> is

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
real money however playing for free is

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.940 
real money however playing for free is
much<00:02:10.360> more<00:02:10.539> viable<00:02:10.810> in<00:02:11.080> Pokemon<00:02:11.439> Rumble<00:02:11.620> war

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
much more viable in Pokemon Rumble war

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.550 
much more viable in Pokemon Rumble war
it's<00:02:12.549> still<00:02:12.909> not<00:02:13.090> ideal<00:02:13.629> and<00:02:13.930> really<00:02:14.409> I<00:02:14.439> just

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
it's still not ideal and really I just

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.180 
it's still not ideal and really I just
prefer<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.069> pay<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.579> couple

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
prefer to pay a couple

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.740 
prefer to pay a couple
pounds<00:02:16.550> for<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.730> game<00:02:16.940> maybe<00:02:17.150> five<00:02:17.480> or<00:02:17.510> even

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
pounds for the game maybe five or even

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.420 
pounds for the game maybe five or even
ten<00:02:18.080> pounds<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.590> then<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.160> be<00:02:19.220> able<00:02:19.310> to

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
ten pounds and then just be able to

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.530 
ten pounds and then just be able to
blitz<00:02:19.700> through<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.060> whole<00:02:20.210> game<00:02:20.450> without

having<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.960> pay<00:02:21.080> another<00:02:21.560> penny<00:02:21.680> but<00:02:22.550> that's

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
having to pay another penny but that's

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.300 
having to pay another penny but that's
just<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.390> changing<00:02:23.780> market<00:02:24.230> as<00:02:24.560> far<00:02:24.710> as<00:02:24.920> micro
