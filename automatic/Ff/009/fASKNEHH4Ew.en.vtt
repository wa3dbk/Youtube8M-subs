00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.449
 hi girls and guys I hope you are 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.980
 very well and welcome one more day to me 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.630
 channel today I bring this the look of 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.189
 makeup because I have put accounts and 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.199
 I did not do a look 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.180
 makeup and that's why I'm here with one 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.859
 new the nadya that I like 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.110
 very much because it is quite cool 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.850
 neutral is not too overloaded because 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.739
 I know that to many of you the truth 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.510
 that we like make-up too 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.309
 recharged even though as it is a 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.870
 makeup look I obviously wear 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.909
 makeup but it's not a look too 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.650
 recharged so I think that many of 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.120
 You may like it I love the 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.010
 combination between the eyes colors 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.440
 neutral and these most vibrant lips is 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.449
 coral color so pretty perfect for 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.129
 this weather that is so hot already 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.870
 you will see what looks really is very very 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.430
 easy to make and the products that 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.260
 I use the truth is that they are pretty 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.910
 economic are all low cost in order 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.590
 let's start with this tutorial if 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.679
 you want to see it, we stay there and 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.360
 let's start, so let's go there with the 

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:11.090
 makeup first thing we're going to do 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.130
 is to apply a pre-foundation 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.690
 this is optional of course I am 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.880
 applying this benefit because I 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.460
 add a touch a little glow to the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.460
 makeup illuminates me and I like it a lot 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.580
 I am going to apply this base of 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.760
 makeup that this is one has a 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.860
 medium and good coverage is a little bit 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.390
 darker than the tone of my skin but 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.190
 It is the same color as the rest of me 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.020
 body so I have to apply this 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.880
 tone so you do not see anything unusual between 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.690
 the neck and the face I am 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.070
 blurring with a sigma brush 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.270
 I'm going to leave all the information of the 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.490
 products in the information box 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.710
 we are going to treat the lips also for 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.320
 that are hydrated before applying the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.960
 rest of the makeup and then 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.820
 I will also apply this PREBASIC 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.829
 shadows I'm going to apply throughout the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.170
 eyelid so that the shadows last 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.780
 more time do not folds and you 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.429
 see more intense now I'm going to do my 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.649
 eyebrows but as you have seen 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.170
 a lot of times I'm going to do it outside of 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.510
 camera but not bored we go with the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.030
 shadows I'm going to apply this brown cited 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.349
 that has a sub tone a little purple 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.360
 around the eyelid mobile to taps and 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.730
 then I will use this following 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.610
 shadow that is like a caramel color with 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.650
 a quite warm sub tone with a 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.900
 Blur brush across the fold 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.489
 As you can see it will be the transition color and 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.850
 the combination between these two colors 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.430
 I love 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.200
 we touch the base color if we see that 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.600
 has lost intensity of the brown I quote 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.640
 clear and then with a brush 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.070
 these little precision ones we're going to 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.230
 catch this dark color that is a brown 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.390
 chocolate and we are going to do as a 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.550
 kind of delineated but with the shadow 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.890
 we are going to extend this color throughout 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.990
 the line of the tabs doing like 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.950
 a triangle in the in what is the 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.950
 eye socket 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.990
 we will add color and then we will 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.470
 Blur with a pretty brush 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.300
 soft so there are not very lines 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.730
 marked we want the outline to be 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.820
 see this marking but with lines 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.970
 too rough, so to speak, I do not know 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.580
 if you understand me later we are going to take a 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.010
 illuminator and let's put under the 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:32.000
 eyebrow bone that is matte in this 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.940
 case and with an eyeliner that is 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.560
 same chocolate color as the shadow that 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.580
 we have applied previous we are going to 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.950
 apply in the upper water line 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.050
 we will apply also our today 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.730
 It costs to speak to our mascara with 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.210
 Eyelash mascara on the eyelashes 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.270
 higher 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.130
 ok let's finish the face before 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.770
 to continue with the shadows and as 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.480
 I will always apply my concealer in 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.120
 this case this is from michael prolong 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.740
 I'm going to blur it very well and I'm going to 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.600
 seal with some powder so that it does not 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.250
 come out creases throughout the day this 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.220
 is important and how I have the skin 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.870
 mixed especially now that it's hot and 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.450
 I will also light up not too much 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.520
 just a little bit the high areas of my 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.400
 face so it looks like that no more 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.170
 with more illuminated the face to 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.670
 continuation with the same shadow as 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.890
 we have put on the mobile eyelid that is 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.510
 this brown with his tone moradito 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.220
 let's put in the whole line of the 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.330
 lower tabs to give 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.540
 definition and with chocolate shadow what 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.190
 let's also give it more definition 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.690
 let's say on the outside of the line 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.670
 of the eyelashes 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.920
 we are going to blur very well so that 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.010
 there is a little smoke effect and only a 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.010
 little bit 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.900
 let's apply mask too 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.180
 mascara tabs on lashes 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.120
 very important inferiors do not forget 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.550
 this step and we are also going to delineate with 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.530
 the same brown eyeliner for 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.389
 that the line of the 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.840
 lower lashes the water line 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.639
 so to speak and also with a with a 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.550
 shadow that has a little glitter 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:14.030
 which is quite clear we will illuminate the 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.470
 internal part of the lacrimal we go with the 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.940
 face and what we are going to do now is 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.770
 I am applying a little bit of 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.750
 bronzer to give it a little color 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.940
 face because I'm pretty white in 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.440
 this time is that the sun gives me and what 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.180
 distribute then for all the areas that 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.789
 I want the sun to shine naturally 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.280
 and this is an optional step but I'm going to 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.560
 outline my face it seems to me 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.630
 more like how my nose is as an 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.979
 little more tuned but of course this 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.060
 it's optional 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.440
 what I do next is also 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.449
 blur it so you do not see plan 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.539
 Busquets have done in the nose what 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.150
 blurred with a soft brush I'll 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:49.460
 apply a little bit of blas or blusher 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.260
 This is a color that I love Rosita 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.800
 with a little bit of brightness 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.370
 color 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.370
 do not 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.740
 and then also a little bit of 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.380
 illuminator in the upper areas of the face 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.270
 the bridge of the nose on the cheekbones etc 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.640
 etc 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.680
 I like to blur it with a is with 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.940
 this skunk brush everything I've 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.580
 done on the face so they do not look 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.520
 cuts and then we go with the 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:20.000
 lips this coral color that I love 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.530
 with wow brightness is super good and what 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.690
 I'm going to apply with my fingers because I think 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.300
 which is the best way and I'm going to lower it 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.280
 a little bit with the other coral color that is 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.950
 more clearly I think the combination that 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.920
 It was fantastic and very bright in the 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:37.040
 lips and good the look is already complete 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:40.390
 neutral eyes and coral lips to me 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.550
 love what do you think 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.080

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:55.070
 there is no 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.480
