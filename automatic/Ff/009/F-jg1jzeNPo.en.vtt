00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.534
 "Triangle" 

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:34.761
 I am in the middle of a triangle. 

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:41.954
 Without solution or even justification. 

00:00:42.585 --> 00:00:48.136
 I fell in love when I saw her for the first time. 

00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:55.169
 Knowing it is impossible 

00:00:57.312 --> 00:01:02.721
 Also in the middle of a triangle. 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.642
 She stayed because I shivered as I did. 

00:01:10.497 --> 00:01:15.938
 He compromised his heart and never thought. 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.241
 That belonging to another. 

00:01:20.093 --> 00:01:22.662
 Put your eyes on me. 

00:01:23.694 --> 00:01:26.505
 That would make us. 

00:01:27.165 --> 00:01:31.217
 Guilty of converting our will. 

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:37.216
 In a triangle, triangle, triangle. 

00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:40.192
 Our love 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.348
 I am in the middle of a triangle. 

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:10.089
 Without solution or even justification. 

00:02:11.134 --> 00:02:16.607
 I fell in love when I saw her for the first time. 

00:02:18.142 --> 00:02:22.024
 Knowing it is impossible 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.743
 Also in the middle of a triangle. 

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:36.256
 She stayed because I shivered as I did. 

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:41.629
 He compromised his heart and never thought. 

00:02:43.387 --> 00:02:45.892
 That belonging to another. 

00:02:46.691 --> 00:02:49.044
 Put your eyes on me. 

00:02:50.164 --> 00:02:52.405
 That would make us. 

00:02:53.523 --> 00:02:57.709
 Guilty of converting our will. 

00:02:58.394 --> 00:03:04.076
 In a triangle, triangle, triangle. 

00:03:04.771 --> 00:03:06.756
 Our love 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.924
 Triangle, triangle. 

00:03:11.755 --> 00:03:13.653
 Our love
