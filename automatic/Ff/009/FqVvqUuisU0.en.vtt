00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.790 
we got our how much it cost but uh I
don't<00:03:29.630> think<00:03:29.840> there<00:03:30.080> were<00:03:30.170> as<00:03:30.260> much<00:03:30.410> as<00:03:30.650> like

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
don't think there were as much as like

smart ones pizzas and stunning every

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.620 
smart ones pizzas and stunning every
cheaper<00:03:34.400> than<00:03:34.520> that<00:03:34.670> but<00:03:35.030> any<00:03:35.330> get<00:03:35.480> two<00:03:35.600> of

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
cheaper than that but any get two of

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
cheaper than that but any get two of
them<00:03:35.870> um<00:03:37.210> so<00:03:38.210> that's<00:03:38.330> a<00:03:38.720> pretty<00:03:38.840> good<00:03:39.050> deal<00:03:39.200> for

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
them um so that's a pretty good deal for

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.180 
them um so that's a pretty good deal for
what<00:03:39.800> you<00:03:39.950> get<00:03:40.990> when<00:03:41.990> I<00:03:42.050> get<00:03:42.140> these<00:03:42.320> again<00:03:42.620> I'd

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
what you get when I get these again I'd

get<00:03:43.400> these<00:03:43.550> again<00:03:43.730> they're<00:03:44.000> really<00:03:44.480> good

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
get these again they're really good

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.010 
get these again they're really good
flavor<00:03:44.950> -<00:03:45.950> I'd<00:03:46.070> probably<00:03:46.310> go<00:03:46.720> maybe<00:03:47.720> ten

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
flavor - I'd probably go maybe ten

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.900 
flavor - I'd probably go maybe ten
seconds<00:03:48.350> less<00:03:48.530> on<00:03:48.710> my<00:03:48.830> microwave<00:03:49.220> every

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
seconds less on my microwave every

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.010 
seconds less on my microwave every
microwave<00:03:50.240> is<00:03:50.330> somewhat<00:03:50.570> different<00:03:50.930> it's

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
microwave is somewhat different it's

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.380 
microwave is somewhat different it's
hard<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.320> judge<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.880> scale<00:03:52.880> so<00:03:53.150> I'd<00:03:53.240> probably

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
hard to judge the scale so I'd probably

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
hard to judge the scale so I'd probably
go<00:03:53.690> like<00:03:54.170> two<00:03:54.380> forty<00:03:54.740> five<00:03:54.890> instead<00:03:55.430> of<00:03:55.490> three

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
go like two forty five instead of three

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.020 
go like two forty five instead of three
just<00:03:57.410> just<00:03:57.950> kind<00:03:58.100> of<00:03:58.220> soften<00:03:58.550> up<00:03:58.640> that<00:03:58.670> cheese

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
just just kind of soften up that cheese

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.410 
just just kind of soften up that cheese
a<00:03:59.060> little<00:03:59.420> bit<00:03:59.570> but<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.260> it's<00:04:00.410> not<00:04:00.560> bad<00:04:01.150> so<00:04:02.150> I'd

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
a little bit but and it's not bad so I'd

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.090 
a little bit but and it's not bad so I'd
give<00:04:02.570> this<00:04:02.690> one<00:04:02.840> a<00:04:02.900> good<00:04:03.110> solid<00:04:03.350> four<00:04:03.710> it's<00:04:03.980> not

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
give this one a good solid four it's not

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.500
