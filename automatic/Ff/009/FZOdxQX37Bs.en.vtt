00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.450
 hello classmates how is it in suite 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.849
 let's see the last rifle of 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.890
 sniper that we have in the game of 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.350
 battlefield 3 and it's nothing more or nothing 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.750
 less than the m4 17 that weapon that 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.260
 we will have to unblock before to 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.330
 have access to the mission of jn g90 that 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.189
 it was the last sniper rifle that 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.750
 we had seen so far and good 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.910
 you can see it in the description or in 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.460
 video response remember that these two 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.010
 rifles are part of the lcd close 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.050
 quarters and that for this you will have to 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.899
 have access to this tlc is not necessary 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.030
 be premium to have access to weapons 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.129
 specific is good but let's go there 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.640
 the first thing that catches our attention 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.980
 this m4 17 is the resemblance to the m4 16 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.870
 the assault rifle not the truth is that 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.160
 I the first time I saw him master 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.379
 Ermelo thought it was a rifle 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.270
 fully automatic and I took a 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.940
 pleasant surprise to see that it was 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.949
 sniper because this 417 me is like 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.150
 a fusion of the best aspects of 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.370
 the other reflections 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.370
 For example, collect the size of the 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.340
 charger of ls ks 21 bullets has a 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.010
 cadence of 295 bullets per minute one of 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.800
 the highest ones have a damage equal to 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.430
 those who have more like the m 39 the mk 11 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.230
 or sv 50% damage up to 15 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.080
 meters is to say a shot to the head and 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.930
 will be dead or going down little by little 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.730
 up to 37 with 5% from 75 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.370
 meters which means pretty much 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.290
 from 45 to 50 meters it will take 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.020
 two shots to the head to kill the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.119
 enemy and if it was not enough copy the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.840
 load time lower than there was that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.210
 it was the one of the nk 11 with 180 seconds if 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.890
 we have bullets in the charger and with 2 with 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.750
 40 if we have it completely empty 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.300
 we have to put the bullet in the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.760
 bedroom to have those 21 bullets in the 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.880
 charger a mix of the best of each 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.680
 house gives much superiority to the rest and 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.750
 here none exceeds it in aspects 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.670
 essentials like the damage in the recharge and 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.160
 if that were not enough, it turns out that it is the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.320
 rifle with better metal measurement 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.480
 set of semiautomatics with which 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.990
 It's perfect to go in the front line 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.910
 help 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.130
 of the partners with radio headlights or 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.050
 tubes although of course we can also 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.060
 use the entire list of measures that 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.460
 we can unlock to adapt our 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.500
 way of game to what we need the 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.740
 truth is that either a reflection one 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.900
 cobra be one or a peephole to 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.280
 I take for example from the eight-fold 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.260
 what are you seeing now for long 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.820
 distances this rifle is an authentic 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.950
 last the truth is that I was 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.690
 using little but how little I have 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.970
 I've enjoyed it and I always 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.060
 has given many and good results 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.190
 to play with the m4 17 is just 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.530
 we must do the mission player of 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.600
 team that is to capture 20 flags 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.030
 voucher of domination conquest of 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.680
 conquer and do 10 assists with the 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.680
 tour the motion sensor
