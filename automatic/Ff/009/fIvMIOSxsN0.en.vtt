out<00:04:38.150> in<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.330> favor<00:04:38.539> I<00:04:39.400> was<00:04:40.400> actually<00:04:40.520> thinking

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
out in a favor I was actually thinking

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.180 
out in a favor I was actually thinking
wow<00:04:41.570> that<00:04:41.870> platform<00:04:42.169> is<00:04:42.500> going<00:04:42.680> perfect<00:04:43.070> for

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
wow that platform is going perfect for

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.580 
wow that platform is going perfect for
an<00:04:43.280> up<00:04:43.370> smash<00:04:43.640> I<00:04:43.880> was<00:04:44.030> like<00:04:44.150> if<00:04:44.300> you<00:04:44.870> Sam<00:04:45.349> with

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
an up smash I was like if you Sam with

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.149 
an up smash I was like if you Sam with
something<00:04:46.070> he's<00:04:46.280> in<00:04:46.430> there<00:04:46.640> woohoo<00:04:47.950> he<00:04:48.950> came

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159 
something he's in there woohoo he came

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:50.589 
something he's in there woohoo he came
over<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:49.520> top<00:04:49.700> of<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:49.880> chart<00:04:50.150> shot<00:04:50.360> with<00:04:50.479> an

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
over the top of the chart shot with an

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:54.279 
over the top of the chart shot with an
air<00:04:50.750> but<00:04:51.020> uh<00:04:51.050> two<00:04:51.860> loaves<00:04:52.070> percent<00:04:52.640> I<00:04:53.229> think<00:04:54.229> he

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
air but uh two loaves percent I think he

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.180 
air but uh two loaves percent I think he
missed<00:04:54.470> an<00:04:54.590> l<00:04:54.710> cancel<00:04:55.099> it<00:04:55.220> oh<00:04:55.450> I<00:04:56.979> gotta<00:04:57.979> think

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
missed an l cancel it oh I gotta think

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.770 
missed an l cancel it oh I gotta think
he<00:04:58.340> actually<00:04:58.490> did<00:04:58.760> that<00:04:58.909> on<00:04:59.030> purpose<00:04:59.060> to<00:04:59.539> like

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
he actually did that on purpose to like

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.200 
he actually did that on purpose to like
maybe<00:05:00.470> pre-empting<00:05:01.130> a<00:05:01.250> jump<00:05:01.880> out<00:05:02.000> I'm

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
maybe pre-empting a jump out I'm

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.730 
maybe pre-empting a jump out I'm
probably<00:05:02.479> thinking<00:05:02.840> too<00:05:02.930> hard<00:05:03.080> about<00:05:03.229> this<00:05:03.530> it

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
probably thinking too hard about this it

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.350 
probably thinking too hard about this it
didn't<00:05:04.010> look<00:05:04.099> too<00:05:04.280> bad<00:05:04.400> until<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.820> fast<00:05:05.120> fell

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
didn't look too bad until the fast fell

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.240 
didn't look too bad until the fast fell
to<00:05:05.479> air<00:05:05.630> dodge<00:05:05.840> right<00:05:06.380> and<00:05:06.560> even<00:05:06.620> then<00:05:06.979> it<00:05:07.130> was

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
to air dodge right and even then it was

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.279 
to air dodge right and even then it was
just<00:05:07.280> just<00:05:08.210> so<00:05:08.330> i<00:05:08.360> have<00:05:08.390> not<00:05:08.750> behind<00:05:09.080> though
