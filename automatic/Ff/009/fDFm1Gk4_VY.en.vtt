ever since so when I bought this boat
that's<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.739> reason<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.069> bought<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.280> cuz<00:03:59.579> it<00:03:59.700> was

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
that's a reason I bought it cuz it was

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.930 
that's a reason I bought it cuz it was
aluminum<00:04:00.530> paid<00:04:01.530> 2<00:04:01.739> grand<00:04:01.769> for<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.370> in<00:04:02.609> 2004<00:04:03.600> you

aluminum paid 2 grand for it in 2004 you

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.130 
aluminum paid 2 grand for it in 2004 you
know<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:06.000> wouldn't<00:04:06.450> let<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.600> go<00:04:06.750> for<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:06.989> right

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
know I wouldn't let it go for that right

know I wouldn't let it go for that right
now<00:04:07.170> just<00:04:07.650> for<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.859> simple<00:04:08.100> fact<00:04:08.160> that<00:04:08.400> I

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
now just for the simple fact that I

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.970 
now just for the simple fact that I
couldn't<00:04:09.209> replace<00:04:09.450> it<00:04:09.630> for<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.900> there's<00:04:10.799> no
