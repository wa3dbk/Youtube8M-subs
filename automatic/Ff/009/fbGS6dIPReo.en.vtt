00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
obviously it's a Danish league but it is

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.270

the top Danish league it's not like a
random<00:01:44.579> lower<00:01:44.939> league<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:45.990> seems

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
random lower league and it just seems

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.539 
random lower league and it just seems
crazy<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.590> me<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.979> player<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.250> play

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
crazy to me that a player can play

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.880 
crazy to me that a player can play
strike<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> striker<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.659> then<00:01:48.899> go<00:01:49.049> left<00:01:49.590> back

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
and then play incredibly at left-back

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.870 
and then play incredibly at left-back
and<00:01:52.439> then<00:01:52.530> go<00:01:52.680> back<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.890> striker<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.640> just

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
unbelievable my ad then he went to a

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.780 
unbelievable my ad then he went to a
left-wing<00:02:16.620> back<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.040> then<00:02:17.190> he<00:02:17.280> moved<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.550> left

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
left-wing back and then he moved to left

mid now you see in Brazil left backs and

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.800 
mid now you see in Brazil left backs and
left<00:02:20.130> wing<00:02:20.340> backs<00:02:20.520> basically<00:02:21.090> our<00:02:21.239> left<00:02:21.540> mids

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
left wing backs basically our left mids

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
this season and they had a game where

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.050 
this season and they had a game where
their<00:02:55.620> goalie<00:02:55.890> got<00:02:56.130> sent<00:02:56.400> off<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:56.970> the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
their goalie got sent off and in the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.850 
their goalie got sent off and in the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
process he gave away a penalty now i

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.650

believe<00:02:59.250> they'd<00:02:59.549> used<00:02:59.760> all<00:02:59.970> free<00:03:00.209> subs<00:03:00.480> or

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
believe they'd used all free subs or

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.940 
believe they'd used all free subs or
they<00:03:00.840> didn't<00:03:01.110> have<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.230> goalie<00:03:01.500> on<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.739> bench

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
they didn't have a goalie on the bench

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.460 
they didn't have a goalie on the bench
