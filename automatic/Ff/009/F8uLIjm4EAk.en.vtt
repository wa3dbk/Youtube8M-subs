00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.429 
we'll go try and find mark a big one
mark<00:04:02.220> where<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.459> let<00:04:02.609> this<00:04:02.790> go<00:04:03.200> what's<00:04:04.200> when<00:04:04.409> a

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
mark where to let this go what's when a

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:05.720 
mark where to let this go what's when a
little<00:04:04.709> bit<00:04:04.829> nicer<00:04:04.980> he's<00:04:05.340> already<00:04:05.519> taken

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
little bit nicer he's already taken

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.990 
little bit nicer he's already taken
better<00:04:06.629> than<00:04:06.870> this<00:04:07.019> so<00:04:07.319> how<00:04:08.159> the<00:04:08.220> same<00:04:08.519> idea<00:04:08.939> I

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
better than this so how the same idea I

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.080 
better than this so how the same idea I
guess<00:04:09.950> it's<00:04:10.950> hard<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.250> say<00:04:11.400> better<00:04:11.670> his<00:04:11.909> was<00:04:12.060> a

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
guess it's hard to say better his was a

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.759 
guess it's hard to say better his was a
little<00:04:12.390> bit<00:04:12.510> bigger<00:04:12.720> than<00:04:12.930> this<00:04:13.079> the<00:04:13.500> first

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
little bit bigger than this the first

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.550 
little bit bigger than this the first
one<00:04:13.950> he<00:04:14.099> took<00:04:14.310> but<00:04:14.549> it<00:04:15.239> was<00:04:15.389> broken<00:04:15.659> with<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:15.930> g3

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
one he took but it was broken with a g3

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.770 
one he took but it was broken with a g3
it's<00:04:17.519> kind<00:04:17.669> of<00:04:17.789> cool<00:04:18.000> this<00:04:18.180> is<00:04:18.239> broken<00:04:18.690> with

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
it's kind of cool this is broken with

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.890 
it's kind of cool this is broken with
g4s<00:04:20.690> makes<00:04:21.690> it<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:21.900> bit<00:04:22.079> of<00:04:22.199> character<00:04:23.900> good

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
g4s makes it a bit of character good

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.260 
g4s makes it a bit of character good
show<00:04:25.110> try<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:25.830> get<00:04:25.949> märklin<00:04:26.400> now<00:04:26.580> hopefully
