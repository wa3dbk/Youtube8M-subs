00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.430
 in the framework of the European project 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.860
 social fund creation 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.350
 interdisciplinary research team for 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.290
 sustainable development 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.960
 Ozersk Copper Institute 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.230
 ecology before graduating from university 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.730
 collaboration with the faculty 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.950
 geography and soil science 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.930
 Latvian University 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.480
 doing some research on 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.170
 some lakes in latvia as stated in 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.350
 official position results 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.950
 project to assess the quality of its environment 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.150
 determining factors especially in 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.070
 specific changing socially 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.190
 economic conditions will have 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.470
 great value with environmental and 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.400
 environmental point of view in 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.940
 context of sustainable development 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.600
 Latvian state 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.390
 But first things first 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.350
 we have 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.410
 I have in Latvia, but how to find out especially 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.140
 latgale department a lot 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.870
 they are all very different 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.400
 hey di if of all these many lakes there 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.690
 lake which are 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.980
 priority priority ie 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.120
 lakes which are especially clean in 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.010
 which 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.020
 are held 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.140
 especially valuable fish species include 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.520
 salmon squad 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.220
 that is, but for example, such as edge 4 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.350
 the project provides 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.220
 study this group look around 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.850
 payments 26 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.840
 and every year valuable fish 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.170
 possess them getting smaller 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.369
 the task of scientists to find out what it is 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.540
 connected and how can you prevent them 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.580
 disappearances one of the main points 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.280
 research has become the second largest 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.570
 lake latvia different so the main task 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.899
 project participants to identify which 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.789
 changes occur in this system 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.670
 pond understand why this is happening and what 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.280
 will be next season 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.990
 the project's task is to develop 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.690
 practical recommendations 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.630
 that is, in India, not only is it scientifically 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.760
 novelty and some kind of discovery but 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.190
 necessarily as a result and 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.460
 practical recommendations for those 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.580
 who is engaged in the economy of these particular 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.550
 lakes for example although it may be 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.770
 recommendations there 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.500
 trash didn't get it naturally no 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.070
 of course yes percent after 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.039
 we cannot say anything as a basis 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.489
 it is about us and prices and interested 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:09.459
 took out very often the fish here and count 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.699
 stocking 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.149
 yes, that is, what kind of fish to let 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:14.589
 start up because very often we 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:16.399
 We meet with the fact that 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.749
 people having money there are buying let's say 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:20.679
 fish in fish fry release 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.709
 here is their wear and tear for the result of zero because 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.399
 that the fish die because 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:27.839
 but it was not necessary that the fish in this 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.249
 and at this time of year let's say hare pressure 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.950
 country systems yes yes yes of course yes yes yes 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.879
 here all the same need as though 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.959
 each orphan its approach within 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.579
 project scientists take water samples and samples 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.499
 ground from different depths is done 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:43.379
 chemical and biological 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.470
 organisms analyzes 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.250
 still being conducted sonar 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.520
 shooting when you can measure and count 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.400
 all the fish that are found here and 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.430
 much more 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.010
 thus the project participants 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.130
 can determine almost all 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.359
 reservoir parameters 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.599
 down to his health 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.619
 inhabitants 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:02.959
 partners in this project are 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.789
 here is whiskey university 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:06.619
 the graphic faculty leader is exactly 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.729
 there is a chemical lab because 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:09.909
 that he their essence of our research 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.809
 complex that is in this project on 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:14.599
 involved 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.260
 family biologists ty physics mathematics 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.889
 because it is envisaged 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.290
 also who seriously modeling a number 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.919
 processes occurring carry 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.099
 this is very i very complex 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.549
 approaches worth noting that 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.819
 research from infection chief 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:30.620
 regional university 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.449
 doing not the first year 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:34.809
 and certain conclusions about the state of local 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:37.349
 ecosystems have already been made 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.859
 he could compared with May 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.639
 from the beginning of 90 x to the beginning of 90 when we 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.649
 started working here 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:46.889
 general water quality improved 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.359
 I think that as if this is the reason for the reason 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.239
 really obvious 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.629
 in the south were agriculture probably not 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.629
 very good up farming 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.629
 I, too, live beautifully told surrendered 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.119
 new standard yes 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:02.349
 all taxi firms are closed 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.279
 that's about bankrupt food percentage all 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:07.359
 collective farm, too, in general, then he is probably young 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.439
 bad but for this particular lake i 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.680
 I think it was good 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.800
 today is different national park 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.770
 although this does not mean that it can not be kept 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.440
 no economic 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.669
 activities 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.499
 just need to take into account a number of restrictions 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:19.939
 do no harm 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:21.979
 Latgale's largest reservoir here for 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.810
 This is also necessary and the recommendations of scientists 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.599
 which it is planned to compile 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.020
 the end of the project it is important to note that in 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.240
 research is not only involved 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.099
 employees of scientific laboratories and 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.569
 professors but also simple students for 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.550
 them this is a great opportunity to get 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.870
 practical work experience 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.370
 I have declined but before me it's great 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.879
 perspective opportunity 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.779
 participate in a science project when 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:45.960
 backyard crisis and little is happening 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.590
 and here I can work to carry out 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.370
 research promising in my specialty 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.610
 the Serbs in the press and the courses of the alleys of the garden we are very 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.500
 glad we have the opportunity 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.819
 cooperation issue 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.210
 university have projects have money 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.580
 on research on engaging our 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.960
 young scientists this and future bachelors and 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.139
 laboratory assistants who research chemical 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.069
 the composition of the water in the lake, our ideologists 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.309
 bachelors and masters 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:11.909
 Partly this project can be considered 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:13.639
 international since the investigation 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.429
 participating researcher 

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:17.309
 Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Belarus 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:18.520
 Vasilevich Novitsky 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.800
 he does research 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.250
 certain groups of animals and 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.300
 electronic crustaceans before that 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.650
 he studied them on 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.270
 the territories of Belarus and Russia are now 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.539
 work with us so you can compare how 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.779
 offense develops in different regions 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:33.599
 they have penetrated everywhere 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:34.680
 glaciation 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.389
 it's about 40 50 thousand years ago 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.389
 and dad who said that the position 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.029
 he slowly entered they settled somewhere 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:47.860
 from north to northeast russia our 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.490
 in our region 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.360
 and its prices 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.030
 in such good big in beautiful 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.889
 which earlier 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:57.689
 it creates a food base for 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:59.199
 a certain kind 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.979
 it is natural that as soon as they arrived 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:02.900
 will there be any changes then 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.009
 immediately affect the other inhabitants 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:05.610
 various 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.240
 so it is important not only to define in 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.120
 what state is the lake now but 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.110
 understand what will happen to him next and how 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.780
 a person can affect these 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.770
 the processes 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.220
 local rub bolla based on that 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.309
 whose rotor was there 30 40 years ago 

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:23.020
 but I myself old some data 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.119
 so we will compare 

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:27.719
 the density of these animals n 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:30.009
 spread their behavior 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.559
 breeding features gaps in 

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:35.309
 biological cycles can also talk about 

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:37.799
 that well, how to predict what 

00:06:37.799 --> 00:06:40.249
 will be further but also sufficiency 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:42.549
 capital without injury is very good 

00:06:42.549 --> 00:06:44.729
 start for further research within 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:46.799
 project we will have to prepare 

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:49.259
 research papers so this is an opportunity 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.509
 develop as part of a scientist 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:54.119
 the total cost of the project is over 720 thousand 

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:56.110
 lats and 85 percent of financing 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.759
 provided European 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:58.750
 social fund 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.690
 15 percent co-financing 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.120
 state deadline 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.240
 project until the thirtieth of november 2012
