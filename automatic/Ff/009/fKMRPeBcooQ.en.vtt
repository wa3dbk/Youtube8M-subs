eyes<00:04:03.400> are<00:04:03.610> playing<00:04:03.760> black<00:04:04.120> here<00:04:04.450> because<00:04:04.660> I

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
eyes are playing black here because I

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.030 
eyes are playing black here because I
like<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:04.959> be<00:04:05.170> safe<00:04:05.440> yeah<00:04:06.040> well<00:04:07.860> one<00:04:08.860> of<00:04:08.980> the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
like to be safe yeah well one of the

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.650 
like to be safe yeah well one of the
things<00:04:09.100> that<00:04:09.490> we've<00:04:09.640> learned<00:04:09.670> from<00:04:10.030> this<00:04:10.390> one

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
things that we've learned from this one

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.530 
things that we've learned from this one
I<00:04:10.690> think<00:04:10.840> is<00:04:11.200> that<00:04:11.260> when<00:04:11.560> you<00:04:11.680> see<00:04:11.950> this

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
I think is that when you see this

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.270 
I think is that when you see this
raccoon<00:04:13.540> formation<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:14.590> shouldn't<00:04:14.980> start

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
raccoon formation you shouldn't start

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.890 
raccoon formation you shouldn't start
sacking<00:04:15.850> a<00:04:15.940> bunch<00:04:16.120> of<00:04:16.239> pieces<00:04:16.419> because

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
sacking a bunch of pieces because

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.690 
sacking a bunch of pieces because
there's<00:04:17.079> really<00:04:17.320> nothing<00:04:17.739> not<00:04:17.859> much<00:04:18.100> that<00:04:18.519> you

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
there's really nothing not much that you

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.020 
there's really nothing not much that you
can<00:04:18.880> do<00:04:19.060> once<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:20.200> set<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.680> pieces<00:04:21.100> so<00:04:21.730> I

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
can do once you set the pieces so I

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.850 
can do once you set the pieces so I
think<00:04:22.270> that<00:04:22.630> might<00:04:22.810> be<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:23.020> good<00:04:23.110> lesson<00:04:23.470> for

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
think that might be a good lesson for

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.100 
think that might be a good lesson for
you<00:04:23.980> just<00:04:24.220> for<00:04:24.280> right<00:04:24.550> now<00:04:24.610> right<00:04:25.450> so<00:04:25.900> don't

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
you just for right now right so don't

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.310 
you just for right now right so don't
just<00:04:26.380> try<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.680> black<00:04:27.669> pieces<00:04:28.060> right<00:04:28.840> because

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
just try to black pieces right because

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.409 
just try to black pieces right because
here's<00:04:29.740> another<00:04:29.980> possible<00:04:30.669> sack<00:04:31.030> you<00:04:31.240> could

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
here's another possible sack you could

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.030 
here's another possible sack you could
have<00:04:31.540> done<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:32.139> it<00:04:32.410> doesn't<00:04:32.770> work<00:04:32.889> either

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
have done and it doesn't work either

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.060 
have done and it doesn't work either
that's<00:04:33.430> this<00:04:33.930> right<00:04:37.230> right<00:04:38.230> that's<00:04:38.560> not<00:04:38.680> good

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
that's this right right that's not good

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.430 
that's this right right that's not good
either<00:04:39.100> i've<00:04:39.700> done<00:04:39.940> that<00:04:39.970> before<00:04:40.630> noon<00:04:40.960> and

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
either i've done that before noon and

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.250 
either i've done that before noon and
and<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.190> then<00:04:42.610> by<00:04:42.970> both<00:04:43.240> you<00:04:43.480> could<00:04:43.720> maybe

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
and and then by both you could maybe

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.240 
and and then by both you could maybe
you're<00:04:44.470> thinking<00:04:44.650> you<00:04:44.919> could<00:04:45.130> come<00:04:45.370> here<00:04:45.960> but

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
you're thinking you could come here but

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.470 
you're thinking you could come here but
thinking<00:04:48.250> that<00:04:48.400> maybe<00:04:48.610> you<00:04:48.790> can<00:04:49.000> take<00:04:49.240> this

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
thinking that maybe you can take this

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.500 
thinking that maybe you can take this
right<00:04:49.810> right<00:04:50.800> but<00:04:51.580> if<00:04:51.790> you<00:04:51.970> think<00:04:52.000> about<00:04:52.330> it

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
right right but if you think about it

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.719 
right right but if you think about it
