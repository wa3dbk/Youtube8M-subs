00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.750
 plus 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.460
 the first memories are like touching 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.990
 in the piece inventing that touches the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.050
 in front of a giant public I have as a 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.810
 complex of style because boy is like 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.640
 I grieve five years or six years when I 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.130
 I started as a composer really do 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.630
 music to you very boy I'm from the south of 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.210
 bar port and I started there as in the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.640
 scene of funk rock and hardcore a 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.140
 play music as a vocalist and then 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.760
 had a series of different bands 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.070
 styles the pretty music compound 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.670
 for images I made two bands 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.019
 programs for the next cable programs 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.320
 participate with music in a movie 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.760
 called root that director matÃ­as red and 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.320
 We are in talks for new 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.300
 projects nowadays also this what 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.399
 I do together with arturo 6 ex of studies 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.660
 triana there are some parallels in a project 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.489
 that I lead in an effort 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.070
 collaborative music where 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.140
 I compose songs invited to collaborate 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.820
 other artists of first instance 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.290
 collaborative is precisely the permission 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.649
 of the journalists who just left 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.780
 by quemasucabeza with a pp of remixes 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.840
 I have a simple call Monte Calvario 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.939
 that is available my soundcloud would be 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.429
 I work as a DJ in different bars of 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.150
 santiago and I also compose together vertu 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.220
 the axes music for images 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.350
 my biggest concern today is 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.980
 move forward this band really 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.140
 they wanted to play sometimes just what I know is 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.840
 really a band more than a character 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.930
 dj and the parallels is a band has 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.880
 that pretension and is my project more 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.440
 important at this moment I am more 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.690
 close to the world of pop and song 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.430
 that the world of delay really 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.470
 I do not even know many nationals but 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.930
 I have loved the phenomenon with the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.310
 format Jarre mix remix 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.260
 collaborate with other artists that is 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.300
 there I want to mean a little bit that axis 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.270
 that connection that is there between the world 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.000
 of the song between the goodness of pop and 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.510
 Chilean rock with these dynamics 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.890
 of the mic sing of the buttons auto ruidito 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.890
 everything is that I love 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.550
 no longer 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.800
 face 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.060
 here 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.140
 what should 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.499
 what 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.290
 I do not stop 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.810
 at home 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.800
