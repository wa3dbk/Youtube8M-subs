the outside of the plate if you know
what<00:01:57.290> I<00:01:57.350> mean<00:01:58.360> so<00:01:59.360> you<00:01:59.480> just<00:01:59.630> turn<00:01:59.810> it<00:01:59.870> over<00:02:00.080> and

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
what I mean so you just turn it over and

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.500 
what I mean so you just turn it over and
start<00:02:00.440> rolling<00:02:00.980> it<00:02:01.130> I<00:02:01.400> guess<00:02:02.180> if<00:02:02.300> you<00:02:02.360> have<00:02:02.450> a

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
start rolling it I guess if you have a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.030 
start rolling it I guess if you have a
colored<00:02:02.840> paper<00:02:03.020> plate<00:02:03.290> like<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.470> pink<00:02:03.710> one<00:02:03.830> or<00:02:04.010> a

colored paper plate like a pink one or a

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.010 
colored paper plate like a pink one or a
red<00:02:04.190> one<00:02:04.400> it<00:02:04.880> would<00:02:05.030> end<00:02:05.180> up<00:02:05.270> with<00:02:05.450> this<00:02:05.570> red

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
red one it would end up with this red

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.440 
red one it would end up with this red
rose<00:02:06.260> or<00:02:06.620> a<00:02:06.650> pink<00:02:07.370> rose<00:02:07.610> just<00:02:08.000> depending<00:02:08.390> on

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.170 
to make sure you get the right side shot
showing<00:02:11.900> it<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.460> can<00:02:13.790> see<00:02:13.970> how<00:02:14.150> I

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
showing it to you so you can see how I

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.980 
showing it to you so you can see how I
rolling<00:02:14.570> this<00:02:14.690> now<00:02:16.270> so<00:02:17.270> I'm<00:02:17.420> holding<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.810> top

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
rolling this now so I'm holding the top

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.790 
rolling this now so I'm holding the top
on<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.200> bottom<00:02:18.320> just<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.770> keep<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.580> straight

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
on the bottom just to keep it straight

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.020 
on the bottom just to keep it straight
this<00:02:23.710> just<00:02:24.710> keep<00:02:24.920> rolling<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.460> and<00:02:25.700> then<00:02:25.820> once

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
this just keep rolling it and then once

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.990 
this just keep rolling it and then once
you<00:02:26.180> get<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.570> end<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:28.280> loosen<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:28.880> off<00:02:28.970> a

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
you get to the end we loosen it off a

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.550 
you get to the end we loosen it off a
bit<00:02:29.330> because<00:02:29.420> it's<00:02:29.600> quite<00:02:29.780> tight<00:02:30.050> now<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.320> can

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
bit because it's quite tight now you can

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.530 
bit because it's quite tight now you can
see<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.890> spiral<00:02:31.190> is<00:02:31.340> quite<00:02:31.550> tight<00:02:33.880> so<00:02:34.880> what<00:02:35.510> I

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
see the spiral is quite tight so what I

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.740 
see the spiral is quite tight so what I
tend<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.960> use<00:02:36.910> previously<00:02:37.910> I've<00:02:38.090> used<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.540> hot

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
tend to use previously I've used a hot

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.440 
tend to use previously I've used a hot
glue<00:02:39.020> gun<00:02:39.110> at<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.830> end<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.130> this<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:41.150> glue<00:02:41.330> it

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
glue gun at the end of this to glue it

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.820 
glue gun at the end of this to glue it
all<00:02:41.570> together<00:02:41.690> another<00:02:42.290> way<00:02:42.470> of<00:02:42.560> doing<00:02:42.770> that

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
all together another way of doing that

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.949 
all together another way of doing that
if<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.040> don't<00:02:43.160> have<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.370> hot<00:02:43.580> glue<00:02:43.790> gun<00:02:43.820> its<00:02:44.750> use

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
if you don't have a hot glue gun its use

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.380 
if you don't have a hot glue gun its use
a<00:02:44.989> stapler<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.860> will<00:02:46.640> show<00:02:46.790> you<00:02:46.850> how<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:46.970> do<00:02:47.180> that

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
a stapler I will show you how to do that

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.490 
a stapler I will show you how to do that
now<00:02:47.600> so<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:48.410> loosen<00:02:48.890> off<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.040> bit<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:51.080> take<00:02:51.350> you

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
now so you loosen off a bit you take you

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.180 
now so you loosen off a bit you take you
push<00:02:51.770> through<00:02:51.980> from<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.520> bottom<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.650> first

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
push through from the bottom the first

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.800 
push through from the bottom the first
bit<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.400> started<00:02:56.000> with<00:02:56.030> that's<00:02:56.690> the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
this is made from one paper plane here

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.680 
this is made from one paper plane here
so<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.489> rows<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:43.910> then<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.120> two<00:03:44.299> daffodil

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
so the rows and then the two daffodil

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.809 
so the rows and then the two daffodil
type<00:03:44.959> flowers<00:03:45.410> okay<00:03:45.860> I<00:03:46.069> shall<00:03:46.370> show<00:03:46.549> you<00:03:46.580> how

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
type flowers okay I shall show you how

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:47.589 
type flowers okay I shall show you how
to<00:03:46.879> do<00:03:47.030> that<00:03:47.180> man

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
to do that man

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.360 
to do that man
you<00:03:47.989> like<00:03:48.170> you<00:03:48.379> know<00:03:48.500> how<00:03:48.650> I<00:03:48.680> don't<00:03:48.920> like<00:03:49.069> waste

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
you like you know how I don't like waste

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.360 
you like you know how I don't like waste
much<00:03:49.610> I'm<00:03:49.940> sorry<00:03:50.480> I'm<00:03:50.810> losing<00:03:51.560> my<00:03:51.950> way<00:03:52.129> not

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
much I'm sorry I'm losing my way not

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.039 
much I'm sorry I'm losing my way not
throwing<00:03:52.700> it<00:03:52.849> away<00:03:52.910> isn't<00:03:53.120> it<00:03:53.269> so<00:03:53.690> you<00:03:53.750> take

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
throwing it away isn't it so you take

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.970 
throwing it away isn't it so you take
your<00:03:54.400> paper<00:03:55.400> plate<00:03:55.670> edge<00:03:56.330> cut<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.440> in<00:03:57.530> half<00:03:57.709> so

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
your paper plate edge cut it in half so

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.890 
your paper plate edge cut it in half so
then<00:03:58.099> you've<00:03:58.220> got<00:03:58.340> two<00:03:58.970> pieces<00:03:59.390> to<00:03:59.510> play<00:03:59.660> with

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
then you've got two pieces to play with

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.080 
then you've got two pieces to play with
and<00:04:00.140> then<00:04:00.709> what<00:04:00.829> you<00:04:00.920> start<00:04:01.220> doing<00:04:01.640> is<00:04:01.790> just

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
and then what you start doing is just

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.720 
and then what you start doing is just
cutting<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:03.290> frill<00:04:03.620> around<00:04:03.799> the<00:04:04.160> edge<00:04:04.280> so<00:04:04.310> you

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
cutting the frill around the edge so you

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.759 
cutting the frill around the edge so you
just<00:04:05.000> go<00:04:05.239> down<00:04:05.450> with<00:04:05.599> the<00:04:05.720> scissors<00:04:06.079> that

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
just go down with the scissors that

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.559 
just go down with the scissors that
little<00:04:07.099> let<00:04:07.310> me<00:04:07.400> out<00:04:07.489> energy<00:04:07.880> just<00:04:08.090> ran<00:04:08.329> to<00:04:08.480> the

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
little let me out energy just ran to the

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.960 
little let me out energy just ran to the
edge<00:04:08.720> so<00:04:09.170> many<00:04:09.380> your<00:04:10.250> paper<00:04:10.430> paper<00:04:10.640> I've<00:04:10.819> got

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
edge so many your paper paper I've got

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.390 
edge so many your paper paper I've got
my<00:04:11.090> nice<00:04:11.239> pattern<00:04:11.660> inside<00:04:12.110> and<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:13.129> can<00:04:13.250> still

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
my nice pattern inside and you can still

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.039 
my nice pattern inside and you can still
make<00:04:13.549> it<00:04:13.670> with<00:04:13.790> a<00:04:13.819> planer<00:04:14.150> one<00:04:14.480> just<00:04:14.750> when<00:04:14.930> it's

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
make it with a planer one just when it's

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.210 
make it with a planer one just when it's
smooth<00:04:15.290> just<00:04:15.620> you<00:04:15.799> just<00:04:15.920> have<00:04:16.010> a<00:04:16.100> different

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
smooth just you just have a different

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.190 
smooth just you just have a different
effect<00:04:16.669> as<00:04:16.850> well<00:04:17.090> so<00:04:17.269> I<00:04:17.329> think<00:04:17.450> it<00:04:17.660> works<00:04:17.959> in

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
effect as well so I think it works in

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.650 
effect as well so I think it works in
any<00:04:18.350> paper<00:04:18.590> plane<00:04:18.919> just<00:04:19.160> have<00:04:19.340> to<00:04:19.489> what<00:04:20.269> we've

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
any paper plane just have to what we've

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.290 
any paper plane just have to what we've
got<00:04:20.989> flour<00:04:21.799> with<00:04:22.160> your<00:04:22.190> Frankie<00:04:22.729> it's<00:04:22.910> very

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
got flour with your Frankie it's very

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.840 
got flour with your Frankie it's very
straightforward<00:04:24.110> and<00:04:24.440> make<00:04:24.950> different<00:04:25.490> yeah

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
straightforward and make different yeah

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.360 
straightforward and make different yeah
it's<00:04:26.780> a<00:04:26.870> revelation<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.650> me<00:04:27.740> to<00:04:27.889> be<00:04:28.010> honest<00:04:28.250> I

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
it's a revelation to me to be honest I

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.860 
it's a revelation to me to be honest I
thought<00:04:28.550> I'll<00:04:28.970> do<00:04:29.090> with<00:04:29.240> this<00:04:29.300> left<00:04:29.600> they<00:04:29.780> have

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
thought I'll do with this left they have

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.540 
thought I'll do with this left they have
a<00:04:29.900> piece<00:04:30.080> of<00:04:30.110> plate<00:04:30.500> I<00:04:30.620> can't<00:04:30.889> bear<00:04:31.160> it<00:04:31.190> let's

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
a piece of plate I can't bear it let's

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.060 
a piece of plate I can't bear it let's
see<00:04:31.700> when<00:04:32.060> you<00:04:32.150> roll<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:32.450> up<00:04:32.710> yeah<00:04:33.710> you<00:04:33.770> know

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
see when you roll it up yeah you know

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.310 
see when you roll it up yeah you know
what<00:04:34.250> I<00:04:34.280> really<00:04:34.580> like<00:04:34.760> is<00:04:35.030> it's<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.990> fact<00:04:36.229> that

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
what I really like is it's the fact that

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.040 
what I really like is it's the fact that
it<00:04:36.500> is<00:04:36.620> just<00:04:36.889> with<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.160> plain<00:04:37.370> white<00:04:38.050> slightly

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
it is just with the plain white slightly

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.129 
it is just with the plain white slightly
shiny<00:04:39.340> cardboard<00:04:40.340> I<00:04:40.669> like<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.750> idea<00:04:41.960> of<00:04:41.990> doing

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
shiny cardboard I like the idea of doing

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.810 
shiny cardboard I like the idea of doing
with<00:04:42.320> a<00:04:42.350> color<00:04:42.620> plate<00:04:42.919> but<00:04:43.160> that's<00:04:43.700> quite

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
with a color plate but that's quite

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.029 
with a color plate but that's quite
thick<00:04:44.150> and<00:04:44.380> maybe<00:04:45.380> bit<00:04:45.590> thinner<00:04:45.889> because

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
thick and maybe bit thinner because

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.100 
thick and maybe bit thinner because
we're<00:04:47.000> tight<00:04:47.210> of<00:04:47.419> the<00:04:47.510> other<00:04:47.690> end

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
we're tight of the other end

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.430 
we're tight of the other end
this<00:04:48.440> is<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.590> title<00:04:49.039> one<00:04:49.630> rolling<00:04:50.630> like<00:04:51.169> I<00:04:51.260> said

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
this is a title one rolling like I said

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.200 
this is a title one rolling like I said
you<00:04:51.560> can<00:04:51.680> also<00:04:51.800> do<00:04:51.979> the<00:04:52.070> notorious<00:04:52.639> rock<00:04:52.910> new

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
you can also do the notorious rock new

you can also do the notorious rock new
always<00:04:53.539> belfry<00:04:54.320> whole<00:04:54.680> line<00:04:54.919> here's<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.310> looser

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.159 
always belfry whole line here's a looser
one<00:04:55.849> and<00:04:56.060> I<00:04:56.120> think<00:04:56.180> it's<00:04:56.419> correct<00:04:56.599> you<00:04:57.020> know<00:04:57.110> to

one and I think it's correct you know to
have<00:04:57.320> looser<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.950> tighter<00:04:58.220> just<00:04:58.849> different

have looser and tighter just different

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.110 
have looser and tighter just different
effects<00:04:59.419> but<00:04:59.900> I<00:05:00.139> wasn't<00:05:00.919> happy<00:05:01.340> about<00:05:01.430> it

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
effects but I wasn't happy about it

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.500 
effects but I wasn't happy about it
anymore

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
anymore

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.659 
anymore
and<00:05:02.720> what<00:05:02.900> I<00:05:02.930> was<00:05:03.139> trying<00:05:03.410> to<00:05:03.560> say<00:05:03.800> when<00:05:04.400> I<00:05:04.430> was

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
and what I was trying to say when I was

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.850 
and what I was trying to say when I was
procrastinating<00:05:04.880> just<00:05:05.690> then<00:05:05.870> was<00:05:06.050> I<00:05:06.289> like<00:05:06.530> to

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
procrastinating just then was I like to

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.580 
procrastinating just then was I like to
roll<00:05:07.550> it<00:05:07.729> in<00:05:07.970> onto<00:05:08.450> the<00:05:08.570> shiny<00:05:08.810> so<00:05:09.289> that<00:05:09.440> when

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
roll it in onto the shiny so that when

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.930 
roll it in onto the shiny so that when
you<00:05:10.090> when<00:05:11.090> you<00:05:11.210> come<00:05:11.419> to<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.720> end<00:05:12.940> it's

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
you when you come to the end it's

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.600 
you when you come to the end it's
prettier<00:05:14.479> if<00:05:15.289> you<00:05:15.349> can<00:05:15.590> bend<00:05:15.800> these<00:05:15.919> back<00:05:16.250> and

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
prettier if you can bend these back and

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.190 
prettier if you can bend these back and
it's<00:05:16.880> all<00:05:17.060> nicely<00:05:17.270> shown<00:05:17.630> me<00:05:17.780> definitely

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
it's all nicely shown me definitely

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.110 
it's all nicely shown me definitely
again<00:05:18.830> if<00:05:18.919> you<00:05:19.010> had<00:05:19.130> a<00:05:19.160> coloured<00:05:19.490> plate<00:05:19.729> and

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
again if you had a coloured plate and

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.790 
again if you had a coloured plate and
have<00:05:20.419> the<00:05:20.510> shiny<00:05:20.750> on<00:05:20.930> the<00:05:21.020> inside<00:05:21.440> and<00:05:21.650> then

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
have the shiny on the inside and then

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.200 
have the shiny on the inside and then
when<00:05:21.919> you<00:05:22.010> fold<00:05:22.220> them<00:05:22.460> out<00:05:22.610> again<00:05:22.789> you'll

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
when you fold them out again you'll

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.510 
when you fold them out again you'll
you'd<00:05:23.690> have<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:23.930> colored<00:05:24.320> petals<00:05:24.830> showing

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
you'd have the colored petals showing

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.339 
you'd have the colored petals showing
out<00:05:25.639> when<00:05:25.820> you<00:05:26.030> do<00:05:26.539> so<00:05:26.870> now

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
out when you do so now

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.020 
out when you do so now
take<00:05:27.800> some<00:05:27.979> selfies<00:05:28.160> which<00:05:28.669> one<00:05:28.849> to<00:05:29.000> help<00:05:31.030> this

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
take some selfies which one to help this

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.159 
take some selfies which one to help this
was<00:05:32.150> quite<00:05:32.330> an<00:05:32.479> ether<00:05:32.720> that's<00:05:32.900> quite<00:05:33.050> easy

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
was quite an ether that's quite easy

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:34.690 
was quite an ether that's quite easy
actually<00:05:33.410> compared<00:05:33.860> to<00:05:34.010> the<00:05:34.099> stapler<00:05:34.490> I<00:05:34.520> mean

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
actually compared to the stapler I mean

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.920 
actually compared to the stapler I mean
the<00:05:34.760> same<00:05:34.940> thing<00:05:35.120> that<00:05:35.389> is<00:05:35.479> really<00:05:35.630> easy<00:05:35.780> to

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
the same thing that is really easy to

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.570 
the same thing that is really easy to
but<00:05:36.380> the<00:05:36.950> sellotape<00:05:37.340> is<00:05:37.490> really<00:05:37.940> is

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
but the sellotape is really is

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.610 
but the sellotape is really is
so<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:39.270> audience<00:05:39.599> issues<00:05:40.169> tickets<00:05:40.500> your

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
so the audience issues tickets your

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.980 
so the audience issues tickets your
fingers<00:05:40.949> and<00:05:41.520> if<00:05:41.610> he's<00:05:41.759> pushed<00:05:42.150> a<00:05:42.330> straw<00:05:42.660> in<00:05:42.870> it

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
fingers and if he's pushed a straw in it

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.230 
fingers and if he's pushed a straw in it
younger<00:05:43.379> children<00:05:43.830> you<00:05:44.729> could<00:05:44.879> make<00:05:45.060> a<00:05:45.090> whole

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
younger children you could make a whole

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.240 
younger children you could make a whole
bouquet<00:05:45.449> really<00:05:46.020> nice<00:05:46.169> bouquet<00:05:46.530> and<00:05:46.979> then<00:05:47.099> if

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
bouquet really nice bouquet and then if

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.439 
bouquet really nice bouquet and then if
you'd<00:05:47.370> like<00:05:47.520> if<00:05:47.669> you<00:05:47.759> didn't<00:05:48.000> have<00:05:48.150> a<00:05:48.180> color

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 
you'd like if you didn't have a color

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.240 
you'd like if you didn't have a color
plate<00:05:48.750> you<00:05:48.960> for<00:05:49.110> painting<00:05:49.289> zla<00:05:49.800> have<00:05:50.099> some
