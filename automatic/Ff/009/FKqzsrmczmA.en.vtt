00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.750
 Hello everyone and welcome in the case of DVDs on the use of the world tour 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.650
 all danger. 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.159
 today we will talk in generate free program 

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:12.279
 radiant is a program for the construction of 3d map sii 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:14.219
 multiplayer for single grid 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.419
 first hairless 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:18.310
 then go to application 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.869
 literary fish 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.630
 radiant is based on the Cartesian xxx gazette axes 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.179
 where by ticks we always mean height 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.699
 periksa wins or means depth plus width 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.160
 depending on where you are looking 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.100
 plants consists of 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.850
 a bar at the top 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.610
 as a menu series 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.940
 the concept of manipulating objects 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.790
 the whole woman 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.860
 a button a shortcut button bar 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.770
 which allow you to always perform manipulations of objects without 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.280
 However 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.140
 choose the aesthetic course - 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.530
 this use can be very useful for performing an operation 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.450
 without losing negrita 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.290
 Moreover 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.080
 I have a fixed grid 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.410
 for the z only 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.780
 and therefore for the height 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.810
 consider that the third 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.810
 the basis for fair plants and zero 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.510
 in fact, rated always starts from 0 0 0 then 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.350
 x0 y0 of all 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.770
 after which there is one 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.910
 editable grid 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.580
 with xy 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.939
 who has seen from above like this case of you xx. hot 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.369
 xz 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.310

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.420
 side yz 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.630
 the change of view on this episode on this dotted map 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.930
 can be made for - with cake 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.830
 at this moment the control 3dx y8 view 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.460
 pressing against tobacco 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.330
 xz pediment 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.460
 still moan against clubs 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.790
 yz saida ie the earth 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.790
 pressing again to return to x y8 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.600
 the same thing 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.290
 you can do it 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.810
 using the menu 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.810
 up 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.969
 xy 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:10.070
 yz 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.659
 xy 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.379
 late control 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.569
 or dj car 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.609
 pc letter seen that you mean you are 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.609
 without doing any cycle 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:26.879
 at this point you tell me a window from the three-dimensional view 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:29.519
 from yours 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.159
 your map 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.859
 the camera that looks at this window and this blue diamond 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.719
 that you find on the map 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.869
 the two put them identify 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:41.890
 the opening 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.679
 focal is the click position I look at the camera 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:47.249
 in the mint map 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:50.969
 the rhombus indicates the position of the cameras with respect to the height 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.969
 hip 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:59.409
 camera attachment always starts from 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.409
 0 0 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:04.869
 let's take an example 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:06.369
 let's build a cube 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:09.369
 holding down the left mouse button 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.419
 5 yes yes. of the hand 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.419
 without releasing the left button we move 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:18.079
 left button release 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.430
 and here he calls the patient to show you how tall the cube is 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:24.039
 the xy map 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:27.879
 so for the view from above it shows me the cube positioned 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.029
 in acsi 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:30.279
 xy 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:31.999
 in this 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:35.809
 3d map I see killer my cube let's say so 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:37.629
 rectangle 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.969
 I and with the camera positioned above it, I want to move it 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:42.939
 will be enough for you 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:44.289
 positioning here 

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:47.759
 keep the right button pressed 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.659
 swimming can advance colmar 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.499
 if you wanted to raise or lower the camera 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.619
 just hold down the key on the control keyboard 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.849
 I will move 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.139
 on the map in the respective z 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.409
 if you even want to tilt my toprock camera, hold user 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.209
 account also the exit 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.209
 so I move 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:17.750
 if I click 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.700
 I'll see what happened to the horns and here it is positioned in 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.650
 this. 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.650
 that the camera head is lower than p 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:31.909
 in the third the latin this window you find instead - hackstor 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.490
 images with which you can paint your objects 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.400
 having selected that having created this cube 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.130
 that to this like you photo as texture I can choose 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.319
 a new texture 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:46.810
 simply by clicking 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.599
 having the red cube selected 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.599
 to remove the selection from the cube 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.669
 press esc 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.639
 my square 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:03.400
 Moreover 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.789
 in this 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.319
 in this window you find 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.319
 the last messages of states only from the programs 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.800
 now move our cube to select the cube just go on 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.279
 3d map 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:21.659
 or on the maps 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.620
 on 3d map or on the map 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.560
 and hold shift on the keyboard press the left mouse button 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:32.199
 you have selected the cube 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.199
 if I press shift select the cube 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:37.059
 at this point 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:38.180
 you can 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.650
 move the cube as you do by simply releasing the shelter while holding the 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.979
 left mouse button 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:48.550
 and I moved two you want for example I want to move it like this 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.919
 then I realize that 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:51.919
 this cube 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.080
 two squares 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.460
 but here it is not 2 hiro I want perfectly square then 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.650
 to move this article 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.710
 to the right 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.710
 I position myself on my beautiful head 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:06.699
 i holding down 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.069
 on the head of the newborn 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:10.520
 left button 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.949
 I move 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.949
 same thing this part 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.570
 now I want to get up 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.590
 oh 2 methods 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.279
 pole up from here 

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:25.279
 e - ads with z or 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.029
 against tobacco 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:31.139
 z front water deck 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:32.819
 and that's it 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:35.819
 a parallelepiped fist 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:42.459
 for this
