00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:23.429 
works out after I get her opened up and

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.249 
works out after I get her opened up and
take<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> look<00:00:24.119> at<00:00:24.269> how<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.449> operate<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.109> whole

deal now I'm a little bit intimidated by

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.829 
deal now I'm a little bit intimidated by
RC<00:00:28.349> choppers<00:00:28.890> or<00:00:29.070> anything<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.179> flies<00:00:30.509> and

RC choppers or anything that flies and

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.040 
RC choppers or anything that flies and
I'm<00:00:30.929> controlling<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:32.239> so<00:00:33.239> we'll<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.899> wait

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
I'm controlling it so we'll have to wait

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.750 
I'm controlling it so we'll have to wait
and<00:00:34.140> see<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.350> how<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.860> goes<00:00:34.890> after<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.520> get<00:00:35.640> it

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and see just how it goes after I get it

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.549 
and see just how it goes after I get it
all<00:00:35.879> up<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.239> running<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.960> see<00:00:37.200> it

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
all up and running here you can see it

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.779 
all up and running here you can see it
comes<00:00:37.829> with<00:00:38.010> an<00:00:38.129> almost<00:00:38.430> game-like

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:38.789 
comes with an almost game-like

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.819 
comes with an almost game-like
controller<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:39.930> that's<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.199> good<00:00:40.350> sign<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.649> know

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
controller so that's a good sign I know

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.220 
controller so that's a good sign I know
how<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> operate<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:42.059> know<00:00:42.180> an<00:00:42.360> xbox<00:00:42.809> or<00:00:43.020> ps3

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
how to operate you know an xbox or ps3

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.979 
how to operate you know an xbox or ps3
controller<00:00:44.010> maybe<00:00:44.340> it'll<00:00:44.670> translate<00:00:45.480> over<00:00:45.870> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
controller maybe it'll translate over to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.410 
controller maybe it'll translate over to
this<00:00:46.109> kind<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.559> device<00:00:46.859> probably<00:00:47.550> not<00:00:47.760> but<00:00:48.180> I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
this kind of device probably not but I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.479 
this kind of device probably not but I
can<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.780> hopeful<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.890> we've<00:00:50.039> got<00:00:50.219> some

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
can be hopeful so we've got some

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.029 
can be hopeful so we've got some
paperwork<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:51.059> once<00:00:51.539> again<00:00:51.809> pretty

that's a problem

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:05.810 
that's a problem
I<00:01:03.210> hope<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.719> easy<00:01:03.929> to<00:01:04.140> turn<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.549> here

is<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.210> controller<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.860> feels<00:01:08.040> pretty

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
is the controller and it feels pretty

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.890 
is the controller and it feels pretty
good<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.520> mean<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.939> feels<00:01:09.060> pretty<00:01:09.390> obvious<00:01:09.810> I

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
good I mean it feels pretty obvious I

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.450 
good I mean it feels pretty obvious I
guess<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.259> your<00:01:10.439> throttle<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> left

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
guess you get your throttle on the left

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.520 
guess you get your throttle on the left
up<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.880> down<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.360> you've<00:01:12.990> got<00:01:13.229> your

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the right-hand joystick there's a little

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.319 
the right-hand joystick there's a little
selector<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.710> center<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> BC<00:01:20.610> selector<00:01:21.150> as

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
selector in the center a BC selector as

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.390 
selector in the center a BC selector as
well<00:01:21.930> as<00:01:22.140> what<00:01:22.500> looks<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.799> some<00:01:23.100> lights

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
well as what looks like some lights

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.039 
well as what looks like some lights
along<00:01:23.729> top<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.450> an<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.900> off<00:01:24.990> switch

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
along top you have an on and off switch

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.260 
along top you have an on and off switch
and<00:01:25.619> then<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.860> big<00:01:26.250> huge<00:01:26.490> chamber<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
and then this big huge chamber on the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.819 
and then this big huge chamber on the
back<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.750> batteries<00:01:28.200> that's<00:01:28.380> because<00:01:28.650> this

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
back for batteries that's because this

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.880 
back for batteries that's because this
thing<00:01:29.040> takes<00:01:29.390> six<00:01:30.390> double-a<00:01:31.140> batteries<00:01:31.710> which

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
thing takes six double-a batteries which

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.469 
thing takes six double-a batteries which
is<00:01:32.040> kind<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.340> nuts<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:32.909> there's<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.180> cool

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
is kind of nuts but there's a cool

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.480 
is kind of nuts but there's a cool
reason<00:01:33.750> why<00:01:34.110> which<00:01:34.320> I'll<00:01:34.470> get<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.040> second

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
reason why which I'll get to in a second

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.490 
reason why which I'll get to in a second
now<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.149> chopper<00:01:36.659> itself<00:01:37.049> needs<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.409> be

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
now the chopper itself needs to be

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.170 
now the chopper itself needs to be
charged<00:01:37.979> they've<00:01:38.220> also<00:01:38.369> included<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:39.000> number

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
charged they've also included a number

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.969 
charged they've also included a number
of<00:01:39.329> extra<00:01:39.840> blades<00:01:40.170> are<00:01:40.350> these<00:01:40.470> called<00:01:40.649> blades

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
of extra blades are these called blades

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.560 
of extra blades are these called blades
what<00:01:41.220> are<00:01:41.310> these<00:01:41.399> called<00:01:41.610> somebody<00:01:42.390> let<00:01:42.540> me

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
what are these called somebody let me

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.880 
what are these called somebody let me
know<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.899> comment<00:01:43.320> section<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:43.770> you've

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
know in the comment section but you've

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.499 
know in the comment section but you've
got<00:01:44.040> some<00:01:44.219> extra<00:01:44.310> ones<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.759> suppose<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.299> case

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
got some extra ones I suppose in case

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.450 
got some extra ones I suppose in case
you<00:01:45.659> damaged<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.649> ones<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.040> are<00:01:47.130> already

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
you damaged the ones that are already

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.340 
you damaged the ones that are already
currently<00:01:47.700> installed<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.930> then<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.229> get

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
currently installed and then you get

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.350 
currently installed and then you get
this<00:01:49.469> little<00:01:49.680> charging<00:01:50.250> cable<00:01:50.579> which<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.759> USB

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
this little charging cable which is USB

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.319 
this little charging cable which is USB
to<00:01:52.229> basically<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.189> regular<00:01:53.640> power<00:01:53.939> style

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
to basically a regular power style

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.700 
to basically a regular power style
adapter<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:54.930> how<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.079> interface<00:01:55.649> with

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
adapter that's how you interface with

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.990 
adapter that's how you interface with
the<00:01:56.460> chopper<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.869> little<00:01:58.170> USB<00:01:59.000> portion

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the chopper and the little USB portion

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.999 
the chopper and the little USB portion
glows<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.659> glows<00:02:00.899> red<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.530> know<00:02:01.740> if<00:02:01.890> you've

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
glows it glows red so you know if you've

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.010 
glows it glows red so you know if you've
got<00:02:02.250> power<00:02:02.490> or<00:02:02.729> not<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.479> slides<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
got power or not and this slides in the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.420 
got power or not and this slides in the
bottom<00:02:04.350> here<00:02:04.500> it's<00:02:04.619> kind<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.829> weird<00:02:05.100> where<00:02:05.310> it

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
bottom here it's kind of weird where it

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.920 
bottom here it's kind of weird where it
fits<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.820> because<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.210> can't<00:02:06.390> really<00:02:06.630> stand

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
fits in because you can't really stand

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.720 
fits in because you can't really stand
the<00:02:07.140> helicopter<00:02:07.740> up<00:02:07.860> when<00:02:08.070> it's<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.340> there<00:02:08.520> at

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:08.730 
the helicopter up when it's in there at

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.990 
the helicopter up when it's in there at
least<00:02:08.790> not<00:02:09.120> very<00:02:09.150> easily<00:02:09.680> so<00:02:10.680> anyways<00:02:11.220> here's

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
least not very easily so anyways here's

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.430 
least not very easily so anyways here's
a<00:02:12.060> better<00:02:12.210> look<00:02:12.330> at<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> actual<00:02:13.260> helicopter

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
a better look at the actual helicopter

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.420 
a better look at the actual helicopter
there<00:02:13.950> are

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
there are

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.430 
there are
metallic<00:02:15.330> components<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.049> then<00:02:16.140> there<00:02:16.319> are

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
metallic components and then there are

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.530 
metallic components and then there are
some<00:02:16.650> plastic<00:02:16.920> components<00:02:17.700> it's<00:02:17.819> not<00:02:17.970> super

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
some plastic components it's not super

all this RC chopper stuff but again this
portion<00:02:55.440> here<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.650> metallic<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.489> here's<00:02:57.180> a

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
portion here is metallic and here's a

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.789 
portion here is metallic and here's a
look<00:02:57.420> at<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.660> underside<00:02:58.019> as<00:02:58.410> well<00:02:58.560> as<00:02:58.680> that

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
look at the underside as well as that

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.220 
look at the underside as well as that
on/off<00:02:59.280> switch<00:02:59.579> and<00:02:59.819> also<00:03:00.299> where<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.569> charges

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
on/off switch and also where it charges

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.740 
on/off switch and also where it charges
the<00:03:01.709> on/off<00:03:02.040> switch<00:03:02.069> is<00:03:02.549> kind<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:02.909> tiny<00:03:03.420> it's

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
the on/off switch is kind of tiny it's

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.990 
the on/off switch is kind of tiny it's
like<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.930> little<00:03:04.140> dip<00:03:04.440> switch<00:03:04.799> so<00:03:05.069> you're<00:03:05.909> not

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
like a little dip switch so you're not

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.460 
like a little dip switch so you're not
going<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.209> do<00:03:06.359> it<00:03:06.390> by<00:03:06.599> accident<00:03:06.750> at<00:03:07.260> least

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
going to do it by accident at least

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.160 
going to do it by accident at least
that's<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.769> upside<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.659> suppose<00:03:09.659> so<00:03:09.900> anyways

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
that's the upside I suppose so anyways

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.680 
that's the upside I suppose so anyways
let's<00:03:10.379> go<00:03:10.470> ahead<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:10.890> insert<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.579> six<00:03:12.150> double

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
let's go ahead and insert the six double

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.899 
let's go ahead and insert the six double
A's<00:03:12.930> which<00:03:13.290> at<00:03:13.560> first<00:03:13.829> I<00:03:13.980> was<00:03:14.129> like<00:03:14.159> damn<00:03:14.549> that

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
A's which at first I was like damn that

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.569 
A's which at first I was like damn that
can't<00:03:15.269> be<00:03:15.359> just<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.989> power<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:16.579> controller

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
can't be just to power this controller

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.900 
can't be just to power this controller
that's<00:03:17.909> crazy<00:03:18.389> talk<00:03:18.780> but<00:03:19.530> no<00:03:20.280> there's<00:03:20.579> a<00:03:20.639> cool

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
that's crazy talk but no there's a cool

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.970 
that's crazy talk but no there's a cool
little<00:03:21.090> secret<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.690> cool<00:03:21.930> little<00:03:22.139> reason<00:03:22.709> why

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
little secret a cool little reason why

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.210 
little secret a cool little reason why
this<00:03:23.700> thing<00:03:23.760> takes<00:03:24.299> six<00:03:24.630> double<00:03:24.989> A's<00:03:25.139> and<00:03:25.440> when

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
this thing takes six double A's and when

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.890 
this thing takes six double A's and when
you<00:03:26.310> power<00:03:26.519> it<00:03:26.669> on<00:03:26.790> you'll<00:03:27.000> notice<00:03:27.329> this<00:03:27.480> these

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
you power it on you'll notice this these

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.379 
you power it on you'll notice this these
flashing<00:03:28.440> red<00:03:28.620> buttons<00:03:29.040> or<00:03:29.280> not<00:03:29.970> buttons

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
flashing red buttons or not buttons

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.780 
flashing red buttons or not buttons
flashing<00:03:31.049> red<00:03:31.200> LEDs<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.010> then<00:03:32.459> there's<00:03:32.669> this

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
flashing red LEDs and then there's this

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.550 
flashing red LEDs and then there's this
little<00:03:33.000> hidden<00:03:33.450> compartment<00:03:34.109> which<00:03:34.290> houses

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
little hidden compartment which houses

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.710 
little hidden compartment which houses
another<00:03:35.069> little<00:03:35.849> power<00:03:36.030> adapter<00:03:36.599> that's

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
another little power adapter that's

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.979 
another little power adapter that's
because<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.680> controller<00:03:38.310> can<00:03:39.090> power<00:03:39.359> up<00:03:39.510> can

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
because the controller can power up can

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.500 
because the controller can power up can
charge<00:03:40.319> your<00:03:41.010> actual<00:03:41.370> chopper<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.120> that's<00:03:42.329> why

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
charge your actual chopper so that's why

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.990 
charge your actual chopper so that's why
I<00:03:42.540> take<00:03:42.810> so<00:03:43.019> many<00:03:43.139> batteries<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:43.919> I<00:03:44.160> believe<00:03:44.730> in

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
I take so many batteries so I believe in

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.449 
I take so many batteries so I believe in
the<00:03:45.510> manual<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.079> says<00:03:46.109> that<00:03:46.560> half<00:03:47.040> an<00:03:47.190> hour<00:03:47.310> of

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
the manual it says that half an hour of

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.309 
the manual it says that half an hour of
charging<00:03:47.849> gives<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.090> about<00:03:48.299> between<00:03:48.959> five

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
charging gives you about between five

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.750 
charging gives you about between five
and<00:03:49.349> ten<00:03:49.709> minutes<00:03:49.739> of<00:03:50.160> flight<00:03:50.459> time<00:03:50.730> and

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
and ten minutes of flight time and

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.759 
and ten minutes of flight time and
you'll<00:03:50.970> notice<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.510> LEDs<00:03:52.019> on<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.260> top<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.650> the

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
you'll notice the LEDs on the top of the

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.800 
you'll notice the LEDs on the top of the
controller<00:03:53.430> indicate<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.150> you're<00:03:54.299> charging

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
controller indicate that you're charging

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.569 
controller indicate that you're charging
so<00:03:54.989> that's<00:03:55.590> pretty<00:03:55.829> cool<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.069> actually<00:03:56.340> wasn't

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
so that's pretty cool I actually wasn't

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:57.979 
so that's pretty cool I actually wasn't
expecting<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:57.180> I<00:03:57.299> actually<00:03:57.540> didn't<00:03:57.900> even

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
expecting that I actually didn't even

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.990 
expecting that I actually didn't even
know<00:03:58.349> that<00:03:58.650> that's<00:03:59.129> the<00:03:59.340> way<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.549> operated<00:03:59.879> so

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
know that that's the way it operated so

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.490 
know that that's the way it operated so
there<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.209> can<00:04:00.329> see<00:04:00.480> all<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.930> all<00:04:01.169> lit<00:04:01.470> up

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
there you can see all it all lit up

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.220 
there you can see all it all lit up
ready<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.040> fly<00:04:02.370> but<00:04:02.609> I<00:04:02.760> am<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.359> was<00:04:03.569> terrible<00:04:04.109> I
