he<00:02:12.980> was<00:02:13.129> talking<00:02:13.519> about<00:02:13.609> the<00:02:14.269> water<00:02:14.840> we<00:02:15.349> need

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
he was talking about the water we need

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.050 
he was talking about the water we need
in<00:02:15.799> total<00:02:16.670> not<00:02:17.030> on<00:02:17.299> top<00:02:17.599> of<00:02:17.629> what<00:02:17.959> we<00:02:17.989> already<00:02:18.109> F

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
in total not on top of what we already F

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.510 
in total not on top of what we already F
meant<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.780> total<00:02:20.050> we<00:02:20.560> have<00:02:20.739> to<00:02:20.950> have<00:02:21.099> per<00:02:21.340> day

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
meant the total we have to have per day

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.199 
meant the total we have to have per day
to<00:02:22.150> stay<00:02:22.390> healthy<00:02:22.980> second<00:02:23.980> he<00:02:24.370> also<00:02:24.520> mentioned

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
to stay healthy second he also mentioned

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.839 
to stay healthy second he also mentioned
that<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.599> physiological<00:02:26.560> mechanisms<00:02:27.310> inside

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
that the physiological mechanisms inside

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.110 
that the physiological mechanisms inside
our<00:02:28.120> bodies<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.930> regulate<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:30.130> liquids<00:02:30.940> in

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
our bodies that regulate the liquids in

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.030 
our bodies that regulate the liquids in
it<00:02:31.270> are<00:02:31.959> very<00:02:32.440> well<00:02:32.800> working<00:02:33.180> meaning<00:02:34.349> he<00:02:35.349> he

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
it are very well working meaning he he

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.910 
it are very well working meaning he he
says<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:37.480> thirst<00:02:37.870> tells<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.620> at<00:02:38.769> the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
says that the thirst tells you at the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.400 
says that the thirst tells you at the
right<00:02:39.099> time<00:02:39.459> when<00:02:39.819> you<00:02:40.030> should<00:02:40.300> have<00:02:40.599> to<00:02:41.140> drink

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
right time when you should have to drink

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.729 
right time when you should have to drink
something<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:42.099> assert<00:02:43.090> he<00:02:43.840> also<00:02:44.019> said<00:02:44.470> that

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
something and assert he also said that

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.220 
something and assert he also said that
water<00:02:45.220> can<00:02:45.580> come<00:02:45.819> from<00:02:46.000> all<00:02:46.239> possible<00:02:46.750> kinds

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
water can come from all possible kinds

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.400 
water can come from all possible kinds
of<00:02:47.530> sources<00:02:47.800> fruit<00:02:48.340> west<00:02:48.959> vegetables<00:02:49.959> coffee

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
of sources fruit west vegetables coffee

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.160 
of sources fruit west vegetables coffee
meat<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.130> all<00:02:51.430> that<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:51.910> it<00:02:52.390> doesn't<00:02:52.780> have<00:02:53.019> to

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
meat and all that and it doesn't have to

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.280 
meat and all that and it doesn't have to
be<00:02:53.319> water<00:02:53.910> specifically<00:02:54.910> that<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:55.810> have<00:02:56.080> to

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
be water specifically that you have to

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.789 
be water specifically that you have to
drink

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
drink

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.330 
drink
so<00:02:57.400> if<00:02:58.180> doctor<00:02:58.720> stare<00:02:59.049> and<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.709> is<00:02:59.860> very<00:03:00.040> likely

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
so if doctor stare and it is very likely

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.340 
so if doctor stare and it is very likely
that<00:03:00.549> that<00:03:00.910> is<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.150> case<00:03:01.390> if<00:03:01.720> doctors<00:03:02.110> they

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
that that is the case if doctors they

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.809 
that that is the case if doctors they
are<00:03:02.470> really<00:03:02.799> is<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.130> source<00:03:03.400> for<00:03:03.640> all<00:03:03.670> the

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
are really is the source for all the

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.170 
are really is the source for all the
water<00:03:04.180> drinking<00:03:04.660> we<00:03:04.930> are<00:03:05.080> supposed<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.860> do

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
water drinking we are supposed to do

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.809 
water drinking we are supposed to do
then<00:03:07.349> somewhere<00:03:08.349> along<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.890> road<00:03:09.069> doctors

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
then somewhere along the road doctors

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.720 
then somewhere along the road doctors
they<00:03:10.060> are<00:03:10.180> most<00:03:10.690> likely<00:03:11.140> simply<00:03:11.530> was

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
they are most likely simply was

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.380 
they are most likely simply was
misunderstood<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.769> what<00:03:14.769> he<00:03:15.069> said<00:03:15.430> mutated

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
misunderstood and what he said mutated

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.570 
misunderstood and what he said mutated
into<00:03:16.599> something<00:03:17.170> completely<00:03:17.769> different<00:03:17.980> and

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
into something completely different and

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.309 
into something completely different and
one<00:03:18.760> person<00:03:19.180> heard<00:03:19.360> that<00:03:19.599> and<00:03:19.810> then<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.019> next

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
one person heard that and then the next

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.890 
one person heard that and then the next
person<00:03:20.500> heard<00:03:20.890> that<00:03:21.160> and<00:03:21.430> it<00:03:21.940> was<00:03:22.090> repeated<00:03:22.510> so

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
person heard that and it was repeated so

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.800 
person heard that and it was repeated so
often<00:03:23.109> that<00:03:23.709> it<00:03:23.859> simply<00:03:24.250> became<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.910> truth<00:03:25.239> that

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
often that it simply became a truth that

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:33.440 
often that it simply became a truth that
all<00:03:25.870> people<00:03:26.500> thought<00:03:26.799> they<00:03:27.340> have<00:03:27.519> to<00:03:27.700> follow

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.120 

now<00:03:33.960> that<00:03:34.110> we<00:03:34.260> saw<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.590> orders<00:03:34.920> water

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
now that we saw that orders water

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.240 
now that we saw that orders water
drinking<00:03:35.730> may<00:03:35.940> simply<00:03:36.510> be<00:03:36.569> due<00:03:36.870> to

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
drinking may simply be due to

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.620 
drinking may simply be due to
misunderstanding<00:03:38.250> let<00:03:38.730> us<00:03:38.850> also<00:03:39.060> mention

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
misunderstanding let us also mention

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.170 
misunderstanding let us also mention
some<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.230> most<00:03:40.440> common<00:03:40.800> myths<00:03:41.130> we<00:03:41.610> hear<00:03:42.060> in

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
some of the most common myths we hear in

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.090 
some of the most common myths we hear in
connection<00:03:42.720> with<00:03:42.900> all<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.440> water<00:03:43.620> drinking

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
connection with all the water drinking

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.059 
connection with all the water drinking
we<00:03:44.220> are<00:03:44.310> supposed<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.790> do<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.560> when<00:03:46.560> you<00:03:46.709> hear

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
we are supposed to do and when you hear

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.490 
we are supposed to do and when you hear
very<00:03:47.610> often<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.630> one<00:03:48.750> we<00:03:48.870> already<00:03:49.020> talked

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
very often is the one we already talked

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.940 
very often is the one we already talked
about<00:03:49.830> which<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.420> that<00:03:51.420> supposedly<00:03:51.990> thirst

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
about which is that supposedly thirst

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.660 
about which is that supposedly thirst
sets<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.550> too<00:03:54.000> late<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.510> prevent<00:03:54.990> dehydration

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
sets in too late to prevent dehydration

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.730 
sets in too late to prevent dehydration
in<00:03:56.670> scientific<00:03:57.240> experiments<00:03:58.020> it<00:03:58.170> was<00:03:58.380> shown

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
in scientific experiments it was shown

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.610 
in scientific experiments it was shown
that<00:03:58.980> thirst<00:03:59.640> always<00:04:00.360> came<00:04:00.810> at<00:04:01.050> the<00:04:01.440> right

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
that thirst always came at the right

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.610 
that thirst always came at the right
time<00:04:01.680> before<00:04:02.640> dehydration<00:04:02.880> is<00:04:03.540> said<00:04:03.840> in<00:04:04.020> and

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
time before dehydration is said in and

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.860 
time before dehydration is said in and
when<00:04:04.739> you<00:04:04.830> think<00:04:05.160> about<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:05.970> also<00:04:06.150> wouldn't

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
when you think about it it also wouldn't

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.340 
when you think about it it also wouldn't
have<00:04:07.110> made<00:04:07.590> sense<00:04:07.920> for<00:04:08.390> evolution<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.570> decide

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
have made sense for evolution to decide

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.979 
have made sense for evolution to decide
us<00:04:10.590> in<00:04:10.800> a<00:04:10.980> way<00:04:11.160> that<00:04:11.459> constantly<00:04:12.420> would<00:04:12.750> leave

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
us in a way that constantly would leave

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.860 
us in a way that constantly would leave
us<00:04:13.280> dehydrated<00:04:14.310> if<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.850> don't<00:04:15.120> force

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
us dehydrated if you don't force

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:24.120 
us dehydrated if you don't force
ourselves<00:04:16.140> to<00:04:16.859> drink<00:04:17.400> water

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.700 

next<00:04:24.850> you<00:04:24.970> often<00:04:25.330> hear<00:04:25.570> that<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.410> color<00:04:26.620> of

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
next you often hear that the color of

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.980 
next you often hear that the color of
your<00:04:27.010> urine<00:04:27.160> can<00:04:27.610> indicate<00:04:28.060> an<00:04:28.390> illness<00:04:28.600> and

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
your urine can indicate an illness and

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.980 
your urine can indicate an illness and
for<00:04:29.230> you<00:04:29.440> to<00:04:29.680> be<00:04:29.860> healthy<00:04:30.040> your<00:04:31.000> urine<00:04:31.540> should

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
for you to be healthy your urine should

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.240 
for you to be healthy your urine should
be<00:04:32.200> clear<00:04:32.770> which<00:04:33.490> is<00:04:33.730> totally<00:04:34.690> wrong<00:04:35.250> let's

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
be clear which is totally wrong let's

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.790 
be clear which is totally wrong let's
say<00:04:36.430> for<00:04:36.700> example<00:04:37.390> you<00:04:38.170> have<00:04:38.350> internal

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
say for example you have internal

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.190 
say for example you have internal
bleeding's<00:04:39.400> and<00:04:39.610> some<00:04:40.090> of<00:04:40.240> that<00:04:40.390> blood<00:04:40.660> goes

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
bleeding's and some of that blood goes

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.700 
bleeding's and some of that blood goes
inside<00:04:42.010> your<00:04:42.550> urine<00:04:43.300> now<00:04:43.750> when<00:04:44.050> you<00:04:44.170> drink<00:04:44.530> a

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
inside your urine now when you drink a

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.020 
inside your urine now when you drink a
lot<00:04:45.010> of<00:04:45.040> water<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:47.080> blood<00:04:47.650> will<00:04:48.160> simply<00:04:48.760> dis

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
lot of water the blood will simply dis

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.630 
lot of water the blood will simply dis
solve<00:04:49.420> in<00:04:49.690> all<00:04:49.960> this<00:04:50.110> water<00:04:50.350> until<00:04:50.830> urine<00:04:51.280> will

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
solve in all this water until urine will

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.880 
solve in all this water until urine will
still<00:04:52.060> be<00:04:52.270> clear<00:04:52.600> but<00:04:53.140> that<00:04:53.380> doesn't<00:04:53.710> mean

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
still be clear but that doesn't mean

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.560 
still be clear but that doesn't mean
that<00:04:53.920> the<00:04:54.190> internal<00:04:54.640> bleeding<00:04:54.760> sep<00:04:55.240> stopped

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
that the internal bleeding sep stopped

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.140 
that the internal bleeding sep stopped
it<00:04:56.110> just<00:04:56.140> means<00:04:56.680> that<00:04:57.010> the<00:04:57.160> blood<00:04:57.340> is<00:04:57.610> now<00:04:57.760> so

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
it just means that the blood is now so

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.660 
it just means that the blood is now so
sin<00:04:58.540> in<00:04:58.750> your<00:04:59.020> urine<00:04:59.230> that<00:04:59.680> it<00:04:59.830> can't<00:05:00.130> be<00:05:00.280> seen

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
sin in your urine that it can't be seen

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.620 
sin in your urine that it can't be seen
so<00:05:00.940> you<00:05:01.330> can<00:05:01.690> per<00:05:02.050> se<00:05:02.320> say<00:05:03.040> that<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:04.090> urine

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
so you can per se say that the urine

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:11.790 
so you can per se say that the urine
means<00:05:05.230> you<00:05:05.680> are<00:05:05.830> healthy

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.379 

the<00:05:12.250> last<00:05:12.490> one<00:05:12.699> you<00:05:12.729> often<00:05:13.120> hear<00:05:13.330> in

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
the last one you often hear in

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.360 
the last one you often hear in
connection<00:05:13.840> with<00:05:13.870> all<00:05:14.199> this<00:05:14.410> water<00:05:14.860> drinking

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
connection with all this water drinking

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.309 
connection with all this water drinking
you're<00:05:15.520> supposed<00:05:15.910> to<00:05:16.060> do<00:05:16.270> is<00:05:16.419> that<00:05:17.050> if<00:05:17.199> you

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319 
you're supposed to do is that if you

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.040 
you're supposed to do is that if you
don't<00:05:17.560> do<00:05:17.889> it<00:05:18.039> supposedly<00:05:18.810> toxins<00:05:19.810> will

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
don't do it supposedly toxins will

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.290 
don't do it supposedly toxins will
accumulate<00:05:20.470> inside<00:05:21.039> your<00:05:21.310> body<00:05:21.520> and<00:05:21.789> make<00:05:22.060> you

last<00:06:02.900> but<00:06:03.080> not<00:06:03.110> least<00:06:03.470> the<00:06:03.650> one<00:06:03.800> we<00:06:03.920> also<00:06:04.070> have

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
last but not least the one we also have

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.100 
last but not least the one we also have
to<00:06:04.550> mention<00:06:04.880> is<00:06:05.030> the<00:06:05.210> one<00:06:05.360> about<00:06:05.540> caffeine

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
to mention is the one about caffeine

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.350 
to mention is the one about caffeine
supposedly<00:06:06.920> having<00:06:07.370> a<00:06:07.580> dehydrating<00:06:08.270> effect

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
supposedly having a dehydrating effect

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.810 
supposedly having a dehydrating effect
on<00:06:08.870> you<00:06:09.050> because<00:06:09.680> that<00:06:09.710> one<00:06:10.040> really<00:06:10.280> has<00:06:10.640> the

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
on you because that one really has the

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.180 
on you because that one really has the
basis<00:06:11.270> in<00:06:11.540> scientific<00:06:12.170> research<00:06:12.380> done<00:06:13.010> in

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
basis in scientific research done in

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.120 
basis in scientific research done in
good<00:06:13.340> years<00:06:13.370> which<00:06:14.030> showed<00:06:14.510> that<00:06:15.050> exact<00:06:15.620> fact

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
good years which showed that exact fact

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.880 
good years which showed that exact fact
but<00:06:17.000> later<00:06:17.210> research<00:06:17.720> showed<00:06:18.260> that<00:06:18.740> this

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
but later research showed that this

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.700 
but later research showed that this
effect<00:06:19.280> only<00:06:19.730> sets<00:06:20.030> in<00:06:20.360> for<00:06:20.720> people<00:06:21.380> who

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
effect only sets in for people who

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.760 
effect only sets in for people who
aren't<00:06:21.980> used<00:06:22.460> to<00:06:22.670> caffeine<00:06:23.060> so<00:06:23.780> if<00:06:24.170> you<00:06:24.380> have

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
aren't used to caffeine so if you have

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.310 
aren't used to caffeine so if you have
actually<00:06:25.190> drink<00:06:25.520> coffee<00:06:26.030> or<00:06:26.600> coke<00:06:26.990> or

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
actually drink coffee or coke or

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.200 
actually drink coffee or coke or
whatever<00:06:27.710> else<00:06:28.010> you<00:06:28.280> are<00:06:28.310> used<00:06:28.640> to<00:06:28.820> the<00:06:28.910> effect

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
whatever else you are used to the effect

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.660 
whatever else you are used to the effect
of<00:06:29.330> caffeine<00:06:29.570> the<00:06:30.470> caffeine<00:06:30.950> won't<00:06:31.190> have<00:06:31.460> this

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670 
of caffeine the caffeine won't have this

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.950 
of caffeine the caffeine won't have this
dehydrating<00:06:32.420> effect<00:06:32.540> and<00:06:33.110> you<00:06:33.740> can<00:06:34.570> count<00:06:35.570> the

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
dehydrating effect and you can count the

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.620 
dehydrating effect and you can count the
liquids<00:06:36.800> you<00:06:37.010> get<00:06:37.250> from<00:06:37.640> these<00:06:37.880> caffeinated

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
liquids you get from these caffeinated

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.010 
liquids you get from these caffeinated
drinks<00:06:39.170> fully<00:06:39.830> into<00:06:40.310> the<00:06:40.340> total<00:06:40.880> liquids<00:06:41.300> you

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
drinks fully into the total liquids you

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:49.189 
drinks fully into the total liquids you
consume<00:06:42.620> per<00:06:43.250> day

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.260 

so<00:06:49.949> what<00:06:50.159> should<00:06:50.279> you<00:06:50.430> take<00:06:50.580> away<00:06:50.879> from<00:06:51.090> this

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
so what should you take away from this

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.839 
so what should you take away from this
