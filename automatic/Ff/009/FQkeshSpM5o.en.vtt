00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
as it was in 1999 the station that i

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.250 
as it was in 1999 the station that i
worked<00:00:34.699> at<00:00:34.850> we<00:00:35.360> didn't<00:00:35.570> even<00:00:35.750> use<00:00:35.900> any<00:00:36.080> other

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
worked at we didn't even use any other

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.140 
worked at we didn't even use any other
stuff<00:00:36.590> i'm<00:00:37.340> sure<00:00:37.520> a<00:00:37.550> little<00:00:37.640> bit<00:00:37.820> about<00:00:37.910> what's

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
stuff i'm sure a little bit about what's

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:51.430 
stuff i'm sure a little bit about what's
inside<00:00:49.269> I<00:00:50.269> think<00:00:50.960> it's<00:00:51.080> a<00:00:51.140> little<00:00:51.199> light

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
inside I think it's a little light

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.290 
inside I think it's a little light
sensitive<00:00:51.860> thing<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:52.309> then<00:00:52.729> also<00:00:53.089> the

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
sensitive thing and then also the

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.560 
sensitive thing and then also the
batter's<00:00:53.570> worn<00:00:53.900> out<00:00:54.019> on<00:00:54.199> this<00:00:54.500> but<00:00:55.360> this<00:00:56.360> was<00:00:56.540> a

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
batter's worn out on this but this was a

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.250 
batter's worn out on this but this was a
countdown<00:00:56.960> clock<00:00:57.290> and<00:00:57.799> you<00:00:58.489> can<00:00:58.580> see<00:00:58.699> here<00:00:59.260> 9

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
countdown clock and you can see here 9

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.710 
countdown clock and you can see here 9
13<00:01:00.799> 99<00:01:01.339> that<00:01:01.670> was<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.970> launch<00:01:02.420> date<00:01:02.659> of

Voyager<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:03.199> syndication<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:03.979> so<00:01:04.990> this<00:01:05.990> was

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
Voyager and syndication and so this was

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.630

to<00:01:11.540> count<00:01:11.750> down<00:01:11.869> to<00:01:12.170> nine<00:01:12.799> 1399<00:01:14.619> it's<00:01:15.619> a<00:01:15.710> full

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
to count down to nine 1399 it's a full

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.460
