00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:01.860
 does it seem we will be all the time 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.020
 together 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.150
 if a 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.040
 having received 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.580
 Sberbank among the dead mostly 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.010
 amazes ask whether it is worth let the robot do 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.230
 their business grow 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.570
 and if you will teach me, but according to 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.359
 the ministry 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.159
 my job is now 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:24.179
 be your father 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.179
 I'm just in shock 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.220
 let's start there will be no familiar bodies 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.120
 your four-dimensional constraint 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.900
 favorite 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.200
 perhaps 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.750
 really hard for them maybe i can 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.680
 help casino then th 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.610
 so the situation is gradually falling 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.550
 eyewitnesses 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.780
 0102 like this 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.590
 decree 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.590
 fine 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.390
 in case the solution is good good 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.610
 the truth is remarkably well shot above 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.780
 higher class is not all 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.190
 sees 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.190
 at 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.159
 I'm not there 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.439
 earlier administration yanao evgeny markin 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.439
 no less for its inhabitants simpler 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.590
 dollars ounce 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.440
 critics of pure reason how did i read 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.760
 you need a queue 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.590
 3 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.900
 that's what's with me 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.180
 when asked for it every night 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.179
 it's not quite so easy to list them 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:45.179
 maybe you can work again 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.920
 I think 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.670
 report among horses 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.509
