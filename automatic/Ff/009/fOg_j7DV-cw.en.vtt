 Cinnamon don't say anything 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.240

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.780

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.020

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.699

 the city don't remember there is a house toilet think 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.740

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.450
 on the toilet and not only on the toilet and in 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.930
 overall there is a huge golden release like 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.660
 call it huge gold excrement 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.420

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.600
 ok hell was asked about 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.360
 when the koreans are more honest I am 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.840
 recalled and could not remember to face with 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.800
 runny nose here with a cold hell there 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:38.390
 and here is cinnamon with a runny nose 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.739
 I do not remember a person further on a hookah 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.769
 coughing given here so on smart and go 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:48.440
 you didn’t mark you 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.959
 Koreans apparently very good immunity 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.269
 because these sharp drops are 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.610
 temperatures that our not stand 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.700
 those who come here for a while 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.790
 the first time they just forgive everything 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.340
 yes because if this summer is equal too 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.370
 the street you go somewhere love meters 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.950
 transport you go on the bus there very much 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.340
 cold under cinnamon conditioners 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.830
 sit quietly they dry their heads under 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.410
 fans or air conditioners 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.310
 they are not normal they can not catch cold 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.820
 their immunity is stronger because of this yes not 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.250
 I know then maybe the fact that the Koreans 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.459
 I just that they just run a doctor 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.640
 so can not starting up such 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.220
 degree because i can't remember 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.980
 but I pay special attention 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.470
 the beginning and who soars they wear masks i'm about 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.970
 This has already been said, but why does the video have a mask ? 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.080
 Koreans wear masks therefore did not notice 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.720
 to squish 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.280

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.280
