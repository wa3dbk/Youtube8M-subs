00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.960
 yes greetings today I will be 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.770
 demonstrating how with your iphone phone 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.690
 can copy texts from facebook 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.789
 facebook unfortunately does not allow them 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.360
 copy text from the application of 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:17.670
 facebook to be able to do that they have to 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.530
 enter facebook on the internet of your 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.080
 phone you decide if you enter by the 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.640
 chrono can enter then by me by 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.539
 example I will be entering today by 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.060
 safari I will go to safari and then in 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.149
 safari you are possibly not going to have 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.589
 his facebook page open so I 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.149
 I will be opening a new tab 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:41.249
 I'm really going to be able here www.facebook.com 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.859
 or in my case I already have it recorded as 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:45.780
 a facebook I will enter then to my 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:49.469
 Facebook for my internet 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.079
 cellular and then I'll go to any 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.499
 page 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.110
 of the person I want in this case 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:01:02.200
 I'm going in 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.200
 to my husband's page 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.300
 and then put them on and then I want 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.190
 copy for example some text that you 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.770
 I have recently done, put it on me 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.660
 I want to copy that text and I just 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.330
 I'm going to give it so that then it opens 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.520
 as such and then I will leave my finger 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.290
 stuck on if they get fixed gives me the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.840
 option to copy me then I can pull 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.450
 and select everything I want 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.020
 copy once I have everything 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.200
 I will give you a copy ok 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.119
 I give copy once I have not copied well 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.640
 simple then I'm going to the section of 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.450
 notes from my cell phone 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.810
 and then I will create a new note 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.670
 of because I'm going to give up here 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.920
 new note I'm going to lower my finger stuck 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.320
 and I'm going to give him the paste and 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.500
 it was automatically recorded then 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.960
 velarde a simple copy paste so 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.310
 this is something very easy I hope this 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.759
