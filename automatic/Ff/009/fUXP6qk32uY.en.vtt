00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
thing to do that you can actually do

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.220 
thing to do that you can actually do
with<00:05:58.950> your<00:05:59.220> wigs<00:05:59.400> is<00:05:59.669> if<00:06:00.540> you<00:06:00.720> guys<00:06:00.840> have

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
with your wigs is if you guys have

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.740 
with your wigs is if you guys have
leave-in<00:06:01.980> conditioner<00:06:02.700> is<00:06:02.910> I<00:06:03.390> would<00:06:03.540> just

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
leave-in conditioner is I would just

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.090 
leave-in conditioner is I would just
spray<00:06:03.990> a<00:06:04.020> little<00:06:04.110> bit<00:06:04.350> of<00:06:04.500> leave-in

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
spray a little bit of leave-in

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.920 
spray a little bit of leave-in
conditioner<00:06:05.730> and<00:06:05.940> just<00:06:06.150> actually<00:06:06.390> comb<00:06:06.780> it

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
conditioner and just actually comb it

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.380 
conditioner and just actually comb it
through<00:06:06.960> so<00:06:07.830> it<00:06:07.919> gives<00:06:08.070> it<00:06:08.220> a<00:06:08.310> little<00:06:08.460> bit<00:06:08.730> of<00:06:08.970> a

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
through so it gives it a little bit of a

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.040 
through so it gives it a little bit of a
you<00:06:10.050> know<00:06:10.080> nice<00:06:11.039> comb<00:06:11.669> through<00:06:12.060> and<00:06:12.360> it's<00:06:12.810> not

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
you know nice comb through and it's not

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.170 
you know nice comb through and it's not
very<00:06:13.260> sneaky<00:06:13.490> so<00:06:14.490> that's<00:06:14.669> one<00:06:14.850> thing<00:06:15.000> you<00:06:15.150> can

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
very sneaky so that's one thing you can

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.940 
very sneaky so that's one thing you can
do<00:06:15.479> you<00:06:15.750> can<00:06:15.900> actually<00:06:16.080> throw<00:06:16.530> your<00:06:16.740> weight

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
do you can actually throw your weight

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.730 
do you can actually throw your weight
caps<00:06:17.250> into<00:06:17.729> the<00:06:18.330> washer<00:06:18.840> I<00:06:19.080> would<00:06:19.620> just

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
caps into the washer I would just

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.170 
caps into the washer I would just
recommend<00:06:19.919> not<00:06:20.250> drying<00:06:20.550> it<00:06:20.760> so<00:06:20.910> it<00:06:21.000> doesn't

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
recommend not drying it so it doesn't

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.840 
recommend not drying it so it doesn't
shrink<00:06:21.510> but<00:06:21.930> you<00:06:22.050> can<00:06:22.200> wash<00:06:22.350> those<00:06:22.650> as<00:06:22.830> well<00:06:23.039> so

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850 
shrink but you can wash those as well so

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.120 
shrink but you can wash those as well so
yeah<00:06:24.300> basically<00:06:24.660> that's<00:06:25.110> it<00:06:25.380> that's<00:06:25.830> how<00:06:26.100> to

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
yeah basically that's it that's how to

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.010 
yeah basically that's it that's how to
put<00:06:26.400> on<00:06:26.520> a<00:06:26.550> wig<00:06:26.760> cap<00:06:26.820> it<00:06:27.330> was<00:06:27.450> really<00:06:27.690> easy<00:06:27.870> to

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
put on a wig cap it was really easy to

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.060 
put on a wig cap it was really easy to
do<00:06:28.350> your<00:06:29.039> wig<00:06:29.310> in<00:06:30.169> so<00:06:31.169> your<00:06:31.350> hair<00:06:31.590> is<00:06:31.680> nice<00:06:31.830> and
