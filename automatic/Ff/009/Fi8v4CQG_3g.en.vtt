secondaries<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.229> black<00:01:25.590> ops<00:01:25.860> are<00:01:26.130> only

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729

pistols<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.810> launchers<00:01:28.429> now<00:01:29.429> I<00:01:29.459> know<00:01:29.640> world<00:01:30.060> at

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:30.209 
pistols on launchers now I know world at

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:32.180 
pistols on launchers now I know world at
war<00:01:30.450> called<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.229> before<00:01:31.530> had<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:31.979> well

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
war called it before had that as well

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.399 
war called it before had that as well
but<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:33.090> fact<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.390> modern<00:01:33.659> warfare<00:01:33.899> 2<00:01:34.200> even

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
but the fact that modern warfare 2 even

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.380 
but the fact that modern warfare 2 even
implemented<00:01:34.740> machine<00:01:35.220> pistols<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.270> they

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
implemented machine pistols and they

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.199 
implemented machine pistols and they
were<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.840> strong<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.560> black<00:01:38.369> ops<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.970> they

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
were so strong and black ops and they

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:42.350 
were so strong and black ops and they
had<00:01:39.590> shotguns<00:01:40.590> secondaries<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.149> fact

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
had shotguns secondaries and the fact

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.809 
had shotguns secondaries and the fact
that<00:01:42.479> Treyarch<00:01:43.170> stuck<00:01:43.590> pistol<00:01:44.369> von<00:01:44.610> traumen

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
that Treyarch stuck pistol von traumen

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.479 
that Treyarch stuck pistol von traumen
secondaries<00:01:45.599> it<00:01:46.560> gives<00:01:46.709> me<00:01:46.830> a<00:01:46.860> lot<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.069> respect

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:47.489 
secondaries it gives me a lot of respect

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:50.150 
secondaries it gives me a lot of respect
for<00:01:47.640> treyarch<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:49.560> think<00:01:49.830> it<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:49.950> adds

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
for treyarch and I think it just adds

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.339 
for treyarch and I think it just adds
another<00:01:50.340> level<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.910> competition<00:01:51.450> when<00:01:52.170> you

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
another level of competition when you

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.050 
another level of competition when you
run<00:01:52.560> out<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.709> ammo<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.190> your<00:01:53.310> primary<00:01:53.519> you<00:01:53.940> have

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
run out of ammo on your primary you have

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.969 
run out of ammo on your primary you have
to<00:01:54.179> switch<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.569> your<00:01:54.660> secondary<00:01:55.110> pistol<00:01:55.590> or<00:01:55.800> in

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
to switch to your secondary pistol or in

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.639 
to switch to your secondary pistol or in
my<00:01:56.129> case<00:01:56.160> in<00:01:56.489> RPG<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.629> finish<00:01:57.899> off<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:58.200> kill<00:01:58.410> I

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
my case in RPG to finish off the kill I

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.889 
my case in RPG to finish off the kill I
just<00:01:59.640> really<00:01:59.819> like<00:01:59.970> that<00:02:00.119> aspect<00:02:00.179> I<00:02:00.750> don't

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
just really like that aspect I don't

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.680 
just really like that aspect I don't
know<00:02:00.989> how<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.140> fail<00:02:01.379> with<00:02:01.530> these<00:02:01.619> two<00:02:01.739> RPGs<00:02:02.690> but

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
know how I fail with these two RPGs but

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.419 
know how I fail with these two RPGs but
another<00:02:04.110> thing<00:02:04.319> I<00:02:04.440> liked<00:02:04.679> about<00:02:04.800> black<00:02:05.190> ops

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
another thing I liked about black ops

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.460 
another thing I liked about black ops
and<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.479> one's<00:02:06.690> tricky<00:02:06.869> because<00:02:07.229> it

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
and this one's tricky because it

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.710 
and this one's tricky because it
actually<00:02:07.619> might<00:02:07.860> be<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> negative<00:02:08.489> but<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.330> love

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
actually might be a negative but I love

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.890 
actually might be a negative but I love
theater<00:02:10.319> mode<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:11.000> like<00:02:12.000> theater<00:02:12.420> mode<00:02:12.540> because

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
theater mode I like theater mode because

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.750 
theater mode I like theater mode because
it<00:02:13.830> allows<00:02:14.099> you<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.280> go<00:02:14.370> back<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:14.580> get

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
it allows you to go back and get

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.059 
it allows you to go back and get
gameplay<00:02:15.150> if<00:02:15.269> you<00:02:15.330> weren't<00:02:15.480> recording<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:16.409> it

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
gameplay if you weren't recording and it

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.399 
gameplay if you weren't recording and it
allows<00:02:17.250> me<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.730> do<00:02:17.879> things<00:02:18.150> like<00:02:18.480> camper<00:02:19.230> meets

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
allows me to do things like camper meets

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.059 
allows me to do things like camper meets

whole very similar corner wherever

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.380 
whole very similar corner wherever
is<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:26.040> allows<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.730> be<00:02:26.790> really<00:02:27.120> creative

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
is it allows you to be really creative

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.990 
is it allows you to be really creative
I've<00:02:27.930> seen<00:02:28.200> some<00:02:28.349> awesome<00:02:28.950> montages<00:02:29.670> come<00:02:29.849> out

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
I've seen some awesome montages come out

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.569 
I've seen some awesome montages come out
of<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.599> I<00:02:31.140> just<00:02:31.650> really<00:02:32.010> like<00:02:32.220> theatre

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
of it and I just really like theatre

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.059 
of it and I just really like theatre
home<00:02:32.760> now<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.599> may<00:02:33.780> be<00:02:33.840> cause<00:02:34.319> for<00:02:34.349> a<00:02:34.739> lot<00:02:34.950> of

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
home now it may be cause for a lot of

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.319 
home now it may be cause for a lot of
lag<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:36.209> black<00:02:36.659> ops<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:37.110> my<00:02:37.260> affair<00:02:37.590> 3c<00:02:38.099> but<00:02:39.090> I

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
lag that black ops of my affair 3c but I

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.119 
lag that black ops of my affair 3c but I
don't<00:02:39.659> know<00:02:39.870> for<00:02:40.170> sure<00:02:40.200> if<00:02:40.530> that's<00:02:40.560> because<00:02:41.010> of

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
don't know for sure if that's because of

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.009 
don't know for sure if that's because of
theater<00:02:41.400> mode<00:02:41.549> so<00:02:41.849> for<00:02:42.090> me<00:02:42.239> it's<00:02:42.720> still<00:02:42.870> a

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
theater mode so for me it's still a

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.979 
theater mode so for me it's still a
positive<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:44.519> another<00:02:45.180> thing<00:02:45.299> that<00:02:45.689> I<00:02:45.780> really

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
positive and another thing that I really

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.729 
positive and another thing that I really
like<00:02:46.260> about<00:02:46.290> black<00:02:46.769> ops<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.340> combat<00:02:48.060> training

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
like about black ops is combat training

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.140 
like about black ops is combat training
it<00:02:49.739> was<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:50.010> really<00:02:50.220> nice<00:02:50.489> when<00:02:50.909> the<00:02:51.000> game

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
it was just really nice when the game

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.420 
it was just really nice when the game
first<00:02:51.180> came<00:02:51.540> out<00:02:51.840> or<00:02:52.200> when<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.560> prestige<00:02:53.040> or

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
first came out or when I prestige or

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.849 
first came out or when I prestige or
whatever<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.209> case<00:02:54.239> may<00:02:54.599> be<00:02:54.629> but<00:02:54.989> I<00:02:55.650> could

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
whatever the case may be but I could

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.710 
whatever the case may be but I could
just<00:02:55.980> go<00:02:56.129> into<00:02:56.280> combat<00:02:56.489> training<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.239> test

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
just go into combat training and test

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.020 
just go into combat training and test
out<00:02:57.900> weapons<00:02:58.109> and<00:02:58.950> get<00:02:59.579> used<00:02:59.790> two<00:02:59.909> different

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
out weapons and get used two different

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.119 
out weapons and get used two different
things<00:03:00.420> check<00:03:00.870> out<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.170> maps<00:03:01.409> actually

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
things check out the maps actually

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.740 
things check out the maps actually
playing<00:03:02.340> in<00:03:02.519> bots<00:03:02.849> you<00:03:03.239> know<00:03:03.329> put<00:03:03.540> them<00:03:03.599> on<00:03:03.720> a

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
playing in bots you know put them on a

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.110 
playing in bots you know put them on a
different<00:03:04.079> difficulty<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:04.940> really<00:03:05.940> like

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
different difficulty I really like

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.210 
different difficulty I really like
combat<00:03:06.510> training<00:03:06.840> in<00:03:06.989> this<00:03:07.049> game<00:03:07.319> and<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.980> think

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
combat training in this game and I think

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.250 
combat training in this game and I think
combat<00:03:08.609> training<00:03:08.909> is<00:03:09.150> way<00:03:09.510> better<00:03:09.750> for<00:03:10.109> new

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
combat training is way better for new

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.679 
combat training is way better for new
players<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:11.129> death<00:03:11.430> streaks<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.510> that's

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
players the death streaks and that's

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.149 
players the death streaks and that's
obviously<00:03:12.870> another<00:03:13.500> thing<00:03:13.769> I<00:03:13.920> love<00:03:14.099> about

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
obviously another thing I love about

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.800 
obviously another thing I love about
black<00:03:14.609> ops<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.090> treyarch<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.689> they

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
black ops and treyarch is that they

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.800 
black ops and treyarch is that they
don't<00:03:16.079> include<00:03:16.290> districts<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:18.120> I'm<00:03:18.269> assuming

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
don't include districts and I'm assuming

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.140 
don't include districts and I'm assuming
they<00:03:18.959> won't<00:03:19.170> be<00:03:19.290> in<00:03:19.379> black<00:03:19.590> ops<00:03:19.799> 2<00:03:19.920> either<00:03:20.250> I'd

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
they won't be in black ops 2 either I'd

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.819 
they won't be in black ops 2 either I'd
really<00:03:21.420> like<00:03:21.659> to<00:03:21.720> see<00:03:21.959> combat<00:03:22.200> training<00:03:22.620> make

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
really like to see combat training make

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.860 
really like to see combat training make
a<00:03:22.859> return<00:03:23.189> and<00:03:23.609> I'd<00:03:23.730> also<00:03:23.760> like<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.180> see<00:03:24.420> basic

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
a return and I'd also like to see basic

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.629 
a return and I'd also like to see basic
training<00:03:25.170> make<00:03:25.319> a<00:03:25.349> return<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:26.340> where<00:03:26.459> new

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
training make a return to where new

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.409 
training make a return to where new
players<00:03:26.970> level<00:03:27.840> 0<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.349> 15<00:03:28.739> or<00:03:28.919> whatever<00:03:29.389> can<00:03:30.389> go

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
players level 0 to 15 or whatever can go

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:31.849 
players level 0 to 15 or whatever can go
in<00:03:30.629> there<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:30.870> face<00:03:31.049> each<00:03:31.290> other<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.739> get

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
in there and face each other and get

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.430 
in there and face each other and get
better<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.720> still<00:03:33.720> think<00:03:33.959> that's<00:03:34.049> way<00:03:34.410> more

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
better I still think that's way more

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.819 
better I still think that's way more
effective<00:03:35.129> than<00:03:35.250> death<00:03:35.579> streaks<00:03:36.230> but<00:03:37.230> anyway

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
effective than death streaks but anyway

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.309 
effective than death streaks but anyway
guys<00:03:38.040> just<00:03:38.639> to<00:03:38.730> finish<00:03:38.910> it<00:03:39.150> up<00:03:39.239> black<00:03:39.900> ops<00:03:40.139> is

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
guys just to finish it up black ops is

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.349 
guys just to finish it up black ops is
probably<00:03:40.799> my<00:03:41.069> least<00:03:41.310> played<00:03:41.579> call<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.030> duty

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
probably my least played call of duty

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.930 
probably my least played call of duty
out<00:03:42.599> of<00:03:42.780> all<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.260> call<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.560> duties<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.760> that's

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
out of all the call of duties and that's

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.849 
out of all the call of duties and that's
mainly<00:03:45.329> just<00:03:45.659> because<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:46.169> struggled<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:46.709> much

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
mainly just because I struggled so much

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:47.960 
mainly just because I struggled so much
with<00:03:47.040> connection<00:03:47.519> when<00:03:47.639> this<00:03:47.730> game<00:03:47.909> first

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
with connection when this game first

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.199 
with connection when this game first
came<00:03:48.299> out<00:03:48.569> but<00:03:49.370> going<00:03:50.370> back<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:50.790> playing<00:03:50.849> it

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
came out but going back and playing it

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.970 
came out but going back and playing it
recently<00:03:51.629> it<00:03:51.959> seems<00:03:52.139> like<00:03:52.349> the<00:03:52.500> connections

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
recently it seems like the connections

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.949 
recently it seems like the connections
are<00:03:53.099> a<00:03:53.159> lot<00:03:53.340> better<00:03:53.519> probably<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.359> from<00:03:54.510> less

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
are a lot better probably just from less

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.289 
are a lot better probably just from less
people<00:03:55.290> being<00:03:55.530> online<00:03:55.790> it's<00:03:56.790> allowed<00:03:56.970> me<00:03:57.000> to

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
people being online it's allowed me to

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.640 
people being online it's allowed me to
enjoy<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:57.750> game<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:57.959> little<00:03:58.109> bit<00:03:58.319> more<00:03:58.590> for

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
enjoy the game a little bit more for

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.969 
enjoy the game a little bit more for
what<00:03:58.979> it<00:03:59.099> is<00:03:59.129> and<00:03:59.690> not<00:04:00.690> having<00:04:01.199> things<00:04:01.500> masked

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
what it is and not having things masked

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.369 
what it is and not having things masked
by<00:04:02.129> connection<00:04:02.790> issues<00:04:03.209> too<00:04:04.049> obviously

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
by connection issues too obviously
