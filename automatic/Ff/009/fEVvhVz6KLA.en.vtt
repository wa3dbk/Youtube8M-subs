00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.870 
ourselves one of the players didn't want
and<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:21.060> was<00:03:21.270> corny<00:03:21.740> former<00:03:22.740> ever<00:03:23.010> but<00:03:23.640> I<00:03:23.670> was

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
and that was corny former ever but I was

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.430 
and that was corny former ever but I was
going<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.150> go<00:03:24.240> for<00:03:24.420> Jozy<00:03:24.810> Altidore<00:03:25.290> but

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
going to go for Jozy Altidore but

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.470 
going to go for Jozy Altidore but
because<00:03:25.710> someone<00:03:26.100> never<00:03:26.310> picked<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.820> certain

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
because someone never picked a certain

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.390 
because someone never picked a certain
player<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.960> managed<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.290> get<00:03:28.410> in<00:03:28.530> myself<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:29.070> it

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
player I managed to get in myself and it

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.050 
player I managed to get in myself and it
was<00:03:29.430> 77<00:03:30.240> rated<00:03:31.010> Lukaku<00:03:32.010> from<00:03:32.280> Everton<00:03:32.730> as<00:03:32.880> well

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
was 77 rated Lukaku from Everton as well

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.760 
was 77 rated Lukaku from Everton as well
so<00:03:33.990> that<00:03:34.290> team<00:03:34.830> looked<00:03:35.070> solid<00:03:35.600> until<00:03:36.600> now<00:03:36.900> in

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
so that team looked solid until now in

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.830 
so that team looked solid until now in
the<00:03:38.010> CDM<00:03:38.550> ball<00:03:38.760> we<00:03:39.150> didn't<00:03:39.360> manage<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.600> get

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
the CDM ball we didn't manage to get

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.500 
the CDM ball we didn't manage to get
Jack<00:03:40.230> Wilshere<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.130> a<00:03:41.460> decent<00:03:42.120> player<00:03:42.270> and

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
Jack Wilshere a to a decent player and

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.780 
Jack Wilshere a to a decent player and
that<00:03:42.870> was<00:03:43.050> because<00:03:43.230> my<00:03:43.680> pic<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:43.980> Ramirez<00:03:44.580> was

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
that was because my pic of Ramirez was

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.110 
that was because my pic of Ramirez was
picked<00:03:45.090> by<00:03:45.360> Ryan<00:03:46.080> laughing<00:03:46.260> Ryan<00:03:46.560> took

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
picked by Ryan laughing Ryan took

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.640 
picked by Ryan laughing Ryan took
Ramirez<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.270> in<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.810> composition<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.500> think

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
Ramirez and in the composition I think

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.070 
Ramirez and in the composition I think
Ryan<00:03:49.860> also<00:03:50.460> took<00:03:50.520> de<00:03:50.880> Bruyne<00:03:51.180> as<00:03:51.450> well<00:03:51.630> so<00:03:51.870> we

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
Ryan also took de Bruyne as well so we

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.500 
Ryan also took de Bruyne as well so we
went<00:03:52.260> with<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.530> freshly<00:03:53.280> transfer<00:03:53.940> player<00:03:54.270> of

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
went with a freshly transfer player of

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.170 
went with a freshly transfer player of
Clint<00:03:55.500> Dempsey<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:56.430> that's<00:03:56.580> how<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.850> team

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
Clint Dempsey so that's how the team

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.540 
Clint Dempsey so that's how the team
does<00:03:57.810> look<00:03:58.080> for<00:03:58.290> my<00:03:58.380> game<00:03:58.650> against<00:03:59.010> Finch<00:03:59.370> now

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550
