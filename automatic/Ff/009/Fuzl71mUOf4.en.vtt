mother cooking gel Gabbay or turkey

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:26.070 
mother cooking gel Gabbay or turkey
confit<00:02:20.220> after<00:02:20.730> Thanksgiving

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.199 

my<00:02:27.080> biggest<00:02:27.290> problem<00:02:27.709> is<00:02:27.860> that<00:02:27.890> sometimes<00:02:28.879> I

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
my biggest problem is that sometimes I

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.390 
my biggest problem is that sometimes I
don't<00:02:29.360> finish<00:02:29.650> swallowing<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.980> then<00:02:31.099> I<00:02:31.159> start

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
don't finish swallowing and then I start

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.869 
don't finish swallowing and then I start
talking<00:02:31.489> about<00:02:31.909> the<00:02:32.120> food<00:02:32.330> then<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.379> talk<00:02:33.879> it

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
talking about the food then I talk it

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.449 
talking about the food then I talk it
happens<00:02:35.209> all<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.360> time

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
happens all the time

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.100 

it's<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:38.610> good<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.060> want<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.510> describe<00:02:39.870> it

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
it's so good that I want to describe it

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.920 
it's so good that I want to describe it
right<00:02:40.260> away<00:02:40.500> before<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.920> forget<00:02:41.100> because<00:02:42.060> my

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
right away before I forget because my

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.559 
right away before I forget because my
memory<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.350> kind<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.590> like<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.709> goldfish

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.910 

but<00:02:46.930> anyways<00:02:48.870> Jojo<00:02:49.870> gets<00:02:49.989> right<00:02:50.230> it's

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
but anyways Jojo gets right it's

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.850 
but anyways Jojo gets right it's
actually<00:02:51.040> very<00:02:51.370> simply<00:02:51.849> very<00:02:52.379> merciful

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.420 

very<00:02:56.400> simple

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.009 

that's<00:03:00.790> pretty<00:03:00.939> good<00:03:01.209> now<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.540> lot<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:01.840> people

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
that's pretty good now a lot of people

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.319 
that's pretty good now a lot of people
don't<00:03:02.290> believe<00:03:02.590> me<00:03:02.650> when<00:03:02.829> I<00:03:03.010> say<00:03:03.280> it's<00:03:04.090> good

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
don't believe me when I say it's good

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.839 
don't believe me when I say it's good
because<00:03:04.870> I'm<00:03:05.379> such<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.709> cynical<00:03:06.129> guy<00:03:06.310> and

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
you see it's not because I'm starving

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.610 
you see it's not because I'm starving
and<00:03:27.460> I<00:03:27.520> haven't<00:03:27.550> eaten<00:03:27.880> anything<00:03:28.060> in<00:03:28.240> a<00:03:28.300> while

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
and I haven't eaten anything in a while

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.430 
and I haven't eaten anything in a while
but<00:03:29.620> this<00:03:29.710> stuff<00:03:29.950> is<00:03:29.980> pretty<00:03:30.310> good

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.720 

is<00:03:34.740> a<00:03:34.800> duck<00:03:35.090> heart

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.510 

it's<00:03:38.940> not<00:03:39.090> beating<00:03:39.420> like<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:39.569> lately

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.810 

so<00:03:43.640> you<00:03:43.820> might<00:03:44.030> think<00:03:45.460> you<00:03:46.460> don't<00:03:46.580> have<00:03:46.790> a

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820
