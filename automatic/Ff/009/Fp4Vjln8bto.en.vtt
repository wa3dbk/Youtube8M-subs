good evening everyone and welcome back

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.849 
good evening everyone and welcome back
to<00:00:03.149> another<00:00:03.179> tutorial<00:00:03.720> this<00:00:04.110> time<00:00:04.710> we're

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
to another tutorial this time we're

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.030 
to another tutorial this time we're
taking<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.250> look<00:00:05.370> at<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.970> Gregg<00:00:06.420> tech

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
taking a look at the Gregg tech

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.140 
taking a look at the Gregg tech
industrial<00:00:08.040> electrolyzer<00:00:09.139> this<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.320> a

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
industrial electrolyzer this is a

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.789 
industrial electrolyzer this is a
machine<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.420> taking<00:00:13.049> over<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.290> lot<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
machine that is taking over a lot of the

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.099 
machine that is taking over a lot of the
recipes<00:00:14.250> from<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.089> industrial<00:00:15.780> centrifuge

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
recipes from the industrial centrifuge

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.410 
recipes from the industrial centrifuge
in<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.250> more<00:00:17.430> recent<00:00:17.520> versions<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.180> Gregg

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
in the more recent versions of Gregg

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.859 
in the more recent versions of Gregg
tech<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.850> really<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.060> makes<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.480> lot<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
tech and really it makes a lot of the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.720 
tech and really it makes a lot of the
important<00:00:22.380> recipes<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.100> need<00:00:23.250> for<00:00:23.490> some

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
important recipes that you need for some

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.359 
important recipes that you need for some
of<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.850> advanced<00:00:24.240> machines<00:00:24.740> it's<00:00:25.740> also<00:00:25.949> it

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
of the advanced machines it's also it

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.060 
of the advanced machines it's also it
used<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.539> silicon<00:00:27.990> cells<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.680> variety<00:00:28.920> of

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
used for silicon cells and a variety of

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.250 
used for silicon cells and a variety of
other<00:00:29.279> things<00:00:29.340> as<00:00:29.730> well<00:00:29.910> there<00:00:30.869> are<00:00:31.109> other

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
other things as well there are other

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.680 
other things as well there are other
ways<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.650> making<00:00:32.040> some<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.340> these<00:00:32.399> but<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.540> is

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
ways of making some of these but this is

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.979 
ways of making some of these but this is
a<00:00:33.719> pretty<00:00:34.559> nice<00:00:34.800> way<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.100> doing<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.520> as<00:00:35.640> well

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
a pretty nice way of doing it as well

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.930 
a pretty nice way of doing it as well
I've<00:00:36.989> also<00:00:37.170> brought<00:00:37.469> back<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.070> computer<00:00:38.640> cube

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
I've also brought back the computer cube

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.240 
I've also brought back the computer cube
for<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.329> particular<00:00:40.200> tutorial<00:00:40.320> because

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
for this particular tutorial because

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.220 
for this particular tutorial because
there's<00:00:41.610> an<00:00:41.730> important<00:00:42.149> feature<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
there's an important feature to the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.590 
there's an important feature to the
computer<00:00:43.710> cube<00:00:44.040> if<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.500> click<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.600> M

the<00:00:49.170> mode<00:00:49.559> button<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:50.300> it'll<00:00:51.300> go<00:00:51.390> through

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
the mode button here it'll go through

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.360 
the mode button here it'll go through
the<00:00:51.629> different<00:00:51.780> modes<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.010> very<00:00:53.160> last

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the different modes and the very last

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.819 
the different modes and the very last
mode<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.210> version<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.020> Gregg<00:00:55.469> tech<00:00:55.710> that

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
mode on the version of Gregg tech that

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.099 
mode on the version of Gregg tech that
I'm<00:00:55.920> using<00:00:56.100> right<00:00:56.340> now<00:00:56.370> which<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.660> little

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
I'm using right now which is a little

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.510 
I'm using right now which is a little
bit<00:00:58.199> outdated<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.800> what's<00:00:58.949> we're<00:00:59.250> out<00:00:59.370> there

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
bit outdated for what's we're out there

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.080 
bit outdated for what's we're out there
right<00:00:59.670> now<00:00:59.699> but<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.739> basic<00:01:02.579> operation<00:01:03.000> I

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
right now but the basic operation I

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.359 
right now but the basic operation I
believe<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> same<00:01:03.650> but<00:01:04.650> if<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.280> go

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
believe is the same but if you go

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.800 
believe is the same but if you go
through<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> modes<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.150> last<00:01:06.330> mode<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.780> I

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
through the modes the last mode that I

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.630 
through the modes the last mode that I
have<00:01:07.020> right<00:01:07.229> now<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.710> electrolyzer

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
have right now is the electrolyzer

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.240 
have right now is the electrolyzer
recipes<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:10.140> has<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> current

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
recipes and it has all of the current

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.870 
recipes and it has all of the current
electrolyzer<00:01:11.880> recipes<00:01:12.500> listed<00:01:13.700> so<00:01:14.700> that

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
electrolyzer recipes listed so that

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.210 
electrolyzer recipes listed so that
makes<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.270> very<00:01:15.570> great<00:01:16.020> way<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.229> make<00:01:16.860> sure<00:01:17.070> that

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
makes a very great way to make sure that

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.060 
makes a very great way to make sure that
you're<00:01:17.490> looking<00:01:18.299> at<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> most<00:01:18.780> recent

you're looking at the most recent
recipes<00:01:20.070> available<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:21.080> what<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.380> is

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
recipes available and what I have is

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.170 
recipes available and what I have is
I've<00:01:22.979> got<00:01:23.100> some<00:01:23.130> flint<00:01:23.520> dust<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.939> I've<00:01:24.000> got

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
I've got some flint dust and I've got

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.749 
I've got some flint dust and I've got
some<00:01:24.330> empty<00:01:24.630> cells<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.320> we're<00:01:26.310> going<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.549> put

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
some empty cells and we're going to put

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.100 
some empty cells and we're going to put
those<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.850> you<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.119> spot

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
those in here so the you have this spot

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.929 
those in here so the you have this spot
right<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.740> where<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.790> put<00:01:32.820> your

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
right here is where you put your

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.090 
right here is where you put your
containers<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.890> take<00:01:35.070> your

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
containers and then you take your

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.980 
containers and then you take your
material<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.030> want<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.390> put<00:01:36.840> through

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
material that you want to put through

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.719 
material that you want to put through
your<00:01:37.140> electric<00:01:37.590> process<00:01:38.220> through<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
your electric process through the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.010 
your electric process through the
electrolyzer<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.600> case<00:01:39.780> we're<00:01:39.930> gonna

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
electrolyzer in this case we're gonna

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.200 
electrolyzer in this case we're gonna
use<00:01:40.140> flint<00:01:40.560> dust<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:41.880> drop<00:01:42.180> it

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
use flint dust and you just drop it

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.670 
use flint dust and you just drop it
right<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.750> bottom<00:01:43.590> here<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:45.680> this

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
right in the bottom here and this

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.940 
right in the bottom here and this
particular<00:01:46.890> recipe<00:01:47.579> takes<00:01:47.850> 5,000<00:01:48.600> EU<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.290> it

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
particular recipe takes 5,000 EU and it

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.580 
particular recipe takes 5,000 EU and it
will<00:01:50.040> take<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:51.049> 128<00:01:52.049> EU<00:01:52.619> protect<00:01:53.509> so

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
will take up to 128 EU protect so

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.539 
will take up to 128 EU protect so
basically<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:57.890> mean<00:01:58.890> divide

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
basically it's going to mean divide

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.639 
basically it's going to mean divide
5,000<00:02:00.149> by<00:02:00.240> 128<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.930> you'll<00:02:01.049> see<00:02:01.229> how<00:02:01.439> long

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
5,000 by 128 and you'll see how long

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.550 
5,000 by 128 and you'll see how long
that<00:02:01.710> recipe<00:02:02.310> will<00:02:02.460> take<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.820> complete<00:02:03.560> so

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that recipe will take to complete so

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.469 
that recipe will take to complete so
this<00:02:04.920> one<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.340> chose<00:02:05.700> because<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.299> fairly

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
this one I chose because it's a fairly

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.040 
this one I chose because it's a fairly
quick<00:02:06.750> recipe<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:08.539> that's<00:02:09.539> basically<00:02:09.959> all

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
quick recipe and that's basically all

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.570 
quick recipe and that's basically all
there<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
there is to it

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.820 
there is to it
once<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.209> recipe<00:02:12.750> finishes<00:02:13.170> up<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.560> will

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
once this recipe finishes up it will

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.030 
once this recipe finishes up it will
put<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.970> output<00:02:15.150> items<00:02:15.660> in<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.960> top<00:02:16.710> four

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
put the output items in the top four

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.140 
put the output items in the top four
slots<00:02:17.430> here<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.920> we<00:02:19.920> should<00:02:20.280> see<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.550> happen

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
slots here and we should see that happen

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.850 
slots here and we should see that happen
in<00:02:21.360> just<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.900> moment<00:02:22.230> here<00:02:24.410> what<00:02:25.410> I've<00:02:25.530> got<00:02:25.680> set

in just a moment here what I've got set
up<00:02:25.980> back<00:02:26.160> here<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.790> have<00:02:27.120> one<00:02:27.600> adjustable

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
up back here is I have one adjustable

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.070 
up back here is I have one adjustable
storage<00:02:28.680> unit<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.340> outputting<00:02:29.910> 128<00:02:30.660> EU

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
storage unit that is outputting 128 EU

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.730 
storage unit that is outputting 128 EU
protect<00:02:31.470> for<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.720> electrolyzer<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:34.020> then<00:02:34.650> I

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
protect for the electrolyzer and then I

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.260 
protect for the electrolyzer and then I
have<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.010> other<00:02:35.130> one<00:02:35.250> here<00:02:35.580> that's<00:02:35.730> just<00:02:36.060> set

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
have this other one here that's just set

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.800 
have this other one here that's just set
to<00:02:36.350> 32<00:02:37.350> so<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.430> will<00:02:38.520> power<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:39.150> computer

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
to 32 so that it will power the computer

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.650 
to 32 so that it will power the computer
cube<00:02:40.260> without<00:02:40.350> blowing<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:40.980> up<00:02:41.660> computer

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
cube without blowing that up computer

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.170 
cube without blowing that up computer
cube<00:02:42.840> only<00:02:42.990> takes<00:02:43.320> 32<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.340> gotta<00:02:44.790> be<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.940> little

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
cube only takes 32 so gotta be a little

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.970 
cube only takes 32 so gotta be a little
bit<00:02:45.270> careful<00:02:45.420> there<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.470> can<00:02:46.620> see<00:02:46.800> that

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
bit careful there and you can see that

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.920 
bit careful there and you can see that
our<00:02:47.280> Flint<00:02:47.790> finished<00:02:48.180> up<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.660> we<00:02:48.750> got<00:02:48.900> a

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
our Flint finished up and we got a

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.340 
our Flint finished up and we got a
silicon<00:02:49.380> cell<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.890> compressed<00:02:50.310> air<00:02:50.550> cell

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
silicon cell and a compressed air cell

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.850 
silicon cell and a compressed air cell
so<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.710> hope<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:53.820> helps<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.210> guys<00:02:54.390> out<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:55.020> I
