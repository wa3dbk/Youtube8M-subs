technical precision and here at the
front<00:00:18.680> of<00:00:18.770> the<00:00:18.920> car<00:00:19.220> we've<00:00:19.820> taken<00:00:20.119> a<00:00:20.420> bold<00:00:20.660> step

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
front of the car we've taken a bold step

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.200 
front of the car we've taken a bold step
forward<00:00:21.440> to<00:00:21.590> really<00:00:21.860> create<00:00:22.130> very<00:00:22.640> sporty

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
forward to really create very sporty

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.810 
forward to really create very sporty
look<00:00:23.390> for<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:23.750> Astra<00:00:24.230> which<00:00:25.070> squeeze<00:00:25.580> the

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
look for the Astra which squeeze the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.210 
look for the Astra which squeeze the
upper<00:00:26.119> grille<00:00:26.390> so<00:00:26.750> it's<00:00:26.900> very<00:00:27.080> quiet<00:00:27.439> and<00:00:27.770> slim

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
upper grille so it's very quiet and slim

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.400 
upper grille so it's very quiet and slim
and<00:00:28.790> really<00:00:29.090> made<00:00:29.270> the<00:00:29.450> lower<00:00:29.689> grill<00:00:29.990> itself

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
and really made the lower grill itself

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.860 
and really made the lower grill itself
much<00:00:31.010> more<00:00:31.250> dominant<00:00:31.789> so<00:00:32.029> it<00:00:32.150> drags<00:00:32.450> your<00:00:32.690> ride

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.890 
areas throughout the vehicle to really
make<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.650> practical<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:12.580> really<00:02:12.910> fit<00:02:13.510> in<00:02:13.660> with

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
make it practical and really fit in with

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.780 
make it practical and really fit in with
our<00:02:13.930> values<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.860> functionality<00:02:15.700> and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
our values of functionality and

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.110 
our values of functionality and
flexibility

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
flexibility

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.839 
flexibility
but<00:02:17.750> overall<00:02:18.110> I<00:02:18.290> think<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.980> impact<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.610> get

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
but overall I think the impact you get

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.539 
but overall I think the impact you get
is<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.629> very<00:02:21.110> high<00:02:21.500> quality<00:02:21.890> interior

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
is of this very high quality interior

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.720 
is of this very high quality interior
that<00:02:23.360> really<00:02:23.870> creates<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.650> very<00:02:24.890> sporty<00:02:25.459> feel

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
that really creates a very sporty feel

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.510 
that really creates a very sporty feel
for<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.060> future
