through a lot of testing for that and
one<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> test<00:00:51.750> results<00:00:52.289> were<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:53.820> blood

test<00:00:54.300> results<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.530> was<00:00:55.770> not<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> donor

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
test results and I was not a donor

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.110

and I did I went I skipped over the the
easier<00:01:14.720> protocol<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.810> went<00:01:15.930> right<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
easier protocol and went right to the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.899 
easier protocol and went right to the
protocol<00:01:17.400> mm<00:01:18.060> yes<00:01:18.390> stronger<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:20.520> did

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.639 
research I want to find something else
that's<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.700> think<00:02:03.000> more<00:02:03.360> healthy<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.869> so

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
that's I think more healthy and so

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.950 
that's I think more healthy and so
that's<00:02:04.950> when<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.159> did<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.820> program<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
that's when I did the program the the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.279 
that's when I did the program the the
2000<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.680> think<00:02:07.860> they<00:02:07.950> call

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
2000 I think they call

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.399 
2000 I think they call
and<00:02:08.590> I<00:02:09.519> did<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.450> cut<00:02:10.629> it<00:02:10.720> short<00:02:10.750> just<00:02:11.049> by<00:02:11.379> a

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:11.409 
and I did that cut it short just by a

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.530 
and I did that cut it short just by a
few<00:02:11.680> days<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:12.310> then<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:12.970> doctor<00:02:13.329> called

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
few days and then the doctor called

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.759 
few days and then the doctor called
about<00:02:13.720> three<00:02:13.900> weeks<00:02:14.110> later<00:02:14.349> and<00:02:14.470> says<00:02:14.620> I'm

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
about three weeks later and says I'm

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.199 
about three weeks later and says I'm
really<00:02:15.040> concerned<00:02:15.370> about<00:02:15.519> you<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:16.030> need<00:02:16.180> to

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
come in and get more testing and start

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.520 
come in and get more testing and start
on<00:02:19.510> your<00:02:20.159> your<00:02:21.180> therapy<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.780> know<00:02:22.900> they<00:02:23.079> kill

you and I had told him no no I'm not
doing<00:02:27.819> that<00:02:27.849> and<00:02:28.090> he<00:02:28.180> says<00:02:28.360> well<00:02:28.540> would<00:02:28.659> you<00:02:28.780> at

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
doing that and he says well would you at

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.589 
doing that and he says well would you at
least<00:02:28.930> consider<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.530> liver<00:02:30.459> biopsy<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.269> I<00:02:31.390> did

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
least consider a liver biopsy and I did

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.050 
least consider a liver biopsy and I did
so<00:02:32.379> I<00:02:32.440> did<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.709> liver<00:02:32.920> biopsy<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.670> little

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
so I did the liver biopsy a little

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.580 
so I did the liver biopsy a little
hesitant<00:02:34.510> but<00:02:34.659> I<00:02:34.750> thought<00:02:34.959> well<00:02:35.109> I<00:02:35.140> just<00:02:35.409> did

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
hesitant but I thought well I just did

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.559 
hesitant but I thought well I just did
this<00:02:35.769> whole<00:02:35.829> treatment<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:36.940> is<00:02:37.000> one<00:02:37.359> way<00:02:37.540> to

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
this whole treatment this is one way to

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.479 
this whole treatment this is one way to
find<00:02:37.900> out<00:02:38.140> how<00:02:38.349> it's<00:02:38.530> working

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
find out how it's working

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.960 
find out how it's working
so<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.670> did<00:02:39.879> the<00:02:40.000> biopsy<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:41.640> he<00:02:42.640> says<00:02:42.819> you'll

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
so I did the biopsy and he says you'll

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.610 
so I did the biopsy and he says you'll
hear<00:02:43.120> from<00:02:43.239> me<00:02:43.359> in<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.480> few<00:02:43.659> days<00:02:43.840> well<00:02:44.200> in<00:02:44.409> those
