 so here are all the ingredients 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.090
 indispensable to prepare you a 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:14.549

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:28.070
 green peppers of the galangal root 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:32.399
 the equivalent of ginger scares me 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:39.440
 coriander seeds and leaves of 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:41.010
 kaffir lemon and that's the kaffir lemon 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.329
 two green peppers 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.239
 ten centimeters three four 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.699

 it's easy to find in 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.760
 Asian grocery stores 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.680
 so here is the green curry paste at the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.979
 size that we get in a way 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.650
 traditional with the pinon and need to 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.000
 less than half an hour we are lucky 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.070
 to have an end to the mix we're not going to 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.710
 try to do or at least to 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:25.619
 approach this preparation with the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:30.380
 thermomix we put all in the bowl we 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:35.990
 add lemon kaffir ouch 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:38.659

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.350
 circle pad no to the thermomix dwarfs and that 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.920
 it's the big peppers we have 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.560
 thermomix scabies in gas gas oil gas and 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.250
 the little pepper 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.610
 I'm just going in my opinion at the end 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.939
 add the shrimp paste so all 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.750
 the ingredients in the bowl three times 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.530
 ten seconds speed 10 and we have a 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.750
 beautiful consistency 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.120
 so I reserve and I will show you 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.640
 how to make chicken curry at the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.730
 cut 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.660
 green curry of course that has nothing to do 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.000
 with Indian curry 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.000
 not very different 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.770
 but OK
