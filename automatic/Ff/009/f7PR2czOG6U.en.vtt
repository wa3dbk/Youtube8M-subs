 that's it dear, I'll show you 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.140
 today how to make fla is a lot of people me 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.330
 asked how the realist fla does 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.230
 And you can make that rainbow too. 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.539

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.520
 impresses your customer a lot because 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.559
 can turn a painting on his wall into 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.120
 room and you do only advertisement 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.629
 free of charge 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.559
 and let's go there was this photo I did already 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.289
 Some time and I'll show you here. 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.469
 crude would not be this picture here I 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.140
 I was pulling it as much as possible the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.199
 here to give a concept of 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.890
 composition is this so I have one 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.469
 son bonatti they are in fibo na ti 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:05.519
 No, let me show you here the end. 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.010
 Bonatti here 么 么 么 么 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.750
 and I'm also using the concept of 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.979
 rule of thirds the rule of thirds 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.909
 legal you can also use several 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.600
 contexts 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.210
 I am also using a context of 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.909
 perspective and in the context of 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.670
 against light then domain of light 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.979
 Okay, and ask to speak a language. 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.780
 more technical, but we'll see right? 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.750
 so that's it folks let's start here 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.549
 You'll see that it's quick, I'm just going. 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.009
 give a little slice here in my area 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.670
 to get no more attention than 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.290
 Grooms right then the bride and groom have to be 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.979
 in the focus point there I'm going to give a 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.159
 light treatment here just by pulling a 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.110
 the definition and put a 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:57.329
 little chap a chat men 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:01.759
 So I'll just pull a little here to 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.409
 to have a little bit of definition ok 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.979
 I liked my photo 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.989
 and here only a little bit 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.720
 so come on, let's get it right. 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.390
 income we add our fla 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.480
 here I open here I see which fla 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:24.630
 where is my son was what happens 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:28.530

 here is the show is very handsome too 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.920
 but it's not that kind of fleck folks 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.220
 is wearing it 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:44.220
 I can here in 105 that I really like 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:47.220
 here decipher here oops oops oops oops 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.330
 There is no problem here, just you. 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.650
 ct 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.630
 now I come back I doubled my beloved 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.880
 What am I going to do here? 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.380
 I'm going to darken my dark darkened 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.270
 I'll apply again, will not stay for 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.540
 Last here, I found it, so I 'm going. 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.810
 use the shortcut against fmi already applied 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.209
 screen collor hurts we will not put 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.300
 Ok, I'm going to shrink just a little bit. 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.180
 here to be convincing against 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.890
 oo the statures do not take saturation here 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.200
 I do not want it to interfere with color 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.780
 the beast interfered in the water if you did not 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.450
 You want this part here, you see it here. 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.340
 Then you come and remove it, you can use the 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.840
 stamp 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.910
 You can use the flag, okay? I 'm 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.630
 working over the goal to mass in the 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:43.560
 O dark layer at 80% filler 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:47.299
 Very good beauty here I guess. 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.920
 hatay and already team the fla if you do not want 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.110
 leave it the way it is here you can 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.920
 manipulate it because it is in another 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:59.070
 layer the legal loop I can increase the 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.830
 my point of diffusion it may come more 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.060
 from the corner to here or from here to here too 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.680
 beauty 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.200
 So that's it, folks, then just give a 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.630
 My little ass, right? 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.250
 then I will do the following O will take a 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:17.459
 corzinha see how it is here one 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.430
 little thing and such a dim light 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.090
 I can give you some tea, have it here. 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.090
 for power 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.150
 gives a little more intensity not 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.540
 I liked boot just a little bit ok then I 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.930
 I got here gives a little of 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.210
 density 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.310
 Ok, let's see how our craft is. 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.740
 program is missing a bit of 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.770
 white ac but I like it and here one 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.340
 A little more beauty, that's it 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.270
 people 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:50.540
 let's make a rainbow freight here is 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.310
 To go back there, I'm going to go there. 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:57.640
 recompose an image to put in the end 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.640
 Bonatti here I'll do the same render 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:07.790
 only I'm going to use the 50 to 300 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:12.590
 I can put this right here and let's go 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:31.940
 see if our rainbow there does not come back 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:35.000
 new render back there we already 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.310
 Got rainbow here is a nice okay 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.880
 got rainbow here then let's go 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.160
 duplicate control or against now 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.880
 against the hull and I'm going to throw lights 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.950
 huh 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:51.740
 and I'll reapply my render or faith a 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:06:03.520
 screen screen 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:06:05.690
 now that I'm going to do I'll put the or 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.710
 transform this here you will not change here 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.300
 the dollar ready in the direction that just 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.590
 It was on his shirt that the sun is coming. 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.580
 from there right to stay cool I will 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.670
 put here 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:23.570
 I remember I was bedridden black right then 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:26.240
 I can erase 30% here, there's a way 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.980
 here the pope now diminishes a little bit 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.240
 the rubber 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:35.200
 I can put a little bit at 100% and 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.200
 public 

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:43.039
 Love to pay up right now because 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:47.899
 I duplicated it, she saw something. 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:51.649
 How beautiful that you stayed there to annoy the 

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:54.919
 layers and I'll give a little bit of density 

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:57.529
 there beauty will change a little bit of 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:03.439
 plate 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:07.219
 Okay, well then everybody's done. 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:10.579
 blue I'm going to do I'll take the 

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:16.039
 attention of my sand couple have to have 

00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:18.969
 the overall beauty attention occupies a 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:18.969
 A little more here 

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:26.329
 backlight do not go down a little light 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:28.009
 and now I'm going to go up and back to the color of the 

00:07:26.329 --> 00:07:30.979
 my photo next to a little bit of 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:34.519
 korla is great 

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:37.219
