and control okay basically the most
simple<00:00:30.779> device<00:00:31.109> either<00:00:31.800> keep<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:33.120> can

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
simple device either keep and you can

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.639 
simple device either keep and you can
see<00:00:33.450> here<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.410> have<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.590> keypad<00:00:35.160> without<00:00:35.969> any

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
see here we have a keypad without any

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
force feed peace pipe function we have

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.979 
force feed peace pipe function we have
only<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.050> joystick<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.160> some<00:00:42.090> buttons<00:00:42.450> like

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
only in joystick and some buttons like

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.920 
only in joystick and some buttons like
this<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.370> connect<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.120> commuters<00:00:45.629> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
this you can connect it to commuters to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.119 
this you can connect it to commuters to
play<00:00:46.170> also<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:46.890> control<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.489> robot<00:00:47.730> robot

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
play also we can control the robot robot

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.680 
play also we can control the robot robot
okay<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.440> we<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.649> use<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.850> steering

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
okay so and we can use the steering

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.880 
okay so and we can use the steering
steering<00:00:55.530> wheel<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.550> drive<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.899> car<00:00:57.930> from

feedback<00:01:14.760> from<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.390> device<00:01:16.159> okay<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.460> now

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
feedback from this device okay and now

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.899 
feedback from this device okay and now
you<00:01:18.210> also<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.340> ipad<00:01:20.340> or<00:01:20.640> iphone<00:01:21.420> or<00:01:22.229> I

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
you also can you the ipad or iphone or I

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.240 
you also can you the ipad or iphone or I
put<00:01:23.909> out<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.750> control<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:28.020> mobile<00:01:28.619> robots<00:01:29.009> at

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
put out to control the mobile robots at

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.719 
put out to control the mobile robots at
well<00:01:29.549> right<00:01:31.009> okay<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:33.299> problem<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.729> those

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
well right okay the problem is those

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.319 
well right okay the problem is those
device<00:01:36.570> are<00:01:36.930> too<00:01:37.380> expensive<00:01:37.880> except<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.060> one

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
device are too expensive except this one

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.770 
device are too expensive except this one
okay<00:01:40.759> but<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.000> one<00:01:43.159> this<00:01:44.159> cannot<00:01:44.909> give<00:01:45.750> you

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
okay but this one this cannot give you

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.730 
okay but this one this cannot give you
the<00:01:46.460> steering<00:01:47.460> or<00:01:47.670> driving<00:01:48.210> feeling<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.619> is

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
the steering or driving feeling that is

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.490 
the steering or driving feeling that is
a<00:01:49.770> problem<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.640> nay<00:01:50.880> no<00:01:51.090> fun<00:01:51.360> for<00:01:51.570> subscriber

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
a problem so nay no fun for subscriber

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.429 
a problem so nay no fun for subscriber
per<00:01:53.149> game<00:01:54.149> controller<00:01:54.600> right<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:57.439> we

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
per game controller right so here we

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.220 
per game controller right so here we
have

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
have

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.090 
have
we<00:02:00.440> have<00:02:00.620> developed<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:01.480> controller<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:03.500> read

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
we have developed a controller to read

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.050 
we have developed a controller to read
to<00:02:05.060> replace<00:02:05.510> several<00:02:06.470> type<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:07.190> current

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
to replace several type of current

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.750 
to replace several type of current
haptic<00:02:08.360> device<00:02:08.660> like<00:02:09.080> joystick<00:02:10.040> like

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
haptic device like joystick like

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.390 
haptic device like joystick like
steering<00:02:11.720> wheel<00:02:11.900> like<00:02:12.740> remote<00:02:13.550> control<00:02:13.940> or

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
steering wheel like remote control or

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.060 
steering wheel like remote control or
phantom<00:02:16.400> for<00:02:16.820> example<00:02:17.180> is<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.890> reason<00:02:18.890> and

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
phantom for example is the reason and

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.210 
phantom for example is the reason and
the<00:02:19.520> motivation<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.300> start<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.110> resource<00:02:21.530> is<00:02:21.710> we

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
the motivation to start a resource is we

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.420 
the motivation to start a resource is we
want<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.060> reduce<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.900> cost<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:25.130> device

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
want to reduce the cost of the device

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.750 
want to reduce the cost of the device
and<00:02:25.670> second<00:02:26.450> we<00:02:26.690> want<00:02:26.990> to<00:02:27.620> have<00:02:27.860> portable

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
and second we want to have portable

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.980 
and second we want to have portable
device<00:02:29.030> which<00:02:30.020> is<00:02:30.730> portable<00:02:31.990> simple

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
device which is portable simple

toaster<00:03:13.490> and<00:03:13.840> here<00:03:14.840> gonzaque<00:03:15.260> have<00:03:15.530> mobile

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
toaster and here gonzaque have mobile

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.140 
toaster and here gonzaque have mobile
robots<00:03:16.760> in<00:03:17.530> outdoor<00:03:18.530> environment<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.459> we

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
robots in outdoor environment and we

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.500 
robots in outdoor environment and we
have<00:03:20.330> a<00:03:20.360> indoor<00:03:21.140> my<00:03:21.560> robot<00:03:21.950> or<00:03:22.390> military<00:03:23.390> my

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
have a indoor my robot or military my

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.229 
have a indoor my robot or military my
variables<00:03:23.989> with<00:03:24.260> gun<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:24.860> underwater<00:03:25.700> robust

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
variables with gun and underwater robust

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.920 
variables with gun and underwater robust
so<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.260> application<00:03:27.739> are<00:03:27.920> very<00:03:28.400> rich<00:03:28.760> ok<00:03:29.420> so

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
so the application are very rich ok so

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.320 
so the application are very rich ok so
now<00:03:30.080> they<00:03:30.140> are<00:03:30.380> normal<00:03:31.040> haptics<00:03:31.610> interface

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
now they are normal haptics interface

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.070 
now they are normal haptics interface
and<00:03:34.540> let<00:03:35.540> me<00:03:35.810> introduce<00:03:36.709> you<00:03:36.950> deep

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
and let me introduce you deep

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.420 
and let me introduce you deep
how<00:03:38.590> hectic<00:03:39.510> interface<00:03:40.510> is<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:41.830> next<00:03:42.130> video

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
how hectic interface is the next video

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.600 
how hectic interface is the next video
clip

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610
