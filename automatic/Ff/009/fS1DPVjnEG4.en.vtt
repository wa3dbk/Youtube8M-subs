00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.769
 beautiful that her back in aside 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.940
 second part of my equipment and 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.740
 equipment video 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.450
 Today I show you what I mean 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.180
 camera on the helmet and fixed 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.410
 which stones are annoying because I always 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.150
 I'm asked again how I like the camera 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.890
 moored which microphone was not 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.210
 use as good as my sound quality 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.680
 So I'm always coming back 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.750
 comments where people put me on it 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.640
 point out that I'm right one 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.199
 good sound quality and that's why 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.020
 I just wanted to show you today 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.180
 how can I do that under my helmet? 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.790
 so now I have now the of 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.710
 mount we can always watch a video 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.020
 that means my camera is here on the front 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.719
 child that now no camera in it 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.070
 just because that's loading but me 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.110
 believe you can see how the whole set up 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.629
 is such a rounded front here 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.710
 glue petra made you see quite well 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.210
 then I have each one here 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.480
 extension pieces made with it 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.219
 the whole thing led this way forward 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.039
 So it looks like a bit 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.860
 80 out but so from the side 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.420
 is it actually from the side sees 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.490
 Stops a bit strange and the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.560
 it does all the extensions but it does 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.689
 and that does not wobble and above all 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.170
 Although I managed to do that by myself 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.409
 there you see such a little bit of the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.540
 2 adhesive strips in this bracket 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.740
 glued and thus it wobbles 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.200
 it does not stop that completely 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.570
 vibration free I can do that now 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.829
 practically not anymore but me 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.990
 anyway have no and front the 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.460
 if I take that part off 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.079
 somehow I have to work 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.140
 then I'll just write that loose here 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.520
 That just stays a dealer 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.960
 yes to get the sound in the videos 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.750
 I have such a small hole here 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.280
 I just made it into the housing 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.810
 I simply use a drill then 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.240
 pre-drilled and then with a small 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.270
 arrow that still a bit square 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.189
 made because you can use the usb adapter from 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.549
 plug microphone in directly and then 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.380
 I can get down without any 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.119
 edit or synchronize the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.329
 sound directly on the camera when driving 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.399
 So that 's very helpful the microphone 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.829
 unfortunately, then you go about this 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.220
 three meters of cable which is a bit long 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.470
 in the helmet pure 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.410
 then the cable goes here under the 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.430
 wind deflector ago so the microphone on 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.700
 tight front just between the two 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.830
 Banks windows clamped that gives the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.590
 best sound ever because you stop by 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.650
 the wind deflector hardly wind noise on 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.170
 but have microphone that by that 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.580
 microphone right in front of her mouth is hers 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.690
 the language quality stop has really cool 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.520
 to the microphone itself I have one more 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.810
 windbreak made off just 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.520
 I swung a piece out 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.400
 cut in the middle eroded 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.400
 and then with a rubber band around it 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.530
 that she looks pretty primitive 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.330
 but really much so the wind noise 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.440
 are suppressed very effectively 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.230
 And most of all you do not have the whole thing 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.620
 time so what you can in English pubs 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.420
 calls the microphone itself only has me 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.950
 I cost you six euros 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.840
 also linked below in the description 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.130
 you can just have a look 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.130
 you'll also find everything about me here 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.830
 just talk and the most expensive was 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.410
 actually this usb adapter so 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.030
 this usb on clinker adapter here for 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.670
 Microphones were more expensive than the microphone 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:23.150
 in itself so what the camera I 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:25.160
 use that is not a coproduction 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.870
 More the newest model but I see 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.000
 actually no reason at all 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.100
 to slip off now 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.080
 So the video quality is good that can 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.450
 all I need is take in 60 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.010
 fps on battery life is even one 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.890
 a little better than the newer ones 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.480
 cameras and unfortunately it will not 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.750
 sold more so you can only the 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.450
 3plus or the four get the 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.700
 four silver should actually be exactly that 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.450
 We can even do the same here 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.610
 120 fps, so what if you record 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.200
 on extreme slow motion is so the 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.850
 I'll have you instead 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.590
 I also have one now 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.090
 order second camera if all is well 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.670
 It's already up to the next one 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.519
 engine block then you will me 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.010
 namely from two perspectives 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.360
 could now also the gopro hero 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.190
 ordered his last year 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.790
 The result is the 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.810
 beginner camera costs 120 euros 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.430
 then you can not start over 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.650
 Seeing the hero needs that 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.479
 I actually cool 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.860
 There are a few changes of perspective 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.500
 maybe something more exciting then 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.860
 to look 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.139
 the problem is this 120 euro camera 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.060
 gopro is really good, too 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.550
 Everyone recommends one 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.930
 but would like to buy the entry-level camera 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.300
 does not support external microphones 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.169
 that is, if you want to motor blocks 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:47.020
 then you have to go at least one go per 4 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.940
 take silver for 200 euros 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.229
 and there you can just an external 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.500
 connect the microphone 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.419
 you can control the image via wifi 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.590
 So how is that aligned now 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.169
 but all the functions that I find 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.260
 second camera does not necessarily need and 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.240
 That's why I have the gopro now 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.310
 hero taken as a second camera 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.780
 So as you said you can down in 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.250
 look at the description of everything where I am 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.510
 I just talked to the conclusion and 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.070
 give families a little tip 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.260
 how I align my camera 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.789
 namely, there is a little trick 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.770
 with which he could align the camera 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.090
 without stopping to make the wireless on and on 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.349
 the cell phone to see if the camera 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.530
 is properly aligned 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:25.660
 you have to just up here on this 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.610
 line here this upper edge of the 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.289
 cutout for the visor is namely 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.669
 quite parallel to the axis on the 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.770
 you look out to the front 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.410
 that is if you just the camera 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.560
 Parallel to this you have the 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.180
 It's about the same as your helmet 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.729
 If you look a little 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.720
 just a little bit deeper 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.220
 a little bit grad 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.840
 then you still have that 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.090
 motorcycle with the field of view and that is 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.310
 just like me, my camera always 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.020
 align and with this little trick 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.580
 I never have to look out of the wifi if the 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.229
 camera is aligned correctly 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.479
 that is very helpful for 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:58.599
 those of you who may be 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.400
 decide 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:02.349
 the beginner gopro to buy because he 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.820
 there is no radio connection around 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.500
 look up how the picture is aligned 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.180
 so i hope you have this little one 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.530
 setup video helped a bit further 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.610
 if I forgot something then 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.130
 just write something in the comments 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.419
 you still want to know if you know 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.340
 I want what to protective clothing driver 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.560
 just look in the first part of this 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.139
 I also link videos at the end again 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.180
 and as soon as my beginner garrido 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.650
 arrives I will also still a small 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.340
 compares video make between the 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:30.639
 under sj 4000 because yes is often asked 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.990
 as compared to the sj 4000 now 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.230
 to the body beats 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.300
 And now there's a group, too 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.650
 same price category is lends itself 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.400
 that's a comparison of her 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.080
 shut 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.940
 that will definitely be in 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.770
 come for the future and until then I say 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.770
 Bye and see you next time
