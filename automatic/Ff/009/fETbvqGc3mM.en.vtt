00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
but i says they're locked in by the tip

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.780 
but i says they're locked in by the tip
an<00:01:54.329> internal<00:01:54.960> tip<00:01:55.200> shaft<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.890> an<00:01:56.399> internal

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
an internal tip shaft and an internal

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.429 
an internal tip shaft and an internal
catch<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.360> then<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.840> collar

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
holding these blades and we're not going

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.120 
holding these blades and we're not going
to<00:02:01.740> come<00:02:01.920> out<00:02:02.030> also<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.570> they<00:02:03.750> are<00:02:04.130> they're

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
to come out also to is they are they're

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.100 
to come out also to is they are they're
tapered<00:02:05.460> blades<00:02:05.850> they<00:02:06.149> start<00:02:06.450> off<00:02:06.630> at<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> point

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
tapered blades they start off at a point

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.080 
tapered blades they start off at a point
zero<00:02:07.350> three<00:02:07.590> five<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.129> then<00:02:08.520> they<00:02:08.610> go<00:02:08.729> all<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
zero three five and then they go all the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.720 
zero three five and then they go all the
way<00:02:09.119> up<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.629> point<00:02:10.080> zero<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.530> zero<00:02:11.280> for

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
way up to a point zero to zero for

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.610 
way up to a point zero to zero for
sharpness<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.480> your<00:02:12.959> blades<00:02:13.230> are<00:02:13.379> really

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
sharpness so your blades are really

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.970 
sharpness so your blades are really
strong

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
strong

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.140 
strong
at<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.159> base<00:02:14.310> where<00:02:14.580> it's<00:02:14.670> important<00:02:15.060> you

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
at the base where it's important you

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.790 
at the base where it's important you
don't<00:02:15.239> want<00:02:15.450> them<00:02:15.540> breaking<00:02:15.629> off<00:02:15.989> so<00:02:16.019> it's

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
don't want them breaking off so it's

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.770 
don't want them breaking off so it's
really<00:02:16.980> nice<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.310> they<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:18.450> they<00:02:18.629> have

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
something like that and can really you

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.619 
something like that and can really you
know<00:02:20.220> hold<00:02:20.489> it<00:02:20.610> strength<00:02:20.970> especially<00:02:21.239> if

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.020 
move it over this string and it just
cuts<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.140> string<00:02:40.319> perfectly<00:02:40.920> that's<00:02:41.790> the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
cuts the string perfectly that's the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.430 
cuts the string perfectly that's the
great<00:02:42.239> thing<00:02:42.269> about<00:02:42.569> it<00:02:42.989> is<00:02:43.019> you're<00:02:43.260> going<00:02:43.349> to

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
be out there if you shoot an animal with

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.420 
be out there if you shoot an animal with
these<00:02:45.390> broad<00:02:45.629> heads<00:02:45.890> it's<00:02:46.890> going<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.069> be<00:02:47.190> cut

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
these broad heads it's going to be cut

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.860 
these broad heads it's going to be cut
in<00:02:47.549> both<00:02:47.819> ways<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.360> if<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.569> don't<00:02:48.720> get<00:02:48.810> a

in both ways so if you don't get a

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.630 
in both ways so if you don't get a
complete<00:02:49.230> pass<00:02:49.470> through<00:02:49.769> which<00:02:50.190> most<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:50.579> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
complete pass through which most of the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.920 
complete pass through which most of the
bows<00:02:50.790> nowadays<00:02:51.239> do<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.599> if<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.750> put<00:02:51.900> a

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
bows nowadays do and if you put a

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.360 
bows nowadays do and if you put a
perfect<00:02:52.319> shot<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.650> should<00:02:52.829> get<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.010> complete

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
perfect shot you should get a complete

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.830 
perfect shot you should get a complete
pass<00:02:53.579> through<00:02:53.790> but<00:02:54.239> let's<00:02:54.329> say<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.599> don't

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
pass through but let's say you don't

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.110 
pass through but let's say you don't
bureau<00:02:55.560> runs<00:02:55.920> off<00:02:56.160> on<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.519> animal<00:02:56.849> and<00:02:57.030> you

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
bureau runs off on the animal and you

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.580 
bureau runs off on the animal and you
watch<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:57.329> flipping<00:02:57.870> out<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.140> side<00:02:58.319> of<00:02:58.349> them

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
watch it flipping out the side of them

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.050 
watch it flipping out the side of them
