because<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.790> wasn't<00:04:00.090> really<00:04:00.299> interested<00:04:00.659> in<00:04:00.989> it

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
because I wasn't really interested in it

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.830 
because I wasn't really interested in it
it<00:04:01.579> looked<00:04:02.579> like<00:04:02.730> it<00:04:02.849> would<00:04:02.970> wash<00:04:03.180> out<00:04:03.390> my<00:04:03.599> face

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
it looked like it would wash out my face

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.800 
it looked like it would wash out my face
it<00:04:04.110> was<00:04:04.200> way<00:04:04.470> too<00:04:04.500> light<00:04:04.920> for<00:04:05.159> my<00:04:05.250> skin<00:04:05.519> tone

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
it was way too light for my skin tone

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.630 
it was way too light for my skin tone
and<00:04:06.810> they're<00:04:06.959> Reds<00:04:07.260> I've<00:04:07.650> never<00:04:08.310> been<00:04:08.610> a

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
and they're Reds I've never been a

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.800 
and they're Reds I've never been a
really<00:04:09.120> big<00:04:09.329> fan<00:04:09.629> of<00:04:09.659> like<00:04:10.549> the<00:04:11.629> Taylor<00:04:12.629> Swift

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.470 
really big fan of like the Taylor Swift
red<00:04:13.260> lip<00:04:13.470> except<00:04:14.040> for<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.489> other<00:04:14.640> day<00:04:14.849> when<00:04:15.450> I

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
red lip except for the other day when I

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.020 
red lip except for the other day when I
put<00:04:15.900> on<00:04:16.139> a<00:04:16.500> red<00:04:17.280> matte<00:04:18.109> lip<00:04:19.109> stain<00:04:19.620> it<00:04:20.010> was<00:04:20.459> kind

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
put on a red matte lip stain it was kind

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.700 
put on a red matte lip stain it was kind
of<00:04:21.120> like<00:04:21.299> a<00:04:21.359> liquid<00:04:21.810> lipstick<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.320> lip<00:04:22.440> stain

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
of like a liquid lipstick and lip stain

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.000 
of like a liquid lipstick and lip stain
in<00:04:22.889> one<00:04:23.300> but<00:04:24.300> it<00:04:24.479> was<00:04:24.630> beautiful<00:04:25.229> and<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.560> loved

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
in one but it was beautiful and I loved

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.700 
in one but it was beautiful and I loved
it<00:04:26.250> but<00:04:26.699> I<00:04:26.880> will<00:04:27.030> probably<00:04:27.270> be<00:04:27.810> purchasing<00:04:28.470> the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
it but I will probably be purchasing the

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.800 
it but I will probably be purchasing the
red<00:04:28.949> shades<00:04:29.280> of<00:04:29.520> these<00:04:29.669> matte<00:04:30.030> lipsticks

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
red shades of these matte lipsticks

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.680 
red shades of these matte lipsticks
because<00:04:31.080> I<00:04:31.680> actually<00:04:32.100> like<00:04:32.340> red<00:04:32.699> now<00:04:32.880> so<00:04:33.330> I

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
because I actually like red now so I

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.510 
because I actually like red now so I
don't<00:04:33.930> have<00:04:34.199> a<00:04:34.260> reason<00:04:34.530> not<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.770> get<00:04:34.919> them<00:04:35.070> the

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
don't have a reason not to get them the

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.909 
don't have a reason not to get them the
consistency<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.389> color<00:04:36.780> payoff<00:04:37.139> for<00:04:37.500> all<00:04:37.560> of

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
consistency and color payoff for all of

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.830 
consistency and color payoff for all of
the<00:04:38.010> sheets<00:04:38.280> that<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:38.580> showed<00:04:38.940> you<00:04:39.150> today<00:04:39.389> are

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
the sheets that I showed you today are

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.100 
the sheets that I showed you today are
pretty<00:04:40.320> much<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.889> same<00:04:41.120> except<00:04:42.120> for<00:04:42.240> a<00:04:42.479> select

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
pretty much the same except for a select

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.230 
pretty much the same except for a select
few<00:04:43.229> which<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:43.860> noticed<00:04:44.340> had<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.610> different

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
few which I noticed had a different

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.450 
few which I noticed had a different
finish<00:04:45.780> to<00:04:46.110> them<00:04:46.289> and<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.530> other<00:04:46.680> ones<00:04:46.950> I<00:04:47.250> just

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
finish to them and the other ones I just

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.320 
finish to them and the other ones I just
noticed<00:04:48.450> that<00:04:49.370> mesmerizing<00:04:50.370> magenta<00:04:51.000> and

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
noticed that mesmerizing magenta and

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.320 
noticed that mesmerizing magenta and
faint<00:04:51.870> for<00:04:52.169> fuchsia<00:04:52.530> felt<00:04:53.130> a<00:04:53.340> little<00:04:53.789> bit<00:04:53.940> less

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
faint for fuchsia felt a little bit less

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.629 
faint for fuchsia felt a little bit less
matte<00:04:54.840> than<00:04:55.289> the<00:04:55.650> other<00:04:55.830> ones<00:04:56.099> that<00:04:56.220> I<00:04:56.340> had

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
matte than the other ones that I had

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.760 
matte than the other ones that I had
swatched<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.450> I'm<00:04:57.840> not<00:04:57.990> sure<00:04:58.169> if<00:04:58.289> it's<00:04:58.410> maybe

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
swatched and I'm not sure if it's maybe

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.190 
swatched and I'm not sure if it's maybe
because<00:04:59.220> there's<00:04:59.430> such<00:04:59.669> a<00:04:59.700> bold<00:05:00.240> pink<00:05:00.840> and

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
because there's such a bold pink and

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.969 
because there's such a bold pink and
maybe<00:05:01.860> they<00:05:02.190> had<00:05:02.430> to<00:05:02.700> compensate<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:04.470> mattes

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
maybe they had to compensate the mattes

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.050 
maybe they had to compensate the mattes
for<00:05:05.669> a<00:05:06.150> bolder<00:05:06.810> color<00:05:07.200> and<00:05:07.680> it<00:05:08.310> just<00:05:08.669> didn't

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
for a bolder color and it just didn't

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.150 
for a bolder color and it just didn't
really<00:05:09.360> have<00:05:09.780> the<00:05:09.930> same<00:05:10.110> consistency<00:05:10.770> but

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
really have the same consistency but

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.820 
really have the same consistency but
it's<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:11.910> tiniest<00:05:12.449> difference<00:05:13.080> so<00:05:13.349> it's<00:05:13.530> not

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
it's the tiniest difference so it's not

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.260 
it's the tiniest difference so it's not
something<00:05:14.220> you're<00:05:14.280> really<00:05:14.430> gonna<00:05:14.639> notice<00:05:15.060> I

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
something you're really gonna notice I

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.420 
something you're really gonna notice I
have<00:05:15.690> a<00:05:15.720> lot<00:05:15.990> more<00:05:16.020> matte<00:05:16.590> lipstick<00:05:17.160> swatches

gives<00:05:51.330> it<00:05:51.450> a<00:05:51.539> bolder<00:05:51.870> look<00:05:52.110> so<00:05:52.680> if<00:05:53.099> you<00:05:53.310> do<00:05:53.520> that

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
gives it a bolder look so if you do that

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:54.200 
gives it a bolder look so if you do that
just<00:05:53.969> me

just me

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.939

sure<00:05:54.419> that<00:05:54.569> you<00:05:54.630> pick<00:05:54.900> a<00:05:55.050> lipliner<00:05:55.350> that's

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
sure that you pick a lipliner that's

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:58.400 
sure that you pick a lipliner that's
close<00:05:56.250> to<00:05:56.280> the<00:05:56.610> shade<00:05:56.910> that<00:05:57.150> you're<00:05:57.270> using<00:05:57.600> so

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
close to the shade that you're using so

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.469 
close to the shade that you're using so
it<00:05:58.889> will<00:05:59.069> just<00:05:59.340> make<00:05:59.880> everything<00:06:00.150> look<00:06:00.449> more

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
it will just make everything look more

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.320 
it will just make everything look more
bold<00:06:00.960> and<00:06:01.259> bright<00:06:01.530> or<00:06:02.069> dark<00:06:02.400> if<00:06:02.759> that's<00:06:03.120> what

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330

bold and bright or dark if that's what
you're<00:06:03.449> doing<00:06:03.720> but<00:06:04.440> I<00:06:04.800> just<00:06:05.340> thought<00:06:05.819> I'd

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
you're doing but I just thought I'd

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.400 
you're doing but I just thought I'd
throw<00:06:06.030> that<00:06:06.360> suggestion<00:06:06.810> out<00:06:07.080> there<00:06:07.289> because

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
throw that suggestion out there because

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.529 
throw that suggestion out there because
that's<00:06:07.620> what<00:06:07.830> I<00:06:07.860> normally<00:06:08.009> do<00:06:08.669> and<00:06:08.910> I<00:06:09.360> feel

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:10.640 
that's what I normally do and I feel

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650
