00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.719 
the next one that I have is from
american<00:01:40.560> eagle<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.130> one's<00:01:41.340> kind<00:01:41.610> of

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
american eagle and this one's kind of

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.069 
american eagle and this one's kind of
different<00:01:42.119> because<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.390> has<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.869> like

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
different because it has this like

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.590 
different because it has this like
really<00:01:43.829> cool<00:01:44.159> pattern<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:45.000> kind<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.329> as

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
really cool pattern it's kind of like as

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.630 
really cool pattern it's kind of like as
takia<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.439> not<00:01:46.590> really<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.070> tribal<00:01:47.280> print

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
takia it's not really like tribal print

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.429 
takia it's not really like tribal print
but<00:01:47.850> i<00:01:48.060> don't<00:01:48.689> know<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.869> kind<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.140> looks<00:01:49.350> like

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
but i don't know it kind of looks like

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.859 
but i don't know it kind of looks like
in<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:50.040> genre<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.210> just<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.540> pink

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
in that genre but it's just like pink

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.420 
in that genre but it's just like pink
purple<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.439> green<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.799> i<00:01:52.860> think<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.189> so

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
purple and green and i think it's so

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.819 
purple and green and i think it's so
pretty<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:54.299> then<00:01:54.479> unlike<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.020> sides<00:01:55.439> i<00:01:55.680> has

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
pretty but then unlike the sides i has

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.060 
pretty but then unlike the sides i has
like<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.219> weird<00:01:57.090> little<00:01:57.320> fringe<00:01:58.320> type<00:01:58.799> thing

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
like this weird little fringe type thing

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.010 
like this weird little fringe type thing
coming<00:01:59.549> off<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.670> has<00:01:59.939> like<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.270> design<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
coming off that has like this design and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.020 
coming off that has like this design and
i<00:02:01.229> think<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.530> adds<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.979> lot<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.490> makes<00:02:02.850> it

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
i think that adds a lot to it makes it

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.940 
i think that adds a lot to it makes it
look<00:02:03.210> different<00:02:03.780> than<00:02:04.079> other<00:02:04.290> scarves<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:04.920> i

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
look different than other scarves so i

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.649 
look different than other scarves so i
really<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:05.579> small<00:02:05.850> my<00:02:06.000> next<00:02:06.360> one<00:02:06.509> is
