00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.670
 mustard behave 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.840
 The idea there started here is not I'm a 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.970
 character people always in the sections that 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.820
 showed very well this province is my 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.390
 objective is equal to a law which may 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.530
 bring a carrot that you could 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.030
 take off some of the skin that will leave the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.750
 event and leaves the skin that now 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.820
 It's roll beets do not know if they accept 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.009
 now the protein was chosen from 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.960
 portugal in the drainer is squeezing 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.340
 a little to get the excess water out 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.920
 now we will move to the part of the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.930
 blender year I love this part here 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.800

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.220
 basil and chives may tear with 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.410

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.650
 do here because it is an example but 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.430
 If I was there I left the border 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.989
 connected and was pushing it into the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.440
 pass the protein inside boot to 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.000

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.769
 little oats to add fiber 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.390
 I also think it will be to use flour 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.950
 half wheat flour half flour 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.010
