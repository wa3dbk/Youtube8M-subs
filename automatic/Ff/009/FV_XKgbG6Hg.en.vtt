when<00:00:52.610> we<00:00:52.640> get<00:00:52.820> to<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.030> plant<00:00:53.300> they<00:00:53.809> get<00:00:53.960> up

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
when we get to the plant they get up

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.510 
when we get to the plant they get up
they're<00:00:54.410> just<00:00:54.559> trying<00:00:54.800> to<00:00:54.890> swing<00:00:55.160> the<00:00:55.309> same

train a drill the breakdowns in the
swing<00:01:01.879> so<00:01:02.570> today<00:01:02.840> I'm<00:01:02.960> going<00:01:03.079> to<00:01:03.140> present<00:01:03.289> you

swing so today I'm going to present you
a<00:01:03.739> program<00:01:04.280> that<00:01:04.430> we<00:01:04.520> developed<00:01:05.000> called<00:01:05.210> the

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
a program that we developed called the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.050 
a program that we developed called the
palm<00:01:06.020> up<00:01:06.289> push<00:01:06.560> snap<00:01:06.830> it's<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:07.610> very<00:01:07.820> simple

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
palm up push snap it's a very simple

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.570 
palm up push snap it's a very simple
program<00:01:08.630> that<00:01:08.660> consists<00:01:09.170> of<00:01:09.289> two<00:01:09.440> parts<00:01:09.740> two

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
program that consists of two parts two

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.570 
program that consists of two parts two
focuses<00:01:11.210> an<00:01:11.420> able<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.170> drill<00:01:12.530> train<00:01:13.250> and

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
focuses an able to drill train and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.790 
focuses an able to drill train and
identify<00:01:14.060> what<00:01:14.270> part<00:01:14.509> is<00:01:14.660> breaking<00:01:15.050> down<00:01:15.259> so

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
identify what part is breaking down so

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.870 
identify what part is breaking down so
after<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.160> while<00:01:16.280> you<00:01:16.340> aren't<00:01:16.580> going<00:01:16.700> to<00:01:16.759> be<00:01:16.850> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.300 
just simply involves focusing down the
rear<00:01:59.270> net<00:01:59.539> understand<00:02:00.500> of<00:02:00.739> the<00:02:00.860> foot<00:02:01.099> head

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
rear net understand of the foot head

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.850 
rear net understand of the foot head
we'll<00:02:02.149> drive<00:02:02.390> back<00:02:02.420> with<00:02:02.959> a<00:02:03.110> talk<00:02:03.349> against<00:02:03.679> one

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
we'll drive back with a talk against one

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.260 
we'll drive back with a talk against one
another<00:02:03.890> but<00:02:04.250> it's<00:02:04.369> more<00:02:04.520> of<00:02:04.580> a<00:02:04.700> brace<00:02:05.000> right

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
another but it's more of a brace right

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.120 
another but it's more of a brace right
now<00:02:05.479> it's<00:02:06.050> a<00:02:06.170> break<00:02:06.410> so<00:02:06.560> we<00:02:06.679> drive<00:02:06.890> back

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
now it's a break so we drive back

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.130 
now it's a break so we drive back
against<00:02:07.670> but<00:02:07.849> this<00:02:08.239> hit<00:02:08.479> is<00:02:08.569> going<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.810> go<00:02:08.929> from

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
here all the way rocky here so we could

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.050 
here all the way rocky here so we could
focus<00:02:11.450> on<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.870> rear<00:02:12.080> hip<00:02:12.790> pushing<00:02:13.790> out<00:02:13.910> the

it's a lot of consistency when we use a

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.220 
it's a lot of consistency when we use a
swing<00:03:08.459> it's<00:03:08.640> very<00:03:08.910> easy<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.420> drill<00:03:09.690> so<00:03:10.110> we're
