00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
 in doing so 

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.599
 well what happens in your mind after 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:15.490
 of this historic achievement 40 years without a 

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:15.490
 relevant fact and very happy 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.660
 what happens the second phase that play 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.340
 against the united states yes yes 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.000
 very important then 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.740
 now I say that the whole process of 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.910
 competition has been a bit long 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.910
 we will also have to learn from this 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.660
 the commitment of the center until it was 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.520
 very important then commitment because it 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.720
 has done a little bit long and ends up in 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.270
 some time with a little bit of 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.270
 spark we have not been harvesting but 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.130
 I think we 've been growing along 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.130
 of the competition 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.210
 maybe the best way to kadarÃ© today is not 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.519
 with a victory and with contribution from 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.379
 all team players today 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.750
 perhaps because of the meaning it has been Paul 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.570
 stoll but not for anything concrete 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.650
 that first always deserves a lot 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.920
 timely that water 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.650
 to the team and good and it goes from there 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.720
 It is thinking about reflecting 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.400
 professional that much work remains for 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.800
 do 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.890
 How nice to be here, what time will it be? 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.800
 one day if we really are not able to 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.300
 put on the overalls and know that 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.490
 what we have to do that is the 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.640
 There is still a lot to do and there is very 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.320
 little done with what I think it is 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.200
 a joy the final culmination is going to be 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.600
 fantastic as against us i think that 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.010
 that's going to like the Mexican public to 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.200
 the Mexican viewers to the 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.150
 Mexican players and coach 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.060
 magical 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.350
 I think that for everyone it will be very nice 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.660
 but that from there starts the 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.070
 countdown and if we want so that 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.350
 these 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.180
 it has been shown that with little but 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.540
 working is passed the things there are that 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.540
 to work 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:12.789
 and finally it's thinking about the goal 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.100
 with those medals for Mexicans 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.800
 they were meeting the objectives 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.170
 what is the feeling of the group should to 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.450
 your players are already in these 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.320
 instances the players are very 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.610
 happy and say what I'm not going face 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.840
 to the media communication and especially 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.840
 respect to you to the easy hobby 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.500
 I like at all times seriously not 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.440
 lie to anyone 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.060
 the objective to go through rooms this is going to 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.670
 be a fourth process the fourth in which 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.890
 let's see how much time we are 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.780
 able to get the USA to compete 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.569
 of the people and that's going to be the goal and 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.569
 really the motivation 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.569
 Thank you
