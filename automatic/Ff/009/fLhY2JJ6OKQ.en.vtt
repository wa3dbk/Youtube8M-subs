00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.769
 unlucky sunderland who doesn't 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.660
 looking at your 5 match win-win 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.809
 the series is still in the basement 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:20.600
 standings took in his field 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.600
 aston villa gioca a big and steven fletcher 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.490
 part of sunderland both came out to replace 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:37.010
 last match and leveled the score duel 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:40.699
 against cardiff knot and composition returned 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.739
 ron vilar and christian bentek dangerous 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.949
 moment at the gates of the guests already in the debut 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.210
 meeting here and fletcher 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.449
 nearly rolls the ball into the far corner 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.449
 the gate 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.670
 then a chance at korean 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.420
 midfielder sunderland and sleep yo 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.980
 but here's the mistake 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.420
 quite childish mistake 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.270
 ikator is small 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.270
 and gabriel agbonlahor 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:38.110
 opens account at this April con meeting 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.970
 la hora scored three times in the last 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.810
 four meetings of sunderland me this 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.810
 the meeting was no exception 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:54.549
 vagator supposedly played just below any 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.210
 critics sunderland attacked here is a chance 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.210
 column 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.940
 but perhaps black cats can be called 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.310
 the most unsuccessful teams this season 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.110
 very much a blow against them yet 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.190
 equally could bark and you could 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.190
 parry the view of the madonna 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.150
 Fabio Borini who saved more than once 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.760
 sandrine this season is exactly which 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.760
 the small ones replaced the second half with a bakun kick and 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.170
 then there were a couple of curious episodes here 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.170
 here now 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.590
 feed into the penalty area and appeal to 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.590
 the arbitrator 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.710
 football players of sunderland in the hope of 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.290
 penalty 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.290
 night in a group of falls found in Lawton 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.560
 and a little later another episode 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.560
 whose narrowly hangs the penalty area 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.659
 a blow of garden tapes seemingly compares 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.879
 score but offside is fixed and 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:29.569
 fabio borini has to let the ball out 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:32.379
 hand if a hand there is still debate some 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.379
 may be the 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:40.069
 here we probably recognize but just 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.970
 some eagle eye at the side arbiter 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.110
 who saw the microscopic offside 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.240
 take but was right Kostyan 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.840
 Benteke rushes at sunderland's gate 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.230
 one of the counterattacks you drink in the corner and 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.230
 splendid jump 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.739
 Sunderland defender knocks the ball and 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.739
 breeds proper 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.800
 it was over it was philipp option 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.070
 another villa attack 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.040
 Vita mandala in place but at the end 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.040
 of all 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.599
 after that upright he's not 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.599
 realized one more good moment 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.950
 the game ended in victory stopped 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.450
 today we check very strongly says 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.400
 paul lambert benda gellar returned this 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:11.080
 important for us and the players we deserve 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.700
 victory and you could still do 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.410
 all right says q solder but he 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.820
 a few minutes the organization failed 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.430
 the players made too much 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.870
 liberties forgetting about the team play this 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.370
 frustrating but so i said that 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.250
 ready to take responsibility for themselves well 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.360
 know this already some salt will achieve 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.360
 the store is bifida
