between<00:00:16.029> chocolates<00:00:17.029> and<00:00:17.840> carob

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
between chocolates and carob

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.740 
between chocolates and carob
now<00:00:19.100> this<00:00:19.250> carob<00:00:19.610> is<00:00:19.760> in<00:00:19.910> a<00:00:20.000> sunflower<00:00:20.450> seed

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
now this carob is in a sunflower seed

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.620 
now this carob is in a sunflower seed
butter<00:00:20.779> jar<00:00:21.320> but<00:00:21.950> it<00:00:22.430> is<00:00:22.610> carob<00:00:23.060> inside<00:00:23.390> there

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
butter jar but it is carob inside there

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.190 
butter jar but it is carob inside there
so<00:00:24.410> a<00:00:24.980> lot<00:00:25.550> of<00:00:25.640> people<00:00:25.880> think<00:00:26.090> of<00:00:26.210> carob<00:00:26.630> as<00:00:26.840> a

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
so a lot of people think of carob as a

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.550 
so a lot of people think of carob as a
substitute<00:00:27.890> for<00:00:28.130> chocolates<00:00:29.050> which<00:00:30.050> i<00:00:30.230> think

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
substitute for chocolates which i think

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.589 
substitute for chocolates which i think
is<00:00:30.770> very<00:00:30.800> misleading<00:00:31.400> because<00:00:31.939> if<00:00:32.270> you<00:00:32.390> look

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
is very misleading because if you look

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.860 
is very misleading because if you look
first<00:00:32.930> at<00:00:33.230> flavor<00:00:33.940> the<00:00:34.940> flavor<00:00:34.970> of<00:00:35.480> chocolate

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
first at flavor the flavor of chocolate

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.080 
first at flavor the flavor of chocolate
and<00:00:36.200> carob<00:00:36.560> are<00:00:36.710> just<00:00:36.920> totally<00:00:37.460> different<00:00:37.880> and

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
and carob are just totally different and

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.360 
and carob are just totally different and
they're<00:00:38.420> both<00:00:38.600> excellent<00:00:39.350> I<00:00:39.649> love<00:00:39.980> them<00:00:40.190> both

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.170 
they're both excellent I love them both

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
but for someone who has never had carob

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.180 
but for someone who has never had carob
it's<00:00:44.329> gonna<00:00:44.449> taste<00:00:44.719> weird<00:00:45.019> it's<00:00:45.800> not<00:00:46.070> gonna

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:56.929 
mean if you if you think about it in

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:58.900 
mean if you if you think about it in
terms<00:00:57.109> of<00:00:57.320> just<00:00:57.469> being<00:00:57.589> something<00:00:58.129> good<00:00:58.640> and<00:00:58.850> a

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
terms of just being something good and a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.119 
terms of just being something good and a
treat<00:00:59.179> then<00:00:59.870> maybe<00:01:00.289> you<00:01:00.469> will<00:01:00.620> if<00:01:00.800> you<00:01:00.829> have<00:01:01.010> an

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
treat then maybe you will if you have an

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.529 
treat then maybe you will if you have an
open<00:01:01.339> mind<00:01:01.519> but<00:01:01.699> a<00:01:01.760> lot<00:01:01.969> of<00:01:01.999> people<00:01:02.149> I<00:01:02.359> think

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
open mind but a lot of people I think

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.600 
open mind but a lot of people I think
that's<00:01:02.660> where<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:02.960> issue<00:01:03.079> comes<00:01:03.260> in<00:01:03.589> now<00:01:04.489> in

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
that's where the issue comes in now in

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.810 
that's where the issue comes in now in
terms<00:01:04.850> of<00:01:05.170> healthiness<00:01:06.340> carob<00:01:07.340> often<00:01:07.640> gets

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
terms of healthiness carob often gets

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.260 
terms of healthiness carob often gets
touted<00:01:08.330> as<00:01:08.480> the<00:01:08.540> healthy<00:01:09.350> choice<00:01:10.220> as<00:01:10.610> opposed

touted as the healthy choice as opposed

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.330 
touted as the healthy choice as opposed
to<00:01:11.420> caffeine<00:01:11.870> as<00:01:12.080> opposed<00:01:12.500> to<00:01:12.620> chocolate<00:01:12.680> and

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
I'm getting ahead of myself because the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.450 
I'm getting ahead of myself because the

eat some chocolate you might get

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.610 
eat some chocolate you might get
headaches

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
headaches

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.980 
headaches
you<00:01:33.770> might<00:01:34.040> feel<00:01:34.850> jittery<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:35.690> might<00:01:35.840> get

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
you might feel jittery you might get

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.040 
you might feel jittery you might get
acne<00:01:36.820> and<00:01:37.820> then<00:01:37.970> you<00:01:38.120> might<00:01:38.300> want<00:01:38.510> to<00:01:38.540> try<00:01:38.750> some

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
acne and then you might want to try some

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.600 
acne and then you might want to try some
carob<00:01:39.350> because<00:01:39.620> carob<00:01:39.980> does<00:01:40.160> not<00:01:40.280> have<00:01:40.460> any

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
carob because carob does not have any

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.000 
carob because carob does not have any
caffeine<00:01:41.060> or<00:01:41.420> anything<00:01:41.960> bromine<00:01:42.590> it<00:01:42.740> doesn't

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
caffeine or anything bromine it doesn't

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.290 
caffeine or anything bromine it doesn't
have<00:01:43.100> any<00:01:43.250> stimulants<00:01:43.850> at<00:01:43.970> all

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
have any stimulants at all

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.020 
have any stimulants at all
so<00:01:45.050> that's<00:01:45.440> one<00:01:45.770> benefit<00:01:46.340> for<00:01:46.550> carob<00:01:46.880> and

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
so that's one benefit for carob and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.810 
so that's one benefit for carob and
that's<00:01:47.240> usually<00:01:47.780> why<00:01:48.560> people<00:01:49.250> talk<00:01:49.430> about<00:01:49.640> it

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
that's usually why people talk about it

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.850 
that's usually why people talk about it
as<00:01:49.940> being<00:01:49.970> a<00:01:50.270> healthy<00:01:50.630> healthy<00:01:51.410> alternative

as being a healthy healthy alternative

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.170 
as being a healthy healthy alternative
and<00:01:52.190> there<00:01:52.340> are<00:01:52.430> some<00:01:52.580> other<00:01:52.700> things<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:53.150> think

and there are some other things to think

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.320 
and there are some other things to think
about<00:01:53.540> as<00:01:53.690> well<00:01:53.930> so<00:01:54.460> cocoa<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:55.610> chocolate<00:01:55.670> are

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
very bitter naturally they don't have

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.610 
very bitter naturally they don't have
any<00:01:58.880> natural<00:01:59.780> sugars<00:02:00.140> in<00:02:00.170> them

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
any natural sugars in them

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.070 
any natural sugars in them
whereas<00:02:01.040> carob<00:02:01.550> is<00:02:01.790> naturally<00:02:02.420> sweet<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.930> has

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
whereas carob is naturally sweet it has

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.640 
whereas carob is naturally sweet it has
a<00:02:03.110> lot<00:02:03.470> of<00:02:03.620> sugars<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:04.370> it<00:02:04.570> just<00:02:05.570> as<00:02:05.870> it<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.110> so

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
a lot of sugars in it just as it is so

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.919 
a lot of sugars in it just as it is so
you<00:02:06.710> don't<00:02:06.890> need<00:02:06.980> to<00:02:07.070> add<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.220> lot<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:08.209> now

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
you don't need to add a lot to it now

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.050 
you don't need to add a lot to it now
this<00:02:09.530> is<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.709> case<00:02:10.009> where<00:02:10.310> you<00:02:10.429> just<00:02:10.610> you<00:02:10.789> really

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
this is a case where you just you really

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.160 
this is a case where you just you really
have<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.239> look<00:02:11.390> at<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.510> ingredients<00:02:11.989> of<00:02:12.080> what

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
have to look at the ingredients of what

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.020 
have to look at the ingredients of what
you're<00:02:12.290> buying<00:02:12.500> because<00:02:13.160> a<00:02:13.310> lot<00:02:13.489> of<00:02:13.580> chocolate

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
you're buying because a lot of chocolate

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.480 
you're buying because a lot of chocolate
does<00:02:14.480> have<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:15.080> ton<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.470> added<00:02:15.770> sugar<00:02:15.980> but<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.340> lot

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
does have a ton of added sugar but a lot

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.090 
does have a ton of added sugar but a lot
of<00:02:16.520> carob<00:02:16.910> also<00:02:17.570> has<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.170> ton<00:02:18.530> of<00:02:18.560> added<00:02:18.890> sugar

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
of carob also has a ton of added sugar

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.530 
of carob also has a ton of added sugar
even<00:02:19.460> if<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.670> doesn't<00:02:19.850> necessary

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
even if it doesn't necessary

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.209 
even if it doesn't necessary
need<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:21.019> and<00:02:21.260> it's<00:02:21.379> also<00:02:21.530> about<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.920> type<00:02:22.189> of

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:22.219 
need it and it's also about the type of

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.520 
need it and it's also about the type of
sugar<00:02:22.909> that's<00:02:23.239> being<00:02:23.420> used<00:02:23.629> in<00:02:23.840> there<00:02:24.019> so<00:02:24.439> if

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
sugar that's being used in there so if

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.800 
sugar that's being used in there so if
you<00:02:24.650> found<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:25.519> chocolate<00:02:25.879> that<00:02:26.420> was<00:02:26.540> using

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
you found a chocolate that was using

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.690 
you found a chocolate that was using
unrefined<00:02:27.349> sugar<00:02:27.769> that<00:02:28.280> might<00:02:28.430> be<00:02:28.519> better

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
unrefined sugar that might be better

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.660 
unrefined sugar that might be better
than<00:02:28.819> a<00:02:29.090> carob<00:02:29.810> chip<00:02:30.230> that's<00:02:30.500> using<00:02:31.040> high

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
than a carob chip that's using high

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.940 
than a carob chip that's using high
fructose<00:02:31.909> corn<00:02:32.120> syrup<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:33.079> then<00:02:33.739> when<00:02:33.859> you

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
fructose corn syrup and then when you

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.849 
fructose corn syrup and then when you
get<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.129> fats<00:02:34.489> it's<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.849> same<00:02:35.090> thing<00:02:35.450> so

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
get to fats it's the same thing so

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.000 
get to fats it's the same thing so
chocolate<00:02:36.859> has<00:02:37.129> more<00:02:38.030> natural<00:02:38.239> fat<00:02:39.010> whereas

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
chocolate has more natural fat whereas

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.630 
chocolate has more natural fat whereas
carob<00:02:40.519> has<00:02:40.730> virtually<00:02:41.090> none<00:02:41.689> and<00:02:42.549> what<00:02:43.549> you

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
carob has virtually none and what you

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.880 
carob has virtually none and what you
have<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.819> do<00:02:44.060> is<00:02:44.269> look<00:02:44.569> at<00:02:44.629> what<00:02:45.439> it<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.680> you're

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
have to do is look at what it is you're

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.979 
have to do is look at what it is you're
eating<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.400> in<00:02:46.609> so<00:02:47.150> if<00:02:47.239> you're<00:02:47.389> eating<00:02:47.420> a

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
eating it in so if you're eating a

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.979 
eating it in so if you're eating a
chocolate<00:02:48.889> bar<00:02:49.099> that's<00:02:49.519> pure<00:02:49.939> dark<00:02:50.389> chocolate

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
chocolate bar that's pure dark chocolate

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.080 
chocolate bar that's pure dark chocolate
and<00:02:51.230> just<00:02:51.469> made<00:02:51.709> with<00:02:51.889> cocoa<00:02:52.250> butter<00:02:52.280> that

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
and just made with cocoa butter that

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.300 
and just made with cocoa butter that
might<00:02:53.239> be<00:02:53.389> better<00:02:53.569> than<00:02:53.689> a<00:02:54.260> carob<00:02:54.739> chip<00:02:54.980> made

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
might be better than a carob chip made

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.080 
might be better than a carob chip made
with<00:02:55.639> hydrogenated<00:02:56.359> palm<00:02:56.780> oil<00:02:57.790> okay<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:58.849> that

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
with hydrogenated palm oil okay so that

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.720 
with hydrogenated palm oil okay so that
covers<00:02:59.480> pretty<00:02:59.689> much<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.169> downsides<00:03:00.859> of<00:03:01.159> both

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
covers pretty much the downsides of both

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.429 
covers pretty much the downsides of both
of<00:03:01.909> these<00:03:02.030> things<00:03:02.090> but<00:03:02.870> then<00:03:03.019> if<00:03:03.139> you<00:03:03.200> look<00:03:03.349> at

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:03.439 
of these things but then if you look at

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.429 
of these things but then if you look at
the<00:03:03.530> upsides<00:03:04.359> cocoa<00:03:05.359> and<00:03:05.689> chocolate<00:03:05.750> have

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:06.439 
the upsides cocoa and chocolate have

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.929 
the upsides cocoa and chocolate have
been<00:03:06.470> studied<00:03:07.069> to<00:03:07.099> have<00:03:07.400> lots<00:03:07.790> of

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
been studied to have lots of

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:11.649 
been studied to have lots of
antioxidants<00:03:08.829> lots<00:03:09.829> of<00:03:10.069> magnesium<00:03:10.939> and<00:03:11.209> other

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659 
antioxidants lots of magnesium and other

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.069 
antioxidants lots of magnesium and other
minerals<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.470> carob<00:03:13.280> has<00:03:13.879> a<00:03:13.909> lot<00:03:14.419> of<00:03:14.689> calcium

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
minerals and carob has a lot of calcium

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.460 
minerals and carob has a lot of calcium
iron<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.639> B<00:03:17.030> vitamins<00:03:17.060> as<00:03:17.750> well<00:03:17.780> as<00:03:18.139> some

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
iron and B vitamins as well as some

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.069 
iron and B vitamins as well as some
antioxidants<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:19.430> some<00:03:19.879> other<00:03:20.030> minerals<00:03:20.870> and

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
antioxidants and some other minerals and

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.319 
antioxidants and some other minerals and
stuff<00:03:21.290> like<00:03:21.409> that<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:21.829> there<00:03:22.489> are<00:03:22.639> benefits<00:03:23.209> to

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
stuff like that so there are benefits to

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.619 
stuff like that so there are benefits to
them<00:03:23.689> now<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.230> don't<00:03:24.680> eat<00:03:25.280> them<00:03:25.639> to<00:03:26.419> get

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:26.629 
them now I don't eat them to get

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.930 
them now I don't eat them to get
nutrients<00:03:27.349> I<00:03:27.530> eat<00:03:27.680> them<00:03:27.829> because<00:03:28.129> I<00:03:28.400> can<00:03:28.819> make

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
nutrients I eat them because I can make

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.670 
nutrients I eat them because I can make
delicious<00:03:29.090> treats<00:03:29.569> with<00:03:29.750> them<00:03:29.930> but<00:03:30.440> it<00:03:30.530> always

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
delicious treats with them but it always

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.309 
delicious treats with them but it always
helps<00:03:31.220> when<00:03:31.669> something<00:03:32.389> that's<00:03:32.540> yummy<00:03:32.780> also

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
helps when something that's yummy also

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.920 
helps when something that's yummy also
has<00:03:33.530> some<00:03:33.829> healthiness<00:03:34.159> going<00:03:34.549> on<00:03:34.669> to<00:03:34.909> it<00:03:35.030> okay

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
has some healthiness going on to it okay

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.409 
has some healthiness going on to it okay
so<00:03:36.319> in<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.650> Battle<00:03:37.010> of<00:03:37.190> chocolate<00:03:37.819> versus

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
so in the Battle of chocolate versus

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.770 
so in the Battle of chocolate versus
carob<00:03:38.780> who<00:03:39.379> is<00:03:39.560> going<00:03:39.739> to<00:03:39.829> win<00:03:40.099> I<00:03:40.629> like<00:03:41.629> them

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
carob who is going to win I like them

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.379 
carob who is going to win I like them
both<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:42.669> think<00:03:43.669> that's<00:03:43.819> maybe<00:03:43.970> a<00:03:44.090> cheater

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
both I think that's maybe a cheater

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.930 
both I think that's maybe a cheater
answer<00:03:44.840> but<00:03:45.169> honestly<00:03:45.829> they<00:03:46.190> both<00:03:46.430> have<00:03:46.729> their

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
answer but honestly they both have their

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.360 
answer but honestly they both have their
own<00:03:47.180> benefits<00:03:47.959> they<00:03:48.500> taste<00:03:48.769> totally

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
own benefits they taste totally

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.099 
own benefits they taste totally
different<00:03:49.760> so<00:03:50.209> I<00:03:50.239> like<00:03:50.479> using<00:03:50.720> them<00:03:50.959> in

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
different so I like using them in

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.369 
different so I like using them in
different<00:03:51.440> things<00:03:51.699> I<00:03:52.699> do<00:03:53.269> tend<00:03:53.780> to<00:03:53.930> go<00:03:54.169> with

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
different things I do tend to go with

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.110 
different things I do tend to go with
carob<00:03:54.829> a<00:03:54.919> lot<00:03:55.069> of<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.280> time<00:03:55.489> just<00:03:55.699> because<00:03:56.000> I

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
carob a lot of the time just because I

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.879 
carob a lot of the time just because I
don't<00:03:56.269> have<00:03:56.359> to<00:03:56.510> add<00:03:56.629> much<00:03:57.229> sugar<00:03:57.560> to<00:03:57.859> it

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
don't have to add much sugar to it

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.250 
don't have to add much sugar to it
whereas<00:03:58.400> with<00:03:58.430> cocoa<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.389> do<00:03:59.629> need<00:04:00.049> to<00:04:00.139> add

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
whereas with cocoa I do need to add

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.199 
whereas with cocoa I do need to add
quite<00:04:00.620> a<00:04:00.680> bit<00:04:00.769> of<00:04:00.949> sweetness<00:04:01.310> and<00:04:01.609> I<00:04:01.909> can<00:04:02.060> do

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
quite a bit of sweetness and I can do

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.759 
quite a bit of sweetness and I can do
that<00:04:02.329> with<00:04:02.479> bananas<00:04:02.959> I<00:04:03.199> can<00:04:03.379> do<00:04:03.500> that<00:04:03.650> with

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
that with bananas I can do that with

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.719 
that with bananas I can do that with
dates<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.909> don't<00:04:05.090> have<00:04:05.269> to<00:04:05.419> use<00:04:05.659> sugars

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:06.729 
dates you don't have to use sugars

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:09.339 
dates you don't have to use sugars
specifically<00:04:07.729> but<00:04:08.359> you<00:04:08.479> do<00:04:08.599> need<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.989> sweeten

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
specifically but you do need to sweeten

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.830 
specifically but you do need to sweeten
it<00:04:09.439> up<00:04:09.560> a<00:04:09.680> little<00:04:09.829> bit<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.340> I<00:04:11.150> also<00:04:11.299> like<00:04:11.720> to

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
it up a little bit and I also like to

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.610 
it up a little bit and I also like to
steer<00:04:12.079> clear<00:04:12.109> of<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:13.459> bars<00:04:13.729> and<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:14.870> stuff

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
steer clear of the bars and and stuff

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.279 
steer clear of the bars and and stuff
made<00:04:15.889> with<00:04:16.099> hydrogenated<00:04:16.459> oils<00:04:17.359> and<00:04:17.630> I<00:04:17.989> find

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
made with hydrogenated oils and I find

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.409 
made with hydrogenated oils and I find
it<00:04:18.409> really<00:04:18.739> really<00:04:18.979> difficult<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:19.759> find<00:04:19.940> carob

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
it really really difficult to find carob

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.529 
it really really difficult to find carob
chips<00:04:20.720> that<00:04:21.409> are<00:04:21.560> made<00:04:21.799> with<00:04:22.340> good<00:04:22.789> on

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
chips that are made with good on

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.810 
chips that are made with good on
hydrogenated<00:04:24.440> oils<00:04:24.770> because<00:04:25.039> a<00:04:25.280> lot<00:04:25.580> of<00:04:25.610> them

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
hydrogenated oils because a lot of them

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.750 
hydrogenated oils because a lot of them
melt<00:04:26.150> like<00:04:26.930> coconut<00:04:27.349> oil<00:04:27.440> melts<00:04:28.070> at<00:04:28.250> 24

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
melt like coconut oil melts at 24

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.060 
melt like coconut oil melts at 24
degrees<00:04:29.000> Celsius<00:04:29.510> so<00:04:29.750> I<00:04:30.139> actually<00:04:30.529> make<00:04:30.860> it<00:04:30.950> at

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
degrees Celsius so I actually make it at

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.920 
degrees Celsius so I actually make it at
home<00:04:31.099> I<00:04:31.490> have<00:04:31.969> a<00:04:32.000> video<00:04:32.300> for<00:04:32.599> homemade

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
home I have a video for homemade

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850
