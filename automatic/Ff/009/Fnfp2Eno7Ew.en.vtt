00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.250
 of onion are onion 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.190
 crispy for this I will use for the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.400
 mass here we have three tablespoons of 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.750
 flour to which we are going to add a 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.950
 spoonful of instant puree any 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.390
 mashed potatoes 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.390
 spoonfuls are single 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:35.580
 then add a spoonful of 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.580
 corn starch or potato starch 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.690
 with a tablespoon 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.450
 now we add I am going to add the 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.340
 paprika 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.850
 a little bit 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.810
 you can add if you like spicy a 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.810
 pepper a spicy 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.309
 a pinch of salt 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.289
 we mix 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.409
 and I will go adding savings first 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.409
 add half a glass and then we see what 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:22.299
 consistency is going to have all that and we see 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.299
 if we need more water or not 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.430
 and we are going to mix 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.610
 I add more water 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.260
 this consistency has to remain 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.520
 now you have to leave in totality use more 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:02.510
 or less 200 milliliters of water this glass 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:05.630
 250 and I stayed a little bit so more or 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.910
 minus 200 milliliters of water and what 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.250
 we have to let some 10 rest 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.729
 minutes meanwhile while this 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.729
 go by 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.530
 must prepare the onion rings 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.630
 onion I used it medium cut the onion 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:28.820
 of this size more or less 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:32.260
 7 millimeters 5 more or less and simply 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.220
 they are separating the hoops 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.220
 well in this way 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.250
 and we're going to need bread crumbs 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.780
 and this father called I'm going to add 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.730
 Sesame seeds 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.280
 these seeds are white seeds 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.280
 raw more or less 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.220
 three tablespoons of sesame seeds 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.730
 and we mix it 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.660
 and now what we do we take an hour of 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.660
 onion we put it here 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.880
 with the help of two forks 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.820
 and now this goes to the bread and with two others 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.820
 Forks 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.750
 we are not going to overflow 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.060
 Meanwhile 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.060
 I'm already heating the oil 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.150
 very easy 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.420
 Now we heat the oil in a pan 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.420
 and we add our 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.930
 we brown them on both sides 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.800
 and we leave the rings on a paper 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.310
 absorbent so that it absorbs all of the 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.310
 oil 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:48.100
 that's how the onion rings came out 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.700
 they make very quick brown in two minutes 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.770
 they come out small and crispy good 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.450
 have a nice day and see you in the 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.450
