to<00:02:08.440> load<00:02:08.680> the<00:02:09.490> thing<00:02:09.700> quicker<00:02:10.680> okay<00:02:11.680> so<00:02:11.740> this

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
to load the thing quicker okay so this

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.070 
to load the thing quicker okay so this
is<00:02:12.160> faster<00:02:12.580> right<00:02:12.760> here<00:02:12.970> number<00:02:13.600> two<00:02:13.840> we're

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
is faster right here number two we're

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.430 
is faster right here number two we're
going<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.290> do<00:02:14.380> CNN<00:02:14.890> com<00:02:18.990> okay<00:02:19.990> give<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.230> some

okay<00:03:04.459> let's<00:03:04.700> go

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.960 

so<00:03:14.590> when<00:03:14.830> two<00:03:14.980> straight<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.460> mobile<00:03:15.820> web

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
so when two straight to the mobile web

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.880 
so when two straight to the mobile web
site<00:03:16.000> but<00:03:16.240> this<00:03:16.570> was<00:03:16.750> faster<00:03:16.960> so<00:03:17.350> let's<00:03:17.530> go<00:03:17.650> all

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
site but this was faster so let's go all

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.320 
site but this was faster so let's go all
the<00:03:18.070> way<00:03:18.100> to<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.340> bottom<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:18.820> we're<00:03:19.180> going<00:03:19.300> to

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
the way to the bottom and we're going to

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:28.350 
the way to the bottom and we're going to
do<00:03:19.450> fools<00:03:19.750> full<00:03:20.200> site<00:03:24.360> no<00:03:26.760> ok<00:03:27.760> so<00:03:27.820> this<00:03:28.120> was

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
do fools full site no ok so this was

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.170 
do fools full site no ok so this was
again<00:03:29.170> first<00:03:29.680> with<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.250> pre-loading<00:03:30.790> turned

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180

this<00:04:23.460> was<00:04:23.670> a<00:04:23.700> little<00:04:24.060> faster<00:04:24.780> in<00:04:24.990> loading<00:04:25.440> the

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
this was a little faster in loading the

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.110 
this was a little faster in loading the
view<00:04:26.400> of<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.790> website<00:04:27.860> what's<00:04:28.860> that<00:04:29.120> that's

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
view of the website what's that that's

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.990 
view of the website what's that that's
just<00:04:30.270> an<00:04:30.450> advertisement<00:04:34.070> okay<00:04:35.070> well<00:04:35.280> that
