00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
when we stand up notice how the legs

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.800 
when we stand up notice how the legs
straighten<00:01:19.950> out<00:01:20.180> relative<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.540> torso

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
when we straighten out well that's key

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.340 
when we straighten out well that's key
because<00:01:25.159> there's<00:01:26.159> something<00:01:26.549> happens<00:01:27.350> with

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
because there's something happens with

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.890 
because there's something happens with
our<00:01:28.380> leg<00:01:28.829> muscles<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.430> our<00:01:29.520> hips<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.600> you

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
our leg muscles in our hips that you

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.710 
our leg muscles in our hips that you
really<00:01:31.860> need<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.159> be<00:01:32.280> aware<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.880> fact<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
really need to be aware of in fact I

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.789 
really need to be aware of in fact I
think<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.340> crucial<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.720> if<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.530> lot

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
think this is so crucial that if a lot

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.010 
think this is so crucial that if a lot
of<00:01:37.979> companies<00:01:38.460> around<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.570> whole<00:01:39.720> United

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
of companies around the whole United

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.170 
of companies around the whole United
States<00:01:40.079> around<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> world<00:01:40.740> explained<00:01:41.670> this

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
States around the world explained this

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.270 
States around the world explained this
very<00:01:42.689> fact<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.290> all<00:01:43.320> their<00:01:43.590> co-workers<00:01:44.070> who

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
very fact to all their co-workers who

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.580 
very fact to all their co-workers who
have<00:01:44.520> desk<00:01:44.820> jobs<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.479> think<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.170> could<00:01:46.320> lower

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
have desk jobs I think this could lower

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.819 
have desk jobs I think this could lower
a<00:01:46.680> health<00:01:47.070> care<00:01:47.340> cost<00:01:48.290> dramatically<00:01:49.290> not

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
a health care cost dramatically not

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.800 
a health care cost dramatically not
because<00:01:50.430> it's<00:01:51.000> going<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.270> invent<00:01:51.570> some<00:01:51.780> new

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
because it's going to invent some new

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.679 
because it's going to invent some new
drug<00:01:52.170> or<00:01:52.259> something<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:53.009> because<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.149> really

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
drug or something but because I really

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.780 
drug or something but because I really
think<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.110> a

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
think this is a

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.640 
think this is a
syndrome<00:01:56.120> across<00:01:56.420> America<00:01:56.960> that<00:01:57.170> needs<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.620> be

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
syndrome across America that needs to be

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.690 
syndrome across America that needs to be
addressed<00:01:58.010> and<00:01:59.890> we<00:02:00.890> could<00:02:01.040> save<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.250> lot<00:02:01.520> of

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
addressed and we could save a lot of

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.970 
addressed and we could save a lot of
money<00:02:01.880> if<00:02:02.390> people<00:02:02.810> had<00:02:02.990> healthy<00:02:03.380> backs<00:02:03.620> and

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
money if people had healthy backs and

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.950 
money if people had healthy backs and
one<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.790> biggest<00:02:05.090> issues<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.660> sitting

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
one of the biggest issues is sitting

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.590 
one of the biggest issues is sitting
down<00:02:06.170> that<00:02:06.410> causes<00:02:06.770> lower<00:02:07.130> back<00:02:07.400> pain<00:02:07.700> and

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
down that causes lower back pain and

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.070 
down that causes lower back pain and
this<00:02:08.869> is<00:02:09.020> why<00:02:10.120> my<00:02:11.120> hip<00:02:11.390> flexor<00:02:13.420> extends<00:02:14.420> my<00:02:14.870> hip

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
this is why my hip flexor extends my hip

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.450 
this is why my hip flexor extends my hip
for<00:02:15.230> me<00:02:15.380> so<00:02:15.530> whenever<00:02:15.710> so<00:02:16.400> whenever<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.730> walk<00:02:18.460> my

for me so whenever so whenever I walk my

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.390 
for me so whenever so whenever I walk my
knees<00:02:19.700> are<00:02:20.420> raising<00:02:21.350> up<00:02:21.440> in<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.650> air<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.250> it's

cause because my hips now there's a
second<00:02:24.590> muscle<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:25.010> my<00:02:25.160> quadricep<00:02:25.880> my<00:02:26.120> my<00:02:26.630> leg

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
second muscle in my quadricep my my leg

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.530 
second muscle in my quadricep my my leg
muscle<00:02:27.260> my<00:02:27.380> thigh<00:02:27.560> muscle<00:02:27.950> called<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.790> rectus

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
muscle my thigh muscle called the rectus

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.470 
muscle my thigh muscle called the rectus
femoris<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.860> that's<00:02:31.310> one<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.240> four

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
femoris and that's one of the four

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.470 
femoris and that's one of the four
muscles<00:02:33.110> in<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.620> quadricep<00:02:34.370> clogging<00:02:35.180> for<00:02:35.420> it

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
muscles in the quadricep clogging for it

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.440 
muscles in the quadricep clogging for it
that<00:02:35.660> means<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:37.220> leg<00:02:37.790> muscle<00:02:38.120> right<00:02:38.270> here

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
that means the leg muscle right here

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.410 
that means the leg muscle right here
that<00:02:38.960> goes<00:02:39.380> straight<00:02:39.950> down<00:02:40.010> similarly<00:02:40.910> that

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
that goes straight down similarly that

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.230 
that goes straight down similarly that
assists<00:02:42.140> with<00:02:42.680> our<00:02:42.860> hip<00:02:43.070> flexors<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.790> our<00:02:43.970> so

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
assists with our hip flexors and our so

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.080 
assists with our hip flexors and our so
as<00:02:44.420> complex<00:02:44.960> basically<00:02:45.430> more<00:02:46.430> hip<00:02:46.670> flexors

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
as complex basically more hip flexors

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.380 
as complex basically more hip flexors
deep<00:02:47.420> inside<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:47.930> us<00:02:48.050> that<00:02:48.730> flex<00:02:49.730> our<00:02:50.090> hip

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
deep inside of us that flex our hip

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.230 
deep inside of us that flex our hip
because<00:02:50.720> our<00:02:50.900> hip<00:02:51.260> flexion<00:02:51.560> now<00:02:52.340> when<00:02:53.060> we're

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
because our hip flexion now when we're

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.970 
because our hip flexion now when we're
sitting<00:02:53.450> down<00:02:53.810> all<00:02:54.170> day<00:02:54.200> long<00:02:54.530> now<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:54.830> is

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
sitting down all day long now this is

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.560 
sitting down all day long now this is
crucial<00:02:55.370> because<00:02:55.459> when<00:02:56.090> we're<00:02:56.240> sitting<00:02:56.480> down

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
crucial because when we're sitting down

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.199 
crucial because when we're sitting down
all<00:02:56.840> day<00:02:56.870> long<00:02:57.200> notice<00:02:58.070> my<00:02:58.459> hip<00:02:58.670> flexors<00:02:59.090> were

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
all day long notice my hip flexors were

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.600 
all day long notice my hip flexors were
in<00:02:59.300> a<00:02:59.390> shortened<00:02:59.720> position<00:02:59.860> okay<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.130> then

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
in a shortened position okay and then

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.920 
in a shortened position okay and then
when<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:01.760> stand<00:03:02.150> up<00:03:02.470> there<00:03:03.470> they're<00:03:04.040> stretched

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
when I stand up there they're stretched

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.410 
when I stand up there they're stretched
but<00:03:05.930> if<00:03:06.380> we<00:03:06.530> spend<00:03:06.830> most<00:03:06.980> of<00:03:07.160> our<00:03:07.340> life<00:03:07.580> sitting

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
but if we spend most of our life sitting

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.550 
but if we spend most of our life sitting
down<00:03:08.720> in<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.170> chair<00:03:10.420> or<00:03:11.420> even<00:03:11.989> the<00:03:12.080> bottom<00:03:12.260> line

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
down in a chair or even the bottom line

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.170 
down in a chair or even the bottom line
you<00:03:12.590> see<00:03:12.920> people<00:03:13.100> at<00:03:13.310> work<00:03:13.580> having<00:03:14.030> balls

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
you see people at work having balls

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.390 
you see people at work having balls
which<00:03:14.450> is<00:03:14.570> great<00:03:14.840> but<00:03:15.440> it's<00:03:15.680> not<00:03:15.769> going<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.280> do

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
which is great but it's not going to do

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.560 
which is great but it's not going to do
anything<00:03:16.760> for<00:03:16.940> what's<00:03:17.090> going<00:03:17.269> on<00:03:17.360> with<00:03:17.510> the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
anything for what's going on with the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.850 
anything for what's going on with the
hips<00:03:17.810> because<00:03:18.230> your<00:03:18.380> hips<00:03:18.590> are<00:03:18.709> still

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
hips because your hips are still

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.610 
hips because your hips are still
shortened<00:03:19.630> your<00:03:20.630> muscles<00:03:20.989> get<00:03:21.140> tight<00:03:21.380> over

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
shortened your muscles get tight over

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.259 
shortened your muscles get tight over
time<00:03:21.860> so<00:03:22.310> as<00:03:22.519> you<00:03:22.670> stand<00:03:23.000> up<00:03:24.760> you<00:03:25.760> can't<00:03:26.060> bring

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
time so as you stand up you can't bring

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.000 
time so as you stand up you can't bring
the<00:03:26.420> hips<00:03:26.630> through<00:03:26.780> because<00:03:27.230> just<00:03:27.739> like<00:03:27.860> the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
the hips through because just like the

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.240 
the hips through because just like the
bicep<00:03:28.370> tricep<00:03:28.870> exercise<00:03:29.870> where<00:03:30.590> my<00:03:30.920> bias<00:03:31.130> is

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
bicep tricep exercise where my bias is

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.009 
bicep tricep exercise where my bias is
over<00:03:31.519> developed<00:03:31.910> over<00:03:32.060> my<00:03:32.150> tricep<00:03:32.690> I<00:03:32.810> can't

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
over developed over my tricep I can't

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.540 
over developed over my tricep I can't
straighten<00:03:33.260> out<00:03:33.440> all<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.590> way<00:03:33.709> we<00:03:34.250> can't

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
straighten out all the way we can't

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.520 
straighten out all the way we can't
strain<00:03:35.090> their<00:03:35.239> hips<00:03:35.450> out<00:03:35.630> all<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.930> way<00:03:36.019> so

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
strain their hips out all the way so

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.740 
strain their hips out all the way so
we're<00:03:36.680> like<00:03:36.830> this<00:03:37.070> but<00:03:37.730> you're<00:03:38.269> not<00:03:38.300> going<00:03:38.690> to

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
we're like this but you're not going to

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.860 
we're like this but you're not going to
walk<00:03:38.930> around<00:03:39.670> like<00:03:40.670> this<00:03:41.000> hunched<00:03:41.510> over<00:03:41.630> all

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
walk around like this hunched over all

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.430 
walk around like this hunched over all
day<00:03:42.050> I<00:03:42.230> don't<00:03:42.560> know<00:03:42.620> maybe<00:03:42.769> some<00:03:43.040> of<00:03:43.130> us<00:03:43.250> do<00:03:43.489> but

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
day I don't know maybe some of us do but

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.440 
day I don't know maybe some of us do but
it's<00:03:45.440> just<00:03:45.560> not<00:03:45.709> going<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.010> happen<00:03:46.160> so<00:03:47.000> what<00:03:47.330> do

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
it's just not going to happen so what do

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.880 
it's just not going to happen so what do
we<00:03:47.570> do<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.900> compensate<00:03:48.170> from<00:03:48.560> that<00:03:48.739> because

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
we do to compensate from that because

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.880 
we do to compensate from that because
because<00:03:49.489> our<00:03:49.610> hips<00:03:49.850> won't<00:03:50.269> allow<00:03:50.690> our<00:03:51.110> hip

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
because our hips won't allow our hip

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.450 
because our hips won't allow our hip
flexors<00:03:51.920> won't<00:03:52.400> allow<00:03:52.550> our<00:03:52.700> hips<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:53.030> come<00:03:53.060> on

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
flexors won't allow our hips to come on

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.160 
flexors won't allow our hips to come on
we<00:03:53.880> can<00:03:54.030> stand<00:03:54.240> up<00:03:54.300> straight<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.690> tall<00:03:54.840> with

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
we can stand up straight and tall with

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.340 
we can stand up straight and tall with
good<00:03:55.320> posture<00:03:56.070> so<00:03:56.490> we're<00:03:56.640> bent<00:03:56.850> over<00:03:57.350> now

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
good posture so we're bent over now

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.510 
good posture so we're bent over now
watch<00:03:58.680> me<00:03:58.890> real<00:03:59.310> real<00:03:59.760> closely<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.540> my<00:04:00.660> back<00:04:00.900> I

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
I mean it really stretches them out but

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.300 
I mean it really stretches them out but
if<00:05:21.720> you<00:05:21.780> have<00:05:21.870> a<00:05:21.990> good<00:05:22.140> posture<00:05:22.440> you<00:05:23.070> know<00:05:23.100> it

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
if you have a good posture you know it

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.080 
feels good
you've<00:05:25.560> got<00:05:25.710> a<00:05:25.740> lot<00:05:25.920> more<00:05:26.070> flexibility<00:05:26.700> that's

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
you've got a lot more flexibility that's

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.600 
you've got a lot more flexibility that's
in<00:05:27.300> a<00:05:27.360> whole<00:05:27.540> nother<00:05:27.780> video<00:05:28.020> but<00:05:28.800> you<00:05:29.340> get<00:05:29.460> the

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
in a whole nother video but you get the

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.090 
in a whole nother video but you get the
point<00:05:29.790> over<00:05:30.150> what<00:05:30.690> can<00:05:31.350> happen<00:05:31.590> if<00:05:31.920> you<00:05:32.010> don't

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
point over what can happen if you don't

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.920 
point over what can happen if you don't
fix<00:05:32.400> this<00:05:32.580> so<00:05:34.580> what's<00:05:35.580> going<00:05:35.880> on<00:05:36.030> when<00:05:36.630> you<00:05:36.720> sit

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
fix this so what's going on when you sit

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.570 
fix this so what's going on when you sit
down<00:05:36.960> that<00:05:37.380> tightens<00:05:37.770> up<00:05:37.920> but<00:05:38.160> when<00:05:38.250> you<00:05:38.340> stand

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
down that tightens up but when you stand

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.730 
down that tightens up but when you stand
up<00:05:38.880> what<00:05:39.510> we<00:05:39.660> need<00:05:39.840> to<00:05:39.930> do<00:05:40.110> to<00:05:40.290> counteract<00:05:40.650> that

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
up what we need to do to counteract that

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.430 
up what we need to do to counteract that
so<00:05:41.130> if<00:05:41.610> the<00:05:41.790> hip<00:05:42.000> muscles<00:05:42.870> are<00:05:42.960> in<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.110> front

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
so if the hip muscles are in the front

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.470 
so if the hip muscles are in the front
that<00:05:44.130> are<00:05:44.190> causing<00:05:44.490> that<00:05:44.760> tightness<00:05:45.120> and

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
that are causing that tightness and

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.020 
that are causing that tightness and
that's<00:05:45.690> the<00:05:45.840> problem<00:05:46.190> then<00:05:47.190> the<00:05:47.580> opposite

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
that's the problem then the opposite

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.320 
that's the problem then the opposite
muscle<00:05:48.500> is<00:05:49.500> our<00:05:49.770> glutes<00:05:50.100> so<00:05:50.760> we<00:05:51.030> need<00:05:51.180> to

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
muscle is our glutes so we need to

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.320 
muscle is our glutes so we need to
stretch<00:05:52.050> out<00:05:52.320> our<00:05:52.380> hip<00:05:52.770> muscles<00:05:53.330> strengthen

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
stretch out our hip muscles strengthen

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.810 
stretch out our hip muscles strengthen
up<00:05:54.480> our<00:05:54.600> glute<00:05:54.930> muscles<00:05:55.530> in<00:05:55.950> order<00:05:56.340> to<00:05:56.490> bring

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
up our glute muscles in order to bring

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.120 
up our glute muscles in order to bring
our<00:05:56.970> hips<00:05:57.210> around<00:05:57.420> to<00:05:58.410> give<00:05:58.620> us<00:05:58.740> a<00:05:58.860> straight

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
our hips around to give us a straight

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.119 
our hips around to give us a straight
back<00:05:59.340> and<00:05:59.550> have<00:05:59.760> a<00:05:59.790> spill

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:24.159 
quadricep are still in a shortened

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:28.529 
quadricep are still in a shortened
position<00:06:24.360> so<00:06:26.009> you<00:06:27.009> you<00:06:27.550> can<00:06:27.580> still<00:06:28.239> be

acceptable to lower back pain or

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:35.549 
acceptable to lower back pain or
anterior<00:06:32.289> pelvic<00:06:32.469> tilt<00:06:32.949> so<00:06:34.139> you<00:06:35.139> got<00:06:35.349> to<00:06:35.469> do

00:06:35.549 --> 00:06:35.559 
anterior pelvic tilt so you got to do

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:37.079 
anterior pelvic tilt so you got to do
the<00:06:35.709> exercises<00:06:36.399> to<00:06:36.580> stretch<00:06:36.849> those<00:06:37.059> muscles

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:37.089 
the exercises to stretch those muscles

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:39.480 
the exercises to stretch those muscles
and<00:06:37.569> strengthen<00:06:37.959> that<00:06:38.139> not<00:06:38.709> only<00:06:39.009> we've<00:06:39.369> got

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
and strengthen that not only we've got

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.059 
and strengthen that not only we've got
to<00:06:39.580> work<00:06:39.699> the<00:06:39.819> glutes<00:06:40.529> another<00:06:41.529> tight<00:06:41.800> muscle

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.069 
to work the glutes another tight muscle

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:44.189 
to work the glutes another tight muscle
is<00:06:42.159> the<00:06:42.249> quadriceps<00:06:42.969> and<00:06:43.209> then<00:06:43.869> your<00:06:44.050> lower

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 
is the quadriceps and then your lower

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.589 
is the quadriceps and then your lower
back<00:06:44.409> muscles<00:06:44.619> get<00:06:44.949> tight<00:06:45.219> too<00:06:45.490> so<00:06:46.089> we<00:06:46.240> have<00:06:46.269> to

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:46.599 
back muscles get tight too so we have to

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:48.179 
back muscles get tight too so we have to
work<00:06:46.779> our<00:06:46.929> abdominal<00:06:47.499> muscles<00:06:47.860> as<00:06:47.979> well

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:48.189 
work our abdominal muscles as well

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:50.309 
work our abdominal muscles as well
because<00:06:48.909> the<00:06:49.300> abdominal<00:06:49.779> muscles<00:06:50.080> are<00:06:50.229> the

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 
because the abdominal muscles are the

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:52.769 
because the abdominal muscles are the
opposite<00:06:50.740> of<00:06:50.860> our<00:06:50.979> tight<00:06:51.279> back<00:06:51.550> muscles<00:06:52.029> so

00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:52.779 
opposite of our tight back muscles so

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:54.359 
opposite of our tight back muscles so
our<00:06:53.110> Donnell's<00:06:53.559> are<00:06:53.649> stretched<00:06:53.919> out<00:06:54.099> our

00:06:54.359 --> 00:06:54.369 
our Donnell's are stretched out our

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:56.399 
our Donnell's are stretched out our
tight<00:06:54.579> muscles<00:06:54.939> our<00:06:55.029> back<00:06:55.569> muscles<00:06:55.599> are<00:06:56.110> tight

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:56.409 
tight muscles our back muscles are tight

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:58.439 
tight muscles our back muscles are tight
our<00:06:56.949> hips<00:06:57.279> are<00:06:57.459> tight<00:06:57.610> and<00:06:57.789> our<00:06:57.879> glutes<00:06:58.209> are

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:58.449 
our hips are tight and our glutes are

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:01.199 
our hips are tight and our glutes are
relaxed<00:06:58.719> so<00:06:59.379> stretch<00:06:59.800> the<00:06:59.979> hips<00:07:00.189> tighten<00:07:01.119> the
