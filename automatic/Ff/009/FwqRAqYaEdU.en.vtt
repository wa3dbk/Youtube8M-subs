app that uses the clipboard it's called

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.800 
app that uses the clipboard it's called
NEP<00:01:45.859> translator<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.729> it's<00:01:47.090> based<00:01:47.359> off<00:01:47.600> of<00:01:47.659> the

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
NEP translator and it's based off of the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.929 
NEP translator and it's based off of the
Microsoft<00:01:48.380> translator<00:01:48.499> app<00:01:49.009> which<00:01:49.280> allows<00:01:49.520> it

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
Microsoft translator app which allows it

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.819 
Microsoft translator app which allows it
to<00:01:49.969> translate<00:01:50.390> text<00:01:50.600> into<00:01:51.109> 45<00:01:51.590> different

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.919 
to translate text into 45 different
languages<00:01:52.549> basically<00:01:53.119> it<00:01:53.240> just<00:01:53.389> keeps<00:01:53.630> an<00:01:53.810> eye

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
languages basically it just keeps an eye

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.330 
languages basically it just keeps an eye
on<00:01:53.960> your<00:01:54.200> device's<00:01:54.619> clipboard<00:01:55.130> and

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
on your device's clipboard and

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.069 
on your device's clipboard and
automatically<00:01:55.909> translate<00:01:56.389> whatever<00:01:56.689> hits

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
that clipboard into your target language

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.090 
that clipboard into your target language
of<00:01:59.240> choice<00:01:59.270> so<00:02:00.170> while<00:02:00.590> this<00:02:00.740> may<00:02:00.889> not<00:02:01.039> be

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
of choice so while this may not be

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.919 
of choice so while this may not be
terribly<00:02:01.549> useful<00:02:01.759> for<00:02:02.240> translating<00:02:02.719> what
