 in what is the deadly kombat of and good 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.630

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.640
 on my facebook page for the video 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.070
 who were previously mortal 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.200
 kombat thus making several criticisms and 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.000
 good guys I respect what each 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.530
 who thinks and says nothing more about me 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.049
 point of view of whether the game fascinates me 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.000
 I like it is very good nothing is that then 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.009

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:32.270
