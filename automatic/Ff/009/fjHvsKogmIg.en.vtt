 It's very easy to do here. 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.750
 the spices are very simple to 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.890
 to find home is just to beat everything in the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.750
 blender 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.810
 I'm sorry for your little cocktail. 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.029
 That's why it 's very easy, that's all. 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.660
 marinating before taking to the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.640
 oven 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.830
 You'll see, let's go to the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.260
 The recipe we'll start by preparing 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.320
 the ingredients of our seasoning then 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.750
 here it will only basically prepare the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.910
 chives and parsley here we are 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.489
 cutting the chives into smaller pieces 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.160
 to make it easier to take 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.280
 blender and you will do the same 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.960
 with the parsley just take the stem and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.960
 cut into smaller pieces 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.440
 the tomatoes we will do the same to 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.170
 people will cut into smaller segments 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.920
 You'll enjoy it and you'll take it away. 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.479
 You do not want just this seasoning here. 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.450
 now in the blender we'll go 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.450
 put the tomato will put the parsley 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.830
 you can then add the olive oil goes 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.320
 also put the same amount of 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:28.770
 water will play the salt will play the pepper 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.479
 calabresa the garlic reminding that all the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.030
 our ingredients are down here 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.200
 in the video description will also play the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.869
 lemon juice and finally will play the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.100
 chives and you can hit your 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.200
 seasoning, you're going to hit more or less 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.210
 two minutes until seasoning 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.100
 totally liquid then this seasoning 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.340
 where are you going to marinate your 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.330
 That's the consistency that you 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.399
 either at the end 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.700
 That's when you saw us for a long time. 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.950
 whole here we are just baking one 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.020
 piece of cake but the amount of 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.110
 seasoning that we made here that you 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.759
 You see, it's for the better so it's not strange. 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.060
 That will be enough 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.100
 Now let's prepare the little snack here. 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.160
 people are using this piece of 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.190
 pork ribs what are we going to do? 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.190
 now make some incisions in our 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.930
 ask for the seasoning between better it 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.510
 be more seasoned 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.850
 so just get a very sharp knife and 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:36.269
 these films that are behind the 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:39.329
 It's just a few incisions you make 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.950
 will do the same thing on the side of the meat 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.980
 of your little cake 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.950
 so you just have to find the spaces between the 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.510
 bones are you going to make strong ones for 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.890
 your seasoning is the best 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.959
 after making these cuts you will 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.329
 put your ribs in a bowl 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.940
 then you will play your seasoning that 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.769
 had you previously prepared in this 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.870
 seasoning here your little ribs will go 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.880
 marinating for a long time before 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.970
 of you put in the oven 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.700
 so with your own hand you only have access 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.130
 your spice for all the little ribs to 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.170
 that he absorbs and that this time 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.230
 between the decisions you make 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.449
 had done now is the time to cover 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.660
 with plastic wrap so just put one 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:26.030
 plastic film on top of your bowl 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.090
 and it covers very well and you can then 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.860
 Take to the refrigerator and this little cake. 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.920
 here will be in the refrigerator for no 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.440

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.380

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.810
 that night a day before leaving the 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.760

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.870

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.050
 five o'clock 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.020
 just take away all your seasoning and now 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.050
 You'll put in the way that goes straight 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.480
 to the oven with a spoon or a 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:01.480
 shell you can play more of the seasoning 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:07.120

 200 degrees for one hour after a 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.090
 time you will remove the foil and 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.300

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.620
 Finish for 30 minutes at your rib

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.150
 You can leave it resting for about ten. 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.960
 minutes before slicing and when you
