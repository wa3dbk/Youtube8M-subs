00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.700
 Hi all 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.650
 I marcela hope they are well 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.289
 Welcome back to our channel 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.570
 the day today we will show you how to do 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.970
 a spiral braid 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.699
 we start by catching a tail with all the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.730
 hair let's take a division 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.939
 small to the side and we are going to divide it 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.640
 in three here we are going to make a braid 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.920
 regular crossing the divisions of the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.370
 sides above the one in the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.280
 center well here we're going to start 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.040
 add hair then we take a 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.400
 very small division and we add it to the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.250
 braid 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.320
 we cross over now without adding 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.020
 hair on this side 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.690
 and again we add hair from 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.719
 up we 're always going to add hair 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.540
 only from above 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:06.650
 again I cross over and added a 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.650
 small division 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.870
 I now cross over without adding 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.000
 hair 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.000
 and again it's from above 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.780
 I cross over and add hair here 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.720
 we are already on the other side of the queue 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.970
 then we will knit about 4 or 5 steps 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.970
 of the braid without adding hair 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.440
 then we went through the braid 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.329
 under the hair 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.549
 we are going to receive it on the other side 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.799
 then we arrange the hands having 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.790
 Be careful that the braid does not get spoiled 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:57.720
 and we take the divisions again 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.090
 here we start again then 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.870
 add hair from this side of the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.100
 tail again 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.190
 I cross over and added hair from 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.820
 above 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:18.120
 again crossed over 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.790
 and I add hair from above so we go 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.600
 to continue weaving the braid until 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.600
 to the other side 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.930
 ah 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.990
 here we go then to weave some 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.130
 steps of the braid without adding more 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:43.340
 hair and then we went through 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.380
 below to the other side of here in 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.020
 forward we will continue weaving the 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.020
 braid doing exactly the same 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.660
 steps and will take turns to 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.590
 we can also depend on the 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.590
 long hair 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.959
 when we finished the braid the 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.410
 we hold then with a band 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.870
 elastic 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.670
 and with another bandite we are going to sustain 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.670
 also the full tail 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:39.180
 at the end we can decorate with a bow 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.359
 and this is the final result of the hairstyle 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.450
 notice how the shape of the braid gives 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:48.319
 this effect to the hair that looks super 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.319
 really cute 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.480
