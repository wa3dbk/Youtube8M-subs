this<00:02:02.360> point<00:02:02.740> we<00:02:03.740> wanted<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.040> make<00:02:04.130> sure<00:02:04.160> that

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
this point we wanted to make sure that

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.320 
this point we wanted to make sure that
we<00:02:04.670> learned<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.060> fish<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.660> was<00:02:05.780> a<00:02:05.869> good<00:02:05.990> size<00:02:06.229> 1

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
45 to 50 pounds perhaps we had a lot of

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.300 
45 to 50 pounds perhaps we had a lot of
fish<00:02:11.810> swimming<00:02:12.170> around<00:02:12.230> this<00:02:12.680> one<00:02:12.950> was<00:02:13.100> a<00:02:13.130> bit

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
fish swimming around this one was a bit

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.390 
fish swimming around this one was a bit
bolder<00:02:13.610> than<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.820> other<00:02:13.970> came<00:02:14.239> a<00:02:14.270> bit<00:02:14.450> closer

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
bolder than the other came a bit closer

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.820

he<00:02:16.400> was<00:02:16.610> not<00:02:16.940> too<00:02:17.420> interested<00:02:18.170> on<00:02:18.380> what<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.650> was

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
he was not too interested on what I was

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.440 
he was not too interested on what I was
doing<00:02:19.160> because<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.580> was<00:02:19.850> like<00:02:20.000> floating

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
doing because I was like floating

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.670 
doing because I was like floating
gliding<00:02:21.230> down<00:02:21.260> towards<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.280> bottom<00:02:23.410> he<00:02:24.410> was

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
gliding down towards the bottom he was

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.520 
gliding down towards the bottom he was
more<00:02:25.100> interested<00:02:25.400> in<00:02:26.090> checking<00:02:26.870> out<00:02:27.140> like

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
more interested in checking out like

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.479 
more interested in checking out like
Neil<00:02:28.450> his<00:02:29.450> scooter<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.590> was<00:02:30.890> following<00:02:31.130> the

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
Neil his scooter so I was following the

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.150 
Neil his scooter so I was following the
bubbles<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.180> he<00:02:32.930> was<00:02:33.080> thinking<00:02:33.500> that<00:02:33.680> what

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
bubbles and he was thinking that what

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.680 
bubbles and he was thinking that what
corrupts<00:02:34.640> maybe<00:02:35.890> something<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.010> feed<00:02:37.280> on

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
corrupts maybe something to feed on

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.190 
corrupts maybe something to feed on
because<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.720> mark<00:02:39.470> was<00:02:39.799> on<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.130> boat<00:02:40.390> coming<00:02:41.390> in

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
because a mark was on the boat coming in

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.990 
because a mark was on the boat coming in
fact<00:02:42.440> he<00:02:42.590> missed<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:43.010> shot<00:02:43.220> because<00:02:43.519> he<00:02:43.820> was

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
fact he missed a shot because he was

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.729 
fact he missed a shot because he was
doing<00:02:44.239> all<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.390> work<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:45.019> was<00:02:45.560> like<00:02:45.680> a

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
combined effort was pretty good then we

00:02:47.810 --> 00:03:41.039 
combined effort was pretty good then we
were<00:02:47.900> able<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.320> land<00:02:48.530> such<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.130> beautiful<00:02:49.580> fish
