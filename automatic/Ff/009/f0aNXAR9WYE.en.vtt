00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
lanes and going pretty straight

this<00:00:26.849> tournament<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.599> think<00:00:27.869> if<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.140> look

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
this tournament and I think if you look

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.779 
this tournament and I think if you look
at<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> other<00:00:28.590> guys<00:00:28.769> those<00:00:29.220> guys<00:00:29.250> put<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
at the other guys those guys put the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.569 
at the other guys those guys put the
ball<00:00:29.910> out<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.599> approached<00:00:31.340> yesterday<00:00:32.340> with

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
ball out so I approached yesterday with

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.180 
ball out so I approached yesterday with
with<00:00:33.540> that's<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> way<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.710> was<00:00:34.860> gonna<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.130> to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
with that's the way I was gonna have to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.330 
with that's the way I was gonna have to
roll<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> ball<00:00:35.930> and<00:00:36.930> that's<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> way<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.350> try

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
roll the ball and that's the way I try

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.590 
roll the ball and that's the way I try
and<00:00:38.399> approach<00:00:38.640> all<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.969> lanes

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and approach all the lanes

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.080 
and approach all the lanes
I<00:00:39.629> let<00:00:40.200> them<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.890> lanes<00:00:41.129> dictate<00:00:41.610> what<00:00:42.059> kind

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
I let them the lanes dictate what kind

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.520 
I let them the lanes dictate what kind
of<00:00:42.270> role<00:00:42.420> I'm<00:00:42.510> gonna<00:00:42.660> put<00:00:42.809> on<00:00:42.899> it

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
of role I'm gonna put on it

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.580 
of role I'm gonna put on it
Brian<00:00:44.399> says<00:00:44.700> he<00:00:44.850> lets<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.239> lanes<00:00:45.510> dictate<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
Brian says he lets the lanes dictate the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.410 
Brian says he lets the lanes dictate the
type<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.980> role<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.550> type<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.789> speed<00:00:48.210> that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
type of role and the type of speed that

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.970 
type of role and the type of speed that
he's<00:00:48.570> gonna<00:00:48.719> put<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.140> well<00:00:49.710> let's<00:00:49.890> suppose

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
he's gonna put on it well let's suppose

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.799 
he's gonna put on it well let's suppose
the<00:00:50.280> lanes<00:00:50.520> are<00:00:50.760> hooking<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.120> lot<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.570> want

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
the lanes are hooking a lot and we want

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.049 
the lanes are hooking a lot and we want
to<00:00:51.899> throw<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.170> hard<00:00:52.410> how<00:00:53.100> do<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.309> do<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:53.820> what

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
to throw it hard how do I do that what

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.180 
to throw it hard how do I do that what
do<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.239> think<00:00:54.270> about<00:00:54.780> well<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.379> could<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.800> give

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
do I think about well I could just give

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.500 
do I think about well I could just give
you<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.340> couple<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.670> suggestions<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.329> what<00:00:57.449> I

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
you a couple of suggestions of what I

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.209 
you a couple of suggestions of what I
think<00:00:57.899> about<00:00:58.109> when<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.649> want<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> throw<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
think about when I want to throw the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.830

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
it straight or so I stay behind it and I

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.549 
it straight or so I stay behind it and I
try<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.300> take<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.629> push<00:01:03.809> way<00:01:04.019> out<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.379> like

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.200 
try and take the push way out and like
I'm<00:01:04.739> putting<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> table<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.760> let<00:01:06.090> it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
I'm putting it on a table and let it

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.640 
I'm putting it on a table and let it
swing<00:01:06.420> straight<00:01:06.810> from<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> shoulder<00:01:07.470> with<00:01:07.619> a

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
swing straight from the shoulder with a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.350 
swing straight from the shoulder with a
straight<00:01:08.070> elbow<00:01:08.490> all<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.670> way<00:01:08.820> through<00:01:09.180> and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
straight elbow all the way through and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.480 
straight elbow all the way through and
go<00:01:09.659> through<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> ball<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> lot<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.100> force

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
go through the ball with a lot of force

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.060 
go through the ball with a lot of force
and<00:01:11.760> pretty<00:01:12.240> firmly<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.960> way<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:14.040> about

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
and pretty firmly that way what about

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.859 
and pretty firmly that way what about
what<00:01:14.460> I'd<00:01:14.610> want<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.909> throw<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.270> softer<00:01:15.750> when

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
what I'd want to throw it's softer when

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.749 
what I'd want to throw it's softer when
the<00:01:16.020> lanes<00:01:16.229> are<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.830> little<00:01:17.009> bit<00:01:17.189> tighter<00:01:17.460> like

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
the lanes are a little bit tighter like

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.070 
the lanes are a little bit tighter like
here<00:01:18.000> most<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.420> players<00:01:18.659> here<00:01:18.960> are

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
here most of the players here are

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.899 
here most of the players here are
throwing<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.470> slower<00:01:19.799> well<00:01:20.430> what<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.610> want<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
throwing it slower well what I want to

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.999 
throwing it slower well what I want to
do<00:01:21.030> then<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.990> still<00:01:22.229> want<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.500> let<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.650> swing

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
do then is I still want to let it swing

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.980 
do then is I still want to let it swing
from<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> shoulder<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.270> try<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.720> let<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
from the shoulder but I try and let the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.840 
from the shoulder but I try and let the
elbow<00:01:25.380> almost<00:01:25.619> break<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> little<00:01:26.430> bit<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
elbow almost break a little bit in the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.550

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
back here and as I come through I come

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.410 
back here and as I come through I come
through<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.860> softer<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.490> try<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.090> roll<00:01:30.270> my
