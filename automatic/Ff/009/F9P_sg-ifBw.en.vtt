00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
in which they dumped me were kind of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.719 
in which they dumped me were kind of
seemingly<00:01:55.079> excessively<00:01:55.740> cruel<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.490> now<00:01:56.610> when

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
seemingly excessively cruel but now when

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.280 
seemingly excessively cruel but now when
I<00:01:56.790> look<00:01:56.969> back<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.570> doesn't<00:01:57.750> seem<00:01:58.020> like

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
I look back on and it doesn't seem like

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.670 
I look back on and it doesn't seem like
this<00:01:58.729> dichotomy<00:01:59.729> where<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.270> was<00:02:00.840> good<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.439> they

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
this dichotomy where I was good and they

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.709 
this dichotomy where I was good and they
were<00:02:01.799> bad<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.610> stayed<00:02:02.939> with<00:02:03.149> them<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.600> they

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
were bad and I stayed with them and they

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.429 
were bad and I stayed with them and they
left<00:02:03.960> me

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
left me

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.399 
left me
it<00:02:04.619> seems<00:02:04.950> more<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.310> thank<00:02:06.240> God<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.689> ended<00:02:07.320> up

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
it seems more like thank God I ended up

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.990 
it seems more like thank God I ended up
with<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.740> Yeti<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.280> maybe<00:02:08.580> they've<00:02:08.819> been

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
with the Yeti and maybe they've been

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.430 
with the Yeti and maybe they've been
through<00:02:09.270> enough<00:02:09.300> because<00:02:09.989> what<00:02:10.319> I've

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
through enough because what I've

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.110 
through enough because what I've
realized<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.489> because<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.910> date

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120
