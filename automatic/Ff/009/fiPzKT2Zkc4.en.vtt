00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.300
 Y 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.370
 Hello, my little guardians, how are you? 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.110
 you are welcome to a new video of 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.940
 destiny and today I prepared this video for you 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.590
 to tell you about reinforced weapons 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.570
 many of you are asking me 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.520
 and gothic how exactly the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.140
 reinforced that weapons can I reinforce 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.599
 because sometimes I try and it does not come out 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.369
 Well now I'm going to clarify what 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.130
 first thing we have to do is go to 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.280
 gunsmith that we have it here and talk to 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.720
 the 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.329
 let's get closer 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.640
 perfect but as you can see in the part 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.620
 lower does not appear at all 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.930
 because then because the weapons that I carry 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.760
 equipped right now can not be 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.649
 reinforce that easy 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.880
 well let's go right now in 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.130
 my inventory let's see from here 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.020
 worth another thing to keep in mind is that 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.150
 each weapon has a symbol in the part 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.740
 top right with a number in 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.600
 Roman numerals in this case the claw 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.100
 annihilates wolves has number 2 that 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.870
 it means that it belongs to the new 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.750
 enlarge the house of the wolves when 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.010
 you see a weapon with the symbol 1 this one 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.450
 here for example it means that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.610
 belongs to the deep darkness is 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.720
 say to the first good dlc those that do not 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.090
 have nothing because they are weapons already 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.200
 they were included in the base game good 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.330
 because I say this because there are 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.970
 keep in mind that we can only 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.670
 reinforce weapons and not all care and 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.740
 not all that belong to the new 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.390
 expanding the house of wolves see is 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.280
 for example it is a weapon that belongs 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.229
 as I said to the expansion but without 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.570
 But when we're going to talk to him 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.729
 gunsmith does not recognize us that he wants 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.380
 say that they are special weapons that do not 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.300
 can reinforce this is one for example 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.850
 the claw nicky the wolves that belongs to 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.740
 I got the prison playing in the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.270
 prison of the elderly and this one that 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.440
 we have here for example that this 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.270
 they give it to us in the first mission of the 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.130
 campaign in the dynasty must be very 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.900
 well-known also you are asking for 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.180
 she then three quarters of the same you see 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.069
 when we approach it does not appear good 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.960
 then they have to be the weapons that 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.780
 we can reinforce it has to be weapons 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.070
 do not be special of the house good in 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.100
 this case of the presidio of the elderly 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.960
 nor that belong to osiris by 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.119
 example is that I have here as you see the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.100
 infinite theorem is machine gun 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.259
 has the number 2 and you can not 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.030
 reinforce because of what I say because 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.649
 It belongs to the collection of weapons 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.080
 osiris and are considered special weapons 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.310
 and can not be reinforced then we go to 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.959
 look for weapons that can be reformed by 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.450
 example is that we have here the amulet 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.920
 of bad luck this shotgun me the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.220
 I will place here as a secondary weapon 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.180
 as a primary weapon I'm going to wear this 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.350
 pulse rifle would be payment 6 to see the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.700
 last half of war dor cause 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.680
 additional loading speed increases 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.930
 when the charger is empty or is 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.030
 other 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.030
 the state of salvation if this one that 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.829
 like less besides I have not improved it or 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.680
 I have not uploaded it that is important is what 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.390
 I say because when we reinforce a weapon the 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.250
 let's reset and we're going to lose everything 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.769
 what we have achieved according to 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.180
 example here the shotgun is that you are 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.219
 seeing you would complete the reform I 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.870
 in his day because the advantages he had 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.819
 they did not convince me then when the 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.709
 reinforce it gave me automatic mode 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.040
 what you know you are seeing right now 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.989
 here and also half army of one 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.090
 these two improvements to me particularly 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.280
 I like them so I decided to stay 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.260
 this good shotgun let's go with another 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.549
 this is the one we're going to do good we're going 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.090
 to reinforce we will do the test with 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.950
 salvation state you see this weapon has 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.709
 this advantage that would be icarus that 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.359
 improved precision while being in the air the 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.530
 it's true that I'm not convinced 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.780
 improvement that I consider there are other 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.549
 much better and on the other hand we have 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.230
 here outlaws the casualties of 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.459
 accuracy with this weapon increase 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.290
 enormously the speed recharges good 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.260
 this one is not bad but as I say we are going 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.329
 to do this test with this with this 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.860
 gun of good agreement then then what 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.020
 what we have to do now 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.210
 to talk to the gunsmith now yes no 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.880
 the weapons will appear as you are seeing 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.350
 that can be reinforced and as I said 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.360
 the shotgun does not interest me because it's 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.860
 fine but instead is another 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.330
 here this explorer's rifle we 're going to 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.880
 reinforce so you can see the differences 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.380
 well you know that you also need 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.300
 certain materials in this case 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.210
 obviously having the weapon is what 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.930
 fundamental a speck of light three pieces 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:10.040
 of weapon and 250 lumen well let's go to 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.040
 reinforce the weapon we press x keep and 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.250
 we already have a new reinforced weapon 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.190
 let's see now let's review we left 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.590
 here the new features here 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.080
 is and as you see now has given us 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.820
 triple impact precision hits 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.610
 fast return a projectile to 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.620
 charger is very good this advantage is not 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.150
 is wrong and we have on the other hand 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.680
 emotional the recharge speed 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.139
 increases when the magazine is empty 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.510
 well this other advantage because it convinces me 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.550
 therefore, I am going to keep it that way 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.710
 how good you have seen how it works 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.270
 the issue of reinforcing weapons over 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.720
 all remember that they have to be weapons 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.669
 of legend purple weapons that belong 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.289
 to the new expansion the house of the 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.270
 wolves and above all remember that 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.160
 also that if you have the raised weapon if 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.910
 you have raised the level you are going to lose 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:01.090
 reset the level so good with the 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.830
 advantage of having other advantages never 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.110
 rather, they can convince you more 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.960
 that has not convinced you of the new weapon 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.850
 the new reinforced because you turn it to 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.190
 reinforce until the weapon appears with 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.740
 the advantages to you like you 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.930
 well so far the video this was 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.300
 What I wanted to tell you about the reinforcer 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.560
 I hope you have been useful if 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.370
 you have any doubt you can leave in 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.289
 the comments 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.850
 I am gothic and see you in the next 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.850
 video take care of you goodbye
