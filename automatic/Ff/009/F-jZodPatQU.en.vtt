00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.600 
just get into this real quick the most
important<00:00:34.559> thing<00:00:34.590> about<00:00:34.800> hockey<00:00:35.100> open<00:00:35.430> team

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
important thing about hockey open team

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.569 
important thing about hockey open team
is<00:00:35.820> probably<00:00:36.920> progression<00:00:37.920> obviously<00:00:38.370> but

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
is probably progression obviously but

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.270 
is probably progression obviously but
the<00:00:38.790> main<00:00:39.030> thing<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.390> separates<00:00:39.930> it

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
the main thing that separates it

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.280 
the main thing that separates it
separates<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.700> probably<00:00:42.360> packs<00:00:42.750> that's<00:00:43.110> my

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
separates it is probably packs that's my

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.229 
separates it is probably packs that's my
opinion<00:00:43.579> that's<00:00:44.579> what<00:00:44.730> probably<00:00:44.850> make<00:00:45.120> you

gold<00:01:09.960> players<00:01:10.200> an<00:01:11.000> NHL<00:01:12.000> 13<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.960> packs<00:01:13.260> were<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
gold players an NHL 13 the packs were a

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.880 
gold players an NHL 13 the packs were a
chance<00:01:14.280> at<00:01:14.430> 5<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.820> 6<00:01:15.060> 80<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.600> above<00:01:15.689> players<00:01:16.470> in

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
chance at 5 to 6 80 and above players in

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.530 
chance at 5 to 6 80 and above players in
next<00:01:17.460> year<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:17.790> going<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> chance<00:01:18.420> at

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
next year it's going to be a chance at

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.050 
next year it's going to be a chance at
five<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.930> six<00:01:19.170> gold<00:01:19.590> player<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.850> could<00:01:21.030> be

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
five to six gold player so that could be

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.359 
five to six gold player so that could be
a<00:01:21.180> really<00:01:21.540> negative<00:01:21.780> thing<00:01:22.200> because<00:01:22.500> if<00:01:23.280> you

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
a really negative thing because if you

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.640 
a really negative thing because if you
think<00:01:23.430> about<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.939> could<00:01:24.090> get<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.650> 577

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
think about it you could get like 577

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.780 
think about it you could get like 577
gold<00:01:25.799> players<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.400> would<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.580> terrible

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
gold players and that would be terrible

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.399 
gold players and that would be terrible
I'd<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> lot<00:01:27.450> worse<00:01:27.570> than<00:01:27.780> an<00:01:27.900> NHL<00:01:28.259> their

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
I'd be a lot worse than an NHL their

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.649 
I'd be a lot worse than an NHL their
team<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:29.280> here's<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.030> positive<00:01:30.509> thing

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
team but here's the the positive thing

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.600 
team but here's the the positive thing
in<00:01:30.750> my<00:01:30.840> opinion<00:01:31.049> if<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.860> guys<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.220> checked

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
in my opinion if you guys have checked

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.429 
in my opinion if you guys have checked
that<00:01:32.700> what<00:01:32.909> EA<00:01:33.030> put<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.509> they<00:01:33.780> put<00:01:34.049> up<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
that what EA put up they put up a the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.800 
that what EA put up they put up a the
top<00:01:34.650> 50<00:01:35.009> players<00:01:35.130> there<00:01:35.970> then<00:01:36.210> finish<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.630> yet

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
top 50 players there then finish it yet

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.020 
top 50 players there then finish it yet
but<00:01:36.990> first<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:37.860> three<00:01:38.130> things<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.640> lot<00:01:39.000> of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
but first like three things a lot of

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.069 
but first like three things a lot of
people<00:01:39.240> are<00:01:39.299> really<00:01:39.329> high<00:01:39.600> rated<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
people are really high rated in the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.560 
people are really high rated in the
scheme<00:01:40.350> like<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.770> would<00:01:41.100> say<00:01:41.310> any<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:42.030> think

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
scheme like I would say any I think

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.740 
scheme like I would say any I think
maybe<00:01:42.930> there<00:01:43.740> was<00:01:43.890> 30<00:01:44.250> players<00:01:44.670> above<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.570> it

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
maybe there was 30 players above like it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.560 
maybe there was 30 players above like it
I'd<00:01:46.110> say<00:01:46.320> 20<00:01:46.799> players<00:01:47.009> above<00:01:47.369> an<00:01:47.460> 80<00:01:47.640> now<00:01:47.970> now

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
I'd say 20 players above an 80 now now

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.740 
I'd say 20 players above an 80 now now
maybe<00:01:49.350> 15<00:01:49.890> players<00:01:50.159> who<00:01:50.399> are<00:01:50.490> above<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> 88

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
maybe 15 players who are above like a 88

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.429 
maybe 15 players who are above like a 88
last<00:01:52.020> year<00:01:52.380> or<00:01:52.770> maybe<00:01:52.979> even<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.570> 13<00:01:54.570> or<00:01:54.600> 12<00:01:54.840> so

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
last year or maybe even like 13 or 12 so

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.990 
last year or maybe even like 13 or 12 so
it<00:01:55.590> was<00:01:55.770> not<00:01:55.950> allowed<00:01:56.219> at<00:01:56.399> all<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.939> year

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
it was not allowed at all this year

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.990 
it was not allowed at all this year
there<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.810> think<00:01:58.310> 50<00:01:59.310> players<00:01:59.579> were<00:01:59.759> above

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
there is I think 50 players were above

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.350 
there is I think 50 players were above
an<00:02:00.090> 88<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.049> that's<00:02:01.290> pretty<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.340> that's<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.090> lot

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
an 88 so that's pretty like that's a lot

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.929 
an 88 so that's pretty like that's a lot
I<00:02:03.630> know<00:02:03.990> Girardi<00:02:04.530> was<00:02:04.680> number<00:02:05.040> 50th<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.759> he

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
I know Girardi was number 50th and he

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.490 
I know Girardi was number 50th and he
was<00:02:06.090> 80<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.869> means<00:02:07.049> there<00:02:07.229> are<00:02:07.290> 50

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
was 80 so that means there are 50

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.320 
was 80 so that means there are 50
players<00:02:07.710> who<00:02:07.890> are<00:02:07.950> above<00:02:08.129> an<00:02:08.220> 80<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:09.270> know

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
players who are above an 80 and I know

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.520 
players who are above an 80 and I know
for<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> fact<00:02:09.869> then<00:02:10.500> each<00:02:10.649> other<00:02:10.920> team<00:02:11.129> did

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
for a fact then each other team did

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.699 
for a fact then each other team did
but<00:02:12.340> here's<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.670> other<00:02:12.940> side<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:14.410> hockey

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
but here's the other side is that hockey

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.340 
but here's the other side is that hockey
ultimate<00:02:15.100> team<00:02:15.280> in<00:02:15.400> NHL<00:02:15.550> 13<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.330> vs<00:02:16.840> both

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
ultimate team in NHL 13 and vs both

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.100 
ultimate team in NHL 13 and vs both
players<00:02:17.680> had<00:02:17.920> different<00:02:18.250> like<00:02:18.370> stats<00:02:18.760> like<00:02:19.110> an

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
players had different like stats like an

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.340 
players had different like stats like an
example<00:02:20.680> in<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.940> guess<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.840> can<00:02:22.959> take<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.080> chore

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
example in I guess you can take a chore

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.650 
example in I guess you can take a chore
right<00:02:23.500> there<00:02:23.680> in<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:23.920> video<00:02:24.340> he's<00:02:24.640> an<00:02:24.760> 85<00:02:25.240> but

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
right there in the video he's an 85 but

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.530 
right there in the video he's an 85 but
he's<00:02:25.810> an<00:02:25.900> 80<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.770> think<00:02:27.370> 89<00:02:27.850> actually<00:02:28.300> now<00:02:28.390> he's

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
he's an 80 I think 89 actually now he's

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.910 
he's an 80 I think 89 actually now he's
a<00:02:28.569> Navy<00:02:28.720> 84<00:02:29.590> vs<00:02:30.100> so<00:02:31.020> really<00:02:32.020> these<00:02:32.319> stats<00:02:32.650> don't

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
a Navy 84 vs so really these stats don't

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.059 
a Navy 84 vs so really these stats don't
really<00:02:33.130> mean<00:02:33.280> anything<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:34.750> if<00:02:35.080> they<00:02:35.500> do<00:02:35.560> I

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
really mean anything but if they do I

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.860 
really mean anything but if they do I
hopefully<00:02:36.280> they<00:02:36.580> do<00:02:36.640> like<00:02:36.970> carry<00:02:37.239> over<00:02:37.420> the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
hopefully they do like carry over the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.449 
hopefully they do like carry over the
hut<00:02:38.050> are<00:02:38.260> somewhat<00:02:38.709> similar<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:39.280> there's<00:02:39.430> a

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
hut are somewhat similar so there's a

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.830 
hut are somewhat similar so there's a
lot<00:02:39.520> higher<00:02:39.700> like<00:02:39.940> overall<00:02:40.300> players<00:02:40.600> in

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
lot higher like overall players in

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.750 
lot higher like overall players in
hockey<00:02:41.020> open<00:02:41.319> theme<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.770> hope<00:02:42.100> so<00:02:42.310> but<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.520> really

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
hockey open theme I hope so but I really

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.759 
hockey open theme I hope so but I really
don't<00:02:42.910> know<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.630> that<00:02:43.750> mean<00:02:43.900> packs<00:02:44.200> could<00:02:44.650> be

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
don't know and that mean packs could be

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.800 
don't know and that mean packs could be
better<00:02:44.920> meaning<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:46.090> when<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.510> get<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.660> gold

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
better meaning that when you get a gold

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.060 
better meaning that when you get a gold
player<00:02:47.080> there's<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.380> higher<00:02:47.530> chance<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.950> you

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
player there's a higher chance of you

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.920 
player there's a higher chance of you
getting<00:02:48.220> one<00:02:48.700> that's<00:02:48.880> good<00:02:49.330> because<00:02:49.540> most<00:02:49.870> of

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
getting one that's good because most of

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.020 
getting one that's good because most of
them<00:02:50.080> are<00:02:50.170> going<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.320> be<00:02:50.380> good<00:02:50.910> comparing<00:02:51.910> like

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
them are going to be good comparing like

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.360 
them are going to be good comparing like
vs.<00:02:52.450> because<00:02:52.780> 50<00:02:53.260> 80<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.800> above<00:02:53.890> players

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
vs. because 50 80 and above players

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.160 
vs. because 50 80 and above players
meaning<00:02:54.850> that's<00:02:55.420> pretty<00:02:55.690> good<00:02:55.780> chance<00:02:56.019> of

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
meaning that's pretty good chance of

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.259 
meaning that's pretty good chance of
getting<00:02:56.410> a<00:02:56.470> good<00:02:56.620> player<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.280> then<00:02:57.970> another

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
getting a good player and then another

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.750 
getting a good player and then another
positive<00:02:58.630> thing<00:02:58.989> is<00:02:59.140> I've<00:02:59.470> gotten<00:02:59.890> a<00:02:59.950> few<00:02:59.980> 79

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
positive thing is I've gotten a few 79

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.900 
positive thing is I've gotten a few 79
80<00:03:01.410> silver<00:03:02.410> players<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:03.069> that's<00:03:03.640> silver

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
80 silver players so that's silver

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.370 
80 silver players so that's silver
players<00:03:04.239> so<00:03:04.420> that's<00:03:04.569> pretty<00:03:04.750> cool<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.260> I

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
players so that's pretty cool and I

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.490 
players so that's pretty cool and I
there's<00:03:05.739> a<00:03:05.800> few<00:03:06.010> like<00:03:06.160> 75<00:03:07.000> 279<00:03:07.720> bronze<00:03:08.230> players

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
there's a few like 75 279 bronze players

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.890 
there's a few like 75 279 bronze players
so<00:03:08.800> that's<00:03:09.220> another<00:03:09.459> cool<00:03:09.730> thing<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:10.600> really

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
so that's another cool thing so really

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.530 
so that's another cool thing so really
this<00:03:11.110> year<00:03:11.319> for<00:03:11.470> pax<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:12.040> I'm<00:03:12.760> excited<00:03:13.209> for<00:03:13.420> them

this year for pax I I'm excited for them
but<00:03:13.840> I'm<00:03:13.959> also<00:03:14.110> not<00:03:14.410> like<00:03:14.650> ecstatic<00:03:15.100> because<00:03:15.459> I

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
but I'm also not like ecstatic because I

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.400 
but I'm also not like ecstatic because I
feel<00:03:15.910> like<00:03:16.030> it's<00:03:16.630> gonna<00:03:16.780> be<00:03:16.959> pretty<00:03:17.079> much<00:03:17.290> the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
feel like it's gonna be pretty much the

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.930 
feel like it's gonna be pretty much the
same<00:03:17.530> as<00:03:17.709> 13<00:03:18.130> you're<00:03:18.310> gonna<00:03:18.430> get<00:03:18.610> ripped<00:03:18.760> off
