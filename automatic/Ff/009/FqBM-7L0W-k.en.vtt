00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.889 
looked they just kind of end up looking
kind<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.489> cheesy<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:33.030> Instagram<00:00:33.510> filters

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899

almost<00:00:34.290> which<00:00:34.920> isn't<00:00:35.190> viscose<00:00:35.489> fault<00:00:35.760> it's

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
almost which isn't viscose fault it's

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.370 
almost which isn't viscose fault it's
just<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.180> way<00:00:36.270> JPEGs<00:00:36.660> work<00:00:36.870> there's<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:37.260> not

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
just the way JPEGs work there's just not

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.260 
just the way JPEGs work there's just not
a<00:00:37.559> lot<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.890> latitude<00:00:38.070> there<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> was

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
a lot of latitude there so I was

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.750 
a lot of latitude there so I was
actually<00:00:39.420> able<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.899> find<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.260> workaround

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
actually able to find a workaround

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.979 
actually able to find a workaround
because<00:00:41.760> right<00:00:42.000> now<00:00:42.030> even<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> Lightroom

import on the Lightroom it'll move them

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.240 
import on the Lightroom it'll move them
into<00:03:06.239> my<00:03:06.420> library<00:03:06.629> anyways<00:03:07.200> so<00:03:07.980> yeah<00:03:08.010> we're

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
into my library anyways so yeah we're

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.550 
into my library anyways so yeah we're
gonna<00:03:08.340> save<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.519> as<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.730> DNG<00:03:09.060> file<00:03:09.420> in<00:03:09.629> Lightroom

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
gonna save it as a DNG file in Lightroom

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.530 
gonna save it as a DNG file in Lightroom
can<00:03:10.769> accept<00:03:11.069> dng<00:03:11.400> files<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:11.909> we're<00:03:12.420> taking

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
can accept dng files so we're taking

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.210 
can accept dng files so we're taking
these<00:03:12.750> raw<00:03:12.930> files<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.500> lightroom<00:03:13.680> doesn't

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
these raw files that lightroom doesn't

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.979 
these raw files that lightroom doesn't
take<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.760> converting<00:03:15.180> them<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.299> dng<00:03:15.629> what<00:03:15.870> you

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
take and converting them to dng what you

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.460 
take and converting them to dng what you
will<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:17.340> was<00:03:17.459> pretty<00:03:17.579> good<00:03:17.900> dmg<00:03:18.900> files<00:03:19.139> are

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
will it was pretty good dmg files are

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.680 
will it was pretty good dmg files are
not<00:03:19.500> quite<00:03:20.040> as<00:03:20.250> versatile<00:03:20.760> as<00:03:20.819> raw<00:03:21.150> files<00:03:21.449> are

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
not quite as versatile as raw files are

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.740 
not quite as versatile as raw files are
I<00:03:21.840> don't<00:03:22.199> think<00:03:22.319> they<00:03:22.709> claim<00:03:22.949> they<00:03:23.099> are<00:03:23.129> but<00:03:23.459> I

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
I don't think they claim they are but I

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.720 
I don't think they claim they are but I
don't<00:03:24.750> seem<00:03:25.049> I<00:03:25.440> don't<00:03:25.829> think<00:03:26.250> there's<00:03:26.430> as<00:03:26.549> much

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
don't seem I don't think there's as much

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.550 
don't seem I don't think there's as much
especially<00:03:27.000> flexibility<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:27.930> exposure<00:03:28.319> and

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
especially flexibility and exposure and

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.490 
especially flexibility and exposure and
stuff<00:03:28.829> like<00:03:28.949> that<00:03:29.010> as<00:03:29.400> as<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:30.569> raw<00:03:30.810> file<00:03:31.049> is<00:03:31.290> but

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
stuff like that as as a raw file is but

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:41.110 
stuff like that as as a raw file is but
in<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:32.129> meantime<00:03:32.310> orcs<00:03:32.699> pretty<00:03:32.879> good

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.440 

you

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.570 

okay<00:03:46.230> well<00:03:46.410> i<00:03:46.440> went<00:03:46.650> ahead<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:46.890> sped<00:03:47.280> that<00:03:47.459> up

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
okay well i went ahead and sped that up

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.790 
okay well i went ahead and sped that up
a<00:03:47.670> little<00:03:47.790> bit<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.120> process<00:03:48.569> of<00:03:48.800> converting

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
a little bit the process of converting

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.440 
a little bit the process of converting
the<00:03:49.980> files<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.340> dean<00:03:50.489> g<00:03:50.640> actually<00:03:51.090> takes<00:03:51.330> a

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
the files to dean g actually takes a

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.750 
the files to dean g actually takes a
little<00:03:51.599> bit<00:03:51.980> so<00:03:52.980> while<00:03:53.129> that<00:03:53.160> was<00:03:53.400> happening<00:03:53.430> i

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
little bit so while that was happening i

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.190

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.450 
another picture let's try this one that
actually<00:05:59.430> makes<00:05:59.700> it<00:05:59.790> a<00:05:59.880> tad<00:06:00.090> warm<00:06:01.100> so<00:06:02.100> we<00:06:02.310> could

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
actually makes it a tad warm so we could

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.180 
actually makes it a tad warm so we could
either<00:06:02.580> just<00:06:03.560> on<00:06:04.560> the<00:06:04.620> presets<00:06:04.980> here<00:06:05.010> but<00:06:05.160> I

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
either just on the presets here but I

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.380 
either just on the presets here but I
think<00:06:05.220> it's<00:06:05.460> actually<00:06:05.550> my<00:06:05.760> white<00:06:05.940> balance<00:06:06.240> is

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
think it's actually my white balance is

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.780 
think it's actually my white balance is
just<00:06:06.570> a<00:06:06.660> little<00:06:06.870> bit<00:06:06.990> warm<00:06:07.200> here<00:06:07.380> so<00:06:07.560> let<00:06:07.680> me

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.790 
just a little bit warm here so let me

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.870 
just a little bit warm here so let me
let<00:06:08.790> me<00:06:08.910> cool<00:06:09.090> it<00:06:09.240> up<00:06:09.360> a<00:06:09.420> little<00:06:09.510> bit<00:06:10.790> it's<00:06:11.790> a

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
let me cool it up a little bit it's a

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.460 
let me cool it up a little bit it's a
little<00:06:11.910> bit<00:06:12.300> better<00:06:12.510> it's<00:06:13.200> pretty<00:06:13.320> cool

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
little bit better it's pretty cool

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.990 
little bit better it's pretty cool

of its you can see there's a pretty good
amount<00:06:33.840> of<00:06:34.850> latitude<00:06:35.850> here<00:06:36.180> almost<00:06:37.050> like<00:06:37.200> a

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260 
amount of latitude here almost like a

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.200 
amount of latitude here almost like a
real<00:06:37.500> wat<00:06:37.680> raw<00:06:37.920> file<00:06:38.190> and<00:06:38.490> it<00:06:38.940> might<00:06:39.090> actually

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
real wat raw file and it might actually

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.820 
real wat raw file and it might actually
be<00:06:39.480> exactly<00:06:39.840> the<00:06:39.990> same<00:06:40.020> and<00:06:40.320> I<00:06:40.380> it<00:06:40.440> might<00:06:40.680> just

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
be exactly the same and I it might just

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.800 
be exactly the same and I it might just
be<00:06:40.980> me<00:06:41.130> but<00:06:41.160> it's<00:06:41.910> pretty<00:06:42.240> good<00:06:42.390> you<00:06:42.690> have
