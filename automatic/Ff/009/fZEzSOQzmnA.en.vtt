00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.050
 ah 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.750
 hello how about youtube friends 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.850
 welcome once again to channel 10 101 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.390
 tec I am strong and good so in this 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.640
 occasion we're going to see an application that 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.119
 I think very useful and it will be very useful 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.789
 for all of you this application is 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.699
 aic line 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.960
 this application what you are going to do is a 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.070
 cleaning of our devices 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.820
 cleaning as to what will you erase 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.230
 all that time this trash that is going 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.210
 storing in our devices 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.820
 trash I mean when you by 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.339
 example where they download some tweet or 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.890
 download some application go 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.870
 saving or storing files in their 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.180
 devices comes the moment that 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.799
 you delete that application or that 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:06.070
 tweet but there are traces or fragments 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:09.100
 of what that application was or click 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.759
 and continue the most stored in our 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.690
 devices consuming resources 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.810
 so 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.660
 this makes our device to 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.030
 sometimes grows so grows so to 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.600
 Sometimes it gets slow for the same reason that 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.270
 we have consuming garbage consuming 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.040
 resources of our device then 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.440
 what is going to do this great 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.050
 application is that it will erase all 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.330
 that garbage everything that is 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.090
 unnecessary in terms of the system 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.550
 our device will not affect anything 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.490
 with respect to audio pictures images 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.190
 videos will simply delete the garbage 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.409
 and good 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.450
 here they are going to give you here 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.280
 the button on the top right 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.710
 down the battery where it says that a 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.710
 or clear as 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.410
 and they will give and automatically go to 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:13.100
 start cleaning 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.710
 what am I going to do is going to start cleaning 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.980
 to be a scan and it's going to clean and we're going 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.080
 to get a report of what of what 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.030
 it has been cleaned and how much of that memory 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.660
 clean after this are going to be the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.440
 rest 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.440
 I am going to cancel 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.630
 shorten this min 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:38.300
 and I will go to my cousins and right now 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.100
 I take a break from everything that I 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.790
 libero from memory 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:48.750
 since after this he made me 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.280
 the spain and here we have as we see no 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.569
 I had 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.600
 and nothing then as constantly the 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.030
 cleaning water I did not have anything and after 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.250
 seconds my men but even if 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.500

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.620
 totally free 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.470
 and it comes by default in the repository of 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.920
 because he decided for this we go and 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.920
