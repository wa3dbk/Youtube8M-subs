alcohol<00:00:16.109> because<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.619> goes<00:00:16.800> everywhere<00:00:17.190> and

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
alcohol because it goes everywhere and

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.570 
alcohol because it goes everywhere and

it's stinks and it's annoying but um

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.910 
it's stinks and it's annoying but um
yeah<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> found<00:00:21.420> another<00:00:21.660> way<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.650> approach

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
yeah I found another way to to approach

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.250 
yeah I found another way to to approach
the<00:00:23.070> problem<00:00:23.460> it's<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.330> sustained<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.230> a

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
the problem it's a sustained it's on a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.800 
the problem it's a sustained it's on a
vinyl<00:00:25.859> seat<00:00:26.310> cushion<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.180> boat<00:00:27.480> it's

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
vinyl seat cushion on a boat it's

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.040 
vinyl seat cushion on a boat it's
probably<00:00:28.109> been<00:00:28.260> here<00:00:28.529> for<00:00:28.970> 10-15<00:00:29.970> years<00:00:30.269> and

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
probably been here for 10-15 years and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.870 
probably been here for 10-15 years and
it<00:00:31.560> looks<00:00:31.740> like<00:00:31.830> when<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.369> look<00:00:32.579> at<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.790> you

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
it looks like when you look at it you

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.790 
it looks like when you look at it you
think<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.420> wouldn't<00:00:33.780> be<00:00:34.170> able<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.469> get<00:00:34.649> that

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
think you wouldn't be able to get that

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.459 
think you wouldn't be able to get that
off<00:00:34.980> really<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:35.790> um<00:00:35.969> yeah<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> sort<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.230> tried<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
off really but um yeah I sort of tried a

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.709 
off really but um yeah I sort of tried a
few<00:00:37.680> different<00:00:37.739> things<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.820> found<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
few different things and I found the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.780 
few different things and I found the
best<00:00:39.899> thing<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.170> use<00:00:40.469> out<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.710> anything<00:00:41.190> is

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
best thing to use out of anything is

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.830 
best thing to use out of anything is
hand<00:00:42.149> sanitizer<00:00:43.610> it's<00:00:44.610> sort<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.719> know

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
hand sanitizer it's sort of a you know

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.889 
hand sanitizer it's sort of a you know
not<00:00:46.050> very<00:00:46.579> not<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> very<00:00:47.850> strong<00:00:48.090> chemical<00:00:48.660> and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
not very not a very strong chemical and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.650 
not very not a very strong chemical and
it's<00:00:49.410> basically<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:49.860> denatured<00:00:50.520> alcohol<00:00:50.660> so

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
it's basically just denatured alcohol so

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.889 
it's basically just denatured alcohol so
you<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:51.870> squirt<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.379> all<00:00:52.739> over<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> paint

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
you just squirt it all over the paint

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.130 
you just squirt it all over the paint
make<00:00:54.899> sure<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.440> all<00:00:55.500> over<00:00:55.680> everything

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
make sure you get it all over everything

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.770 
make sure you get it all over everything
then<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.320> leave<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.829> about<00:00:59.750> two<00:01:00.750> or

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
then just leave it for about two or

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.869 
then just leave it for about two or
three<00:01:01.050> minutes<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.649> it'll<00:01:02.309> get<00:01:02.460> into<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
three minutes and it'll get into the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.490 
three minutes and it'll get into the
paint<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.390> dissolve<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.899> paint<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.409> then

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
paint and dissolve the paint and then

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.690 
paint and dissolve the paint and then
you<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.680> sort<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.070> get<00:01:05.220> your<00:01:05.309> fingernail

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
you can sort of just get your fingernail

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700 
you can sort of just get your fingernail
and<00:01:05.760> scratch<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.270> off<00:01:06.390> now<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.350> hand

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
and scratch it off now the hand

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.469 
and scratch it off now the hand
sanitizer<00:01:07.950> sit<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.700> there<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> minute<00:01:09.360> or

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
sanitizer sit on there for a minute or

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:09.890 
sanitizer sit on there for a minute or
two

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
two

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.810 
two
should<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.380> long<00:01:10.530> enough<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.799> let<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:11.670> into

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
should be long enough to let it get into

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.640 
should be long enough to let it get into
the<00:01:11.939> paint<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.450> act<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> solvent<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.530> get

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
the paint and act as a solvent and get

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.149 
the paint and act as a solvent and get
rid<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.830> it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
rid of it

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:25.550 
rid of it
we'll<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.880> how<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.090> went<00:01:24.320> could<00:01:25.320> probably

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
we'll see how it went could probably

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.140 
we'll see how it went could probably
have<00:01:25.740> left<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.280> little<00:01:26.520> bit<00:01:26.640> longer<00:01:26.880> but

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
have left it for a little bit longer but

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.429 
have left it for a little bit longer but
we<00:01:27.270> should<00:01:27.420> be<00:01:27.509> able<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.689> get<00:01:27.840> rid<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.080> most<00:01:28.229> of

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
we should be able to get rid of most of

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.030 
we should be able to get rid of most of
this<00:01:28.530> stuff<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:29.159> by<00:01:29.909> scratching<00:01:30.210> away<00:01:30.630> Anna

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
this stuff just by scratching away Anna

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.490 
this stuff just by scratching away Anna
and<00:01:32.910> as<00:01:33.030> its<00:01:33.210> alcohol-based<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:34.110> obviously

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
and as its alcohol-based it obviously

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.370 
and as its alcohol-based it obviously
once<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:36.120> not<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.450> put<00:01:36.600> moisture<00:01:37.110> into

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
once it's not going to put moisture into

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.440 
once it's not going to put moisture into
the<00:01:37.410> foam<00:01:38.220> underneath<00:01:38.580> it's<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.240> going<00:01:39.360> to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the foam underneath it's just going to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.260 
the foam underneath it's just going to
evaporate<00:01:39.980> and<00:01:40.980> the<00:01:41.100> vinyls<00:01:41.520> are<00:01:41.850> supposed<00:01:42.180> to

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
evaporate and the vinyls are supposed to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.730 
evaporate and the vinyls are supposed to
be<00:01:42.390> waterproof<00:01:42.660> I<00:01:42.990> know<00:01:43.050> I<00:01:43.230> don't<00:01:43.410> know<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:43.650> it

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
be waterproof I know I don't know if it

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.580 
be waterproof I know I don't know if it
still<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:43.980> but<00:01:45.080> shouldn't<00:01:46.080> cause<00:01:46.380> any

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
still is but shouldn't cause any
