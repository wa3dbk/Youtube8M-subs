00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
tended to overtrain a little bit more

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.170 
tended to overtrain a little bit more
because<00:04:52.190> I<00:04:52.460> don't<00:04:52.760> know<00:04:52.820> I<00:04:52.850> just<00:04:52.880> thought

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
because I don't know I just thought

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.880 
because I don't know I just thought
gotta<00:04:53.780> be<00:04:53.900> training<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.500> working<00:04:54.710> the

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
gotta be training and working the

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.070 
gotta be training and working the
muscles<00:04:55.190> all<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.370> time<00:04:55.580> to<00:04:55.790> grow<00:04:55.970> but<00:04:56.810> now<00:04:56.960> I'm

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
muscles all the time to grow but now I'm

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.510 
muscles all the time to grow but now I'm
started<00:04:57.350> realizing<00:04:57.620> you<00:04:57.680> know<00:04:57.710> that<00:04:57.890> rest<00:04:58.190> and

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
started realizing you know that rest and

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.860 
started realizing you know that rest and
feeding<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.000> recovering<00:04:59.419> is<00:04:59.570> really<00:04:59.780> what

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
feeding and recovering is really what

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.350 
feeding and recovering is really what
builds<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:00.200> muscle<00:05:00.820> so<00:05:01.820> I'm<00:05:01.940> only<00:05:02.060> doing<00:05:02.300> a
