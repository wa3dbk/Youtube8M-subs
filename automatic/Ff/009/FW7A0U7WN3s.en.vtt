black-and-white switch oh I never knew
that<00:01:33.590> was<00:01:33.770> there<00:01:34.130> it's<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.460> stereo<00:01:34.909> switch

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.899 

I<00:01:50.499> completely<00:01:51.499> forgot<00:01:51.740> about<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.340> multiple

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
I completely forgot about the multiple

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.999 
I completely forgot about the multiple

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
Atari 2600 games actually I think this

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.050 
Atari 2600 games actually I think this
may<00:01:57.590> be<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:57.829> only<00:01:57.950> game<00:01:58.219> that<00:01:58.250> uses<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:58.880> and

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
may be the only game that uses it and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:06.660 
may be the only game that uses it and
it's<00:01:59.539> possible<00:02:00.280> that<00:02:01.280> I'm<00:02:01.399> hallucinating

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.430 

okay<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:07.909> tennis<00:02:08.479> isn't<00:02:08.660> much<00:02:08.899> for<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.200> ears

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
okay so tennis isn't much for the ears

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.130 
okay so tennis isn't much for the ears
but<00:02:09.769> how<00:02:09.890> does<00:02:10.069> it<00:02:10.220> play<00:02:10.340> well<00:02:10.970> like<00:02:11.840> pong

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
but how does it play well like pong

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.809 
but how does it play well like pong
shifted<00:02:12.830> vertically<00:02:13.160> where<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.549> pong

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
shifted vertically where the pong

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.240 
shifted vertically where the pong
paddles<00:02:14.330> look<00:02:14.599> like<00:02:14.810> people<00:02:15.110> but<00:02:15.799> the<00:02:16.040> thing

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
paddles look like people but the thing

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.039 
paddles look like people but the thing
is<00:02:16.280> they<00:02:16.549> got<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.730> look<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.330> feel<00:02:17.660> of<00:02:17.720> the

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
is they got the look and feel of the

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.839 
is they got the look and feel of the
game<00:02:18.080> right<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.739> looks<00:02:18.920> like<00:02:18.980> tennis<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.580> ball

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
game right it looks like tennis the ball

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.580 
game right it looks like tennis the ball
actually<00:02:20.120> bounces<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:20.959> then<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.200> can<00:02:21.319> hit<00:02:21.440> it

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
actually bounces and then you can hit it

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.650 
actually bounces and then you can hit it
and<00:02:21.819> depending<00:02:22.819> on<00:02:22.910> where<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.150> hit<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.480> ball

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
and depending on where you hit the ball

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.990 
and depending on where you hit the ball
on<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.379> left<00:02:24.560> or<00:02:24.829> on<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.010> right<00:02:25.160> it'll<00:02:25.610> go

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
on the left or on the right it'll go

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.780 
on the left or on the right it'll go
that<00:02:26.180> direction<00:02:26.590> no<00:02:27.590> you<00:02:27.650> can't<00:02:28.129> put<00:02:28.310> spin<00:02:28.670> on

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
that direction no you can't put spin on

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.280 
that direction no you can't put spin on
it<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.030> can't<00:02:29.269> slam<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:29.810> down<00:02:29.840> in<00:02:30.170> your

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290
