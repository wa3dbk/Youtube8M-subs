flour<00:02:11.680> on<00:02:11.799> top<00:02:12.190> so<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.640> wouldn't<00:02:12.940> be<00:02:13.000> sticky

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480

minutes<00:02:15.819> so<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.299> could<00:02:16.480> just<00:02:16.630> warm<00:02:16.930> up<00:02:17.110> and

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
minutes so it could just warm up and

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.550 
minutes so it could just warm up and
cook<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.430> bit<00:02:18.700> before<00:02:19.269> I<00:02:19.299> began<00:02:19.870> my<00:02:20.170> tomato
