00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.860
 Hello everyone today review cars 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.430
 equipment which is more than most cars 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.860
 this is mini recon river now I don’t 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.560
 tell and first tell me how 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.210
 I was lucky to buy even before the super stock from 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.410
 HIV five years I got the equipment tf 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.670
 40 3 channel which is more abruptly ours 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.440
 tf1 myself this 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.600
 This is a plus but now it is completed at 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.380
 us type 11 2 channel to 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:47.230
 minimum settings once so the car itself 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:50.050
 what do we have 18 scale means you immediately 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.620
 up to 18 scale full drive collector 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.960
 system 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.920
 hydride battery here it is in short about him 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.560
 what can be said what are the advantages in principle 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.120
 Well, the price is yes that is, we buy a wheelbarrow to 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.700
 indulge in not to invest big 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.240
 money in some big and try that 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.400
 This is such a but still for 18 scale and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.770
 he will quickly get bored so if 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.780
 try I don't know anyway 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.820
 it costs a pretty good idea can be 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.000
 watch you try the chinese head 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.270
 let's say which costs about cheaper times 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.340
 but but but but but also. 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.930
 that is , pretty solid 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.350
 quality wheelbarrow we should ordinary 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.380
 sound hardware which 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.119
 worth it really well if 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.310
 buy strike their stores it is worth 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.960
 like a chinese car means i don't 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.600
 I know well the pros that there is a four-wheel drive 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.330
 Of course this is our mini monster 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.740
 bashi actually plows on the 18th scale 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.950
 with the collector engine is very difficult 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.130
 so the principle can immediately go to 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.960
 cons of this car so well it 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.850
 it seems with exactly like without 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.210
 no, that is because the price is small 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.780
 this 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.229
 collector system installed but for 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.679
 You won't find such a price yet. 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.530
 some brand cars so 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:13.959
 collector slightly tedious 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.170
 sewage from us hydride ak a ride a minute 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.629
 20 we charge for a long time therefore 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.500
 but does not live long yes collector with us 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.200
 so 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.209
 bk system everyone will say about gives you 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.519
 I will put here bk system I will buy 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.400
 drive but no here with us and not everywhere 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.849
 plastic in the differentials plastic is 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.799
 so the gimbal with us like aluminum 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.780
 so I do not know the ecosystem will 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.420
 Spread this plastic to you very quickly 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.739
 and you will constantly disassemble though he 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.349
 and understands pretty quickly 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.629
 access to our differential 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.359
 well really fast but still it 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:52.359
 inner messing with it is therefore better 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:54.609
 on it really skate while there either 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.319
 roll on the collector until the very end 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.420
 do not bother with the bull system 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.109
 better to dig up for something bigger and already 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.540
 Now more powerful shock absorbers damn well not 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:07.989
 I know 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.459
 work somewhere leaking but as such 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.859
 on the 18th scale 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.010
 they are not particularly working that is such 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:18.340
 the jumper is not very soft really that is 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.799
 and march stand completely soft on us 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.900
 completely me and settings but he's hard 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.569
 jumps ie work shock absorbers 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.019
 almost imperceptibly there is no 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.700
 what is there on titan for example they 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.049
 work really better he really 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.450
 well soft and 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:41.079
 and goes sags here so there is no such 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.359
 idiotic slots to accommodate our 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.980
 battery even though I did there 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.560
 a bigger hole so that you can 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.280
 pull out but he really is stupid 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.109
 annoying 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.639
 so I absolutely didn’t like him 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:58.599
 no moisture protection therefore 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:04:01.540
 to be problems on let's not drive too 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:05.220
 minus driving only dry weather 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:08.919
 caution and all that follows 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.049
 so and and well, of course here with us 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:15.579
 problems to like most of these 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:17.549
 the sensor here is our main gear and 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.829
 pinyons gets sand 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.740
 it all starts chewing starts 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.440
 it is better to creak 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.539
 place or repaired there have 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.370
 hole and where it falls 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.349
 I recommend immediately for doing so 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.139
 blame tires 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.210
 but not really tenacious up to the monster you here with 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.729
 so big tread well 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.909
 not worth bothering some kind of replacement 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.069
 search, I think such cars need clean 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:48.090
 try to drive or drive as they 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:50.490
 sinks but do not spend money on their tuning 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.879
 improvements better save up for more 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.490
 scale 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.979
 the larger the scale the more interesting 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.919
 pokatushki and the more expensive operation 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.289
 so all such a monster principle is nothing 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.409
 does not break well here if you say by 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.990
 suspension arms fists and everything else on 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:09.300
 18 scale it is difficult to break it even 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.610
 and a monster but yours is unreal 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.740
 because here I stand worth collector 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.430
 the system you will not just not be able to 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.190
 run 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.800
 very high and very far it is real 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.669
 can only be broken if you crash into 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.819
 I don’t know the apartment but not neatly but the horse 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:29.029
 I'm somewhere on the road with small 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.440
 nothing breaks me with springboards 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:33.319
 go out on the asphalt crash into the curb well 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.150
 of course here and start kissing 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:38.849
 so he is so interesting . 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.860
 she's pretty old already 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:44.509
 left long ago but I had to try 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:47.520
 drive to look look how it goes 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:50.069
 choose a car and strive for more 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.460
 scale thank you all for your attention 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.460
 new meetings
