00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.850
 We have this device over here 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.770
 exactly one year ago here in barcelona 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.380
 the first at the mobile world congress 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.040
 Let's see that vodafone is yes 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.440
 now also in germany 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.540
 available on the back the ink 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.310
 display but how to easily recognize 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.800
 can stop with this wedge shape yet 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.330
 relatively angular and this year shows 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.180
 jutta the white is here in barcelona 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.710
 the successor, however, probably 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.449
 not until the end of the year to germany 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.650
 but that should come here before as 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.449
 first prototype 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.780
 That's how he should look like 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.250
 unequaled sexier because founded here 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.140
 back and above all things that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.840
 display here the e ink display on the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.520
 back has gotten bigger 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.390
 4.7 inches, it is now so big in front of everyone 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.800
 but touchscreen 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.030
 that means now I can here me 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.219
 do not need more with the most important 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.629
 down here that I am now 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.250
 for example, say I have one now 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.100
 I want that book on the back 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.870
 read then press up here 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.210
 this icon and then it goes on the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.489
 back here it is still here 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.500
 locked by default and then I can 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.420
 stop here to read easy 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.920
 the over the strings vision and how 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.200
 said a lot more intuitive than when 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.420
 predecessor and it is just simply too 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.700
 sensational in the hand on the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.299
 we have a natural front 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.189
 Also touch screen full HD display 5 inch 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.909
 With that one comes loud manufacturer on one 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.770
 density of 442 ppi in which one easily 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.170
 can recognize the amulet is too 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.150
 excellent contrasts so front 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.939
 got better in the back better 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.509
 in ampass now 47 inches with a 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.930
 resolution of 540 x 960 pixels 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.460
 then you come to 235 ppi from there 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.439
 There is of course another house numbers 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.960
 but do not need this high 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.909
 resolution here as well as backwards 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.040
 Again I see this typical 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.930
 from the permanently installed battery the same front 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.640
 I have a display on the back 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.710
 just lose weight now 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.740
 but with the charm that the thing 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.990
 also strong for 2,550 milliamp hours 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.340
 can be charged wirelessly, the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.729
 means I just lay on mine 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.799
 charging station will be compatible and then 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.300
 it's loaded and that 's natural then 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.950
 Even brands gain comfort so 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.580
 again overall much better 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.300
 is now also us 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.920
 dapd 800 processor in there that is 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.170
 quad core processor i have a fc me 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.910
 have an 8 megapixel camera in here 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.430
 black and white should be there 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.190
 I have just 8 9 millimeters here 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.660
 one of the strength and as a goal one gives 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.370
 140 grams 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.380
 well, maybe so plus / minus 1 2 grams 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.010
 it's all beta currently what 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.170
 we see here 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.450
 but still that will be at this size 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.640
 absolutely easy and is as I said 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.020
 sensational in the hand because of that 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.030
 I honestly say so I like it 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.800
 So at that time I was on display 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.810
 Enthusiastic but in practice has become 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.370
 then in the test year, that proved 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.070
 there is still a lot to improve 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.590
 There was definitely one done 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.330
 hardware side and the operation like 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.950
 said to have stayed in principle here in front 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.880
 i mean android and i have mine 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.470
 usual eps of yota how to get them 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.880
 also knows this from the surface 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.680
 Here you got fancier as you can see 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.240
 So everything optimized a bit so 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.050
 I think you can really believe that 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.209
 look forward to it 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.430
 yes, so the end of the year should be the new 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.900
 jota from then also to germany 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.330
 come the big question is 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.739
 Of course now the price right there 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.540
 I've been here for a short time 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.910
 which you also from jutta devices 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.860
 entertained and he said so goal is 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.690
 It is the device for a price in the market 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.880
 to bring it like other android 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.760
 providers would also be in these 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.769
 snapdragon have 800 intus and then should 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.220
 that will be exactly this price and then 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.959
 so to speak, that the e ink display 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.360
 on the back as a bonus on top of it 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.380
 more or less exciting story 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.970
 I think that should be synonymous times 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.459
 rich as a first impression of the new 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.640
 jota from here from the mobile world congress 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.640
 in Barcelona
