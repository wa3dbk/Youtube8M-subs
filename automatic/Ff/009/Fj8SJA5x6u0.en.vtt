00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:08.960
 hello everyone, I'm coming back again 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.330
 to the railway topic 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.880
 and it will be a blank detector 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.309
 trolleys that is about the scheme that we have 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.230
 allows you to determine if there are trolleys 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.199
 player or trolley rides empty 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.810
 I will tell even as much as 2 schemes one of 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.159
 them uses tank 2 uses 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.640
 features trolleys 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:31.880
 and the first circuit we will have a circuit with 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.250
 gods how it works we use the tank 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.510
 maynkrafta that when overclocking a trolley to 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.670
 maximum speed 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.100
 for example like this four bed 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.310
 supplied electric rails 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.040
 if it falls on sloping rails 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.500
 a detector with a fork behind them then she is not 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.460
 and switches the fork goes on like this 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.260
 the usual way 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.020
 if we have the same situation 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.480
 gets the trolley sitting in it like him 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.400
 the player switches this fork and here 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.320
 leaves the opposite side well 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.650
 let's try to demonstrate 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.810
 put the trolley run and as you can see 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.759
 she does not change the arrow and goes left 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.369
 Now I will try to roll myself and I'm glad 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.770
 see and drove off to bravo ie there is an arrow 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.359
 this time it happened mainly 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.789
 the disadvantage of this scheme is of course 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:21.280
 is that this is a bug although both schemes 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.719
 which I am considering today 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.509
 old enough well-known that is 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:28.490
 this bug is unlikely to be anytime soon 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.920
 corrected but nonetheless it follows 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.780
 take account of 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.209
 we now turn to the second scheme and 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.950
 it looks like we put it here like this 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:43.880
 let's say here are a few electric 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.429
 rails is not important here we already speed 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.479
 what should be 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:52.789
 we have further forks at a distance 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.549
 Here so we admit one unit and now 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.520
 the most important thing is a sloping area we 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.840
 put a wooden fence on top of it 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.799
 pressure plate 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.689
 there should be some blog 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:10.580
 let 's put it like this and put it on it 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:16.080
 must be redstone now we are left 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:19.379
 connect to our fork torch further 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.280
 connect here with the source 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:25.140
 of our signal that is the pressure plate and 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.660
 put the torch here how it works 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.360
 This scheme is very simple 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.640
 when we have an empty trolley, then it 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.370
 occupies just one block off height per 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.170
 account minecraft features what trolleys 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.380
 sloping passes under blocks 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.910
 she calmly overcomes 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.090
 obstacles in the form of a wooden fence and 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.000
 go on the arrow without changing it when 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.500
 we have a player on the trolley here 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.709
 that player 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.700
 we press this head like 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.540
 pressure plate 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.160
 forcing her to put out this torch 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.970
 the circuit switches and the arrow changes 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.129
 own direction 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.950
 well let's try this scheme in 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.799
 work we start the trolley and it does not 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.760
 changed the arrow left on the right sit down 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.760
 in the cart themselves 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.769
 did you hear the click that is worked 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:20.379
 pressure plate she put out the torch 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.799
 on the block, respectively , this one came on 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.599
 torch 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.640
 the arrow switched we went to 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.590
 the other side is this way 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.409
 This method does not use any 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.140
 bugs exclusively features work with 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.920
 trolleys chief please flaw 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.370
 here's what 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.950
 the player is forced to fit into this fence 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.079
 in this pressure plate that is flashed 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.840
 Before the eyes of the wooden this design 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.000
 Strongly enough it is a disadvantage or not 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.159
 I do not know, decide for yourself but in this 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.840
 we no longer need a scheme 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.109
 speed control unlike 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.430
 previous schemes that I considered 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.319
 accordingly, I hope that this 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.579
 tutorial you would understand at all of course 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.950
 there is another scheme 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:03.639
 which is engaged in determining whether 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.040
 have the player kick out or not but these schemes 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.840
 use even more and bugs or they already 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.019
 outdated so consider them not 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.299
 became but two methods you got all the same 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.949
 if something incomprehensible remains of course 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.220
 ask in the comments do not forget 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:21.449
 also leave your marks
