00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello very good everyone I am jarita 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.120
 welcome to my channel one more day today 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.649
 I bring another video of gta 5 online 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.500
 this time it's about how to get the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.969
 sure any vehicle is worth it 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.349
 some vehicle will let us take out the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.220
 sure good well here you have the way 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.090
 the first thing would be to have a vehicle that 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.859
 inside your garage that is 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.500
 insured because that is why it is going to 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.660
 replace vale the ideal would be that it 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.949
 11 malillo is ok but if not with 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.480
 anyone is worth any of those who 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.179
 have specials then I'll return it to 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.910
 Do not worry, it's okay because this 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.460
 vehicle and make it by making it safe 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.050
 is going to double and you're going to lose it and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.120
 it's quite simple to take the vehicle 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.670
 to get out to the outside it 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.340
 close to the house to re-enter 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.620
 Now, well, the ideal is if you have a 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.760
 c4 which is the way you have explosive 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.309
 which is the fastest way 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.280
 place and without explosives is worth you lose 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.620
 near the door you put a gun or without 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.460
 Weapon or whatever you want and what you are worth 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.260
 try to enter 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.120
 the ideal thing would be to have stuck me more 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.530
 blue and would have entered just before 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.049
 that had jumped to the police in case 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.250
 that the police jump nothing happens what 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.659
 yours instead of spinning like this the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.039
 circle as I am there 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.810
 is that it is nonsense to take us away 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.060
 little bit worth anything with a little as you see 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.119
 they are going to start blinking 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.689
 and you go inside now well 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.930
 now you will have to remove the mobile phone and 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.210
 call mutual loves to claim the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.880
 vehicle that we just destroyed but 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.270
 when you give us the option to recover it 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.399
 we 'll leave it there without pressing x vale 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.080
 we will leave waiting so to speak and 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.539
 we will ride in the car to which 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.250
 we want to put the insurance os mounts 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.240
 first, as you want, you have seen there 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.680
 equal value 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.680
 we call mutual 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.700
 you wait, it's worth calmly, it does not take 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.920
 a lot and here at this moment you see that it is 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.510
 to request it accelerates and if not 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.450
 you are requesting and you are going to apply 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.310
 now at the time when you go out 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.530
 just before it appears is 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.410
 cinematographic you give him if you give him late 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.110
 or before you will see what happens then nothing 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.540
 obviously no no nothing has come out 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.979
 no demos message has come out 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.990
 mutual and nothing that is that the trick has not 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.330
 come out nothing happens as you see me 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.980
 also fails sometimes it is worth you I leave the 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.720
 error for you to see it thanks to being 87 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.300
 by by happen then back again 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.110
 the bike is worth it helped me to record 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.120
 this 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.130
 and nothing came to me very well because 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.230
 You see that I can show you that I was without 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.970
 secure vale 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.950
 sometimes you know what happens is vehicles 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.239
 because it has taken them out a hacked way 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.540
 whatever it is for whatever it is you can not 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.220
 put it holy just can not put the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.930
 safe or by duplicating it as it happens with 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.239
 this does not come out for sure, well for that 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.920
 It's worth, and here you'll see how 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.049
 pressing at the right moment now it's worth 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.450
 then more or less when it ends 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.879
 blink when it finishes leaving the 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.430
 circle true that of charge then more or 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.160
 less just at the end you press hear that 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.030
 click and it will be ok now you see how 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.030
 how do you come in 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.310
 and you will have the insurance the car that is 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.400
 will have doubled also you will see 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.060
 now a moment let's see in two for 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.000
 in 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.709
 and as you can see it is in the place 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.890
 where was the motorcycle is now 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.030
 the insured vehicle and the vehicle 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.030
 original which we had 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:27.730
 We wanted to get insurance and nothing because that 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.019
 is everything is simple you know for what 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.489
 which is worth according to the car leaves us 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.079
 ensure whatever it is worth or have a 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.200
 Stick car to take out the insurance more 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.909
 cheap would also be worth us and nothing that has 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.099
 been everything for today is worth see you in the 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:44.099
