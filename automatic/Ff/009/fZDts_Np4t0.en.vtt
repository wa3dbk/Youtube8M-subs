to five years out of a set of tires you

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.220 
to five years out of a set of tires you
know<00:04:41.419> and<00:04:41.660> then<00:04:41.750> they're<00:04:41.900> pretty<00:04:42.050> much

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
know and then they're pretty much

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.150 
know and then they're pretty much
getting<00:04:42.560> too<00:04:42.650> old

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
getting too old

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.400 
getting too old
of<00:04:43.580> course<00:04:43.820> even<00:04:44.150> then<00:04:44.330> it's<00:04:44.930> according<00:04:45.200> how

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
of course even then it's according how

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.260 
of course even then it's according how
they've<00:04:45.590> been<00:04:45.710> took<00:04:45.890> care<00:04:46.160> of<00:04:46.190> if<00:04:46.640> they've

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
they've been took care of if they've

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.350 
they've been took care of if they've
been<00:04:47.450> armor<00:04:47.810> old<00:04:47.960> and<00:04:48.520> and<00:04:49.520> had<00:04:49.760> good<00:04:49.970> UV

been armor old and and had good UV
protection<00:04:50.780> put<00:04:51.140> on<00:04:51.290> them<00:04:51.530> you<00:04:52.520> know<00:04:52.640> they'll

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
protection put on them you know they'll

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.909 
protection put on them you know they'll
probably<00:04:53.120> last<00:04:53.419> longer<00:04:53.570> you<00:04:54.140> know<00:04:54.440> course

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
probably last longer you know course

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.350 
probably last longer you know course
motorcycle<00:04:55.580> tires<00:04:55.760> you<00:04:55.910> don't<00:04:56.090> want<00:04:56.210> to<00:04:56.270> do

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
motorcycle tires you don't want to do

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.130 
motorcycle tires you don't want to do
that<00:04:56.479> on<00:04:57.940> you<00:04:58.940> know<00:04:59.060> I've<00:04:59.210> seen<00:04:59.419> tires<00:04:59.720> that

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
that on you know I've seen tires that

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.870 
that on you know I've seen tires that
were<00:05:00.290> ten<00:05:00.770> years<00:05:01.010> old<00:05:01.310> that<00:05:01.490> weren't<00:05:01.700> dry

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
were ten years old that weren't dry

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.730 
were ten years old that weren't dry
rotted<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:02.660> then<00:05:02.840> I<00:05:02.930> think<00:05:03.200> tires<00:05:03.410> that<00:05:03.650> were

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
rotted and then I think tires that were

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.920 
rotted and then I think tires that were
two<00:05:03.919> years<00:05:04.130> old<00:05:04.400> and<00:05:04.640> and<00:05:05.120> dry<00:05:05.330> rot<00:05:05.540> the<00:05:05.690> crack

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
two years old and and dry rot the crack

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.310 
two years old and and dry rot the crack
