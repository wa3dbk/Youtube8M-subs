great<00:01:34.950> fit<00:01:35.250> okay<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:35.909> that's<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> upper

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
great fit okay so that's on the upper

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.600 
great fit okay so that's on the upper
now<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> lower<00:01:37.200> we've<00:01:37.500> got<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:38.070> couple<00:01:38.430> of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
now on the lower we've got a couple of

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.340 
now on the lower we've got a couple of
upgrades<00:01:38.759> we've<00:01:39.150> got<00:01:39.240> an<00:01:39.329> upgrade<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
upgrades we've got an upgrade in the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.340 
upgrades we've got an upgrade in the
wheels<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> frame<00:01:41.579> yes<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.810> you've

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
wheels and in the frame yes so you've

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.469 
wheels and in the frame yes so you've
got<00:01:43.380> an<00:01:43.950> aluminum<00:01:44.460> frame<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:44.909> which<00:01:45.119> really

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
got an aluminum frame here which really

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.840 
got an aluminum frame here which really
transfers<00:01:46.110> power<00:01:46.590> from<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.189> skater<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
transfers power from the skater to the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.149 
transfers power from the skater to the
road<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> first<00:01:48.990> price<00:01:49.590> point<00:01:49.950> of

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
road so this is the first price point of

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.340 
road so this is the first price point of
getting<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.790> aluminum<00:01:51.270> skate<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:52.049> lumen

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
getting the aluminum skate the lumen

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.219 
getting the aluminum skate the lumen
frame<00:01:52.560> versus<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.479> composite<00:01:54.479> frame<00:01:54.630> what's

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
frame versus the composite frame what's

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.109 
frame versus the composite frame what's
the<00:01:55.350> benefit<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.710> an<00:01:55.860> aluminum<00:01:56.250> frame<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.670> just

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
the benefit of an aluminum frame I just

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.429 
the benefit of an aluminum frame I just
didn't<00:01:57.390> power<00:01:57.570> transfer<00:01:58.079> you're<00:01:58.200> gonna<00:01:58.290> be

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
didn't power transfer you're gonna be

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.810 
didn't power transfer you're gonna be
able<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.649> hit<00:01:58.829> higher<00:01:59.040> speeds<00:01:59.460> it's<00:01:59.640> going<00:01:59.759> to

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
able to hit higher speeds it's going to

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.910 
able to hit higher speeds it's going to
be<00:01:59.909> more<00:02:00.090> stable<00:02:00.360> at<00:02:00.630> speed<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.740> a

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
be more stable at speed and it's just a

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.130 
be more stable at speed and it's just a
better<00:02:02.460> skating<00:02:03.030> frame<00:02:03.299> for<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.630> higher<00:02:03.899> end

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
better skating frame for that higher end

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.050 
better skating frame for that higher end
it<00:02:04.350> doesn't<00:02:04.680> flex<00:02:04.860> as<00:02:05.009> much<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.399> transfers<00:02:05.939> the

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
it doesn't flex as much so transfers the

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.180 
it doesn't flex as much so transfers the
power<00:02:06.090> directly<00:02:06.479> exactly<00:02:07.320> now<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.950> one's

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
power directly exactly now this one's

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.770 
power directly exactly now this one's
got<00:02:08.310> high-low<00:02:08.849> smaller<00:02:09.330> wheels<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.750> front

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
got high-low smaller wheels on the front

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.630 
got high-low smaller wheels on the front
higher<00:02:10.410> wheels<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.890> back<00:02:10.979> why<00:02:11.370> do<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.550> do

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
higher wheels in the back why do you do

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.730 
higher wheels in the back why do you do
that<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.360> we<00:02:12.660> do<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:13.020> it's<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.410> it's<00:02:13.590> a

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
that so we do that it's a it's a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.210 
that so we do that it's a it's a
mix<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.240> low<00:02:15.240> center<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.630> gravity

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
mix of low center of gravity

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.430 
mix of low center of gravity
maneuverability<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.550> speed<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.900> you're

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
maneuverability and speed so you're

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.260 
maneuverability and speed so you're
going<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.590> get<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:19.980> generate<00:02:20.640> higher<00:02:20.820> speeds

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
going to get you generate higher speeds

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.250 
going to get you generate higher speeds
from<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.570> bigger<00:02:21.750> wheels<00:02:21.960> in<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.170> back

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
from the bigger wheels in the back

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.690 
from the bigger wheels in the back
you're<00:02:23.040> still<00:02:23.220> going<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.370> have<00:02:23.580> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
you're still going to have the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.100 
you're still going to have the
maneuverability<00:02:24.390> because<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.690> got<00:02:24.810> smaller

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
maneuverability because you got smaller

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.180 
maneuverability because you got smaller
wheels<00:02:25.380> in<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.500> front<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:25.890> it's<00:02:26.010> going<00:02:26.130> to

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
wheels in the front so it's going to

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.980 
wheels in the front so it's going to
allow<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.580> corner<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.210> go<00:02:27.630> edge<00:02:27.810> to

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
allow you to corner and just go edge to

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.990 
allow you to corner and just go edge to
edge<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> little<00:02:28.230> bit<00:02:28.470> faster<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.910> know

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
edge a little bit faster and you know

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.430 
edge a little bit faster and you know
the<00:02:30.120> combination<00:02:30.420> gives<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.990> best<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.320> both

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
the combination gives the best of both

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.750 
the combination gives the best of both
worlds<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.920> sort<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.220> follows<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.730> natural

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
worlds it sort of follows the natural

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.730 
worlds it sort of follows the natural
contour<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.780> foot<00:02:34.080> where<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.380> heel<00:02:34.590> is

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
contour of a foot where the heel is

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.090 
contour of a foot where the heel is
higher<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.870> forefoot<00:02:37.200> slower<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:37.980> it

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
higher and the the forefoot slower so it

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.670 
higher and the the forefoot slower so it
allows<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.970> keep<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.930> skate<00:02:40.170> low<00:02:40.410> while

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
allows you to keep the skate low while

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.380 
allows you to keep the skate low while
still<00:02:40.890> giving<00:02:40.980> that<00:02:41.220> performance<00:02:41.700> wheel<00:02:42.240> in

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
still giving that performance wheel in

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.270 
still giving that performance wheel in
the<00:02:42.480> back<00:02:42.600> exactly<00:02:43.350> exactly<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.100> tribute

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
the back exactly exactly it's a tribute

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.500 
the back exactly exactly it's a tribute
to<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.580> engineers<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.090> were<00:02:45.180> able<00:02:45.420> to

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
to the engineers that were able to

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.480 
to the engineers that were able to
figure<00:02:45.870> out<00:02:46.020> how<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.170> make<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.440> work<00:02:46.620> yep<00:02:47.190> and

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
figure out how to make that work yep and

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.040 
figure out how to make that work yep and
then<00:02:47.670> this<00:02:47.760> has<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.090> real<00:02:48.240> fitness<00:02:48.660> boot<00:02:48.870> the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
then this has the real fitness boot the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.590 
then this has the real fitness boot the
k2<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:50.400> know<00:02:50.490> it's<00:02:50.610> really<00:02:50.670> known<00:02:51.000> for<00:02:51.030> that

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
k2 you know it's really known for that

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.170 
k2 you know it's really known for that

nice tight anatomical fit right exactly
it's<00:02:54.360> got<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:54.930> really<00:02:55.770> great<00:02:56.250> padding

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
it's got that that really great padding

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.460 
it's got that that really great padding
in<00:02:56.820> here<00:02:57.060> really<00:02:57.540> mulch<00:02:57.780> their<00:02:58.080> foot<00:02:58.290> while

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
in here really mulch their foot while

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.380 
in here really mulch their foot while
you're<00:02:58.590> skating<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.700> you<00:02:59.790> know<00:02:59.910> one<00:03:00.120> thing<00:03:00.300> we

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
you're skating and you know one thing we

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.880 
you're skating and you know one thing we
didn't<00:03:00.690> touch<00:03:00.810> on<00:03:01.020> on<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.290> wheel<00:03:01.440> down<00:03:01.680> here

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
didn't touch on on the wheel down here

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.590 
didn't touch on on the wheel down here
that<00:03:02.040> I'll<00:03:02.130> throw<00:03:02.370> in<00:03:02.550> as<00:03:02.670> well<00:03:02.820> get<00:03:03.330> an<00:03:03.420> aisle

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600
