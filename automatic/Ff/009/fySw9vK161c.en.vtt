that<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:14.250> server<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.030> did<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.599> video

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
that the server that I did in that video

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.810 
that the server that I did in that video
doesn't<00:00:16.260> work<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.890> much<00:00:17.039> anymore<00:00:17.279> but

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
doesn't work that much anymore but

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.640 
doesn't work that much anymore but
there's<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.090> new<00:00:18.240> server<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:18.930> by<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.350> same

like<00:00:20.330> people<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.420> guess<00:00:21.689> but<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.920> IP<00:00:23.220> is

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
like people I guess but the IP is

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.130 
like people I guess but the IP is
different<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.210> I'm<00:00:24.420> making<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.840> video<00:00:24.990> to

the<00:01:29.640> compass<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.409> there's<00:01:31.409> different

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the compass here and there's different

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.100 
the compass here and there's different
stuff<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:32.610> here<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.990> have

stuff that you can do here but you have
the<00:01:34.290> Quarter<00:01:34.619> Quell<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.670> survival<00:01:36.119> games<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the Quarter Quell the survival games the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.929 
the Quarter Quell the survival games the
survival<00:01:37.140> games<00:01:37.380> classic<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.640> think

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
survival games classic and I think

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.910 
survival games classic and I think
that's<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.450> terms<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.780> survival<00:01:40.170> games<00:01:40.350> so

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
that's it in terms of survival games so

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.620 
that's it in terms of survival games so
I'm<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.820> going<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.000> go<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.479> regular

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.630 
I'm just going to go to the regular
survival<00:01:43.229> games<00:01:43.409> not<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> classic<00:01:44.220> or<00:01:44.399> D

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
