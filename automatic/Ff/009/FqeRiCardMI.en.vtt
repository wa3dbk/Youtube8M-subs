00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
and it was really frustrating because it

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.620 
and it was really frustrating because it
was<00:04:57.950> the<00:04:58.040> first<00:04:58.220> time<00:04:58.340> that<00:04:58.400> I<00:04:58.550> saw<00:04:58.730> racism<00:04:59.420> in

that certain light I would hear stories
and<00:05:02.960> I<00:05:02.990> would<00:05:03.140> see<00:05:03.320> things<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:05.060> people<00:05:05.240> would

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
and I would see things and people would

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.870 
and I would see things and people would
say<00:05:05.630> things<00:05:05.690> to<00:05:06.110> me<00:05:06.260> and<00:05:06.440> I<00:05:07.280> would<00:05:07.550> feel<00:05:07.730> the

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
stares and I felt like people really

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.080 
stares and I felt like people really
avoided<00:05:09.950> me<00:05:10.100> and<00:05:10.340> it<00:05:10.640> was<00:05:10.760> really<00:05:10.910> frustrating

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
avoided me and it was really frustrating

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.680 
avoided me and it was really frustrating
because<00:05:11.930> I<00:05:12.380> didn't<00:05:12.920> understand<00:05:13.280> why<00:05:13.660> so<00:05:14.660> I

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
because I didn't understand why so I

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.450 
because I didn't understand why so I
started<00:05:15.110> reading<00:05:15.320> about<00:05:15.470> privilege<00:05:15.860> and

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
started reading about privilege and

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.300 
started reading about privilege and
social<00:05:17.210> justice<00:05:17.240> and<00:05:18.080> although<00:05:18.590> it<00:05:18.800> validated

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
social justice and although it validated

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.000 
social justice and although it validated
how<00:05:19.520> I<00:05:19.550> felt<00:05:19.970> I<00:05:20.240> started<00:05:21.080> finding<00:05:21.320> myself

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
how I felt I started finding myself

I can't say that I've been that scared

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.460 
I can't say that I've been that scared
in<00:06:22.400> a<00:06:22.520> long<00:06:22.700> time

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
in a long time

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.230 
in a long time
um<00:06:23.710> so<00:06:24.040> I<00:06:24.100> walked<00:06:24.310> a<00:06:24.370> little<00:06:24.490> faster<00:06:24.910> and<00:06:25.060> I<00:06:25.090> saw

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
um so I walked a little faster and I saw

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.850 
um so I walked a little faster and I saw
my<00:06:25.390> friends<00:06:25.690> I<00:06:25.780> tried<00:06:25.960> and<00:06:26.110> pretend<00:06:26.410> like<00:06:26.530> it

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
my friends I tried and pretend like it

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.410 
my friends I tried and pretend like it
wasn't<00:06:27.010> a<00:06:27.130> big<00:06:27.280> deal<00:06:27.430> but<00:06:27.670> it's<00:06:28.030> one<00:06:28.180> of<00:06:28.300> those

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.420 
wasn't a big deal but it's one of those

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.390 
wasn't a big deal but it's one of those
things<00:06:28.600> that<00:06:28.750> I'll<00:06:28.810> probably<00:06:28.990> never<00:06:29.170> forget

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
things that I'll probably never forget

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.130 
things that I'll probably never forget
so<00:06:30.400> my<00:06:30.610> whole<00:06:30.760> perspective<00:06:31.180> on<00:06:31.540> life<00:06:31.690> kind<00:06:32.050> of

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
so my whole perspective on life kind of

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.310 
so my whole perspective on life kind of
changed<00:06:32.590> as<00:06:32.830> I<00:06:33.010> was<00:06:33.130> graduating<00:06:33.790> I<00:06:34.230> wasn't<00:06:35.230> as
