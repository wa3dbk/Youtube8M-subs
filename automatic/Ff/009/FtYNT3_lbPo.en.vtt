construction of the wall how did the

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.529 
construction of the wall how did the
water<00:00:22.510> system<00:00:23.050> in<00:00:23.590> the<00:00:23.740> main<00:00:23.920> sink<00:00:24.340> and<00:00:24.580> also

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
water system in the main sink and also

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.109 
water system in the main sink and also
touches<00:00:25.960> on<00:00:26.170> the<00:00:26.529> Zig<00:00:27.039> unit<00:00:27.340> which<00:00:27.460> is<00:00:27.610> the<00:00:27.820> the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
touches on the Zig unit which is the the

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.510 
touches on the Zig unit which is the the
12<00:00:28.510> volt<00:00:28.720> electrical<00:00:29.260> distribution<00:00:29.590> system

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
12 volt electrical distribution system

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.750 
12 volt electrical distribution system
so<00:00:31.330> without<00:00:31.990> further<00:00:32.230> ado<00:00:32.559> here<00:00:33.220> is<00:00:33.460> the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
so without further ado here is the

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:43.229 
so without further ado here is the
footage<00:00:41.340> okay<00:00:42.340> this<00:00:42.550> is<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.850> other<00:00:42.970> water

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
footage okay this is the other water

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.900 
footage okay this is the other water
system<00:00:43.980> now<00:00:44.980> I<00:00:45.010> actually<00:00:45.190> don't<00:00:45.460> have<00:00:45.790> any

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
system now I actually don't have any

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.900 
system now I actually don't have any
water<00:00:46.180> in<00:00:46.360> there<00:00:46.480> at<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.750> moment<00:00:47.110> but<00:00:47.230> if<00:00:47.440> I

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
water in there at the moment but if I

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
water in there at the moment but if I
open<00:00:48.910> this<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:50.440> can<00:00:50.500> probably<00:00:50.770> see<00:00:51.129> there<00:00:51.930> oh

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
open this you can probably see there oh

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.049 
open this you can probably see there oh
I've<00:00:53.500> got<00:00:53.649> some<00:00:53.800> water<00:00:53.950> in<00:00:54.129> ours<00:00:54.460> interesting

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
I've got some water in ours interesting

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.209 
I've got some water in ours interesting
so<00:00:55.660> that<00:00:55.809> should<00:00:56.079> work<00:00:56.110> I<00:00:59.010> think<00:01:00.010> I'll<00:01:00.100> tell

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
so that should work I think I'll tell

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.590 
so that should work I think I'll tell
you<00:01:00.340> what<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.579> Polk<00:01:00.760> come<00:01:01.000> off<00:01:01.120> that's<00:01:01.390> why

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
you what the Polk come off that's why

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.430 
you what the Polk come off that's why
this<00:01:02.440> is<00:01:02.770> a<00:01:03.129> 25<00:01:03.789> liter<00:01:04.119> drum<00:01:04.809> which<00:01:05.080> I'll<00:01:05.259> show

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
this is a 25 liter drum which I'll show

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.290 
this is a 25 liter drum which I'll show
you<00:01:05.470> in<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:05.710> minute<00:01:05.800> and<00:01:05.950> we'll<00:01:06.759> actually<00:01:06.940> now

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
you in a minute and we'll actually now

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:17.969 
you in a minute and we'll actually now
actually<00:01:13.319> there<00:01:14.319> we<00:01:14.410> go<00:01:14.940> all<00:01:15.940> that<00:01:16.179> is<00:01:16.360> is<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.979> 25

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
actually there we go all that is is a 25

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.040 
actually there we go all that is is a 25
liter<00:01:18.280> drum<00:01:18.880> but<00:01:19.179> you<00:01:19.300> can<00:01:19.450> take<00:01:19.630> in<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:19.959> out

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
liter drum but you can take in and out

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.389 
liter drum but you can take in and out
and<00:01:20.950> inside<00:01:21.399> that<00:01:21.899> you<00:01:22.899> have<00:01:23.170> another<00:01:23.619> stop<00:01:24.130> on

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
and inside that you have another stop on

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.919 
and inside that you have another stop on
a<00:01:24.490> pump<00:01:24.729> with<00:01:25.179> some<00:01:25.420> power<00:01:26.220> now<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.250> pumpkin

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
a pump with some power now a pumpkin

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.089 
a pump with some power now a pumpkin
okay<00:01:28.929> I<00:01:28.959> thought<00:01:29.200> so<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:31.750> we<00:01:31.810> go<00:01:31.929> and<00:01:32.920> that

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:33.099 
okay I thought so there we go and that

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:35.130 
okay I thought so there we go and that
sits<00:01:33.340> in<00:01:33.490> a<00:01:33.580> car<00:01:33.819> happily<00:01:34.179> and<00:01:34.509> it's<00:01:34.929> non

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
sits in a car happily and it's non

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.359 
sits in a car happily and it's non
demand<00:01:35.470> system

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.550 

so<00:01:39.270> soon<00:01:39.450> as<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.570> tell<00:01:39.689> us<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.960> farm<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.350> feeds

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
so soon as you tell us a farm it feeds

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.899 
so soon as you tell us a farm it feeds
power<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.039> pump<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:42.119> there's<00:01:42.390> your<00:01:42.539> water

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
power to the pump and there's your water

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.690 
power to the pump and there's your water
now<00:01:44.909> obviously<00:01:45.359> with<00:01:46.130> it's<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.490> cold

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
now obviously with it's just a cold

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.289 
now obviously with it's just a cold
water<00:01:47.969> feed<00:01:48.299> system<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.259> need<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:50.240> if<00:01:51.240> you

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
water feed system so you need to if you

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.969 
water feed system so you need to if you
need<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.600> heat<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> water<00:01:51.869> obviously<00:01:52.649> you're

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
need to heat the water obviously you're

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.160 
need to heat the water obviously you're
going<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.159> need<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> kettle<00:01:53.789> or<00:01:53.939> some<00:01:54.810> form<00:01:55.079> of

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
going to need a kettle or some form of

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.389 
going to need a kettle or some form of
heating<00:01:56.090> right<00:01:57.090> then<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.689> zig<00:01:57.990> unit

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
heating right then on to the zig unit

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.419 
heating right then on to the zig unit
aka<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.969> known<00:02:00.450> as<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.990> zig<00:02:01.469> unit<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.890> CFA

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
aka this is known as a zig unit a CFA

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.620 
aka this is known as a zig unit a CFA
and<00:02:03.350> what<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.439> have<00:02:04.619> here<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.299> this<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.359> this

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
and what you have here is this is this

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.240 
and what you have here is this is this
is<00:02:06.780> brilliant<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.200> really<00:02:07.619> takes<00:02:07.859> the<00:02:08.009> sting

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
is brilliant this really takes the sting

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.199 
is brilliant this really takes the sting
out<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.789> doing<00:02:09.360> your<00:02:10.069> your<00:02:11.069> wiring<00:02:11.549> all<00:02:11.970> that

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
out of doing your your wiring all that

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.880 
out of doing your your wiring all that
happens<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.630> you<00:02:12.780> have<00:02:13.049> let's<00:02:13.410> go<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.709> back

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
happens is you have let's go to the back

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.680 
happens is you have let's go to the back
of<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.130> now<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.000> looks<00:02:15.150> pretty<00:02:15.209> complicated

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
of it now it looks pretty complicated

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.569 
of it now it looks pretty complicated
but<00:02:16.470> it's<00:02:16.680> actually<00:02:16.799> very<00:02:17.220> straightforward

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
but it's actually very straightforward

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.870 
but it's actually very straightforward
if<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.030> just<00:02:18.180> do<00:02:18.299> it<00:02:18.329> one<00:02:18.569> wire<00:02:18.810> at<00:02:19.019> a<00:02:19.140> time<00:02:19.440> and

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
if you just do it one wire at a time and

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.690 
if you just do it one wire at a time and
all<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.060> happens<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:22.079> have<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.950> mains

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
all that happens is you have a mains

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.020 
all that happens is you have a mains
wire<00:02:24.079> thorium<00:02:25.079> a<00:02:25.349> master<00:02:25.980> 12<00:02:26.280> volt<00:02:26.489> wire<00:02:26.670> comes

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
wire thorium a master 12 volt wire comes

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.600 
wire thorium a master 12 volt wire comes
in<00:02:27.209> from<00:02:27.390> your<00:02:27.540> engine<00:02:27.720> battery<00:02:28.349> into<00:02:29.069> the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
in from your engine battery into the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.839 
in from your engine battery into the
back<00:02:29.879> of<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.150> Zi<00:02:30.329> it's<00:02:30.629> a<00:02:30.750> big<00:02:30.870> fat<00:02:31.140> wire<00:02:31.849> which

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
back of the Zi it's a big fat wire which

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.330 
back of the Zi it's a big fat wire which
if<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.060> can<00:02:33.180> find<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.480> think<00:02:33.510> it's<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.900> one

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
if I can find I think it's that one

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.130 
if I can find I think it's that one
comes<00:02:35.340> in<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.700> that's<00:02:35.879> basically<00:02:36.450> charges

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
comes in and that's basically charges

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.759 
comes in and that's basically charges
your<00:02:37.530> leisure<00:02:38.040> battery<00:02:38.660> she's<00:02:39.660> down<00:02:40.260> here

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
your leisure battery she's down here

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.759 
your leisure battery she's down here
she<00:02:41.250> lays<00:02:41.400> your<00:02:41.549> batteries<00:02:42.230> now<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.350> charges

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
she lays your batteries now it charges

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.129 
she lays your batteries now it charges
those<00:02:43.950> up<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:45.239> while<00:02:45.540> you're<00:02:45.690> driving<00:02:46.049> along

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
those up and while you're driving along

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:49.370 
those up and while you're driving along
while<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.560> engine<00:02:46.799> is<00:02:46.829> running<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:48.290> what<00:02:49.290> it

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
while the engine is running and what it

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.879 
while the engine is running and what it
also<00:02:49.500> does<00:02:49.859> is<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:51.660> zit<00:02:52.139> unit<00:02:52.380> distributes

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
also does is the zit unit distributes

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.770 
also does is the zit unit distributes
your<00:02:53.280> power<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.349> rest<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.769> van<00:02:55.950> so

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
your power to the rest of the van so

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.030 
your power to the rest of the van so
basically<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.930> think<00:02:57.959> you've<00:02:58.230> got<00:02:58.380> one<00:02:58.829> -

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
basically I think you've got one -

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.520 
basically I think you've got one -
you've<00:02:59.250> got<00:02:59.340> three<00:02:59.690> three<00:03:00.690> main<00:03:00.900> outlets<00:03:01.349> I

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
you've got three three main outlets I

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.009 
you've got three three main outlets I
think<00:03:01.829> was<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.280> for<00:03:02.690> cut<00:03:03.690> remember<00:03:03.900> what<00:03:03.989> I

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
think was it for cut remember what I

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.930 
think was it for cut remember what I
think<00:03:04.230> that's<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:04.470> main<00:03:04.680> fuse<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:05.370> can't

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
think that's the main fuse I can't

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.400 
think that's the main fuse I can't
remember<00:03:06.090> actually<00:03:06.299> but<00:03:06.599> you've<00:03:07.139> got<00:03:07.260> three

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
remember actually but you've got three

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.280 
remember actually but you've got three
main<00:03:07.849> power<00:03:08.849> outlets<00:03:09.299> in<00:03:09.569> each<00:03:09.780> one<00:03:10.019> of<00:03:10.169> these

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
main power outlets in each one of these

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.960 
main power outlets in each one of these
you've<00:03:11.130> got<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.280> positive<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.940> negative

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
you've got a positive and a negative

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.839 
you've got a positive and a negative
goes<00:03:12.720> out<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.109> it<00:03:13.230> feeds<00:03:13.530> by<00:03:14.459> each<00:03:14.609> one<00:03:14.639> of

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
goes out and it feeds by each one of

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.839 
goes out and it feeds by each one of
these<00:03:14.940> wires<00:03:15.180> goes<00:03:15.630> off<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.109> feeds<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.859> power

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
these wires goes off and feeds a power

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.909 
these wires goes off and feeds a power
cable<00:03:18.150> out<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:19.109> the<00:03:19.200> rest<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.560> van<00:03:19.709> which

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
cable out to the rest of the van which

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.729 
cable out to the rest of the van which
you<00:03:20.040> tap<00:03:20.340> in<00:03:20.579> in<00:03:20.819> parallel<00:03:21.630> those<00:03:22.560> are

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
you tap in in parallel those are

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.089 
you tap in in parallel those are
parallel<00:03:23.099> yet<00:03:23.370> is<00:03:24.260> all<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.500> your<00:03:25.620> electrical

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
parallel yet is all of your electrical

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.920 
parallel yet is all of your electrical
items<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:29.000> I'm<00:03:30.000> sure<00:03:30.269> that<00:03:30.480> sounds<00:03:30.630> about<00:03:30.870> as

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
items and I'm sure that sounds about as

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.020 
items and I'm sure that sounds about as
clear<00:03:31.230> as<00:03:31.349> mud<00:03:31.380> so<00:03:32.250> I'm<00:03:32.549> not<00:03:32.639> very<00:03:32.700> good<00:03:32.880> at

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
clear as mud so I'm not very good at

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.670 
clear as mud so I'm not very good at
explaining<00:03:33.269> these<00:03:33.599> things<00:03:33.660> but<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.560> other

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
explaining these things but the other

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.110 
explaining these things but the other
thing<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.299> if<00:03:36.299> you<00:03:36.359> have

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.740 

one<00:03:40.120> of<00:03:40.240> these<00:03:40.390> which<00:03:40.750> is<00:03:41.040> for<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.690> for<00:03:43.690> the

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
one of these which is for the for the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.960 
one of these which is for the for the
mains<00:03:43.990> which<00:03:44.890> we<00:03:44.980> can<00:03:45.130> really<00:03:45.340> grab<00:03:45.610> it<00:03:47.970> then

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
mains which we can really grab it then

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.700 
mains which we can really grab it then
what<00:03:49.120> happens<00:03:49.480> is<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:49.810> need<00:03:50.050> to<00:03:50.080> feed<00:03:50.440> your

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
what happens is you need to feed your

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.620 
what happens is you need to feed your
main<00:03:50.920> supply<00:03:51.340> in<00:03:51.610> through<00:03:52.090> one<00:03:52.330> of<00:03:52.450> these

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
main supply in through one of these

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.940 
main supply in through one of these
which<00:03:52.930> is<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:54.570> short<00:03:55.570> circuit<00:03:56.080> breaker<00:03:56.620> on

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
which is a a short circuit breaker on

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.030 
which is a a short circuit breaker on
our<00:03:57.550> CD<00:03:57.970> that<00:03:58.750> makes<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.140> safe<00:03:59.380> so<00:03:59.710> if<00:03:59.800> you<00:03:59.920> have

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
our CD that makes it safe so if you have

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.580 
our CD that makes it safe so if you have
any<00:04:00.450> electricity<00:04:01.450> go<00:04:01.570> to<00:04:01.720> ground<00:04:01.960> or<00:04:02.380> go<00:04:02.530> to

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
any electricity go to ground or go to

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.830 
any electricity go to ground or go to
the<00:04:02.830> go<00:04:03.460> to<00:04:03.520> ground<00:04:03.850> or<00:04:04.090> go<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.240> the<00:04:04.420> bodywork

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
the go to ground or go to the bodywork

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.810 
the go to ground or go to the bodywork
then<00:04:05.200> it<00:04:05.710> will<00:04:05.860> it<00:04:06.130> will<00:04:06.250> cut<00:04:06.490> the<00:04:06.580> power<00:04:06.610> off

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
then it will it will cut the power off

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.650 
then it will it will cut the power off
well<00:04:07.750> this<00:04:07.990> will<00:04:08.230> also<00:04:08.620> feed<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.490> sig<00:04:09.670> unit<00:04:10.000> so

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
well this will also feed the sig unit so

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.510 
well this will also feed the sig unit so
that<00:04:11.110> when<00:04:11.530> you're<00:04:11.680> plugged<00:04:11.920> into<00:04:12.070> the<00:04:12.220> mains

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
that when you're plugged into the mains

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.660 
that when you're plugged into the mains
you<00:04:12.940> can<00:04:13.150> actually<00:04:13.270> switch<00:04:13.690> on<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:15.190> charger

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
you can actually switch on the charger

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.220 
you can actually switch on the charger
and<00:04:15.730> it<00:04:15.820> has<00:04:15.940> a<00:04:15.970> built<00:04:16.270> in<00:04:16.420> battery<00:04:16.600> charger

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
and it has a built in battery charger

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.060 
and it has a built in battery charger
which<00:04:17.380> will<00:04:17.560> continue<00:04:17.980> to<00:04:18.310> charge<00:04:18.730> your<00:04:20.070> your

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
which will continue to charge your your

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.340 
which will continue to charge your your
letter<00:04:21.310> batteries<00:04:21.900> so<00:04:22.900> all<00:04:23.020> you<00:04:23.110> have<00:04:23.200> to

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
letter batteries so all you have to

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.710 
letter batteries so all you have to
remember<00:04:23.500> is<00:04:23.710> these<00:04:23.830> controls<00:04:24.310> here<00:04:24.720> when

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
remember is these controls here when

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.480 
remember is these controls here when
you're<00:04:25.840> driving<00:04:26.050> along<00:04:26.320> and<00:04:26.500> your<00:04:26.920> your

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
you're driving along and your your

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.400 
you're driving along and your your
you're<00:04:27.910> not<00:04:28.210> actually<00:04:28.360> using<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.900> van<00:04:29.080> you

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
you're not actually using the van you

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.140
