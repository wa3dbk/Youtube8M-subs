to<00:01:09.960> kind<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.440> careful<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.250> don't<00:01:11.490> want

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
to kind of be careful so you don't want

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.999 
to kind of be careful so you don't want
to<00:01:11.700> swirl<00:01:11.970> your<00:01:12.240> brush<00:01:12.299> into<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.469> blush<00:01:13.710> you

to swirl your brush into the blush you

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
actually just want to kind of dab it

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.880 
actually just want to kind of dab it
into<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.930> blush<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.320> then<00:01:16.380> apply<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.649> to<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
into the blush and then apply it to the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.260 
into the blush and then apply it to the
cheeks<00:01:17.130> because<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.640> could<00:01:17.909> get<00:01:18.240> very

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
cheeks because you could get very

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.230 
cheeks because you could get very
heavy-handed<00:01:18.899> easily<00:01:19.649> so<00:01:20.189> they<00:01:20.789> are<00:01:20.969> very

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
heavy-handed easily so they are very

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.719 
heavy-handed easily so they are very
pigmented<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:22.259> they<00:01:22.590> are<00:01:22.770> beautiful<00:01:23.100> and

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
pigmented but they are beautiful and

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.029 
pigmented but they are beautiful and
blend<00:01:24.060> out<00:01:24.180> nicely<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.020> they're<00:01:25.829> very

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
blend out nicely and they're very

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.399 
blend out nicely and they're very
affordable<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.579> at<00:01:27.030> 399<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.960> can't<00:01:28.200> really

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
affordable so at 399 you can't really

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.179 
affordable so at 399 you can't really
beat<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:29.149> so<00:01:30.149> that<00:01:30.390> one<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.810> papaya<00:01:31.320> all

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
beat that so that one is papaya all

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.099 
beat that so that one is papaya all
right<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:32.640> next<00:01:32.969> color<00:01:33.149> is<00:01:33.390> called<00:01:33.630> wobba

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
right so this next color is called wobba

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:36.950 
right so this next color is called wobba

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
it's a little bit more vibrant in deeper

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.550 
it's a little bit more vibrant in deeper
than<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> last<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.659> they<00:01:40.079> look<00:01:40.289> very<00:01:40.320> similar

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
than the last one they look very similar

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.069

it<00:05:07.520> down<00:05:07.550> below<00:05:07.670> but<00:05:08.180> in<00:05:08.330> that<00:05:08.480> video<00:05:08.780> I<00:05:08.840> did

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
it down below but in that video I did

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.380 
it down below but in that video I did
use<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.530> darker<00:05:10.340> shade<00:05:10.640> which<00:05:10.880> was<00:05:11.180> the

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
use the darker shade which was the

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.690 
use the darker shade which was the
chocolate<00:05:11.960> truffle<00:05:12.200> and<00:05:12.590> I<00:05:13.190> used<00:05:13.400> it<00:05:13.580> to

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
chocolate truffle and I used it to

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.070 
chocolate truffle and I used it to
contour<00:05:14.120> since<00:05:14.419> I<00:05:14.540> felt<00:05:14.750> like<00:05:14.840> it<00:05:14.930> was<00:05:15.050> a

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
contour since I felt like it was a

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.750 
contour since I felt like it was a
little<00:05:15.230> bit<00:05:15.380> more<00:05:15.530> cool<00:05:15.740> toned<00:05:15.980> I<00:05:16.310> applied<00:05:16.640> it

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
little bit more cool toned I applied it

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.450 
little bit more cool toned I applied it
right<00:05:16.940> here<00:05:17.330> and<00:05:17.540> all<00:05:18.140> around<00:05:18.290> my<00:05:18.560> hairline<00:05:18.800> so

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
right here and all around my hairline so

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.830 
right here and all around my hairline so
as<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:19.730> will<00:05:19.850> see<00:05:20.030> it<00:05:20.150> just<00:05:20.330> takes<00:05:20.510> a<00:05:20.570> little

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
as you will see it just takes a little

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.260 
as you will see it just takes a little
bit<00:05:20.990> of<00:05:21.080> work<00:05:21.350> to<00:05:21.560> actually<00:05:22.010> blend<00:05:22.250> it<00:05:22.430> out<00:05:22.610> but

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
bit of work to actually blend it out but

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.870 
bit of work to actually blend it out but
it<00:05:23.390> looks<00:05:23.770> perfectly<00:05:24.770> fine<00:05:25.040> once<00:05:25.400> I<00:05:25.520> do<00:05:25.580> get<00:05:25.730> it

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
it looks perfectly fine once I do get it

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.159 
it looks perfectly fine once I do get it
blended<00:05:26.180> out<00:05:26.300> it<00:05:26.480> just<00:05:26.510> takes<00:05:26.870> a<00:05:26.960> little<00:05:27.050> bit

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
blended out it just takes a little bit

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.960 
blended out it just takes a little bit
more<00:05:27.290> work<00:05:27.710> than<00:05:27.740> other<00:05:28.130> bronzers<00:05:28.550> that<00:05:28.700> I<00:05:28.730> own

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
more work than other bronzers that I own

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.750 
more work than other bronzers that I own
so<00:05:29.660> um<00:05:29.990> those<00:05:30.440> are<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.740> two<00:05:30.890> bronzers<00:05:31.460> I

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
so um those are the two bronzers I

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.570 
so um those are the two bronzers I
actually<00:05:32.140> love<00:05:33.140> the<00:05:33.320> blushes<00:05:33.770> and<00:05:34.100> I<00:05:34.250> do<00:05:34.310> like

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
actually love the blushes and I do like

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.100 
actually love the blushes and I do like
the<00:05:34.730> bronzers<00:05:35.120> they're<00:05:35.600> not<00:05:35.750> my<00:05:35.870> favorite

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
the bronzers they're not my favorite

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.450 
the bronzers they're not my favorite
bronzers<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:36.830> I<00:05:36.860> have<00:05:37.040> in<00:05:37.160> my<00:05:37.250> collection

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
bronzers that I have in my collection

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.630 
bronzers that I have in my collection
but<00:05:38.000> again<00:05:38.540> they're<00:05:38.960> only<00:05:39.140> 399<00:05:40.040> so<00:05:40.340> can<00:05:40.550> you

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
but again they're only 399 so can you

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.760 
but again they're only 399 so can you
really<00:05:40.850> beat<00:05:41.150> that<00:05:41.360> and<00:05:41.630> they<00:05:41.810> have<00:05:42.020> a<00:05:42.320> good

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770

color<00:05:43.070> selection<00:05:43.700> these<00:05:44.450> are<00:05:44.600> the<00:05:44.720> two<00:05:44.870> that<00:05:44.990> I

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050
