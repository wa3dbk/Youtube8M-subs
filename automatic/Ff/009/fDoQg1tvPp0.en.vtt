okay<00:00:02.010> so<00:00:02.070> we've<00:00:02.820> got<00:00:02.970> our<00:00:03.090> backing<00:00:03.449> on<00:00:03.600> there

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
okay so we've got our backing on there

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.660 
okay so we've got our backing on there
about<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.500> hundred<00:00:04.799> yards<00:00:05.100> on<00:00:05.250> here<00:00:05.460> that's

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
about a hundred yards on here that's

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.730 
about a hundred yards on here that's
more<00:00:06.180> than<00:00:06.420> enough<00:00:06.509> for<00:00:06.720> what<00:00:07.440> we're<00:00:07.560> going<00:00:07.680> to

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
more than enough for what we're going to

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.520 
more than enough for what we're going to
be<00:00:07.830> using<00:00:08.150> so<00:00:09.150> now<00:00:09.660> it's<00:00:09.840> time<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.230> attach<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
be using so now it's time to attach the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.120 
be using so now it's time to attach the
fly<00:00:10.889> line<00:00:12.530> firstly<00:00:13.530> have<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> look<00:00:13.889> at<00:00:14.009> their

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
fly line firstly have a look at their

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.250 
fly line firstly have a look at their
fly<00:00:14.340> line<00:00:14.610> generally<00:00:15.360> they'll<00:00:15.660> come<00:00:15.870> spooled

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
fly line generally they'll come spooled

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.200 
fly line generally they'll come spooled
up<00:00:16.379> like<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:16.830> like<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.520> say<00:00:17.850> this<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.090> a

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
up like this like I say this is a

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.300 
up like this like I say this is a
five-way<00:00:18.779> fly<00:00:19.109> line<00:00:19.380> it's<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.680> five-way<00:00:20.160> it

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
five-way fly line it's a five-way it

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.330 
five-way fly line it's a five-way it
rolls<00:00:20.520> very<00:00:20.820> very<00:00:21.449> important<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:23.130> first

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
rolls very very important the first

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.800 
rolls very very important the first
thing<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.699> need<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.880> do<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.210> make<00:00:24.420> sure<00:00:24.449> you

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
thing you need to do is make sure you

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.859 
thing you need to do is make sure you
get<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.170> right<00:00:25.199> end<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> fly<00:00:26.400> line<00:00:26.869> most

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
get the right end of the fly line most

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.839 
get the right end of the fly line most
fly<00:00:28.170> lines<00:00:28.439> these<00:00:28.650> days<00:00:28.920> are<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> whit<00:00:29.400> forward

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
fly lines these days are a whit forward

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.139 
fly lines these days are a whit forward
profile<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.929> they<00:00:31.080> start<00:00:31.380> off<00:00:31.529> thin<00:00:31.920> get<00:00:32.820> thick

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
profile so they start off thin get thick

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.090 
profile so they start off thin get thick
and<00:00:33.420> then<00:00:33.899> go<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> little<00:00:34.290> bit<00:00:34.469> thin<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.890> end

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
and then go a little bit thin at the end

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.709 
and then go a little bit thin at the end
it's<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> Tier<00:00:35.700> four<00:00:35.730> it's<00:00:36.059> two<00:00:36.180> eared<00:00:36.480> are

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
it's the Tier four it's two eared are

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.500 
it's the Tier four it's two eared are
casting<00:00:37.260> well<00:00:37.829> by<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:37.980> later<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.360> it's

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
casting well by that later on so it's

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.690 
casting well by that later on so it's
essential<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.170> get<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.890> right<00:00:41.190> hand<00:00:41.460> onto

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
essential you get the right hand onto

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.700 
essential you get the right hand onto
the<00:00:41.910> backing<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.960> seen<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.350> done<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the backing I have seen it done the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.260 
the backing I have seen it done the
wrong<00:00:43.829> way<00:00:44.040> around<00:00:44.219> quite<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> few<00:00:45.000> times

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
wrong way around quite a few times

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.130 
wrong way around quite a few times
actually<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.350> normally<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.100> your<00:00:47.340> fly<00:00:47.550> line

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
actually so normally on your fly line

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.180 
actually so normally on your fly line
you'll<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> little<00:00:49.500> stick<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.860> saying

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
you'll have a little stick of saying

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.939 
you'll have a little stick of saying
reel<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.539> that's<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.289> end<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.590> use<00:00:52.770> on

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
reel and on it that's the end of use on

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:53.630 
reel and on it that's the end of use on
the<00:00:53.129> wing

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the wing

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.700 
the wing
this<00:00:54.210> one's<00:00:54.480> simple<00:00:54.780> because<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.530> two

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
this one's simple because it's a two

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.639 
this one's simple because it's a two
tone<00:00:55.980> fly<00:00:56.309> line<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.850> know<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:58.109> running<00:00:58.320> line

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
tone fly line I know the running line

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.400 
tone fly line I know the running line
will<00:00:59.190> shooting<00:00:59.760> line<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.809> real<00:01:01.050> end<00:01:01.260> of

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
will shooting line or the real end of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.950 
will shooting line or the real end of
the<00:01:01.530> line<00:01:01.739> there's<00:01:02.430> also<00:01:02.640> no<00:01:02.940> comes<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the line there's also no comes on to the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.850 
the line there's also no comes on to the
backing<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:05.189> we<00:01:05.280> go<00:01:05.780> once<00:01:06.780> again<00:01:07.140> there

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
backing so here we go once again there

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.740 
backing so here we go once again there
are<00:01:07.890> many<00:01:08.280> different<00:01:08.760> knots<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.299> use<00:01:09.510> for

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
are many different knots you can use for

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.560 
are many different knots you can use for
this<00:01:09.950> kneel<00:01:10.950> knots<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:12.000> use<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> braided

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
this kneel knots you can use a braided

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.740 
this kneel knots you can use a braided
loo<00:01:13.020> they're<00:01:13.830> not<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.250> particularly<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.330> I

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
loo they're not I particularly like is I

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.560 
loo they're not I particularly like is I
know<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.530> an<00:01:16.650> old<00:01:16.770> bright<00:01:17.130> not<00:01:17.400> very<00:01:18.119> simple

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
know as an old bright not very simple

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.990 
know as an old bright not very simple
it's<00:01:18.659> very<00:01:18.750> secure<00:01:19.350> what's<00:01:20.159> important<00:01:20.820> here

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it's very secure what's important here

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.550 
it's very secure what's important here
for<00:01:21.270> your<00:01:21.360> backing<00:01:21.570> joint<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.500> very

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
for your backing joint is that it's very

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.010 
for your backing joint is that it's very
slim<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.909> will<00:01:24.030> slide<00:01:24.390> through<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.810> Rings

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
slim and it will slide through the Rings

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.230 
slim and it will slide through the Rings
without<00:01:25.200> getting<00:01:25.710> stuck<00:01:26.130> otherwise<00:01:26.939> you'll

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
without getting stuck otherwise you'll

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.450 
without getting stuck otherwise you'll
use<00:01:27.570> lose<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.200> fly<00:01:28.409> line<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.100> fish<00:01:29.340> of

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
use lose your fly line and that fish of

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.700 
use lose your fly line and that fish of
a<00:01:29.520> lifetime<00:01:29.549> that's<00:01:30.180> heading<00:01:30.509> off<00:01:30.600> into

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
a lifetime that's heading off into

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.740 
a lifetime that's heading off into
so<00:01:32.039> it<00:01:32.159> needs<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> nice<00:01:32.759> slim<00:01:33.179> knock<00:01:33.450> but

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
so it needs to be a nice slim knock but

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.319 
so it needs to be a nice slim knock but
very<00:01:33.990> strong<00:01:34.409> here's<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.340> old<00:01:35.490> right<00:01:35.759> now<00:01:35.789> and

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
very strong here's the old right now and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.240 
very strong here's the old right now and
again<00:01:36.630> these<00:01:36.929> knots<00:01:37.229> are<00:01:37.380> always<00:01:37.740> best<00:01:37.979> on

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
again these knots are always best on

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.490 
again these knots are always best on
maybe<00:01:38.880> not<00:01:38.969> just<00:01:39.179> before<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.899> go<00:01:40.049> fishing

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
maybe not just before you go fishing

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.950 
maybe not just before you go fishing
like<00:01:40.649> we<00:01:40.799> are<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.490> at<00:01:41.909> home<00:01:42.270> under<00:01:42.929> a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
like we are here but at home under a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.929 
like we are here but at home under a

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
nice bright lights where you can make a

few mistakes so real end of the fly line
double<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.710> over<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:51.380> always<00:01:52.380> give

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
double it over like so always give

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.130 
double it over like so always give
yourself<00:01:52.590> plenty<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.189> room<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.610> play<00:01:53.729> with<00:01:54.140> and

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
there we go I've used this not for

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.399 
there we go I've used this not for
everything<00:03:21.939> from<00:03:22.090> trout<00:03:22.420> salmon<00:03:22.689> fishing<00:03:23.170> to

awful lot and it hasn't let me down yet

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.929 
awful lot and it hasn't let me down yet
touchwood<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.829> it's<00:03:29.980> one<00:03:30.129> to<00:03:30.310> practice<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.790> get

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:30.939 
touchwood so it's one to practice to get

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:31.890 
touchwood so it's one to practice to get
your<00:03:31.060> knots<00:03:31.239> right<00:03:31.480> now

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
your knots right now

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.809 
your knots right now
that'll<00:03:32.260> hold<00:03:32.439> that'll<00:03:33.280> take<00:03:33.430> just<00:03:33.640> about

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
that'll hold that'll take just about

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.630 
that'll hold that'll take just about
anything<00:03:34.120> but<00:03:34.329> I<00:03:34.840> like<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:35.950> just<00:03:36.159> pop<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.400> little

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
anything but I like to just pop a little

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.199 
anything but I like to just pop a little
bit<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.879> superglue<00:03:37.209> on<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.599> map<00:03:37.780> just<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:40.030> make

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
bit of superglue on the map just to make

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.780 
bit of superglue on the map just to make
it<00:03:40.239> extra<00:03:40.420> secure<00:03:40.859> it<00:03:41.859> also<00:03:42.010> gives<00:03:42.340> it<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.609> nice

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
it extra secure it also gives it a nice

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.059 
it extra secure it also gives it a nice
top<00:03:43.209> coating<00:03:44.700> as<00:03:45.700> well<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:47.049> makes<00:03:47.739> it<00:03:47.950> even

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
top coating as well and makes it even

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.970 
top coating as well and makes it even
more<00:03:48.420> sort<00:03:49.420> of<00:03:49.480> slimmer<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.200> sleeker<00:03:50.590> for

more sort of slimmer and sleeker for

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.199 
more sort of slimmer and sleeker for
going<00:03:51.220> through<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.549> rain<00:03:51.700> just<00:03:51.909> give<00:03:52.060> it<00:03:52.150> a

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
going through the rain just give it a

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.220 
going through the rain just give it a
nice<00:03:52.359> coating<00:03:52.690> of<00:03:52.989> superglue

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.670 

there<00:03:56.830> we<00:03:56.950> go<00:03:57.599> takes<00:03:58.599> a<00:03:58.720> second<00:03:59.080> or<00:03:59.140> two<00:03:59.319> to<00:03:59.349> dry

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
there we go takes a second or two to dry

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.440 
there we go takes a second or two to dry
be<00:04:00.340> careful<00:04:00.730> at<00:04:00.819> this<00:04:00.910> stage<00:04:01.180> you<00:04:01.360> don't

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
be careful at this stage you don't

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.180 
be careful at this stage you don't
suddenly<00:04:01.750> real<00:04:02.140> that<00:04:02.319> all<00:04:02.500> together<00:04:02.739> because

suddenly real that all together because

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.710 
suddenly real that all together because
you'll<00:04:03.459> get<00:04:03.580> it<00:04:03.700> stuck<00:04:03.940> into<00:04:04.150> your<00:04:04.330> bucking

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
you'll get it stuck into your bucking

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.140 
you'll get it stuck into your bucking
make<00:04:05.379> sure<00:04:05.560> this<00:04:05.769> dries<00:04:08.340> okay<00:04:09.340> we're<00:04:10.030> getting

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
make sure this dries okay we're getting

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
advice to put this on is to keep it on

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.010 
advice to put this on is to keep it on
the<00:04:37.240> spool<00:04:37.510> that<00:04:37.690> comes<00:04:37.930> on<00:04:39.690> held<00:04:40.690> it<00:04:40.870> in<00:04:40.990> place

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
the spool that comes on held it in place

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.409 
the spool that comes on held it in place
with<00:04:41.440> pipe<00:04:41.710> cleaners<00:04:41.940> I'm<00:04:42.940> just<00:04:43.210> going<00:04:43.389> to

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
with pipe cleaners I'm just going to

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:50.190 
with pipe cleaners I'm just going to
undo<00:04:43.570> these<00:04:44.970> wanna<00:04:45.970> either<00:04:46.210> side<00:04:46.540> here

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.420 

and<00:04:50.590> then<00:04:50.710> we're<00:04:50.830> going<00:04:50.920> to<00:04:51.010> do<00:04:51.130> something

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
and then we're going to do something

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.820 
and then we're going to do something
similar<00:04:51.790> as<00:04:52.090> we<00:04:52.210> did<00:04:52.390> with<00:04:52.480> the<00:04:52.600> backing<00:04:52.830> hand

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
similar as we did with the backing hand

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.480 
similar as we did with the backing hand
still<00:04:54.100> there<00:04:54.340> we<00:04:54.460> are<00:04:54.490> through<00:04:55.450> the<00:04:55.600> middle<00:04:56.490> is

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
still there we are through the middle is

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.610 
still there we are through the middle is
really<00:04:57.760> need<00:04:57.970> some<00:04:58.180> help<00:04:58.210> again<00:04:58.750> there<00:04:59.260> we<00:04:59.440> go

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
really need some help again there we go

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.490 
really need some help again there we go
and<00:05:00.340> again<00:05:00.640> it's<00:05:00.880> very<00:05:01.110> important<00:05:02.110> to<00:05:02.200> keep<00:05:02.350> a

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
and again it's very important to keep a

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.930 
and again it's very important to keep a
little<00:05:02.620> bit<00:05:02.830> of<00:05:02.920> tension<00:05:03.130> on<00:05:03.460> this<00:05:03.670> you<00:05:03.820> don't

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
little bit of tension on this you don't

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.850 
little bit of tension on this you don't
want<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.240> any<00:05:04.450> loose<00:05:04.750> coils<00:05:05.350> on<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.590> reel

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
want the any loose coils on the reel

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.640 
want the any loose coils on the reel
here<00:05:06.280> so<00:05:06.970> Mike's<00:05:07.480> slim<00:05:07.840> backing<00:05:08.260> up<00:05:08.440> that

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
here so Mike's slim backing up that

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.740 
here so Mike's slim backing up that
looks<00:05:08.920> good<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.460> little<00:05:10.360> bit<00:05:10.450> of<00:05:10.540> tension

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
looks good a little bit of tension

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.770 
looks good a little bit of tension
running<00:05:11.260> through<00:05:11.440> my<00:05:11.590> fingers<00:05:11.980> and<00:05:12.780> slowly

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
running through my fingers and slowly

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.350

but<00:05:14.530> steadily<00:05:15.010> we're<00:05:15.790> going<00:05:15.970> to<00:05:16.030> put<00:05:16.210> this

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
but steadily we're going to put this

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.630 
but steadily we're going to put this
line<00:05:16.630> on<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:16.930> reel<00:05:17.080> be<00:05:17.890> careful<00:05:18.370> at<00:05:18.490> this

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
line on the reel be careful at this

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.640 
line on the reel be careful at this
stage<00:05:18.940> if<00:05:19.240> you<00:05:19.360> see<00:05:19.540> any<00:05:19.690> punch<00:05:19.990> ups<00:05:20.230> happening

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
stage if you see any punch ups happening

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.850 
stage if you see any punch ups happening
stop<00:05:21.340> and<00:05:21.580> sort<00:05:21.820> it<00:05:21.970> out<00:05:25.410> so<00:05:26.410> that's<00:05:26.710> the

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
stop and sort it out so that's the

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.830 
stop and sort it out so that's the
running<00:05:27.190> line<00:05:27.370> going<00:05:27.730> on<00:05:27.880> very<00:05:28.150> simple<00:05:28.720> you'll

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
running line going on very simple you'll

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.240 
running line going on very simple you'll

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
see in a second this line will change

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.560 
see in a second this line will change
color<00:05:30.640> it<00:05:30.700> will<00:05:30.850> go<00:05:31.000> blue

tie our leader on onto this loop whether
we<00:06:13.740> tie<00:06:13.919> a<00:06:13.949> knot<00:06:14.219> or<00:06:14.400> a<00:06:14.520> loop<00:06:14.669> to<00:06:14.849> loop<00:06:14.879> join<00:06:15.270> but

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
we tie a knot or a loop to loop join but

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.480 
we tie a knot or a loop to loop join but
what<00:06:16.229> I'm<00:06:16.349> going<00:06:16.499> to<00:06:16.590> actually<00:06:16.949> show<00:06:16.979> you<00:06:17.249> is

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
what I'm going to actually show you is

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.429 
what I'm going to actually show you is
the<00:06:17.610> way<00:06:17.699> most<00:06:17.999> people<00:06:18.210> set<00:06:18.719> set<00:06:19.080> their<00:06:19.259> fly

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:19.439 
the way most people set set their fly

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.129 
the way most people set set their fly
line<00:06:19.680> up<00:06:19.889> by<00:06:20.400> putting<00:06:20.729> a<00:06:21.090> braided<00:06:21.479> loop<00:06:21.810> on<00:06:22.020> the

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 
line up by putting a braided loop on the

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:23.899 
line up by putting a braided loop on the
ends<00:06:22.469> so<00:06:22.770> I'm<00:06:23.159> actually<00:06:23.310> going<00:06:23.550> to<00:06:23.639> cut<00:06:23.789> this

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909 
ends so I'm actually going to cut this

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:25.640 
ends so I'm actually going to cut this
off<00:06:24.120> although<00:06:24.360> I'm<00:06:24.509> very<00:06:24.750> happy<00:06:25.080> to<00:06:25.199> use<00:06:25.409> these

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
off although I'm very happy to use these

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.740 
off although I'm very happy to use these
uses<00:06:26.129> all<00:06:26.310> the<00:06:26.430> time<00:06:26.490> while<00:06:27.180> all<00:06:27.360> issue<00:06:27.629> you

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
uses all the time while all issue you

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.879 
uses all the time while all issue you
have<00:06:27.840> really<00:06:28.139> looked<00:06:28.349> because<00:06:28.500> they're<00:06:28.770> so

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
have really looked because they're so

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:37.820 
have really looked because they're so
important

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830
