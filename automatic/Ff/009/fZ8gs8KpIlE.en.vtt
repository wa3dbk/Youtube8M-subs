00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:16.610
 good afternoon friends almost every 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.350
 apartment each customer asks for advice 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.230
 By mine chose we find today we 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.330
 let's talk on this topic in today 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.740
 video I will tell you two ways 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.599
 choose laminate simple and more difficult 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.609
 first talk about more difficult at the end 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.460
 Video will tell about how easy you can 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:37.240
 will you on how do you know la grande 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.990
 subdivided into different classes 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:46.640
 there are second classes korobas that is 21 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.950
 delivered 23 and laminate and let's say 3 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.150
 class 331 ths 2 of 3 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.280
 how do they differ due to 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.900
 2 class they are designed for home 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.070
 use for residential premises 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.170
 laminate and third class for 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.610
 commercial use but because of them 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.620
 not the day this marking is not relevant 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.620
 because the sale in Russia 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.440
 wo n't find second class laminate so 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.100
 as he is not in demand and 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.790
 our territory of Russia is not made 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.420
 and does not care other countries our people you 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.550
 know limit everywhere safety margin here 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.540
 therefore relevant today 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:32.530
 only laminate and third grade 3 1 3 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.000
 2 3 to meet these laminate is different 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.930
 among themselves conscience resistance to 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.900
 abrasion at the factory they all pass 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.850
 laboratory tests that is taken 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.930
 abrasive disc rough 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.229
 saying sandpaper lean cycles on that 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.750
 both circles are counted and how many 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.630
 revolutions sustain laminate before 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.539
 wipe through 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.009
 protective layer depending on this on 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.090
 Laminate marking 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.350
 9 thousand revolutions 12011 here these 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.239
 figures that's it that's it that's 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.550
 thus denotes the first criterion 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.739
 on which we choose laminate is a class 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.190
 laminate the higher the number the laminate 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.400
 it is better 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.920
 The next important parameter is 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.930
 laminate thickness 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.170
 accordingly, the thicker the laminate is 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.349
 he has higher sound absorption and 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.739
 more comfortable you will walk on this floor 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.090
 let's say so the theme sounds that are transmitted 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.080
 through the curtains will be better 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.549
 will improve but here one has a nuance like 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.400
 you know most of the apartments now 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.500
 surrenders with a screed this screed is pretty 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.099
 decent condition like your 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.069
 the master will say that the screed is good and its not 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.709
 you need to dub it accordingly 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.799
 you didn't have a floor differential you need 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.049
 pick laminate thickening such what 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.950
 you will have flooring in 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.390
 neighboring rooms example if you have 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.120
 the hallway and the kitchen 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.980
 There is a floor tile which is standard 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.910
 thickness of 9 millimeters, then you preferably 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.010
 and laminate to take a thickness of 9 millimeters 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.760
 tile adhesive thickness and thickness 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.819
 substrate 2 3 mm just 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.000
 level you your scores if you have to 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.490
 example in the hallway of linoleum 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.430
 preferably such a laminate 7 millimeters 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:32.810
 if you have porcelain stoneware in the hallway 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.150
 1.3 millimeters thick 12 millimeters 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.620
 amazing or meters, respectively, 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.840
 Names you desirable take such 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.280
 thickness 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.200
 but the thickness of the laminate affects the other 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.080
 important factor is on the locks 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.160
 laminate that is the longer the deck over 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.250
 the weaker his lock and enhanced 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.540
 seven millimeter laminates these 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.470
 locks and weakest weakest point 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:08.010
 this is the second factor you need 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:11.440
 on 1 my match to talk about the castle 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.440
 dwell on this means 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.630
 cordial deeds there are two kinds 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.780
 locks movies became locks when 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.230
 it was just a thorn groove and there was a miss 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.630
 glue 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.180
 every joint of them for today and you 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:30.040
 you will not find it is already outdated 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:32.740
 then the creed bug system was this when 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.850
 we had every board to score too 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.990
 there is now the usual ordinary locks there 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.500
 or locks 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.200
 but ordinary days cry and there are old castles 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.440
 and the secret language is nothing different 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:51.010
 when along the narrow side of the laminate 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.230
 inserted spring latch and using 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.900
 this spring latch is reproved assembly 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.650
 laminator but it has a reverse side 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.790
 medals 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:04.000
 Here's the end they latch locks 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:07.270
 hold much worse laminate boards than 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.270
 ordinary classic locks so i 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.040
 recommend with regular domain locks on 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.910
 the following is worth paying attention to 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.650
 this is a loud laminate there are ordinary edges 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.110
 and there are edges that are processed 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.250
 special composition to protect against 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.639
 leaks and flags 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.409
 Naturally those who 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.259
 leaked from the leakage is not much 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:29.490
 better by the way to know laminate can 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.379
 use not only for dry 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.389
 rooms and special mind renata 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:35.639
 that can be put in wet 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:38.430
 rooms that is such as kitchens 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.889
 hallway loggia even bathroom and 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.009
 These laminates differ in special 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:46.819
 icon 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:49.949
 if all other parameters are equal 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:51.449
 you can't decide between one 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.150
 productive others that is 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.749
 same color one is on 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.620
 identical locks 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:59.699
 well, almost all the same then another 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.580
 criterion which can be turned 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.870
 attention which with laminate 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.449
 how do you know well so you know to 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.389
 the laminate that he represents himself 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.879
 top paper layer bottom paper layer 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:13.500
 inside 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:16.969
 fibreboard so here 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.620
 this cooker is from different manufacturers 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:23.069
 made from different materials you are the most 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.830
 cheap this poplar this shavings were pinched 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:28.770
 poplars plus composites and under pressure and 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.099
 all this is done in more other laminate 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:35.039
 all this is made of birch 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:37.349
 naturally let's say so birch more 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:40.670
 expensive tree and in its density it 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:44.930
 close to oak and laminate 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:49.060
 of based on birch it is much 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:51.980
 best withstands all shock loads 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.620
 much better keeps its shape and naturally 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:57.730
 he is much harder is taken much 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:03.020
 harder than so here when you 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:04.730
 decided on the manufacturers or not 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.340
 you can choose the moment you need 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.500
 just read about packaging 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:14.390
 about about two squares slightly 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:16.580
 different you can define choose 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.410
 Laminate in the forest on each 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.930
 packaging is written without laminate that is 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:25.580
 Aminat also heavier than you would 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:26.750
 other things being equal that is, when 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.330
 equal to the meter 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.770
 for equal to the thickness of the laminators here 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.190
 only the heavier 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.750
 quality as probably everything you need 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.580
 It was to talk about a difficult way 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.130
 choosing laminate now i will talk about 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.540
 simple and simple is 

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.350
 next you just focus on 

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.340
 the price of good wine that is dreams 

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.470
 maybe that's all you can tell 

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.470
 about laminate 

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:52.550
 Thank you all for watching all a lot of video 

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:56.140
 liked becoming a person subscribe 

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:56.140
 on the channel bye
