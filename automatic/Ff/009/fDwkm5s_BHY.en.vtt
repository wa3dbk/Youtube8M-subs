00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.730 
is going on and a third problem concerns
about<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.270> tires<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.110> whether<00:01:49.320> they<00:01:49.560> could

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
about the tires and whether they could

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.280 
about the tires and whether they could
handle<00:01:49.979> breaking<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> stop<00:01:51.090> re<00:01:51.780> wondering

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
handle breaking to a stop re wondering

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.920 
handle breaking to a stop re wondering
what<00:01:52.470> was<00:01:52.590> next<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.100> was<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.880> captain<00:01:54.360> Park<00:01:54.630> kept

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
what was next I was so captain Park kept

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.020 
what was next I was so captain Park kept
the<00:01:55.049> plane<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.590> air<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.979> burn<00:01:56.189> fuel<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the plane in the air to burn fuel and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.990 
the plane in the air to burn fuel and
the<00:01:57.450> extra<00:01:57.869> weight<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.409> comes<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:58.860> it

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
the extra weight that comes with it

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.730 
the extra weight that comes with it
eventually<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.360> time<00:02:00.630> came<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.259> touch<00:02:01.439> down

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
eventually the time came to touch down

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.100 
eventually the time came to touch down
it<00:02:02.579> was<00:02:02.759> perfect<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.450> went<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.719> was<00:02:03.810> over<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.079> was
