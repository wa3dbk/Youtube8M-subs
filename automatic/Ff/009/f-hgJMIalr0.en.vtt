Emma

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.720

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
and there we go 10 fired off with the

and there we go 10 fired off with the
barrel<00:04:12.030> off<00:04:12.980> now<00:04:13.980> slight<00:04:14.910> breeze<00:04:15.270> nothing

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019

that's<00:04:16.169> going<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.380> affect<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.620> range<00:04:16.799> as<00:04:16.919> you

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
that's going to affect the range as you

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.370 
that's going to affect the range as you
can<00:04:17.190> see<00:04:17.400> this<00:04:17.970> time<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.269> this<00:04:18.600> is<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:19.260> can

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
can see this time and this is you can

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.690 
can see this time and this is you can
see<00:04:19.560> they<00:04:19.680> all<00:04:19.799> ended<00:04:20.040> up<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.280> this<00:04:20.400> side<00:04:20.609> and

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
see they all ended up to this side and

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.069 
see they all ended up to this side and
that's<00:04:20.790> just<00:04:21.060> going<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.239> be<00:04:21.359> due<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.690> my<00:04:21.870> aim

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
that's just going to be due to my aim

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.630 
that's just going to be due to my aim
not<00:04:22.410> due<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.830> anything<00:04:23.640> else<00:04:23.820> going<00:04:24.210> on<00:04:24.300> oh<00:04:25.640> and

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
not due to anything else going on oh and

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:34.100 
not due to anything else going on oh and
there's<00:04:26.820> our<00:04:27.000> lowest<00:04:27.510> shot<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:30.230> 29<00:04:31.700> so<00:04:33.110> not

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
there's our lowest shot and 29 so not

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.450 
there's our lowest shot and 29 so not
too<00:04:34.380> much<00:04:34.530> difference<00:04:35.010> barrel<00:04:35.430> on<00:04:35.550> or<00:04:35.730> off<00:04:35.850> I

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
too much difference barrel on or off I

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.500 
too much difference barrel on or off I
call<00:04:40.460> actually<00:04:41.460> these<00:04:41.580> ones<00:04:41.850> if<00:04:42.090> I<00:04:42.180> go<00:04:42.330> to<00:04:42.390> the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
call actually these ones if I go to the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.970 
call actually these ones if I go to the
full<00:04:42.690> spread<00:04:42.960> these<00:04:43.140> ones<00:04:43.350> are<00:04:43.470> closer<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.890> the

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
full spread these ones are closer to the

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.330 
full spread these ones are closer to the
middle<00:04:44.280> so<00:04:44.490> I'm<00:04:45.300> going<00:04:45.450> to<00:04:45.510> go<00:04:45.630> on<00:04:45.660> this<00:04:46.340> line

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
middle so I'm going to go on this line

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.520 
middle so I'm going to go on this line
of<00:04:47.490> three<00:04:47.700> here<00:04:47.970> and<00:04:48.120> those<00:04:48.540> drop<00:04:49.230> down<00:04:49.410> to

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
of three here and those drop down to

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.620 
of three here and those drop down to
exactly<00:04:49.950> between<00:04:50.240> 36<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.710> 37<00:04:52.710> feet<00:04:53.040> and<00:04:53.630> work

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
exactly between 36 and 37 feet and work

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.130 
exactly between 36 and 37 feet and work
our<00:04:54.780> way<00:04:54.810> up<00:04:54.990> to<00:04:55.080> got<00:04:55.740> one<00:04:56.660> went<00:04:57.660> a<00:04:57.690> bit<00:04:57.840> farther

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
our way up to got one went a bit farther

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.030 
our way up to got one went a bit farther
than<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.560> rest<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:58.919> this<00:04:59.070> top<00:04:59.370> one<00:04:59.669> here<00:05:01.040> at

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
than the rest and this top one here at

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.180 
than the rest and this top one here at
41<00:05:02.729> feet<00:05:02.910> so<00:05:03.300> maybe<00:05:04.050> you<00:05:04.500> get<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.680> little<00:05:05.070> bit

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
41 feet so maybe you get a little bit

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.000 
41 feet so maybe you get a little bit
more<00:05:05.400> with<00:05:05.729> that<00:05:05.880> barrel<00:05:06.120> off<00:05:06.390> but<00:05:06.720> not<00:05:07.380> too

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
more with that barrel off but not too

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.250 
more with that barrel off but not too
big<00:05:08.280> as<00:05:08.550> to<00:05:08.970> say<00:05:09.210> oh<00:05:09.240> you<00:05:09.479> could<00:05:09.780> never<00:05:09.930> use<00:05:10.110> the

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
big as to say oh you could never use the

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.290 
big as to say oh you could never use the
barrel<00:05:10.410> definitely<00:05:11.340> up<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:12.090> your<00:05:12.210> own
