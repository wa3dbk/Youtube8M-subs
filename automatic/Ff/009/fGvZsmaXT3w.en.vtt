some wonderful things about your

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.769 
some wonderful things about your
pictures<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.730> think<00:00:17.970> you're<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.359> close<00:00:18.600> to

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
pictures I think you're so close to

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.529 
pictures I think you're so close to
doing<00:00:18.930> anything<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.529> want<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.539> in

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
doing anything you want and in

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.150 
doing anything you want and in
relationship<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.320> five<00:00:22.470> pencil<00:00:22.859> method

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
relationship to the five pencil method

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.070 
relationship to the five pencil method
let<00:00:23.400> me<00:00:23.490> go<00:00:23.609> ahead<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.850> again<00:00:24.570> point<00:00:24.960> out<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
let me go ahead and again point out a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.269 
let me go ahead and again point out a
couple<00:00:25.170> things<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:26.539> as<00:00:27.830> you<00:00:28.830> may<00:00:29.010> have<00:00:29.039> already

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
couple things I as you may have already

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.370 
couple things I as you may have already
heard<00:00:29.429> me<00:00:29.699> say<00:00:29.910> but<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.359> will<00:00:30.599> if<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.990> haven't

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
heard me say but you will if you haven't

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.639 
heard me say but you will if you haven't
I<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.969> eliminate<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.570> line<00:00:33.960> representing

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
I like to eliminate a line representing

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.260 
I like to eliminate a line representing
edge<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.460> an<00:00:35.579> edge<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.760> value<00:00:35.969> I

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
edge I like to have an edge to value I

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.299 
edge I like to have an edge to value I
think<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.719> gives<00:00:36.809> us<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.170> much<00:00:38.010> better

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
think it gives us a much better

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.510 
think it gives us a much better
opportunity<00:00:38.969> for<00:00:39.239> dimension<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:41.219> seems

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
opportunity for dimension so this seems

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.660 
opportunity for dimension so this seems
to<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.760> pretty<00:00:42.180> common<00:00:42.800> approach<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:44.399> your

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to be a pretty common approach in your

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.610 
to be a pretty common approach in your
pictures<00:00:45.559> we<00:00:46.559> see<00:00:47.309> these<00:00:47.870> outlines<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.320> I

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
pictures we see these outlines and I

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.310 
pictures we see these outlines and I
think<00:00:49.950> again<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.520> has<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> tendency<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.629> take

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
think again it has a tendency to take

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.799 
think again it has a tendency to take
away<00:00:52.710> dimensional<00:00:53.520> opportunities<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.600> may

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
away dimensional opportunities you may

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.510 
away dimensional opportunities you may
be<00:00:54.870> afraid<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.379> not<00:00:55.620> being<00:00:55.680> able<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> hold<00:00:56.309> an

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
be afraid of not being able to hold an

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.049 
be afraid of not being able to hold an
edge<00:00:57.320> but<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.590> think<00:00:58.949> you'll<00:00:59.370> do<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> lot<00:00:59.879> better

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
edge but I think you'll do a lot better

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.869 
edge but I think you'll do a lot better
job<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:01.050> try<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.410> even<00:01:02.219> refine<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
job if you can try to even refine the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.479 
job if you can try to even refine the
lightest<00:01:03.239> values<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:04.049> very<00:01:04.680> nice<00:01:04.979> clean

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
lightest values to a very nice clean

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.210 
lightest values to a very nice clean
edge<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.450> wonderful<00:01:06.770> proportions<00:01:07.770> you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
edge you have wonderful proportions you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.960 
edge you have wonderful proportions you
have<00:01:08.430> wonderful<00:01:08.729> contour<00:01:09.570> you've<00:01:10.170> created

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
have wonderful contour you've created

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.820 
have wonderful contour you've created
some<00:01:11.970> great<00:01:12.510> subtle<00:01:12.960> values<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.710> your

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
some great subtle values in your

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.350 
some great subtle values in your
pictures<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.790> don't<00:01:14.970> think<00:01:15.060> you're<00:01:15.210> going

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
pictures and I don't think you're going

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.660 
pictures and I don't think you're going
to<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.540> any<00:01:15.689> problem<00:01:16.200> being<00:01:17.009> able<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.520> have

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
to have any problem being able to have

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.149 
to have any problem being able to have
something<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.299> there<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.570> replace<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.799> line

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
something in there to replace that line

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.109 
something in there to replace that line
and<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.850> think<00:01:21.060> you'll<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> benefits

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
and I think you'll see the benefits

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.870 
and I think you'll see the benefits
again<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.890> there's<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:25.979> more<00:01:26.369> thing<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.850> I

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
again I there's one more thing that I

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.940 
again I there's one more thing that I
can<00:01:27.180> suggest<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.229> bi<00:01:30.860> lesson<00:01:31.860> number

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
can suggest and that is bi lesson number

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.280 
can suggest and that is bi lesson number
three<00:01:32.130> over<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> five<00:01:32.909> pencil<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.659> method

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
three over in the five pencil of method

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.749 
three over in the five pencil of method
community<00:01:34.770> oh<00:01:36.439> no<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.680> said<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.159> wrong<00:01:38.310> over

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
community oh no I said that wrong over

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.469 
community oh no I said that wrong over
in<00:01:38.850> 25<00:01:39.119> pencil<00:01:39.630> method<00:01:39.960> calm<00:01:41.390> lesson<00:01:42.390> number

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
in 25 pencil method calm lesson number

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.270 
in 25 pencil method calm lesson number
three<00:01:42.630> will<00:01:43.079> give<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.649> rules<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.100> light

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
three will give you the rules of light

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.060 
three will give you the rules of light
how<00:01:44.939> light<00:01:45.240> works<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.409> think<00:01:46.470> that's<00:01:46.829> one

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
how light works and I think that's one

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.859 
how light works and I think that's one
thing<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.310> anybody<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:47.909> benefit<00:01:48.299> from<00:01:48.329> it

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
thing that anybody can benefit from it

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.960 
thing that anybody can benefit from it
just<00:01:49.200> starts<00:01:49.500> making<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:49.979> aware<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.369> how<00:01:50.850> much

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
just starts making you aware of how much

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.690 
just starts making you aware of how much
more<00:01:51.210> contour<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.079> depth<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.829> can<00:01:52.890> also<00:01:53.220> have

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
more contour and depth you can also have

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.660 
more contour and depth you can also have
by<00:01:54.390> thinking<00:01:55.229> about<00:01:55.409> where<00:01:56.040> things<00:01:56.369> will<00:01:56.549> be

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
by thinking about where things will be

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.940 
by thinking about where things will be
getting<00:01:56.909> darker<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:58.170> even<00:01:58.619> if<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.799> don't

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
getting darker and and even if you don't

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.859 
getting darker and and even if you don't
have<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.280> best<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.729> material<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.630> work<00:02:00.810> with

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
have the best of material to work with

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.690 
have the best of material to work with

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
you're using you may be able to take the

you're using you may be able to take the
principles<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.829> apply<00:02:07.860> them<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:09.750> not<00:02:10.020> be

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
so dependent on your photographs but

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.980 
so dependent on your photographs but
there's<00:02:14.250> opportunities<00:02:15.000> for<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.480> pull

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
there's opportunities for you to pull

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.180 
there's opportunities for you to pull
things<00:02:16.260> forward<00:02:16.950> by<00:02:17.160> pushing<00:02:17.790> things<00:02:18.150> back

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
things forward by pushing things back

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.280 
things forward by pushing things back
this<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.400> also<00:02:20.819> going<00:02:21.150> right<00:02:21.480> along<00:02:21.780> with<00:02:22.080> your

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
this is also going right along with your

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.250 
this is also going right along with your
your<00:02:22.890> your<00:02:23.760> clean<00:02:24.270> edge<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.540> value<00:02:24.569> instead<00:02:25.080> of

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
your your clean edge to value instead of

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.559 
your your clean edge to value instead of
a<00:02:25.350> line<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:26.400> eliminate<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:27.000> line<00:02:27.300> and

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
a line you can eliminate that line and

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.470 
a line you can eliminate that line and
also<00:02:28.200> incorporate<00:02:28.830> how<00:02:28.980> light<00:02:29.250> works<00:02:29.520> so

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
also incorporate how light works so

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.990 
also incorporate how light works so
whenever<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.470> have<00:02:31.830> these<00:02:32.040> opportunities<00:02:32.250> I

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
whenever I have these opportunities I

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.780 
whenever I have these opportunities I
have<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.240> chance<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.870> pull<00:02:34.530> something<00:02:35.040> forward

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
have a chance to pull something forward

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.890 
have a chance to pull something forward
and<00:02:36.260> it's<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.560> great<00:02:37.590> feeling<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:39.390> realize

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
and it's just a great feeling to realize

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.280 
and it's just a great feeling to realize
that<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:41.100> can<00:02:41.370> go<00:02:41.550> ahead<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.850> create<00:02:42.300> even<00:02:43.170> a

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
that you can go ahead and create even a

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.600 
that you can go ahead and create even a
more<00:02:44.630> warmth<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:46.680> know<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:46.980> your<00:02:47.010> pictures

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
more warmth you know in your pictures

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.729 
more warmth you know in your pictures
but<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:48.600> things<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.020> our<00:02:49.260> minds<00:02:49.530> are

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
but but things that our minds are

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.650 
but but things that our minds are
expecting<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.340> see<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.880> clean<00:02:51.150> edges<00:02:51.330> a

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
expecting to see the clean edges a

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.810 
expecting to see the clean edges a
little<00:02:51.780> more<00:02:52.290> contour<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:52.890> have<00:02:53.160> no<00:02:53.340> idea<00:02:53.489> what

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
little more contour I have no idea what

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.729 
little more contour I have no idea what
your<00:02:53.970> source<00:02:54.180> looks<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.660> but<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.380> can<00:02:55.590> go

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
your source looks like but you can go

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.800 
your source looks like but you can go
ahead<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.010> take<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.760> opportunity<00:02:57.360> just<00:02:57.600> show

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
ahead and take the opportunity just show

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.250 
ahead and take the opportunity just show
a<00:02:58.080> little<00:02:58.860> bit<00:02:59.160> more<00:02:59.519> range<00:02:59.820> of<00:03:00.060> value<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.780> see

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
a little bit more range of value I see

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
a little bit more range of value I see
that<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.500> don't<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.890> an<00:03:02.010> outline

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
that you don't have an outline

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.800 
that you don't have an outline
everywhere<00:03:02.850> it's<00:03:03.030> only<00:03:03.300> in<00:03:03.420> certain<00:03:03.570> places

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
everywhere it's only in certain places

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.630 
everywhere it's only in certain places
so<00:03:04.500> again<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:04.860> think<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.489> could

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
so again I think that you could

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.240 
so again I think that you could
eliminate<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.360> just<00:03:06.600> in<00:03:06.750> my<00:03:07.380> opinion<00:03:07.739> have

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
eliminate it and just in my opinion have

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.390 
eliminate it and just in my opinion have
a<00:03:08.280> much<00:03:08.550> more<00:03:08.730> effective<00:03:08.970> picture<00:03:10.070> this<00:03:11.070> also

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
a much more effective picture this also

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.130 
a much more effective picture this also
is<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:12.150> great<00:03:12.870> opportunity<00:03:13.200> for<00:03:13.560> us<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:14.040> show<00:03:14.700> a

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
is a great opportunity for us to show a

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.479 
is a great opportunity for us to show a
little<00:03:16.140> more<00:03:16.350> depth<00:03:16.680> something<00:03:17.100> going<00:03:17.370> around

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
little more depth something going around

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.090 
little more depth something going around
and<00:03:18.090> out<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.390> sight<00:03:18.660> around<00:03:19.110> behind<00:03:19.650> where<00:03:20.010> it

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
and out of sight around behind where it

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.979 
and out of sight around behind where it
gets<00:03:20.160> darker<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.910> little<00:03:21.060> separation<00:03:21.450> between

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
gets darker a little separation between

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.050 
gets darker a little separation between
things<00:03:22.410> like<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.739> beard<00:03:23.130> maybe<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.850> hair

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
things like the beard maybe the hair

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.000 
things like the beard maybe the hair
being<00:03:24.299> all<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.660> same<00:03:24.870> color<00:03:25.170> we<00:03:25.680> can<00:03:25.860> make<00:03:25.980> a

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
being all the same color we can make a

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.039 
being all the same color we can make a
little<00:03:26.370> darker<00:03:26.730> here<00:03:26.970> just<00:03:27.450> little<00:03:27.810> things

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
little darker here just little things

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.620 
little darker here just little things
like<00:03:28.260> this<00:03:28.650> can<00:03:29.190> help<00:03:29.459> give<00:03:29.790> your<00:03:30.060> picture

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
like this can help give your picture

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.800 
like this can help give your picture
much<00:03:31.140> more<00:03:31.350> dimension<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.420> you<00:03:33.420> may<00:03:33.570> have<00:03:33.600> to

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
much more dimension and you may have to

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.780 
much more dimension and you may have to
increase<00:03:34.110> some<00:03:34.620> values<00:03:35.070> in<00:03:35.100> certain<00:03:35.640> places

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
increase some values in certain places

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.960 
increase some values in certain places
to<00:03:36.690> allow<00:03:37.440> this<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.950> look<00:03:38.100> light<00:03:38.370> enough<00:03:38.730> if

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
to allow this to look light enough if

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.789 
to allow this to look light enough if
you<00:03:39.060> have<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.390> increase<00:03:39.660> this<00:03:39.870> value<00:03:39.930> instead

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
you have to increase this value instead

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.130 
you have to increase this value instead
of<00:03:40.980> having<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.310> line<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.910> hold<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.299> edge<00:03:42.570> you

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
of having a line to hold that edge you

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.840 
of having a line to hold that edge you
may<00:03:43.290> have<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.769> work<00:03:43.799> and<00:03:44.250> have<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.459> little<00:03:44.700> more

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
may have to work and have a little more

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.789 
may have to work and have a little more
value<00:03:45.209> in<00:03:45.239> other<00:03:45.540> places<00:03:45.690> so<00:03:46.110> in<00:03:46.260> relationship

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
value in other places so in relationship

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.530 
value in other places so in relationship
it<00:03:46.950> still<00:03:47.130> looks<00:03:47.340> light<00:03:47.549> but<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.180> think<00:03:48.450> you're

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
it still looks light but I think you're

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.180 
it still looks light but I think you're
going<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.720> do<00:03:48.840> just<00:03:48.870> wonderful<00:03:49.680> I'm<00:03:49.860> so

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
going to do just wonderful I'm so

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.380 
going to do just wonderful I'm so
anxious<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.579> see<00:03:50.790> what<00:03:50.940> you're<00:03:51.060> going<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.239> do

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
anxious to see what you're going to do

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.750 
anxious to see what you're going to do
with<00:03:51.630> maybe<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.350> suggestions<00:03:53.130> that<00:03:53.400> I'm

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
with maybe the suggestions that I'm

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.410 
with maybe the suggestions that I'm
making<00:03:54.150> without<00:03:55.549> you<00:03:56.549> know<00:03:56.640> expecting<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.239> to

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
making without you know expecting you to
