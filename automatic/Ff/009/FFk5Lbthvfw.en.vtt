00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 I would no longer have a vertex called d if not 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.290
 I would go back to the here at the bottom 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.480
 we draw a line to indicate that of the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.099
 c returns the y that is triangular and here 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.840
 we draw what is the actual form of the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.460
 tower because the format is as if 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.139
 it was completely straight but this 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.940
 It has a pyramid shape after doing 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.510
 we started doing the drawing then 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.760
 we look for the face that is it is seen that it is 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.920
 this one that is here is just the one 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.900
 let's start drawing that we achieve 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.519
 see at the top there is an antenna 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.250
 in the center and available supports 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.630
 we make the drawing I remember that hand and 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.670
 placed the height at which it is 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.860
 then I have the left part a 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.120
 antenna drawing the antenna and placed the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.379
 height at which it is 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.690
 then he already saw two antennas on 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.100
 the edge of the drawings and placed them 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.690
 the height at which they meet and this 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.920
 is the way to draw here I reach 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.710
 see suddenly these three antennas that 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.149
 they are on the face bird I can go 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.860
 drawing however afterwards it 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.510
 corroborate with a photo that looks like 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.039
 the face but what I want to mention 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.859
 is that here is again the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.629
 vertex b so it's a reflection it 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.250
 find the same elements and to 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.870
 this case we have already determined that we are going 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.030
 to install the antennas because the site 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.619
 it's ours on the top 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.450
 was occupied by another operator 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.190
 we should place them in the most 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.990
 low and if we were in one place 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.090
 located our recommendation would be 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.170
 change the existing sanctity 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.909
 the next thing to take is the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.650
 we do the sectors there are more or less 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.659
 three ways to do it once from the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.759
 tower with the compass looking up to where 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.200
 point the antennas and take the top 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.550
 however, this has a margin of 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.470
 error since as is one 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.850
 inside a metal cage that is the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.350
 tower was to affect the measurement of the 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.720
 compass another way to take it is 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.310
 position yourself under the tower and 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.130
 exactly under one of the antennas 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.619
 and there from the floor watching this is the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.149
 reference point is taken at one of 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.320
 each of the three sectors that must 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.390
 be registered in the list of 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.119
 I check a third way if here 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.909
 we have the tower and we managed to locate 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.920
 point of reference a building and already 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.600
 we have located the north we assemble the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.819
 application of a compass and we can 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.649
 determine what is the top what 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.539
 we are recommending in this case is the 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.759
 second option from the floor then 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.979
 come the new space questions 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.300
 contributions 1.5 meters for three sectors 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.789
 this was the one that we already took photos 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.709
 horizontal tower ladder and 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.329
 vertical and we must determine if there 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.660
 space to place the hangars that 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.760
 they go there 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.470
 fiber optics and feeding that 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.210
 towards the radio units like us 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.890
 we realize this is busy but without 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.630
 But here on the side you can 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.640
 make an adaptation with hunger and you 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.680
 You can carry the cables through the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.870
 tower if it was not that the option touches 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.150
 send the proposal to assemble a new 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.890
 ladder on one side and it 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.360
 must make the observations in the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.280
 checklist is the list 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.900
 horizontal same remember then 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.820
 you look for economy the proposal would be 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.080
 place it at one end because in the 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.000
 center there is no space with this 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.620
 we answer this question and finally 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.840
 you have to measure the distance of the room 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.610
 equipment to the tower that would be this 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.410
 distance or all kinds of angle of the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.240
 tower from taking the photo this is a 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.250
 case of a tie some towers come 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.780
 only in it or some come circular 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.270
 This serves to make the case that 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.920
 install brackets the manufacturer already know 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.540
 what kind of rage arrived at the rapporteur 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.030
 then there is a photo of the wall passes 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.860
 where we should identify if there is any 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.630
 space to pass our cables 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.050
 or if it is necessary to mount another step love 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.370
 then comes fourth equipment photo 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.170
 preferably where the tired 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.060
 location of the room and how it has linked with 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.030
 the tower and the photos inside the 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.890
 fourth equipment where the racks can be seen 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.480
 Take at least three angles 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.880
 different both external and internal 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.920
 then we will reserve the space for 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.060
 the rack the first option is like in 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.709
 this case that there is enough space 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.959
 inside the fourth equipment and we perform 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.150
 a reserve of one square meter and what 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.250
 let's mark it by taking a picture of it 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.959
 second option if it is not met 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.270
 reserve a space of 6 units of 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.130
 rack that is approximately 30 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.140
 centimeters and it is left marked and by 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.940
 last option would be a car rack should be 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.200
 look for a site that is close to 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.140
 equipment room because you have to bring 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.610
 the energy of that or ac and near the 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.440
 tower and ladder to be able to carry 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.420
 the wires should take the picture leaving 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.030
 a mark in this case was placed a 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.360
 folder to see where it's going to 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.890
 place soon the time 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.050
 but we're going for the energy part 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.000
 we have that rectifier space is 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.800
 available in case you need to increase 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.630
 the supply here was only found 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.980
 one available but there is a space in the 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.630
 bottom to mount more 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.190
 racks if necessary I 'll 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.290
 Take the photo to the load consumption 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.090
 current if this one is not very real since the 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.410
 modern radios have system saves 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.299
 energy and when the traffic goes down it 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.519
 they are turning off now we take the photo of 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.950
 reserved breaker space in the 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.690
 distributor of that there is space in this 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.440
 case there are three spaces here we see one 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.810
 which was left reserved 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.480
 here is another and so that it is reached 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.970
 see another space to take pictures is left 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.770
 one reserved making the notation that 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.610
 there is no break and in case it touches us 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.040
 assemble our own system 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.200
 rectifier that to take picture at 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.180
 board makes verifying that if they remain 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.770
 spaces to mount a bipolar breaker 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.420
 is already going to deliver the checklist 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.910
 completed with all observations 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.800
 that the plane of the tower is necessary 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.180
 that was made by hand and the entire file of 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.580
 photos that these two documents were taken 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.230
 is given in scanning or they should be taken 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.180
 a macro photo well done and it 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.800
 will download the cloud the intention is to make 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.360
 storage of information in the 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.430
 cloud there are many providers that lend 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.660
 this service and for this project we are going 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.220
 to use this that will send them a 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.930
 mail where you are authorized to 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.340
 use the nano space and there go 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.870
 downloading the photos within the 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.860
 files of each of the sites and 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.360
 this is the procedure that 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.280
 developed to perform the site survey 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.280
 for a station 4g lte
