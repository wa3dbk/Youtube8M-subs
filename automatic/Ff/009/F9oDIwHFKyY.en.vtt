00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.300 
and would last a long time in and that's
what<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.680> what<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> was<00:01:20.009> able<00:01:20.070> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
what this is this is what I was able to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.060 
what this is this is what I was able to
find<00:01:20.750> they<00:01:21.750> did<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:21.990> recently<00:01:22.380> redesign

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
find they did just recently redesign

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.160 
find they did just recently redesign
this<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:24.090> does<00:01:24.240> say<00:01:24.390> new<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> website

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
this so it does say new on the website

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.990 
this so it does say new on the website
on<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.380> one<00:01:25.590> because<00:01:25.890> they<00:01:26.070> they<00:01:26.400> change<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
on this one because they they change the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.429 
on this one because they they change the
old<00:01:27.150> model<00:01:27.479> inside<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.810> wait<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.990> few<00:01:28.140> months<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
old model inside to wait a few months to

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.230 
old model inside to wait a few months to
get<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.680> new<00:01:28.710> model<00:01:29.100> here<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:30.119> it's

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
get the new model here but it's

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.899 
get the new model here but it's
definitely<00:01:30.390> worth<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.680> again<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.729> is

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
definitely worth it so again this is

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.530

they have a nice leather handle on the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.770 
they have a nice leather handle on the
outside<00:01:46.740> that's<00:01:46.920> integrated<00:01:47.399> into<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.390> I

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
outside that's integrated into the I

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.740 
outside that's integrated into the I
guess<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.680> frame<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.430> metal<00:01:51.240> components

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
guess the frame or the metal components

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.380 
guess the frame or the metal components
on<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.930> inside<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.890> also<00:01:53.310> has<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> nice<00:01:53.790> while

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
on the inside so I also has a nice while

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.490 
on the inside so I also has a nice while
we<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.600> look<00:01:54.689> into<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> front<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.320> got<00:01:55.470> a

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
we can look into the front it's got a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.440 
we can look into the front it's got a
pocket<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> front<00:01:56.340> here<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.360> can

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
pocket on the front here so you can

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.940 
pocket on the front here so you can
place<00:01:57.630> documents<00:01:58.259> something<00:01:58.590> else<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.829> know

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
about the specs so it is 14 inches top

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.130 
about the specs so it is 14 inches top
to<00:02:05.640> bottom<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.420> about<00:02:06.570> ten<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.990> half

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
to bottom it's about ten and a half

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.830 
to bottom it's about ten and a half
inches<00:02:07.590> wide<00:02:07.940> and<00:02:08.940> then<00:02:09.090> it's<00:02:09.270> about<00:02:09.360> an<00:02:09.569> inch

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
inches wide and then it's about an inch

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.180 
inches wide and then it's about an inch

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.340 
so that yellow one that's pretty sweet
too<00:06:37.480> if<00:06:37.570> you<00:06:37.660> feel<00:06:37.810> like<00:06:37.900> you<00:06:38.020> could<00:06:38.140> pull<00:06:38.320> that

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.190 
too if you feel like you could pull that
off<00:06:38.470> that'd<00:06:38.770> be<00:06:38.860> pretty

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
off that'd be pretty

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.110 
off that'd be pretty
some<00:06:39.520> but<00:06:40.520> they<00:06:41.150> also<00:06:41.270> do<00:06:41.600> they<00:06:42.440> do<00:06:42.500> purses

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
some but they also do they do purses

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.520 
some but they also do they do purses
they<00:06:44.120> do<00:06:44.260> shoes<00:06:45.260> they<00:06:45.680> don't<00:06:45.860> make<00:06:46.370> them

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
they do shoes they don't make them

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.860 
they do shoes they don't make them
anything<00:06:48.530> above<00:06:48.950> a<00:06:49.040> 45<00:06:49.580> European<00:06:50.240> which<00:06:50.420> is<00:06:50.630> I

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
anything above a 45 European which is I

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.640 
anything above a 45 European which is I
think<00:06:50.990> like<00:06:51.410> 11<00:06:52.370> American<00:06:53.050> versus<00:06:54.050> our<00:06:54.200> sizes

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.650 
think like 11 American versus our sizes

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.780 
think like 11 American versus our sizes
so<00:06:54.740> they<00:06:54.830> don't<00:06:54.950> have<00:06:55.040> anything<00:06:55.250> in<00:06:55.400> my<00:06:55.430> size

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:55.790 
so they don't have anything in my size

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.250 
so they don't have anything in my size
but<00:06:56.530> a<00:06:57.530> really<00:06:58.490> cool<00:06:58.670> backpack<00:06:59.120> so<00:06:59.750> this<00:06:59.960> isn't

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.260 
but a really cool backpack so this isn't
