00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 good guys we are here in a blog 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.470
 Well, this is a blog like this 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.240
 short and fleeting so basically for 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.160
 tell you so good that I'm already in my 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.070
 house as you can appreciate I am in my 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.570
 beautiful house that I missed him and 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.420
 well also to tell you that 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.100
 Well, I'm back from the e3 that's good 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.380
 I imagine that you will know it already although good 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.880
 it was evident that he had returned and what else 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.680
 what happens when, then, between the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.090
 move and all the roll because you know 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.210
 Well, it usually takes a while 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.489
 little bit to go back to position and 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.870
 others because it's going to mount others all the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.450
 room and that the truth is that it is a 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.300
 disgusting mess but hey what 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.540
 it touches and well well also shortly 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.550
 I'm going to play again yes 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.090
 but well this time it's going to be a 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.780
 definitive move at least for 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.370
 a long time because man the truth is 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.160
 what good when you get used to living 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.050
 only the truth is that it's cool and good 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.730
 Well, I want to be 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.770
 not to my house that is very well 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.690
 Obviously, but I really want 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.880
 be alone the truth 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.100
 Well, you know, I have rubén here 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.470
 and I also anyway but good 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.420
 the fact is that well I also imagine 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.160
 that you will have seen then that these days 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.350
 I've been with the usual rhythm of 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.410
 channel that there was even some day that did not 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.120
 uploaded video forgive me okay but it's been 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.160
 basically good for all the 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.810
 mess of the move and others and good 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.640
 It is also true that I still notice the 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.520
 voice a little fucked and is that I'm a 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.520
 little cold and yesterday I was all the 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.560
 night in bed with some disgusting the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.110
 truth is that it is the worst is what more 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.030
 I hate in the world is cold and good 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.010
 Well, the truth that sincerely is like 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.740
 that you're like this a little reluctantly of others and 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.930
 on top of that, that is if you want 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.940
 curl the curl more over you go 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.010
 Breaks the fucking splitter so it does not 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.040
 could record whatever it is that it was already the 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.260
 plan he does not go over but good does not happen 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.880
 nothing because he is sometimes cautious 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.190
 I'm not going to buy a splitter 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.320
 bought two or is it in plan of if you 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.450
 breaks one is always in reserve the 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.070
 truth is that I'm going to learn to be more 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.470
 cautious with those things because it is 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.550
 true that if you break something 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.080
 you stay like that a little turús to two candles 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.180
 basically because good because because without 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.510
 splitter will not be able to with this capture 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.250
 with which I have and others and good for longer 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.400
 thank goodness I have it already I have it 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.750
 install works well let's go so 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.690
 Well, you're going to have it again 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.760
 again the usual videos are going to 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.950
 return the rhythm to the channel as always or 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.270
 I even plan to do more things or 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.340
 be that it may even increase a 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.470
 little the rhythm and others anyway 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.450
 I also have to edit the blogs of the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.770
 e3 what are you asking me to do when 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.970
 I will increase it more but less with the 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.370
 question of doubts and all that because 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.440
 you know how good everything goes a little 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.200
 more slowly but good this week that 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.610
 come you will already have the e3 blogs I do not know 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.980
 how many will I raise the truth I do not have 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.420
 No idea depends on what you see 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.220
 the clicks that he has recorded as well 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.020
 I'll go like this so that 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.600
 there are cool videos that do not have videos 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.940
 cortitos and good for those who leave have 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.650
 come out the truth that I have many clicks 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.300
 the truth we recorded many things of 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.190
 bring lots of bullshit too 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.410
 we've seen over there but well I have 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.460
 thought to do all that and nothing else 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.990
 I just wanted 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.070
 this video has been very short so that 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.930
 do not say what happens here since this does not 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.000
 it's the same then just to 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.310
 tell us about that good now 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.960
 in no time and it will return the rhythm 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.450
 usual channel retake the channel 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.280
 secondary I also have many ideas and 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.280
 the truth is that what I have not done everything 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.980
 this time I'm going to do it now because 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.560
 like everything else, you get used to saying 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.930
 I'm going to do this and you're leaving it 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.970
 leaving what you are leaving but good 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.340
 finished now let's start and really 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.020
 seriously to death so good then 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.390
 I simply hope that your support 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.370
 well I have it always I finish it I do not see 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.230
 always the tweets that you put me in the 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.540
 comments the truth that I am very 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.030
 really grateful for the support that I 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.190
 you give day by day even yesterday he put that 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.510
 It was bad the whole world is what's wrong with you 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.030
 to get the truth is that many 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.010
 thank you all and well then simply 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.170
 I wanted to comment on these things is a 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.390
 video yes a little fast and so on and 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.600
 good also to comment a little 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.550
 The theme this that good maybe 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.190
 good when I go to move and others 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.980
 I will tell 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.860
 and I'll leave videos to prepare you worry and 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.840
 all that I do not have date exactly of 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.790
 when I'm going to leave but I hope it's 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.720
 as quickly as possible because the truth 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.910
 is that I want to be living in my 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.350
 quiet house is that I'm very cool 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.000
 it's really cool, I imagine that 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.610
 many of you because you are young 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.270
 those that are not obviously so 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.130
 same is not better at home with the 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.410
 parents obviously but the day that 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.970
 you try to live only the truth is that only 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.760
 I say it's the best you can do 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.120
 because it is to undo whatever you want 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.120
 but also worth not in plan should do 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.010
 here we go a damage no but good that 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.500
 we do a lot so I do not roll more 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.230
 I leave you simply with this so that 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.700
 do not know I leave this video and good and 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.340
 you know that in a little bit he is back 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.990
 back the rhythm and pim pam pim pam and nothing 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.560
 see you next videos to the guys 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.560
 goodbye
