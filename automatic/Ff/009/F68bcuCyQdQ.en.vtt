you

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.550 

so<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:38.640> ten<00:00:39.090> books<00:00:39.300> I'd<00:00:39.480> shows<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:40.140> basically

so the ten books I'd shows are basically

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.770 
so the ten books I'd shows are basically
books<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.310> influenced<00:00:41.820> me<00:00:42.000> but<00:00:42.630> mostly

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
books that influenced me but mostly

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.720 
books that influenced me but mostly
influenced<00:00:43.440> my<00:00:43.590> reading<00:00:43.980> habits<00:00:44.010> because<00:00:44.640> I

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
influenced my reading habits because I

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.860 
influenced my reading habits because I
don't<00:00:44.910> think<00:00:45.090> there's<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.330> book<00:00:45.540> that<00:00:45.780> really

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
don't think there's a book that really

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.140 
don't think there's a book that really
changed<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> person<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.370> am<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:48.120> just

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
changed the person that I am I just

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.170 
changed the person that I am I just
think<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.200> books<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:50.010> general<00:00:50.400> like<00:00:50.670> help

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
think that books in general like help

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.090 
think that books in general like help
you<00:00:51.300> expand<00:00:51.690> your<00:00:51.780> mind<00:00:52.080> and<00:00:52.500> learn<00:00:52.739> about

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
you expand your mind and learn about

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.210 
you expand your mind and learn about
yourself<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.760> others<00:00:54.080> but<00:00:55.080> I<00:00:55.410> don't<00:00:56.010> know<00:00:56.070> if

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
yourself and others but I don't know if

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.520 
yourself and others but I don't know if
one<00:00:56.510> particular<00:00:57.510> book<00:00:57.810> really<00:00:58.350> had<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
one particular book really had a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.180 
one particular book really had a
definite<00:00:59.040> impact<00:00:59.220> of<00:00:59.790> my<00:00:59.910> life<00:01:00.230> also<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.500> can't

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
definite impact of my life also I can't

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.910

the other stories what maybe would have

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.399 
the other stories what maybe would have
happened<00:05:29.009> if<00:05:29.159> he<00:05:29.699> had<00:05:29.789> been<00:05:30.000> accepted<00:05:30.539> in<00:05:30.719> Cebu
