00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.820
 hello very good to all here parisien 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.860
 commenting on a new video tutorial in the 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.660
 that I will show you how to unlock 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.369
 or hack your psp with the version 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:25.460
 6.60 and good to tell you that I think that 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:27.500
 will also work for 639 and 635 if 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.550
 they have a lower one as they update their 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.379
 software 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.110
 and this and well, the video is going to 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.840
 being very easy is more than downloading 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.940
 a file and put it in the psp and then 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.680
 set some things 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.510
 and well, the first thing you have to do 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.059
 do is download this file that 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.199
 I will leave the description when I have it 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.900
 downloaded you do not have to extract here to the 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.720
 click the right button this was here 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.090
 once brought we will be this 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.970
 folder that you have to open the 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.950
 I would have delivered game and you will remain 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.180
 these two files are worth what 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.960
 we have to do now is connect 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.960
 our psp 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.960
 well once we have connected to 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.890
 our prince to the computer what 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.080
 we will have to do is open 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.960
 the psp or know the files it contains 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.740
 and these folders will appear then 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.680
 we have to get into p esp 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.170
 game and here I do not have made some 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.850
 you will have some good games boys 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.869
 Well, here what you have to do is 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:44.590
 copy these files from the winrar that 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.580
 leave the copies and the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.290
 lose in game 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.320
 now it will stick 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.690
 and once it's already copied we're going to 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.960
 close everything and we 're going to go to our 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.960
 psp 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.860
 once we have started our psp what 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.200
 what we are going to do is go 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.940
 for memory stick 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.200
 and then let's see that two do not appear 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.970
 records 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.220
 what are we just going through with the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.830
 good computer first of all we're going to 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.470
 look at the version of our psp that 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.490
 I was still in the settings 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.490
 system adjustment 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.050
 and now we should look for information not 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.540
 to lose 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.599
 system information 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.319
 good to me it tells me that I have the version 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:43.060
 6.60 well now let's continue with the 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.720
 computing what we have to do is 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.250
 no to the memory stick 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.250
 we are not going to memory stick 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.650
 and once there what we have to do 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:58.230
 open the file but update 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.230
 we open it and it's going to start 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.819
 ok now we are going to appear here as 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.349
 some letters and white and the background all 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.879
 black then what we have to do 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.879
 is to press the X 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.859
 ok now it appears other suitcases still 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.859
 we have to give him 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.920
 ok and now it will proceed to restart 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.920
 the prince 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.310
 to you will appear more letters and 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.349
 still because as it already makes you 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.409
 time then and I do not see that 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.239
 you will appear many letters and as 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.280
 if something was installed but that 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.019
 do not freak out that that's normal good 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.640
 Now let's check that it has 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.930
 installed well 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.440
 then we go to settings adjustments of the 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.440
 system 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.099
 system information 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.640
 and will tell us now to see 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.200
 now he does not say 6.60 but he sees 9 that 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.620
 means that our psp right now 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.720
 is pirated it's worth then that we have 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.510
 what to do to show us the 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.000
 games 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.190
 we imagine that you put 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.110
 memories has a game and I should 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.510
 appear here in the rote here is 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.860
 where all the games are going to appear 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.980
 so if it does not appear it's because you have 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.000
 that give this the fast recovery if 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.520
 once I had a game and not 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.060
 appears is because you have to open this 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.440
 I say it's going to restart the psp 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.550
 and then now it will all appear 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.550
 rope head games worth 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.349
 Y 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.879
 and then now I'm going to show you where 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.100
 you have to save the games from the 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:57.360
 computer 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.969
 well now I'm back here 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.740
 in the other on the computer with the psp 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:04.830
 connected and as you see I have been created 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.099
 two new files that would be the cep lug 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.879
 ins and the good iso folder where you have 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:11.560
 that save them game 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:13.900
 most are saved in that 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.310
 that is the video we are not going to put and that is 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.350
 I do not know why your video appears 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.240
 he puts it and here in this folder inside 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.400
 the folder that's where you have to 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.950
 save all the good games and some 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.250
 they are saved in here in game but that already 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.050
 it's weird then if the 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.360
 folder that for nothing happens you have to 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.210
 create an age is to create parts folder and 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.340
 the flame is it that with all uppercase 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.430
 and well, that's it, we have our 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:43.000
 formatted psp and formatted bear 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.560
 pirated and you can put all the 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.910
 games that you want and all good that 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.620
 I hope it has served videos that you 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.700
 subscribe that you give to the xxi has served 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.700
