00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.000
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.220
 a new blanches video 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.580
 Today I want to introduce mom device 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.539
 that's from voltcraft and that's that 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.519
 b6 ac from konrad it is super said the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.250
 kab and unload but that's where i come from 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.480
 there to speak again because first 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.130
 I wanted to say that we are in 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.759
 forum online are the nova jazz 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.770
 Forum 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.600
 there you can sign up if 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.309
 you may want to ask 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.579
 put as well as it in youtube channel too 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.290
 does 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.590
 you can do your own projects 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.660
 imagine with pictures and what you all 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.969
 I also want to know about it 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.620
 exchange about it so this great 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.559
 thing if he wants to with you 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.160
 I myself am also with mediatek project 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.629
 Do not want to miss in the winter 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.530
 I've heard of paper in there and 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.359
 there are also a few 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.129
 Pictures follow which our piece for 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.780
 show what I just did 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.020
 have and write what they will soon 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.640
 still going to do it and having a break 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.610
 I'm still there with the savage 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.020
 that's a bit of someone's effect this way 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.030
 kaputt kaputt and that would like a bit 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.380
 you can also castor her 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.659
 Write what you have for how to man 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.000
 but castrating could do that 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.070
 see again when the time is right 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.100
 much that one to the forum 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.720
 Although now is the charger so I 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.329
 have of conrad gets me warcraft 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.280
 bought and that 's a great thing 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.900
 I would like to show what in the first 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.500
 device for example everything is included 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.420
 here we have the for the people 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.009
 For example , we still drive with nitro 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.030
 glow plugs here put this tower 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.990
 so that you can beautifully the glow plugs 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.540
 charge 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.259
 that's very easy so you can see it too 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.310
 how we live to address everything 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.750
 then we have two more crocodiles 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.670
 I would need it now 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.140
 first but not the variety in 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.700
 scope of delivery included 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.740
 then we have a little one 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.520
 tower that is smaller otherwise 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.740
 flat tower now even then 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.880
 we still have such a tower I have to 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.380
 Let's see what I still bent for you 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.810
 but he is lucky here 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.260
 Find 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.980
 there is still an essay with it 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.569
 I already have that 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.200
 that is currently connected 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.040
 to my battery pack of carbon on 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.450
 this is always with special 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.910
 interim solution but I say 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.940
 Coupling solved and then everyone is 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.750
 small essay will be also at those 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.890
 otherwise tackled by carbon fiber goes like this 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.450
 then you see here for example already 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.800
 These three types are three now 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.660
 Battery types that I just now 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.430
 you can definitely use that 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.200
 so were these other tackled the 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.049
 is a family day you can in any case 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:46.780
 this will continue to charge the battery pack from the moon 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:49.330
 and those glowing stada the camera 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.340
 You can of course load it 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.470
 even more batteries or rechargeable batteries 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.269
 and that could be the whole 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.090
 Lithium batteries have been that once 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.650
 nico simon and live rechargeable batteries I have 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.569
 now itself not to be found rather 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.549
 because in the flight model helicopters 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.700
 and maybe everything was broken 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.069
 I have to think about helicopters 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.620
 you have already seen a nice one 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:15.670
 but then you can still do this 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.280
 nickel metal hydride rechargeable batteries and 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.280
 nickel cadmium batteries and lead batteries can 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.720
 plan the device but also very many 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.130
 functions there I will now first 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.180
 do not respond because that would be the 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.600
 frame you can do so much 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.700
 do 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.630
 You have to read that yourself 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.690
 device is actually relatively new so 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.769
 who that what I think now 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.910
 I 've still got those 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.440
 parenting of carbon fibers and there 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.470
 For example, here is a connection 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.940
 turn and I think strongly that one 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.560
 here too if you are in this now 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.750
 this family if mappus is in here 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.489
 that you can load it too 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.560
 Unfortunately, there is no plug here now 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.389
 with which I could do that but the 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.730
 you may also have to buy 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:59.200
 I'll be smart again but that 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.340
 It would be great to have the batteries 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:08.940
 take out and in which the family completely 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:11.290
 Just like that I have already 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.889
 my battery connected from the carbon 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.989
 continue 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.360
 I had the user now 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.280
 and then long 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.769
 or was a very long time in the network 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.850
 connected and not know now 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.920
 how happy it is because he thought for a long time 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.780
 i do i use a program from 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.850
 The charger see how fresh that 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.570
 is a super thing I will now 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.190
 show times and you have every menu 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.570
 you can see that there you can many 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.850
 set things when I enter 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.010
 button presses for example 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.510
 one here lipo battery so now 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.940
 no lottery has that time 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.290
 next category so here are these 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:56.280
 nickel metal hydride batteries since I have this 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:58.950
 Battery wants to load under her is the 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.150
 Charts is loading program 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.900
 But I do not want to be late because he 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.940
 not empty is the next unloaded 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.200
 I do not want that too I want him 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:14.280
 so long the program here 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.750
 you can see that unloads and loads 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.090
 You can change that too the first one 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.340
 song and discharges and that the following 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.970
 background 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.650
 that takes this cycle or this 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.380
 cycle is done five times the hot 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.970
 unloads and songs and the whole he does 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.350
 five times in a row the flashing battery 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.610
 that makes me fit again if he is 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.640
 so a little bit tells him it's exhausted 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.800
 and long years in use 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.229
 I want to do that for so long now 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.940
 emphatically times on enter so there is 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.140
 Everything is set correctly if I am 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.650
 Now maybe start the program 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.690
 would like to 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.919
 Holding down for three seconds stood there 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.710
 in there you can see it now 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.460
 benno jacob is super straight and you are standing 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.729
 here's the data 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.260
 he's just out of something , for example 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.800
 that is from battery or I have one 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.510
 given 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.390
 then he will look after himself here 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.979
 with vampire unloads and popular there 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.540
 set it different stages then 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.979
 you also have to take care of the batteries 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.690
 because many do not hold some levels 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.630
 but you have to be there already 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.180
 make smart 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.220
 in total , that will be 6 1 5 volts and now 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.660
 He has been the time that has just 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:21.060
 but at the moment 30 seconds 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:24.390
 here stands d and c that is here the d 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.550
 stands for discharged and he is just 37 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.660
 or to unload his music at 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.210
 and here is the value he is right now 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:35.860
 Wait, the whole is now five 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:37.840
 times and then he would have to be refresh 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.290
 or be charged because I had yes 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.990
 said unloaded and then wlan euro so 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:46.200
 loading and the land would be the last point 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.520
 and then the battery would be full 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.650
 Of course it will take forever now 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.000
 long the good is the device results 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.120
 signals when it is full if that 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.530
 At the end of the program he is self-employed 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.050
 lurking with him that's just fine 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.910
 I once had the problem that I have one 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.980
 older charger had and me earlier 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.810
 so that has shot a few batteries 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.730
 then really that good German the space 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.680
 are and then the solvia is battery 

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.540
 has leaked and really i had 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.370
 then something like the fire holes carpet 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.520
 that should be the running is that can hereby 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.230
 no longer happens with this device 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.400
 if you have if you have questions or if 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.560
 you think the device is good you can yes 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.720
 leave a comment because if you want 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.800
 I can also make video over again 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.030
 the individual programs because that is 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.910
 that would really be the frame 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:30.250
 go beyond explaining everything that we do 

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.960
 first the charger as I said so 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.420
 china anodized is a super thing so 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.920
 I think the thing really pretty 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.980
 that makes a good deco on the 

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.560
 table and that means only before the 

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:44.650
 charger and from me and I hope so 

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.730
 fallen video day and see you 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.230
 then at the next video I have there 

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.230
 So then bye bye
