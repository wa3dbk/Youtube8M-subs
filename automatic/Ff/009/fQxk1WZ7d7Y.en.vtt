00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
little bit more about discharge and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.139

games<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.899> game<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.530> i<00:00:52.710> think<00:00:53.070> ciale<00:00:53.340> geez

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
games the game one so i think ciale geez

why<00:00:53.910> advantage<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.539> Spartans<00:00:55.350> large<00:00:55.860> champion

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
why advantage is Spartans large champion

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.119 
why advantage is Spartans large champion
pool<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.699> they<00:00:57.270> were<00:00:57.390> able<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:58.010> counter<00:00:59.010> your

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
pool and they were able to counter your

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.650 
pool and they were able to counter your
top<00:00:59.280> laner<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.670> get<00:00:59.940> advantage<00:01:00.210> from<00:01:00.449> that

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
top laner and get advantage from that

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.689 
top laner and get advantage from that
and<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.079> game<00:01:01.289> one<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.710> think<00:01:02.039> Jason<00:01:02.190> got<00:01:02.489> Auto

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
and a game one I think Jason got Auto

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.179 
and a game one I think Jason got Auto
drops<00:01:02.969> super<00:01:03.329> hard<00:01:03.510> because<00:01:03.920> ERISA<00:01:04.920> you

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
drops super hard because ERISA you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.560 
drops super hard because ERISA you
should<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.430> able<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.760> use<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.210> ninja<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
should be able to use it as a ninja to

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.120 
should be able to use it as a ninja to
last<00:01:06.780> week<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> top<00:01:07.229> laner<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:07.950> last

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
pick the milliner which gives an account

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.219 
pick the milliner which gives an account
back<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> Nara<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.850> lost<00:01:12.659> again<00:01:12.930> and

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
back to the Nara and lost again and

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.750 
back to the Nara and lost again and
again<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.799> right<00:01:13.950> now<00:01:13.979> design<00:01:14.369> just<00:01:14.490> quite

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
again to you right now design just quite

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.520 
again to you right now design just quite
a<00:01:14.790> different<00:01:15.210> kind<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.390> pic<00:01:15.540> again<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.200> just

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
a different kind of pic again and just

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.770 
a different kind of pic again and just
again<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.310> i<00:01:17.340> want<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:17.759> if<00:01:17.970> TSM<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.570> do<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
again so i want to see if TSM can do a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.060 
again so i want to see if TSM can do a
change<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.350> pantech<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.830> chemistry

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
change in the pantech in the chemistry

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.429 
change in the pantech in the chemistry
yeah<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.970> because<00:01:21.090> they<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.780> darshan<00:01:22.110> with

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
yeah and because they have darshan with

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.260 
yeah and because they have darshan with
this<00:01:22.560> gigantic<00:01:23.100> champion<00:01:23.580> pool<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.880> top<00:01:24.060> lane

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
this gigantic champion pool the top lane

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.300 
this gigantic champion pool the top lane
for<00:01:24.479> zion<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.439> allows<00:01:25.710> them<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.920> run<00:01:26.070> triple

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
for zion that allows them to run triple

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.219 
for zion that allows them to run triple
threat<00:01:26.640> compositions<00:01:27.180> consistently<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
threat compositions consistently and

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.630 
threat compositions consistently and
that's<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.439> huge<00:01:28.770> things<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.159> takes<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.460> stress

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
that's a huge things it takes the stress

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.120 
that's a huge things it takes the stress
off<00:01:29.820> double<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.509> pentakill<00:01:31.020> he<00:01:31.200> got<00:01:31.439> was

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
off double if that pentakill he got was

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.890 
off double if that pentakill he got was
largely<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.909> part<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> fact<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.750> you

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
largely in part of the fact that if you

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.749 
largely in part of the fact that if you
