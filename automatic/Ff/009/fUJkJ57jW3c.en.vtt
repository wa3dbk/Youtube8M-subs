00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.530
 hello everyone I'm 709 and I bring you a 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.349
 informative video about the five 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.790
 guardians george jones has been very 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.980
 open with the changes that will be made 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.380
 to the five guardians of the details 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.330
 smaller ones like for example removed 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.160
 the music when you wait for land 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.830
 appearance to new servers 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.619
 Dedicated specifically for games 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.880
 Customized practically a summary 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.070
 changes axle and the five 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.530
 guardians that have not been announced in 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.920
 bulletins or articles but in different 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.510
 community forums changes and details 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.600
 of matchmaking leaves the five guardians 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.270
 have been given in various georges forums 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.670
 pons clarified matchmaking will be weighted 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.770
 towards parties first parties 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.200
 that is, players who entered to play with 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.719
 a team of its own , however, will not be 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.789
 a hard and fast rule since you have to 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.829
 be balanced against the times of 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.899
 search so the preference will be 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.250
 there in the code but depending on 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.500
 available population 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.229
 the players actively looking at the 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.630
 moment of the game your case is different 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.729
 in short you feel to play online 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.710
 with a group of friends is more likely 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.210
 that you play against other groups instead 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.909
 of players who go like wolves 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.159
 solitary and also works vice versa 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.320
 georg added will be balanced or what 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.570
 otherwise you could search forever without 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.220
 find a compatible player thanks 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.799
 to the player population in this 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.049
 list of games but it will probably be 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.270
 more rigid by the range and may vary 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.820
 according to the level of opponents and 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.740
 yours in a few words if there is a low 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.659
 rate of online players could 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.329
 quite affect the internal system in 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.110
 march making on the other hand they shared 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.900
 a little more 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.080
 the gameplay changes of the game 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.090
 jones shared we gave a slight delay 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.430
 in the backpack propellant since it is 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.500
 sudden and unpredictable you do not know 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.480
 when one is going to use it, we want to give the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.910
 opposing player as a fraction of 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.460
 second to read the play and react 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.320
 if you are an expert it is enough that 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.570
 You can see your opponent when he starts 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.429
 use the backpack you can read the address 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.720
 that is moving and you adjust for 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.970
 make the shot in the head for the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.820
 killing the delay is very slight for 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.290
 important to maintain balance 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.330
 george jones also talked about the maps 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.700
 the changes will make the flow of 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.260
 maps is more predictable for those 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.900
 rooms that have too many 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.850
 points of entry or exit we found 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.590
 that the porosity of the room 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.110
 he did during too many rounds of attack 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.790
 or escape the changes will improve the 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.160
 approach and the flow of time that 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.110
 preserve the character of the map in a few 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.850
 words many of the maps will have 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.370
 small changes within several 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.370
 rooms so many opponents do not 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.750
 they have so many escape routes finally 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.880
 but something interesting 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.800
 georg finally said we decided to remove 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.300
 the music when you're waiting for your 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.380
 reappearance according to criticism 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.480
 constructive 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.720
 It was very annoying and it reminded you that 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.970
 you died something that is very necessary these 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.980
 small details changes are a bit 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.990
 interesting but not as interesting as 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.910
 the dedicated servers if not what 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.370
 you know and the five guardians will have 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.720
 dedicated servers in match make in the 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.790
 which allows you to play against others 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.740
 players around the world with a 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.320
 level of balanced connection next to 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.780
 them is to say there should not be much the 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.940
 good even though they are news that already 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.860
 We knew about george a while ago 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.050
 jones added not long ago that the 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.150
 Custom games will also have 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.410
 your own dedicated servers without 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.120
 mention that you can choose the 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.620
 servers that you want for your 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.230
 online experience both in 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.090
 matchmaking as in customized to the 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.800
 final what do you think of these changes 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.960
 remember to leave a comment about it 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.880
 since these changes and with the new 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.950
 information about the servers 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.030
 I would say that we are on track for 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.090
 now 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.430
 by the way employees of 343 shared 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.230
 a page in tumblr with the phrase house 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.510
 the truth has an accountant and 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.520
 apparently something will happen this Sunday 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.319
 I will not talk about it until it comes out 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.790
 have to leave since it is not worth the 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.220
 sorry to make a video talking about this 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.440
 specifically it is a page with a 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.080
 counter and I will not do theories with 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.670
 a single good image make sure 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.500
 check the channel for more content 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.170
 leave it and subscribe if you have not done it 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.180
 I'm an advisor 9 and see you in the next 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.180
