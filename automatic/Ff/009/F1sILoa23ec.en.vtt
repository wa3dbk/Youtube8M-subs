we're gonna put ten peanut butter cups
making<00:01:11.130> one<00:01:11.430> layer<00:01:12.290> now<00:01:13.290> we're<00:01:13.470> going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.650> top

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
making one layer now we're going to top

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.289 
making one layer now we're going to top
this<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.400> marshmallows<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:14.970> I've<00:01:15.180> already

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
this with marshmallows and I've already

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.120 
this with marshmallows and I've already
cut<00:01:15.450> them<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.869> half<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.619> reason<00:01:17.009> why<00:01:17.100> we

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
cut them in half now the reason why we

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.310 
cut them in half now the reason why we
do<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.759> because<00:01:17.880> if<00:01:18.540> we<00:01:18.689> put<00:01:18.720> an<00:01:18.990> entire

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
do this is because if we put an entire

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.080 
do this is because if we put an entire
marshmallow<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:19.979> top<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.549> top<00:01:20.729> would<00:01:20.880> burn

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
marshmallow on top the top would burn

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.700 
marshmallow on top the top would burn
but<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:21.689> everything<00:01:21.960> else<00:01:22.200> wouldn't<00:01:22.530> melt

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
but then everything else wouldn't melt

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.070 
but then everything else wouldn't melt
so<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.610> helps<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.030> give<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.330> perfect<00:01:24.840> ratio

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
so this helps it give that perfect ratio

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.679 
so this helps it give that perfect ratio
I<00:01:25.619> love<00:01:26.549> s'mores<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.119> much<00:01:27.299> because<00:01:27.600> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
I love s'mores so much because it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.969 
I love s'mores so much because it
reminds<00:01:27.990> me<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.200> going<00:01:28.290> camping<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:28.799> my
