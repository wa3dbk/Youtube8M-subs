high point reach hardpoints work as

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.730 
high point reach hardpoints work as
before<00:03:18.210> revealing<00:03:18.540> contents<00:03:19.140> for<00:03:19.290> location

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
before revealing contents for location

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.010 
before revealing contents for location
but<00:03:20.490> as<00:03:20.610> an<00:03:20.760> added<00:03:21.090> feature<00:03:21.120> now<00:03:21.750> they<00:03:21.900> are

but as an added feature now they are
also<00:03:22.170> fast<00:03:22.590> travel<00:03:22.830> points

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.460 

so<00:03:33.940> now<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.270> we're<00:03:34.390> back<00:03:34.420> in<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.840> ocean<00:03:34.990> we
