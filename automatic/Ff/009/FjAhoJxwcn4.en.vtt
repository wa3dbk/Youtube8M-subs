mcdonald that's going to give you 24
grams<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.140> protein<00:01:40.340> now<00:01:41.340> let's<00:01:41.549> shape<00:01:41.729> now

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
grams of protein now let's shape now

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.210 
grams of protein now let's shape now
let's<00:01:42.479> take<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:43.229> think<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:43.710> six<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.100> eight

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
let's take a I think it's six to eight

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.399 
let's take a I think it's six to eight
ounces<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.759> chicken<00:01:44.909> breast<00:01:45.270> that's<00:01:46.140> going<00:01:46.320> to

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
ounces of chicken breast that's going to

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
also give you 24 grams of protein so you

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.670 
also give you 24 grams of protein so you
guys<00:01:50.610> are<00:01:50.820> going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.030> seriously<00:01:51.509> sit<00:01:52.500> there

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
protein you're getting from the 12 piece

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.260 
protein you're getting from the 12 piece
chicken<00:01:57.450> nugget<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.740> same<00:01:59.040> exact<00:01:59.790> protein

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
chicken nugget is the same exact protein

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.300 
chicken nugget is the same exact protein
you're<00:02:00.420> putting<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.780> your<00:02:00.810> body<00:02:00.899> as<00:02:01.380> the

chicken breast it's not true so that's

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.580 
chicken breast it's not true so that's

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
taking it to the extreme right there

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.410 
taking it to the extreme right there
it's<00:02:11.190> taken<00:02:11.459> probably<00:02:11.730> one<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.270> best

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
it's taken probably one of the best

of<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.330> poaching<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.319> can<00:02:14.440> get<00:02:14.620> respond<00:02:15.099> the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
of a poaching you can get respond the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.339 
of a poaching you can get respond the
worst<00:02:15.430> right<00:02:15.790> fast<00:02:16.120> food<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.660> think<00:02:17.140> they<00:02:17.230> make

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
worst right fast food I think they make

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
their chicken nuggets out of like this

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.880 
their chicken nuggets out of like this
pink<00:02:19.030> paste<00:02:19.390> I'll<00:02:19.959> put<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.230> picture<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.739> I

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
pink paste I'll put a picture of it I

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.160 
pink paste I'll put a picture of it I
watched<00:02:21.160> this<00:02:21.310> little<00:02:21.610> video<00:02:21.760> on<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.030> but<00:02:22.959> um

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
watched this little video on that but um

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.199 
watched this little video on that but um
so<00:02:23.860> that's<00:02:24.069> taken<00:02:24.310> into<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.580> extreme<00:02:24.970> and

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
so that's taken into the extreme and

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.420 
so that's taken into the extreme and
that<00:02:25.330> proves<00:02:25.599> my<00:02:25.750> part<00:02:26.019> right<00:02:26.110> there<00:02:26.140> if<00:02:26.500> if<00:02:27.220> it

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
that proves my part right there if if it

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.430 
that proves my part right there if if it
fits<00:02:27.610> your<00:02:27.730> macros<00:02:27.849> works<00:02:28.510> then<00:02:28.989> why<00:02:29.200> doesn't

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
fits your macros works then why doesn't

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.110 
fits your macros works then why doesn't
work<00:02:29.680> there<00:02:29.890> because<00:02:30.519> that's<00:02:30.640> taken<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.030> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
work there because that's taken to the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.650 
work there because that's taken to the
extreme<00:02:31.180> so<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.840> means<00:02:32.049> that<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:34.269> can<00:02:34.390> apply

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
extreme so it means that you can apply

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.820 
extreme so it means that you can apply
that<00:02:34.989> theory<00:02:35.349> across<00:02:36.010> all<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:37.000> foods<00:02:37.239> right

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
that theory across all the foods right

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.740 
that theory across all the foods right
even<00:02:38.830> not<00:02:39.549> even<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.030> extreme<00:02:40.330> if<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.569> take

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
even not even to the extreme if you take

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.979 
even not even to the extreme if you take
soy<00:02:40.989> protein<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:43.150> known<00:02:43.569> to<00:02:43.870> increase

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
soy protein that is known to increase

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.920 
soy protein that is known to increase
like<00:02:44.470> estrogen<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:45.760> stuff<00:02:46.090> like<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.269> it's

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
like estrogen and stuff like that it's

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.240 
like estrogen and stuff like that it's
not<00:02:47.079> as<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.230> guys<00:02:47.410> like<00:02:47.530> whey<00:02:47.709> protein<00:02:48.099> for

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
not as you guys like whey protein for

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.479 
not as you guys like whey protein for
example<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:49.269> oh<00:02:49.829> and<00:02:50.829> another<00:02:51.130> good<00:02:51.340> example
