00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 so welcome skating oliver sarah den 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.770
 I hope you have subscribed to channel 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.170
 already in the backstage area of 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.440
 new you will find more videos you 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.000
 only there will find very special 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.800
 techniques and be effective 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.670
 We want to continue with respect to 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.230
 easy contact intermediate not beginner 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.420
 In between and there I would like to 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.699
 mistakes we are already often on the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.010
 foot care received but im 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.019
 I want to connect with the fight 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.329
 show you again the disadvantages 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.370
 and the possibilities combine well 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.230
 more capable does not mean that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.700
 it really made the other of us that 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.629
 the other from the spring of the plate 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.710
 that means you actually grow that 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.899
 stood by the opponent unsettled that 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.340
 works with both feet can with 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.530
 Both legs we make the mistake 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.750
 stay tuned that was just that 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.219
 accomplish with the front foot 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.079
 if, for example, yours 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.210
 fight position so or here in 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.840
 Europe already means that 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.210
 actually 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.939
 here is no way down what 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.380
 here we are always looking forward 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.220
 back and while the experienced became 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.900
 struggling with footpath that is deceiving namely 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.640
 it would have to be taken just as well 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.110
 do we fight in the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.229
 videos with technology like that never said 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.369
 but film always works upwards 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.369
 look forward look 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.800
 they receive 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.800
 the eyes do not reveal what she's up to 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.770
 you get that very briefly unsettled 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.340
 that they looked down anyway 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.570
 still seen what she's up to 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.820
 except not so much fought but me 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.720
 have seen directly what just luck you 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.640
 did it 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.550
 Of course, that's how you read the course 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.270
 opponents but that was not the mistake 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.190
 short of accommodation can be upstairs 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.100
 on my shoulders but on the 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.619
 moment I have my balance 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.540
 lost and the goal is always champions 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.119
 bring the opponent out of balance 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.700
 and gut blow to otherwise it is 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.500
 difficult to meet when in the 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.420
 balance it is very difficult to 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.380
 bring muslim out of balance 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.220
 that's just another mistake 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.230
 now you can follow the back 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.560
 Of course, nice stupid of me can read 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.200
 I there so knock me well but I 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.300
 I wanted to practice how to do the mistake 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.250
 best with the eye contact above 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.780
 stay 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.570
 The important thing in the four years is the one in the 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.269
 tvfilm foot is actually the 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.730
 make up for soccer 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:40.660
 as opposed to the im could of the 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.190
 opponent foot one says antonia missing on 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.350
 Protector itself one still has the 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.570
 Protect the shooter you are allowed to 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.940
 just not in the balance and no 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.970
 fall into the knees but kick 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.820
 stay on foot and then you have the 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.320
 greatest possible lever in the exercise 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.490
 that looks like we are moving 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.690
 quite round 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.690
 then shortly before me 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.450
 it can be natural to live on 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.989
 nursing approaches, the other is watching 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.580
 with full weight on it has two 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.340
 consequences 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.170
 Either I can do it or he can do it 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.299
 It does not just stop and laugh 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.769
 will break if I can do it on 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.840
 any case unsettled 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.840
 sometimes normal 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.450
 after getting the error with extreme 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.190
 has been swept there is not more 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.210
 a lot with or enough 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.250
 Clever react 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.860
 You just have to see what they are 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.620
 Cover up and that as well as possible 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.760
 to get back out of there is named after 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.730
 yes, these errors in the combination with 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.000
 The punch is a measure that can 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.250
 you do not have to save a lot of coalition 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.840
 do a lot of things, why assure the opponent and 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.600
 beats him perfect blue as well 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.480
 of the whole country unfortunately is at 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.169
 light contact the sweeper often not 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.460
 I think belongs with it makes 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.640
 the package completely 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.830
 you always have to top down it's like low 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.230
 kicks are missing the low kicks is missing 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.260
 Package kickboxing just belong easy 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.140
 with this is the complete fight 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.630
 announced kickboxing not unnecessary yet 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:42.110
 abbreviate as already done in numerous ways 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.460
 so practicing is more capable 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.590
 push this short forward with in 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.870
 panic many open up 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.040
 possibilities with the capable further 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.020
 combination room 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.960
 I've put together again 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.630
 and set up in the backstage area 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.550
 kickbox it.de already knows you 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.910
 can you see exactly what is going on again 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.040
 something more with your finger 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.560
 can i realize and how can i 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.040
 very good 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.710
 you've heard everything so far 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.720
 think about the next technique for you 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.060
 equal contact fight but we see 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.060
 us together
