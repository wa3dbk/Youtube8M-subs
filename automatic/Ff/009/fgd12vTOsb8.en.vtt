00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 good morning omniscient basti 98 h 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.180
 Write me why is my power like that 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.760
 successful now this is one 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.170
 interesting question what the 98 have a yes 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.000
 video about minecraft that's the best 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.330
 Game of the world minecraft is pretty much 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.369
 the worst game in the world that 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.439
 Gameplay is extremely simple the graphics 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.279
 is expressed benevolently 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.420
 minimalist and because it is in java 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.699
 it is probably written 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.410
 Also on a laser shoot the turbo 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.960
 computer from the future not yet 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.429
 run smoothly but the worst is 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.140
 that minecraft is actually a 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.480
 Sandbox game is where it comes from 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.309
 is going to create your own world but 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.840
 are just about to build this world 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.579
 one with the rough blocks at those 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.290
 You often need a lot of imagination to get started 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.820
 recognize what should constitute at all 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.559
 only very few possibilities for 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.059
 disposal is already so look at it 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.829
 minecraft quite nice crap there 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.570
 many games of this year the very 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.039
 much more design options 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.870
 but still offering is 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.129
 minecraft so successful but why 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.579
 People are even playing this 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.350
 scrap metal 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.899
 oh what should I go call now 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.000
 Duty gamble now the answer to this 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.770
 question is actually relatively easy 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.930
 People like to play minecraft so much 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.909
 because you are so limited in his 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.560
 opportunities is, we assume you were 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.180
 Almighty and could alone force 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.979
 your thoughts a house exactly after 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.450
 Build his ideas then that would be 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.369
 but it would be pretty cool too 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.320
 be bored quickly against it 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.880
 to build a dream home just out of rough 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.710
 Blocks with a very limited 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.479
 number of shapes colors is one 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.400
 quite a challenge and needs 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.380
 a lot of creativity is usually there 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.479
 but just these restrictions 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.790
 our creativity mill in mind 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.710
 Only properly throw the artist phil 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.810
 Hansen, for example, can because of a 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.310
 Nerve suffering no straight lines 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.259
 do not draw the best 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.090
 requirements for an artist though 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.070
 a lot of hansen has found again despite 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.560
 to create this restriction of art 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.780
 for example, only by locking 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.570
 Krankl talk painted huge paintings 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.950
 or just pics out sometime 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.360
 Much realized that it was just this 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.159
 challenge with his 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.079
 limited possibilities to art 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.060
 that was him on such creative creations 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.040
 ideas and he started to get new ones 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.420
 to consider other restrictions like 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.430
 for example, a portrait 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.750
 Only with karate now beat 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.189
 may say hansen has a bit 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.390
 exaggerated when he started art too 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.160
 create the exclusively 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.050
 spat out measured and one 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.940
 paintings that just dropped off and 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.680
 discarded norio halves composed 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.450
 has also been little of perfection 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.370
 an albrecht dÃ¼rer but the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.470
 hansen has brought a challenge to it 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.570
 new creative ways to go a bit 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.370
 so it is with minecraft the houses 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.780
 cathedrals and palaces you look at 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.280
 Building there will never be perfect 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.960
 but look at it with the limited ones 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.850
 you have as good as possible 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.830
 that requires a lot 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.450
 creativity and creativity 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.950
 many people just really fun 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.360
 by the way, himself in his 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.980
 options is limited 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.600
 now a popular technique 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.550
 many creatives around her 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.780
 to stimulate one's own creativity as well 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.880
 the reasons why I set myself 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.500
 I have two videos a week to make me 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.300
 of course know that these videos in the 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.410
 short of time does not become perfect 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.940
 but i can search the 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.710
 challenge for an old one 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.870
 creativity mill again a bit 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.340
 to crank up two videos a week 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.930
 is a bit like minecraft 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.370
 I can play what minecraft can do 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.200
 play along what are you doing here me 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.490
 Do you think you've got a call of duty? 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.570
 but yes I have the other players 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.160
 kicked me out when I started 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.750
 I have cartridge belts and old ones 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.410
 Part of a redstone circuit 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.730
 down 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.900
 then let's have a round minecraft 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:16.220
 zocken crap why is that 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.220
 framerate again so low
