and<00:01:09.900> directly<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.770> could<00:01:11.040> control<00:01:11.580> focus<00:01:12.210> you

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
and directly you could control focus you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.020 
and directly you could control focus you
could<00:01:12.810> control<00:01:13.140> iris<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.070> camera<00:01:14.430> while

it's up in the sky on a drone using this

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.070 
it's up in the sky on a drone using this
port<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.729> that's<00:01:18.090> really<00:01:18.479> cool<00:01:18.840> that's

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
port and that's really cool that's

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.360 
port and that's really cool that's
something<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.500> GoPro<00:01:19.650> doesn't<00:01:20.159> allow<00:01:20.310> you

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
something that GoPro doesn't allow you

something that GoPro doesn't allow you
to<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:22.229> that's<00:01:22.350> why<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:23.010> more

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250

totally different purposes for studios

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.950 
totally different purposes for studios
this<00:01:37.830> is<00:01:37.950> literally<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.940> smallest<00:01:39.150> studio

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
this is literally the smallest studio

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.380 
this is literally the smallest studio
camera<00:01:40.380> I've<00:01:40.530> ever<00:01:40.740> seen<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.760> can<00:01:41.910> do<00:01:42.000> live

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
camera I've ever seen so you can do live

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.690 
camera I've ever seen so you can do live
at<00:01:42.690> studio<00:01:42.990> 4k<00:01:43.440> with<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:44.040> something<00:01:44.280> that

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
at studio 4k with with something that

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.730 
at studio 4k with with something that

you can fit in your pocket essentially

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.890 
you can fit in your pocket essentially
so<00:01:47.070> instead<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.370> having<00:01:47.580> remote<00:01:48.360> operations

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
so instead of having remote operations

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.690 
so instead of having remote operations
like<00:01:49.050> the<00:01:49.200> micro<00:01:49.560> cinema<00:01:50.100> camera<00:01:50.370> has<00:01:50.520> this

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
like the micro cinema camera has this

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.760

has<00:01:50.940> studio<00:01:51.480> operations<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.260> got<00:01:52.440> a<00:01:52.470> tally

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
has studio operations it's got a tally

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.770 
has studio operations it's got a tally
lamp<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.340> got<00:01:53.550> built-in<00:01:53.910> mics<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.600> got

built-in<00:01:55.110> color<00:01:55.440> correction<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.310> has<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> lot

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
built-in color correction it has a lot

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.649 
built-in color correction it has a lot
of<00:01:56.760> those<00:01:57.000> things

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
of those things

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.050 
of those things
would<00:01:57.780> find<00:01:58.079> on<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.499> bulky<00:01:58.979> large<00:01:59.219> video<00:01:59.490> camera

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
