00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.630 
table let's say this is the edge of the
table<00:01:08.280> right<00:01:08.670> here<00:01:10.010> my<00:01:11.010> deck<00:01:11.250> was<00:01:11.430> here<00:01:12.470> my

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
table right here my deck was here my

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.790 
table right here my deck was here my
graveyard<00:01:14.640> was<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.720> my<00:01:15.780> synchros<00:01:16.530> were

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
graveyard was here and my synchros were

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.219 
graveyard was here and my synchros were
actually<00:01:17.400> right<00:01:18.120> next<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.979> my<00:01:19.979> graveyard<00:01:21.229> now

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.050 
actually right next to my graveyard now
they<00:01:22.500> were<00:01:22.560> facedown<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.880> probably

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
they were facedown but this is probably

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.460 
they were facedown but this is probably
the<00:01:24.420> third<00:01:24.780> game<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.229> was<00:01:25.260> playing

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the third game that I was playing

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.080 
the third game that I was playing
against<00:01:25.920> my<00:01:26.070> opponent<00:01:26.190> so<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.700> had<00:01:26.940> already

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
against my opponent so I had already

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.010 
against my opponent so I had already
synchros<00:01:27.840> many<00:01:28.110> many<00:01:28.350> synchros<00:01:28.860> already<00:01:29.190> and

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
synchros many many synchros already and

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.540 
synchros many many synchros already and
i<00:01:31.020> left<00:01:31.320> my<00:01:31.470> synchros<00:01:31.860> down<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:32.490> this

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
so that my opponent doesn't know exactly

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.650 
so that my opponent doesn't know exactly
which<00:01:34.619> synchros<00:01:35.130> I'm<00:01:36.090> going<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.330> be<00:01:36.390> bringing

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
reason being people start saying that

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.069 
reason being people start saying that
you<00:04:06.280> have<00:04:06.489> a<00:04:06.519> lot<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.790> nice<00:04:07.120> cards<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.780> lot<00:04:07.930> of

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
you have a lot of nice cards a lot of

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.159 
you have a lot of nice cards a lot of
expensive<00:04:08.889> cards<00:04:09.690> they're<00:04:10.690> going<00:04:10.840> to<00:04:10.930> want<00:04:11.019> to

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
expensive cards they're going to want to

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.170 
expensive cards they're going to want to
take<00:04:11.290> them<00:04:11.500> that's<00:04:12.099> just<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.519> nature<00:04:12.730> of<00:04:12.910> the

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
take them that's just the nature of the

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.140 
take them that's just the nature of the
way<00:04:13.329> things<00:04:13.810> are<00:04:14.139> out<00:04:14.200> here<00:04:15.000> unfortunately<00:04:16.000> it

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
way things are out here unfortunately it

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.460 
way things are out here unfortunately it
does<00:04:16.359> happen<00:04:17.519> so<00:04:18.519> what<00:04:18.940> I<00:04:18.970> would<00:04:19.090> say<00:04:19.419> is<00:04:19.630> keep

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
does happen so what I would say is keep

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.990 
does happen so what I would say is keep
the<00:04:20.530> cards<00:04:20.950> in<00:04:21.039> the<00:04:21.099> deck<00:04:21.130> box<00:04:21.549> they<00:04:21.820> don't

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
the cards in the deck box they don't

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.190 
the cards in the deck box they don't
know<00:04:22.120> exactly<00:04:22.539> what<00:04:22.720> you<00:04:22.840> have

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
know exactly what you have

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.810 
know exactly what you have
so<00:04:23.860> therefore<00:04:24.070> they're<00:04:24.340> not<00:04:24.490> going<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.670> bother

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
so therefore they're not going to bother

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.070 
so therefore they're not going to bother
you<00:04:25.060> now<00:04:25.900> with<00:04:26.410> your<00:04:26.440> deck<00:04:27.130> itself<00:04:28.080> while
