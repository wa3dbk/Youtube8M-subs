00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.680
 beautiful all the guys here is known and 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.810
 I'm here today with a special video that 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.550
 it's not video games per se but 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.740
 it's a very peripheral 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.090
 interesting to be able to play anyway 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.299
 video that is the keyboard 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.070
 quickfire tk of the master cooler that i 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.650
 has been kindly sent to do so 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.510
 review this keyboard e 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.820
 very recommended for playing gods 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.410
 games like maybe fps like games in 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.930
 which do not need a large number of 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.869
 keys because as we can see from the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.500
 images this keyboard is 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.480
 characterized by being a lot 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.820
 compact as we also see the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.710
 numeric keypad is compact 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.030
 together with the darts then the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.860
 keyboard as you can see a lot 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.870
 small little bulky and this 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.070
 surely it is a point to his advantage 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.899
 it is certainly not recommended for 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.870
 pg memories though if you have to play a fps 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.520
 and certainly very comfortable but before 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.960
 go to the reason why this 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.030
 keyboard is very comfortable from the point of 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.890
 view of pressing the keys vi 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.570
 I show features that 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.910
 allow you to have even more 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.699
 comfort with regard to space 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.909
 in fact, as you see the cable at 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.159
 canala tour and where it can be 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.439
 arranged to avoid cluttering the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.950
 your desk and among other things cable is 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.409
 covered in rope and therefore even more 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.799
 sure you avoid ruining it and stuff 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.900
 gender 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.490
 then the keyboard of the two risers like 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.890
 any normal keyboard this 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.049
 keyboard is also backlit 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.750
 this means that it has LEDs in this 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.880
 red case behind the keys that allow 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.020
 to illuminate maybe when you are at 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.350
 dark so you can better see the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.270
 keyboard with function key fn la in 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.549
 low you can get different 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.170
 features different functions precisely 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.090
 of the keyboard for example you can 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.880
 change the arrangement of the lights 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.920
 you can only illuminate the vst keys 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.509
 in order to play comfortably we can 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.640
 change the intensity of light we can 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.869
 change many modes then 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.210
 we can adjust ourselves or better 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.040
 we want as you can just see with 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.860
 the fn key is also activated 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.170
 the f12 key which in its function is 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.939
 that of disabling the windows keys of 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.130
 weeks the windows keys we will have the 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.600
 possibility to avoid these 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.819
 annoy during the game 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.800
 now instead we pass to the component 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.180
 physical component 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.320
 physics regarding the feeling 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.450
 as you can see with this 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.580
 particular contraption that will now come to you 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.260
 shown you can remove keys 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.870
 so you can replace them so you can 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.580
 Clean the keyboard once it is removed 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.360
 the key we can see that what 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.970
 it's underneath 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.220
 is a mechanical switch peculiarity of 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.560
 this keyboard that makes it comfortable 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.810
 pressing the button does not force the 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.850
 finger and above all it is a characteristic 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.500
 which makes it much longer lasting 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.560
 the keyboard unlike the grommets that 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.090
 they have a much more limited duration here 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.950
 boys we have reached the end of 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.540
 review this keyboard i will there 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.770
 i highly recommend i hope i didn't 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.870
 swallowed indeed I hope to have 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.190
 the intrigued thank you again for the cooler 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.840
 master for giving me the opportunity to 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.430
 try this keyboard we feel the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.430
 next nice review
