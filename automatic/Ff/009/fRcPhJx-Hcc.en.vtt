ax it's got it basically it's a it's a

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.550 
ax it's got it basically it's a it's a
really<00:02:06.240> pretty<00:02:06.570> interface<00:02:06.990> sitting<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.380> top

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
really pretty interface sitting on top

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.350 
really pretty interface sitting on top
of<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> bsd<00:02:08.129> core<00:02:08.429> which<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.819> variation<00:02:09.149> of

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
of the bsd core which is a variation of

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.630 
of the bsd core which is a variation of
unix

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
unix

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.940 
unix
and<00:02:10.970> but<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.360> lot<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.510> people<00:02:11.630> just<00:02:11.960> like<00:02:12.050> the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
and but a lot of people just like the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.260 
and but a lot of people just like the
way<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.220> operating<00:02:13.580> system<00:02:13.850> deals<00:02:14.060> in<00:02:14.180> the

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
way the operating system deals in the

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.430 
way the operating system deals in the
fact<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.690> takes<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:14.959> lot<00:02:15.080> of<00:02:15.110> work<00:02:15.260> to

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
fact that it takes a lot of work to

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.250 
fact that it takes a lot of work to
crash<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:15.920> usually<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:17.330> with<00:02:17.540> vista<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:17.930> think

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
crash it usually and with vista I think

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.050 
crash it usually and with vista I think
Vista<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:18.770> ticked<00:02:19.160> off<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.370> lot<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.760> people<00:02:19.880> in
