00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.780
 this is how you see a plant 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.280
 craft to produce lyre and now 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.750
 we will go to explain what are the 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.090
 main phases of the process 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.470
 verification of the first phase precisely 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.160
 that of the grinding of the logical 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.880
 then the barley will be ground then 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.439
 reduced 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.470
 the track grains will be reduced 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.000
 crushed and will come later 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.899
 put inside this pot that 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.250
 the mesh pot in which is wounded 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.940
 the process of the exhibition will take place 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.100
 or the barley put into the water a 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.039
 certain temperatures will cause the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.140
 enzymes that are inside the grain 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.350
 will go to turn friends for 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.120
 kiko himself in sugars now let's say that 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.309
 inside the match we have two types 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.339
 of different temperatures inside the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.410
 which work together different and in 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.570
 this case of beckham cases and alpha 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.000
 those targeted amylases are beta 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.350
 enzymes that work in the range that goes 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.150
 roughly from 60 to 67 serious and they are 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.740
 so that they produce sugars 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.720
 simple or sugars that will come 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.430
 then attached to the yeast and processed 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.710
 in arc from 66 to 74 degrees instead 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.170
 they work the alpha amylases or those 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.020
 enzymes that produce sugars 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.810
 complexes that will not be transformed 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.800
 from yeast and which will then bring 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.710
 will make a contribution for what 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.500
 concerns the body of the beer 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.110
 finished the amortization process that 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.450
 occurs with the verification with the test 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.659
 of iodine or a part of the must 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.159
 is taken and is mixed with della 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.740
 iodine tincture and iodine tincture 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.440
 by binding to the hooks of one colors this 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.180
 means that if the iodine is colored are 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.430
 still present years from within the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.649
 of the must and therefore still the donkeys 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.360
 they must finish their jobs if this 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.090
 iodine is not colored then the mash 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.200
 machine in this case is finished and yes 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.530
 move to another phase 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.480
 el meshad or water 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.239
 of amortization is made one 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.880
 temperature of 78 graves where exactly 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.970
 enzymes are inhibited and then passed 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.090
 extraction of mars extract 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.040
 or inside this pot 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.650
 there is a filter 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.180
 that just extracts only the liquid and that 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.010
 it will end up in this pot then 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.319
 it is called a boiler or pot 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.409
 where it will happen 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.180
 but the crush of beer is effective while 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.540
 this extraction was said yes 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.340
 they continue to wash the three b's and they are 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.680
 that is, logics remaining the inter has one 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.120
 pot with sparse water but 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.340
 this land 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.659
 this water even if at 78 degrees it serves 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.069
 just to wash so don't go 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.140
 go get the ones that are 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.940
 substances left inside 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.580
 the temper of the match and also maintain 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.590
 the temperature 78 severe and causing that 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.990
 the enzymes remain the mythical ones 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.330
 from the extraction we pass to the true cup 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.940
 and precisely during the quota that can 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.580
 be 60 or 90 minutes 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.819
 luperi i are usually added 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.379
 hops according to the time is at the time 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.060
 of boiling will provide some 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.909
 different characteristics to drink in 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.790
 how much wolf discharged at the beginning ie 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.749
 at the beginning of 90 minutes of crush 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.030
 will have a contribution for what 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:30.859
 regards the marvel had of lupoli 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.200
 instead they will be added in 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.760
 last 20 10 minutes they will give a 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.709
 report regarding Rome 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.810
 of life 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.349
 once this process is finished, we move on 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.810
 to the centrifugation of the beer that is 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.950
 beer as far as extracted anyway 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.840
 inside still contains some 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.659
 dust the remains of wolves arrest of 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.689
 today for which a centrifuge is made 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:55.250
 approximately 15 minutes which causes 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.889
 all the substances that are still in 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.319
 suspension inside the must go 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.629
 to position itself in the center and at the bottom 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.129
 of the short pot or the 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.169
 boiler 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.730
 done this 20 15 months the beer goes 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:10.329
 made to sing twenty minutes 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.230
 precisely to make these these 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.169
 this swirls ports of all 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.690
 substances in suspension and below 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.470
 after which we move on to 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.180
 cooling was alive through one 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.520
 heat exchanger us in this case 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.530
 we have a copper coil and therefore 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.120
 put in a fermenter placed in 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.889
 fermenter then brought one 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.800
 temperature of 100 degrees of cooked a 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.110
 desired temperature which depends on 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.620
 brewer 's yeast that you do 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.560
 precisely there is added the yeast and then 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.640
 put the beer in fermentation 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.460
 then this is our system 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.460
 braked or is an exchanger of 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.490
 heat inside which there are two 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.630
 liquids that go flow encounter 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.910
 or beer 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.980
 from the tent the boiler is transferred 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.340
 and enter inside this tube 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.690
 this copper of this copper tube is the 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.550
 turn inside a tube of 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.460
 rubber then inside the tube of 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.760
 copper enter will open central while 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.830
 inside the meeting hose rubber 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.000
 flow then your down the water enters a 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.190
 room temperature 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.380
 this means this causes the water 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.280
 enter at room temperature and succeed from 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.910
 here at 100 degrees 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.040
 beer and including 100 degrees and exit 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.840
 from here directly into the fermenter 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.300
 at the temperature from us of yes from me 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.840
 desired and this is the operation 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.300
 of our cooling 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.500
 fermentation therefore usually for 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.590
 regarding our always the 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.350
 let's keep from 10 to 14 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.229
 days after which the end 414 million 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.600
 of beer can be poured in so 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.610
 such from dawn fermenter to another in 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.530
 so as to leave all the sites of 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.990
 precipitated yeast that has been created 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.300
 inside the first fermenter e 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.070
 then fill the second fermenter 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.560
 with just the clean beer and from there yes 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.650
 they pass bottling for the phase of 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:03.150
 therefore there is a bottling 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:05.280
 addition of sugars or must and that 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.600
 for 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.280
 favors and the process of 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.530
 carbonation of the beer that will go to 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.650
 determine shaving level and the 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:16.950
 life itself and therefore the foam made 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.389
 precisely the priming is so called 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.889
 or the addition of sugars for the 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.120
 karbon action then the yeast 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:22.440
 the remaining yeast will continue 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.690
 inside the beer will continue to 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.880
 what was his work in 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.070
 previous 14 days going to attack 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.169
 these added sugars transforming them 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.210
 yeast in carbon dioxide 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.860
 only that while during the 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.800
 fermentation carbon dioxide comes 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.330
 expelled in the bottle landi carbonica 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.100
 It remains inside of the compound 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.570
 that is of the ability itself and of 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:47.390
 consequently when we went to open 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:47.390
 we have a foam and then it's fine
