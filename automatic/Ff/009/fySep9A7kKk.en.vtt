00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
with these is and also something that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.249 
with these is and also something that
could<00:01:32.040> be<00:01:32.130> quite<00:01:32.310> dangerous<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.960> new

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
could be quite dangerous is that the new

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.440 
could be quite dangerous is that the new
series<00:01:34.770> look<00:01:35.340> pretty<00:01:35.820> much<00:01:35.970> similar<00:01:36.240> like

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
series look pretty much similar like

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.390 
series look pretty much similar like
this<00:01:36.600> except<00:01:37.049> they<00:01:37.170> don't<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> s<00:01:37.979> and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
this except they don't have the s and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.480 
this except they don't have the s and
the<00:01:38.430> s<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.900> letter<00:01:40.140> S<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.380> what<00:01:40.799> matters<00:01:41.189> on

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the s the letter S is what matters on

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.039 
the s the letter S is what matters on
this<00:01:41.759> because<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.869> newer<00:01:43.290> ones<00:01:43.649> one<00:01:44.960> 5000<00:01:45.960> is

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
this because the newer ones one 5000 is

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.980 
this because the newer ones one 5000 is
worth<00:01:46.320> around<00:01:46.680> 100<00:01:47.100> US<00:01:47.369> dollars<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.780> can

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
worth around 100 US dollars so you can

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.920 
worth around 100 US dollars so you can
trick<00:01:49.290> people<00:01:49.909> sadly<00:01:50.909> by<00:01:51.149> giving<00:01:51.630> them<00:01:51.750> these

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
trick people sadly by giving them these

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.649 
trick people sadly by giving them these

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
it's very important that if you are a

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.959 
it's very important that if you are a
honest<00:02:01.530> collector<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.369> sell<00:02:02.670> them<00:02:02.850> at

10,000 F Gotti's and this is the back
again<00:03:54.390> I<00:03:54.420> believe<00:03:54.570> this<00:03:54.960> is<00:03:55.170> Arabic<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:55.800> it

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
again I believe this is Arabic but it

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.680 
again I believe this is Arabic but it
could<00:03:56.070> be<00:03:56.220> also<00:03:56.430> Persian<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.300> other

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
could be also Persian and other

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.140 
could be also Persian and other
languages<00:03:58.290> so<00:03:58.950> I<00:03:58.980> cannot<00:03:59.610> be<00:03:59.850> a<00:03:59.880> hundred

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150

and kind of tired today anyway point

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.249 
and kind of tired today anyway point
being<00:04:50.220> is<00:04:50.490> here<00:04:50.940> are<00:04:51.060> fifty<00:04:51.479> Afghani<00:04:51.810> so<00:04:52.110> these

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
being is here are fifty Afghani so these

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.920 
being is here are fifty Afghani so these
are<00:04:52.849> quite<00:04:53.849> interesting<00:04:54.330> too<00:04:54.449> so<00:04:54.630> all<00:04:54.660> of<00:04:54.810> them

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
are quite interesting too so all of them

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.300 
are quite interesting too so all of them
have<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.259> writing<00:04:55.560> of<00:04:55.620> course<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.919> serial

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
have the writing of course the serial

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.089 
have the writing of course the serial
number<00:04:56.580> is<00:04:56.699> Arabic<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.690> that's<00:04:58.319> about<00:04:58.650> it<00:04:58.889> I

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
number is Arabic and that's about it I

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.159 
number is Arabic and that's about it I
think<00:04:59.819> also<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.210> Sudanese<00:05:00.720> have<00:05:00.960> it<00:05:01.080> in

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
think also the Sudanese have it in

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.260 
think also the Sudanese have it in
Arabic<00:05:01.620> I'm<00:05:01.770> not<00:05:02.069> entirely<00:05:02.430> sure<00:05:02.639> they<00:05:03.030> should

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
Arabic I'm not entirely sure they should

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.180 
Arabic I'm not entirely sure they should
have<00:05:03.419> serial<00:05:03.840> numbers<00:05:03.870> somewhere<00:05:04.590> I'll

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
have serial numbers somewhere I'll

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.219 
have serial numbers somewhere I'll
actually<00:05:06.120> take<00:05:06.479> a<00:05:06.539> look<00:05:06.810> at<00:05:06.900> that<00:05:07.020> that's

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
actually take a look at that that's

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.120 
actually take a look at that that's
actually<00:05:07.770> important<00:05:08.190> to<00:05:08.250> know<00:05:09.530> no<00:05:10.530> actually

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
actually important to know no actually

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.719 
actually important to know no actually

well<00:06:26.969> basically<00:06:27.300> these<00:06:27.599> are<00:06:27.719> never<00:06:28.289> used

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
well basically these are never used

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.550 
well basically these are never used
probably<00:06:29.219> as<00:06:29.310> change<00:06:29.840> like<00:06:30.840> equivalent<00:06:31.469> to

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
probably as change like equivalent to

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.760 
probably as change like equivalent to
coins<00:06:31.889> 5<00:06:32.250> even<00:06:32.759> that's<00:06:33.090> pretty<00:06:33.449> amazing<00:06:33.659> a<00:06:33.990> few

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
coins 5 even that's pretty amazing a few

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.550 
coins 5 even that's pretty amazing a few
of<00:06:34.860> these<00:06:34.979> so<00:06:35.219> you<00:06:35.250> can<00:06:35.490> trade<00:06:36.029> those<00:06:36.270> and<00:06:36.599> then

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
of these so you can trade those and then

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.740 
of these so you can trade those and then
I<00:06:37.800> believe<00:06:38.159> this<00:06:38.279> is<00:06:38.339> a<00:06:38.490> newer<00:06:38.760> series<00:06:39.120> I'm<00:06:39.570> not

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
I believe this is a newer series I'm not

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.980 
I believe this is a newer series I'm not
entirely<00:06:40.050> sure<00:06:40.260> in<00:06:40.500> this<00:06:40.620> one

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
entirely sure in this one

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.630 
entirely sure in this one
as<00:06:41.080> being<00:06:41.320> counter<00:06:41.800> stand<00:06:42.100> which<00:06:42.370> shows<00:06:42.610> that

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
as being counter stand which shows that

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.550 
as being counter stand which shows that
it's<00:06:42.970> being<00:06:43.150> used<00:06:43.660> under<00:06:43.900> diplomatic

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
it's being used under diplomatic

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.970 
it's being used under diplomatic
purposes<00:06:44.740> so<00:06:45.370> this<00:06:45.820> is<00:06:46.000> a<00:06:46.120> 500<00:06:46.720> rupees<00:06:47.110> this<00:06:47.830> is

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:47.980 
purposes so this is a 500 rupees this is

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.830 
purposes so this is a 500 rupees this is
how<00:06:48.100> the<00:06:48.160> newer<00:06:48.460> series<00:06:48.760> look<00:06:49.090> like<00:06:49.300> in<00:06:49.480> some
