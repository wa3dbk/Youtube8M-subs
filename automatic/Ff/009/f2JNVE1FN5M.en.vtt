all<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.440> had<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.250> go<00:00:35.399> into<00:00:35.550> my<00:00:35.640> transmitter<00:00:36.360> I'm

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
all I had to go into my transmitter I'm

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.069 
all I had to go into my transmitter I'm
using<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.320> dx7<00:00:37.890> here<00:00:38.309> but<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.480> whatever

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
using the dx7 here but for whatever

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.280 
using the dx7 here but for whatever
you're<00:00:40.379> using<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.920> Delta<00:00:41.190> mixing<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.820> onboard

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
you're using the Delta mixing is onboard

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
this unit the stabilization unit so you

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.920 
this unit the stabilization unit so you
need<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.660> take<00:00:45.870> off<00:00:46.079> Delta<00:00:46.649> mixing<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:47.250> here

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
need to take off Delta mixing on here

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.080 
need to take off Delta mixing on here
now<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.379> off<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.800> need<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> hook<00:00:50.309> up<00:00:50.670> I

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
now this is off you need to hook up I

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.029 
now this is off you need to hook up I
happen<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.020> be<00:00:52.140> using<00:00:52.440> an<00:00:52.530> orange<00:00:52.829> our

to the aileron and elevator ports there
and<00:01:15.320> then<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.710> connected<00:01:17.490> my<00:01:17.729> servos<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
and then I connected my servos here and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.960 
and then I connected my servos here and
let<00:01:20.580> me<00:01:20.700> confirm<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.759> servo<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.970> right

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
let me confirm so the servo on the right

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.060 
let me confirm so the servo on the right
wing<00:01:27.479> if<00:01:27.750> you're<00:01:27.900> looking<00:01:28.170> head-on<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.890> this

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
wing if you're looking head-on so this

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.870 
wing if you're looking head-on so this
one<00:01:29.280> over<00:01:29.310> here<00:01:29.820> plugs<00:01:30.420> into<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.869> elevator<00:01:31.500> on

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
one over here plugs into the elevator on

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.120 
one over here plugs into the elevator on
here<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:34.110> one<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.259> your<00:01:34.409> left<00:01:34.590> if<00:01:35.009> you're

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
here and the one on your left if you're

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.870 
here and the one on your left if you're
looking<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.540> wing<00:01:36.780> from<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.530> angle

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
looking on to the wing from this angle

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.510 
looking on to the wing from this angle
once<00:01:38.880> again<00:01:39.210> goes<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.960> aileron<00:01:41.119> left<00:01:43.250> yes<00:01:44.250> that

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
once again goes to aileron left yes that

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.700 
once again goes to aileron left yes that
is<00:01:44.610> correct<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.210> then<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.990> had<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.259> flip<00:01:46.470> these

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
is correct and then I had to flip these

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.460 
is correct and then I had to flip these
little<00:01:47.009> switches<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.700> here<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.439> see

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
little switches in here if you can see

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.120 
little switches in here if you can see
these<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.340> had<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.149> flip<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.110> Delta<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
these I had to flip the Delta to the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.560 
these I had to flip the Delta to the
left<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:55.229> elevator<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.189> aileron<00:01:57.060> little

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
left and the elevator and aileron little

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.469 
left and the elevator and aileron little
dip<00:01:57.780> switches<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.560> left<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.219> then<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.299> my

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
dip switches to the left and then in my

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.429 
dip switches to the left and then in my
transmitter

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
transmitter

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.029 
transmitter
I<00:02:01.469> had<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.399> reverse<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.479> elevator<00:02:05.689> output<00:02:07.039> and

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
I had to reverse the elevator output and

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.969 
I had to reverse the elevator output and
that's<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.670> now<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.170> not<00:02:10.560> only<00:02:10.739> does

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
that's it and now this is not only does

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.400 
that's it and now this is not only does
this<00:02:11.129> give<00:02:11.459> correct<00:02:11.930> control<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.140> here<00:02:13.319> I'm

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
this give correct control so here I'm

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.770 
this give correct control so here I'm
pulling

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
pulling

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.440 
pulling
up<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:16.780> guys<00:02:16.870> can<00:02:17.050> see<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:17.620> I'm<00:02:17.800> pulling<00:02:18.010> up

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
up you guys can see that I'm pulling up

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.880 
up you guys can see that I'm pulling up
going<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.690> right<00:02:19.900> turning<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.650> left

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890
