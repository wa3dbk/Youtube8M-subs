00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
people were confused and thinking that

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.280 
people were confused and thinking that

they need to take the alcohol leaves and

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.990 
they need to take the alcohol leaves and
fill<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.680> pen<00:01:15.830> with<00:01:15.980> it<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:16.490> could<00:01:16.670> do<00:01:16.850> that

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
fill the pen with it you could do that

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.520 
fill the pen with it you could do that
but<00:01:17.240> once<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:17.630> fill<00:01:17.840> a<00:01:17.869> pen<00:01:18.110> with<00:01:18.260> a<00:01:18.320> color

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
but once you fill a pen with a color

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.190 
but once you fill a pen with a color
it's<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:19.490> color<00:01:19.670> forever<00:01:20.000> alright<00:01:20.570> but

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
it's that color forever alright but

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.080 
it's that color forever alright but
instead<00:01:21.710> if<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.070> fill<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.700> pen<00:01:22.910> with

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
instead if you fill the pen with

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.420 
instead if you fill the pen with
blending<00:01:23.450> solution<00:01:23.900> you<00:01:24.619> can<00:01:24.830> blend<00:01:25.130> all<00:01:25.310> of

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
blending solution you can blend all of

tip there it also has a flexible brush

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.920 
tip there it also has a flexible brush
tip<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:34.880> is<00:01:35.030> removable<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:35.720> you're<00:01:35.869> just

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
tip and this is removable so you're just

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.510 
tip and this is removable so you're just
going<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:36.200> take<00:01:36.350> that<00:01:36.380> nib<00:01:36.800> you're<00:01:37.430> gonna

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
going to take that nib you're gonna

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.560 
going to take that nib you're gonna
reach<00:01:37.790> right<00:01:37.970> under<00:01:38.180> there<00:01:38.330> you're<00:01:38.450> gonna

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
reach right under there you're gonna

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.359 
reach right under there you're gonna
pull<00:01:38.810> this<00:01:38.960> out<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.740> you<00:01:39.920> would<00:01:40.040> take<00:01:40.190> the

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
pull this out and you would take the

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.010 
pull this out and you would take the
blending<00:01:40.670> solution<00:01:40.759> squeeze<00:01:41.690> it<00:01:41.810> for<00:01:41.960> about

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
blending solution squeeze it for about

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.170 
blending solution squeeze it for about
three<00:01:42.440> seconds<00:01:42.890> let<00:01:43.460> it<00:01:43.580> sit<00:01:43.820> because<00:01:44.030> it's

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
three seconds let it sit because it's

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.700 
three seconds let it sit because it's
going<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.479> absorb<00:01:44.600> in<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.110> material<00:01:45.560> inside

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
going to absorb in the material inside

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.469 
going to absorb in the material inside
there<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:46.280> would<00:01:46.759> do<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:47.000> about<00:01:47.119> three

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
there and you would do that about three

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.360 
there and you would do that about three
or<00:01:47.570> four<00:01:47.750> times<00:01:48.040> then<00:01:49.040> you're<00:01:49.220> going<00:01:49.310> to

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
or four times then you're going to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.240 
or four times then you're going to
reinsert<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.090> nib<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:51.440> caps<00:01:51.710> they're

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
reinsert the nib the caps they're

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.580 
reinsert the nib the caps they're
airtight<00:01:52.700> caps<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.420> when<00:01:53.540> you<00:01:53.690> lock<00:01:54.080> this<00:01:54.290> in

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
airtight caps so when you lock this in

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.919 
airtight caps so when you lock this in
evaporating<00:01:56.490> depends<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.509> not<00:01:57.659> going<00:01:57.869> to

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
evaporating depends it's not going to

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:59.539 
evaporating depends it's not going to
happen<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:58.560> here's<00:01:58.740> what<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.009> allows<00:01:59.250> me<00:01:59.429> to

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
happen but here's what it allows me to

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.609 
happen but here's what it allows me to
do<00:01:59.670> so<00:01:59.909> now<00:02:00.420> what<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> have<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:00.899> I've<00:02:01.140> got<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> pen

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
do so now what I have is I've got a pen

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.899 
do so now what I have is I've got a pen
that's<00:02:01.799> just<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.189> dispense<00:02:02.460> blending

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
that's just going to dispense blending

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.480 
that's just going to dispense blending
