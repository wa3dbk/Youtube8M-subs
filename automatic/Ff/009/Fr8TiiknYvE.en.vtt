00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:08.900
 is leaving today 9 sure to put the 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.230
 deficit there is a test bench she 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.769
 tests 12-volt systems or 24 very 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.409
 huh 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.460
 is an alternator it generates if a current 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:20.960
 alternately internally after the plate 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.779
 identifier turns this chain 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.580
 alternating current 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.300
 this DC we got 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.509
 whole plate and will be measured as the 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.680
 reason measures the tension of the trainer 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.760
 the voltage is here the battery is with 12.0 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.520
 nine volts 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.140
 here is the part of the worker where the 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.270
 Coach here 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.890
 here the player is marking ac-90 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.320
 on foot 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:56.120
 So he has to take a life on foot. 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.320
 90 feet and 14 18 laps here we'll see if 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.539
 he is regulating right 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.359
 here we have alan pilot represented 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.000
 here by the cable 30 that is 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.560
 representing the line 15 key posts of the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.290
 the line 15 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.790
 the ignition, it feeds this 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.259
 lamp here is the 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.110
 excitement 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:18.079
 through that driver here the word of 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:23.049
 excitation of the stator that lamp that 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:25.759
 and it contributes to the excitement 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.240
 of the stator by making it 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.240
 magnetic field 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.990
 Good, I'll drive here people to see. 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.200
 avoiding both the voltage generating therein 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.900
 correctly 14/8 volts and also if it 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.900
 generates 90 feet commits the mother 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.560
 it is a pity regrets
