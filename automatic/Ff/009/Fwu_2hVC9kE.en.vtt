 Translator: Mohanad Bahattab Checker: Hussain Laghabi 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.152
 I like to become a compassionate teacher; 

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:13.596
 Serious, but fair teacher. 

00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:16.588
 But my clever little brain, 

00:00:16.588 --> 00:00:22.602
 These scholars I would like to stand for their appreciation 

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:25.915
 I am the teacher who is sweating profusely. 

00:00:25.915 --> 00:00:27.951
 Not a compassionate teacher who, 

00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:31.630
 Happens by chance to sweat, 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.058
 Not even the teacher who sweats. 

00:00:35.058 --> 00:00:38.227
 No, the teacher who is sweating. 

00:00:38.227 --> 00:00:39.861
 Sweating is a recipe, 

00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:42.559
 My intention is to come before the name, the teacher, 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.542
 As if to say, this is Mr. Lamb. 

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:50.664
 You do not define him by the profession to which he dedicated his life. 

00:00:50.664 --> 00:00:55.720
 But with warm natural springs or what he calls hand grenades. 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.185
 Every morning, I wake up in the cold ... 

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.603
 Did not matter. 

00:01:02.603 --> 00:01:04.743
 The simple spontaneous teacher says: 

00:01:04.743 --> 00:01:06.659
 "I do not have to sweat" 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.865
 The high-sounding teacher says: 

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:10.632
 "You, this, you do not have to sweat" 

00:01:10.632 --> 00:01:15.432
 But even the compassionate teacher does not understand. 

00:01:15.432 --> 00:01:18.099
 In a latent and cheerful landmark. 

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:21.174
 I pretend that the remarks I confiscated in the chapter 

00:01:21.174 --> 00:01:22.932
 Thanks only. 

00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:25.502
 Acknowledgment of my career as a teacher 

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:29.515
 "Lalala, you did not have to do this!" 

00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:34.252
 We even boycotted one about Mr. Stank Bates. 

00:01:34.252 --> 00:01:37.438
 No, really. You did not have to do this. 

00:01:37.438 --> 00:01:41.083
 Since the development of twisted skills began 

00:01:41.083 --> 00:01:42.795
 To divert attention, 

00:01:42.795 --> 00:01:44.551
 To become a new person; 

00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:46.689
 The teacher who shakes his shoulders 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.012
 With obvious aggressiveness. 

00:01:49.012 --> 00:01:51.744
 The teacher who ties the tie to his pants, 

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.340
 And pulls its end 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.301
 Because he is so stupid. 

00:01:57.301 --> 00:01:59.902
 But that does not work. 

00:01:59.902 --> 00:02:04.957
 Because my teacher in geography was also sweating. 

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:09.757
 And to this day, I can not remember the capital of Bulgaria 

00:02:09.757 --> 00:02:13.144
 While the two hundred meters I know most 

00:02:13.144 --> 00:02:17.378
 They sat under his shoulders. (Laughter) 

00:02:17.378 --> 00:02:19.384
 Now, I am who 

00:02:19.384 --> 00:02:22.278
 It seems like it has the Atlantic and the Pacific 

00:02:22.278 --> 00:02:23.951
 In the grip of his hands. 

00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:29.716
 Or who asks: "How was the plunge bath?" 

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:32.663
 "There was no bath for snorkeling 

00:02:32.663 --> 00:02:36.237
 We live in the wet New Orleans city! "(Laughter) 

00:02:36.237 --> 00:02:40.031
 How will I respond if I am an angry teacher? 

00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:43.330
 Instead, look at the child in the eye 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.943
 When sweat swells from my nose, 

00:02:46.943 --> 00:02:50.459
 Then scattered on his blank paper, 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.923
 To say: "I sweat because I do my best. 

00:02:55.923 --> 00:02:59.283
 I want you to do the same. "
