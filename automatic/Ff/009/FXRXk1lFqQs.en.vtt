00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
about this sheath that it comes with is

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.540 
about this sheath that it comes with is
that<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.379> buckle<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.010> prefer

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
that you have to have a buckle I prefer

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.590 
that you have to have a buckle I prefer
like<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.820> Kydex<00:00:45.120> sheath<00:00:45.390> which<00:00:45.899> holds<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.800> in

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
like a Kydex sheath which holds it in

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.380 
like a Kydex sheath which holds it in
strictly<00:00:48.600> by<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.840> tension<00:00:49.820> but<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.940> does<00:00:51.120> ride

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
strictly by the tension but it does ride

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.439 
strictly by the tension but it does ride
nice<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.100> close<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.250> your<00:00:53.309> body<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.239> doesn't

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
nice and close to your body and doesn't

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.500 
nice and close to your body and doesn't
protrude<00:00:55.260> out<00:00:55.530> or<00:00:56.180> you<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:57.300> look<00:00:57.750> all<00:00:57.960> bulky

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:10.160 

here<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.750> close<00:01:04.530> up<00:01:08.210> it<00:01:09.210> also<00:01:09.360> doesn't<00:01:09.810> come

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170

with this little paracord wrap on here I

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.120 
with this little paracord wrap on here I
just<00:01:13.880> put<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.060> there<00:01:15.299> real<00:01:15.450> quick<00:01:16.340> because

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
just put it on there real quick because

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.070 
just put it on there real quick because
it's<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> thin<00:01:20.430> handle<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.090> feels<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.869> little

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
it's the thin handle and feels a little

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.490 
it's the thin handle and feels a little
bit<00:01:22.200> nicer<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> paracord<00:01:24.290> see<00:01:25.290> this

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
bit nicer with the paracord see this

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.429 
bit nicer with the paracord see this
blades<00:01:26.040> got<00:01:26.220> some<00:01:26.400> jimping<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> back

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.480 

fills<00:01:31.439> decent<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> hand<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:35.070> only<00:01:35.250> gripe

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
fills decent in the hand the only gripe

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.590 
fills decent in the hand the only gripe
I'd<00:01:35.729> give<00:01:35.939> about<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.500> handles<00:01:37.950> kind<00:01:38.310> of

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
I'd give about it is the handles kind of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.149 
I'd give about it is the handles kind of
short<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.930> little<00:01:40.170> bit<00:01:40.290> wide<00:01:40.560> right<00:01:40.799> here

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
short and a little bit wide right here

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.740 
short and a little bit wide right here
so<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.000> does<00:01:42.210> feel<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> little<00:01:42.899> awkward<00:01:44.750> it

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
so it does feel a little awkward it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.270 
so it does feel a little awkward it
doesn't<00:01:46.049> feel<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.530> could<00:01:46.710> get<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.040> most

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
doesn't feel like you could get the most

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.090 
doesn't feel like you could get the most
cutting<00:01:47.909> power<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.770> would<00:01:49.890> like

you<00:03:14.099> can<00:03:14.129> compare<00:03:14.640> it<00:03:14.760> like<00:03:14.819> that<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:17.310> yeah

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
you can compare it like that so yeah

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.420 
you can compare it like that so yeah
it's<00:03:17.940> got<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.150> large<00:03:18.930> blade<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.709> handle<00:03:20.040> ratio

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
it's got a large blade to handle ratio

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.330 
it's got a large blade to handle ratio
looks<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.389> little<00:03:21.480> bit<00:03:21.750> weird<00:03:24.200> but<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:26.130> know<00:03:26.190> it

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
looks a little bit weird but you know it

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.650 
looks a little bit weird but you know it
gives<00:03:26.549> you<00:03:26.609> that<00:03:26.819> a<00:03:27.319> large<00:03:28.319> cutting<00:03:29.160> ability<00:03:30.440> I

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660
