see how as it comes off so I'm gonna
reshoot<00:00:47.280> these<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:47.780> Barty<00:00:48.780> actually<00:00:49.079> started

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
reshoot these but Barty actually started

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.430 
reshoot these but Barty actually started
the<00:00:49.500> edge<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:50.399> here<00:00:51.079> hopefully<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> angles

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the edge on here hopefully the angles

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
the edge on here hopefully the angles
coming<00:00:52.710> through<00:00:52.890> okay<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.059> was

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
coming through okay and I like it was

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.779 
coming through okay and I like it was
just<00:00:54.329> started<00:00:55.140> rolling<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.590> edge<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.100> start

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
just started rolling the edge and start

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.410 
just started rolling the edge and start
peeling<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.870> material<00:00:58.410> itself<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.059> can<00:01:00.239> go

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
peeling the material itself so we can go

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.450 
peeling the material itself so we can go
back<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:02.489> I'll<00:01:02.640> actually<00:01:03.120> remove<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
back and then I'll actually remove the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.160 
back and then I'll actually remove the
remove<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.390> head<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.810> tail<00:01:06.990> light

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
remove that the head the tail light

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.500 
remove that the head the tail light
itself<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.310> I'll<00:01:08.520> shoot<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.970> real<00:01:09.180> light

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
itself and I'll shoot it real light

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.730 
itself and I'll shoot it real light
because<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.290> side<00:01:12.170> you<00:01:13.170> can't<00:01:13.470> really

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
because on this side you can't really

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.780 
because on this side you can't really
tell<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:15.560> you<00:01:16.560> shoot<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:16.920> side<00:01:17.189> light<00:01:17.490> it

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
tell if you shoot this side light it

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.719 
tell if you shoot this side light it
still<00:01:18.060> looks<00:01:18.570> dark<00:01:19.250> but<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.310> allows<00:01:20.490> more

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
still looks dark but it allows more

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.490 
still looks dark but it allows more
light<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.000> travel<00:01:21.299> through<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.810> reshoot

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
light to travel through so just reshoot

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.749 
light to travel through so just reshoot
it<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.799> way<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> taillights<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.549> coming

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
it so that way the taillights are coming

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.310 
it so that way the taillights are coming
through<00:01:23.909> right<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.270> personally<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.930> want<00:01:25.229> my

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
through right just personally I want my

00:01:25.320 --> 00:02:10.719 
through right just personally I want my
tail<00:01:25.530> lights<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.040> nice<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.400> bright<00:01:26.580> so

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.890 

there<00:02:11.629> you<00:02:11.720> have<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:14.540> got<00:02:14.659> a<00:02:14.690> couple

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
there you have it so you got a couple

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.780 
there you have it so you got a couple
edges<00:02:15.290> on<00:02:15.440> here<00:02:15.680> they're<00:02:15.830> just<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:16.190> little<00:02:16.489> bit

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
edges on here they're just a little bit

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.789 
edges on here they're just a little bit
stuck<00:02:17.150> just<00:02:17.959> because<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.260> didn't<00:02:18.470> shoot<00:02:18.680> it

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
stuck just because I didn't shoot it

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.850 
stuck just because I didn't shoot it
super<00:02:19.190> heavy<00:02:19.459> up<00:02:20.000> top<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.659> just<00:02:21.500> give<00:02:21.650> those<00:02:21.799> a

super heavy up top I just give those a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.550 
super heavy up top I just give those a
little<00:02:22.010> thumb<00:02:22.340> roll<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:24.290> they're<00:02:24.440> cleaned<00:02:24.739> up

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
little thumb roll and they're cleaned up

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.839 
little thumb roll and they're cleaned up
my<00:02:27.560> taillights<00:02:28.040> are<00:02:28.190> pretty<00:02:28.370> scuffed<00:02:28.670> up

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
my taillights are pretty scuffed up

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.430 
my taillights are pretty scuffed up
underneath<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.599> begin<00:02:29.840> with<00:02:29.989> it's<00:02:30.200> part<00:02:30.410> of

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
underneath to begin with it's part of

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.630 
underneath to begin with it's part of
the<00:02:30.530> reason<00:02:30.650> why<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:30.920> wanted<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.250> black<00:02:31.459> them

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
the reason why I wanted to black them

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.170 
the reason why I wanted to black them
out<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:33.230> can<00:02:33.290> see<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.500> material<00:02:33.920> here<00:02:34.180> it's

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
out you can see the material here it's

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.520 
out you can see the material here it's
pretty<00:02:35.269> durable<00:02:35.540> oh<00:02:37.420> yeah<00:02:38.420> my<00:02:38.569> my<00:02:39.170> my

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
pretty durable oh yeah my my my

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.930 
pretty durable oh yeah my my my
taillights<00:02:39.890> are<00:02:40.040> pretty<00:02:40.220> damaged<00:02:40.549> so<00:02:40.730> instead

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
taillights are pretty damaged so instead

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.309 
taillights are pretty damaged so instead
of<00:02:41.060> actually<00:02:41.360> sanding<00:02:41.780> them<00:02:41.870> down<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.170> trying

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
of actually sanding them down and trying

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.420 
of actually sanding them down and trying
to<00:02:42.409> clean<00:02:42.560> them<00:02:42.739> up<00:02:42.799> I<00:02:42.920> think<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.190> blacked-out

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
to clean them up I think the blacked-out

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.890 
to clean them up I think the blacked-out
look<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:43.940> potentially<00:02:44.360> what<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:44.510> want<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.780> go

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
look is potentially what I want to go

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.740 
look is potentially what I want to go
with<00:02:45.019> or<00:02:45.170> maybe<00:02:45.319> I'll<00:02:45.760> mix<00:02:46.760> up<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.120> custom<00:02:47.540> color

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
with or maybe I'll mix up a custom color

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.979 
with or maybe I'll mix up a custom color
and<00:02:48.470> kind<00:02:48.590> of<00:02:48.739> shade<00:02:48.980> these<00:02:49.220> in<00:02:49.519> something

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
and kind of shade these in something

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.869 
and kind of shade these in something
something<00:02:50.989> else<00:02:51.140> but<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:52.400> can<00:02:52.579> see<00:02:52.730> there

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
something else but you can see there

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.180 
something else but you can see there
that's<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.290> that's<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.410> basic<00:02:54.829> removal

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
that's the that's the basic removal

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.470 
that's the that's the basic removal
procedure<00:02:55.519> since<00:02:55.849> I<00:02:55.940> actually<00:02:56.150> already

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
procedure since I actually already

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.610 
procedure since I actually already
started<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.930> one<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.560> left<00:03:00.829> it<00:03:01.010> alone<00:03:01.099> so

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
started that one and left it alone so

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.549 
started that one and left it alone so
you<00:03:03.620> guys<00:03:03.799> could<00:03:04.069> kind<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.310> take<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.459> look
