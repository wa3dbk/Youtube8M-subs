00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
think I would have done it even if we

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.500 
think I would have done it even if we
didn't<00:00:32.099> have<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.279> record<00:00:32.520> deal<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.270> weren't

making money and we weren't touring him
stuff<00:00:36.030> like<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.390> was<00:00:36.510> something<00:00:36.690> I

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
stuff like that it was something I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.600 
stuff like that it was something I
wanted<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.020> do<00:00:37.140> anyway<00:00:43.040> this<00:00:44.040> little<00:00:44.280> piece<00:00:44.460> of

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
wanted to do anyway this little piece of

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.670 
wanted to do anyway this little piece of
wood<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:44.969> that'll<00:00:45.239> save<00:00:45.480> my<00:00:45.660> ass<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.230> think
