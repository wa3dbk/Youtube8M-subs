this<00:01:25.740> isn't<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.100> first<00:01:26.250> project<00:01:26.700> we've<00:01:26.880> done

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
this isn't the first project we've done

this isn't the first project we've done
with<00:01:27.360> boughs<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.630> work<00:01:27.960> inside<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.680> the

with boughs and work inside and the
greater<00:01:28.979> jag<00:01:29.280> you'e<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.610> work<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:30.119> them<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.540> X

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
greater jag you'e to work with them on X

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.789 
greater jag you'e to work with them on X
F<00:01:31.200> X<00:01:31.890> K<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.880> really<00:01:33.659> know<00:01:33.869> how<00:01:34.110> they<00:01:34.500> work

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
F X K so we really know how they work

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.319 
F X K so we really know how they work
and<00:01:35.040> what<00:01:35.250> value<00:01:35.640> they<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:36.150> and

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
and what value they can have and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.840 
and what value they can have and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
similarly they know our skills are what

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.179 
similarly they know our skills are what
value<00:01:39.150> weaken<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.869> together<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:41.040> makes

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
value weaken it and together that makes

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.340 
value weaken it and together that makes

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
the easiest systems in the world to use

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.399 
the easiest systems in the world to use

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
pull up touch screens as you can see in

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.260 
pull up touch screens as you can see in

front of you at plans that this is
clearly<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:09.050> world's<00:02:09.349> best<00:02:09.769> car<00:02:10.280> audio

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670

system<00:02:10.729> there<00:02:11.420> are<00:02:11.450> so<00:02:11.599> many<00:02:11.750> systems<00:02:12.110> on<00:02:12.470> this

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680

amplifier<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:22.099> the<00:02:22.160> way<00:02:22.459> that<00:02:22.670> comes<00:02:22.910> together

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
amplifier is the way that comes together
