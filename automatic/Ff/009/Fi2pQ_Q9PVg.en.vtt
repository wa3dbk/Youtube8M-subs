00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 I think everybody loves it 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.130
 That's why I have you five today 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.000
 books picked out the against 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.000
 heartfelt help 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.710
 Number one is the absolute classic 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.759
 have bridget jones diary i mean 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.490
 in all of us put a 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.930
 desperate little chubby something 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.090
 clumsy woman just hanging out 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.830
 longs for love and a lot of it 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.330
 makes mistakes and I believe exactly 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.220
 That's why this book can be repeated 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.170
 well read myself lovesick because 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.970
 you just notice it's going to other people 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.949
 it's just as shit, but it can be done anyway 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.110
 a happy end the next book because 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.940
 lovesick cellity from nicole you 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.579
 because here too it is about relationships 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.110
 and it's about rock the one 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.700
 has just loaded and just from his 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.809
 girlfriend was abandoned he was once 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.230
 leave again 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.579
 and yes, now he starts to ask 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.320
 where was not that actually him 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.480
 he is always relived by everyone 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.620
 his old relationship again and again 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.180
 trying to figure out what's wrong 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.350
 has gone and I think if you can 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.059
 this book reads while you 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.920
 lovesickness, of course, comes by itself 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.840
 a bit pondering and almost too 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.820
 new courage this book reads for in the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.140
 the end effect is really nice 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.909
 I also think I prefer 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.740
 The hat ever made a review 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.270
 I'll tell you below in the infobox 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.860
 link again now we come to 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.689
 the slightly more unusual anti 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.070
 lovesick books and indeed that would be 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.630
 First, what I suggest to you 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.850
 What would I talk about when I run away? 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.950
 Talk about haruki murakami that's one 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.479
 scary personal book there it goes 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.040
 actually about his two passions 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.840
 to run and write that 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.340
 both have combined in this book 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.390
 and that sounds like it has 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.159
 nothing at all with love and 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.850
 to do passion but somehow has 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.990
 that's it 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.329
 because that's incredible 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.950
 inspirational book what motivates and 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.750
 makes sure that you maybe again 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.850
 Remember that it is never too late of 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.500
 to start at the beginning of book number four 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.659
 I can recommend you is salt and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.860
 his price of critical means that is 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.030
 a book that you should read when you are 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.310
 to rediscover the belief in love 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.659
 it must be a book it's about two 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.280
 women who fall in love with each other 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.470
 So a lesbian love story is 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.780
 a road trip and a book somehow 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.700
 more emotions than alex ever houses 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.500
 has definitely recommended 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.640
 if you browse a bit and 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.560
 makes 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.000
 I really want the last book 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.159
 somehow nothing to do with love 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.840
 but somehow everything because it is 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.149
 a book in which we all fall in love 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.920
 At that time Harry Potter it's easy 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.990
 again because there are not any 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.430
 book series that makes you happier than 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.900
 this one she somehow has something of 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.340
 A feeling of security is reminiscent of his 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.280
 childhood and everything you live through 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.840
 have you read these books and 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.160
 It makes you feel right after you are 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.230
 maybe well distracted and 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.400
 therefore an absolute must be against 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.750
 lovesickness has now I have you 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.010
 my five books against lovesick 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.290
 I would like to suggest now, of course 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.060
 you still know what you are against me 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.050
 lovesick would suggest if you 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.060
 could give me a hint 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.709
 in the comments with otherwise see 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.100
 us next week until then is back 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.100
