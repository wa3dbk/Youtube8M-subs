and it goes from 0 to 25 volts doesn't

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.440 
and it goes from 0 to 25 volts doesn't
adjust<00:01:08.860> quite<00:01:09.190> that<00:01:09.400> high<00:01:09.610> but<00:01:09.910> still<00:01:10.030> very

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
adjust quite that high but still very

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.860 
adjust quite that high but still very
cool<00:01:10.990> when<00:01:11.230> there's<00:01:11.440> a<00:01:12.270> switch<00:01:13.270> here

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.860 
room much to the dismay of my wife all
right<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.580> have<00:02:45.790> we're<00:02:45.910> all<00:02:46.030> plugged<00:02:46.390> in<00:02:46.660> and

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
right so I have we're all plugged in and

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.420 
right so I have we're all plugged in and
what<00:02:46.959> I'm<00:02:47.050> gonna<00:02:47.170> do<00:02:47.350> now<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.590> I'm<00:02:47.950> gonna<00:02:48.130> turn

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna turn

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.640 
what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna turn
it<00:02:48.580> on<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.120> I've<00:02:49.270> got<00:02:49.510> a<00:02:49.540> lapel<00:02:49.959> mic<00:02:50.230> on<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:50.590> I'm

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
it on and I've got a lapel mic on so I'm

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.990 
it on and I've got a lapel mic on so I'm
not<00:02:50.709> sure<00:02:50.830> how<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.280> guys<00:02:51.610> are<00:02:51.760> going<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:51.940> be

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
not sure how you guys are going to be

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.090 
not sure how you guys are going to be
able<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.150> hear<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.390> but<00:02:52.590> it's<00:02:53.590> pretty<00:02:53.770> loud<00:02:54.040> so

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
able to hear it but it's pretty loud so

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.580 
able to hear it but it's pretty loud so
let's<00:02:54.520> try<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.820> here

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.780 

so<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.160> guess<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.580> can<00:03:01.760> hear<00:03:02.000> me<00:03:02.239> over<00:03:02.510> the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
so I guess you can hear me over the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.790 
so I guess you can hear me over the
power<00:03:04.790> supply<00:03:05.239> but<00:03:06.020> what<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.200> wanted<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.590> show

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
power supply but what I wanted to show

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.380 
power supply but what I wanted to show
you<00:03:06.830> is<00:03:07.099> really<00:03:07.430> cool<00:03:07.640> I<00:03:07.849> don't<00:03:07.970> know<00:03:08.060> if<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.209> can

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
you is really cool I don't know if I can

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.960 
you is really cool I don't know if I can
show<00:03:08.599> both<00:03:08.810> at<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.080> same<00:03:09.290> time<00:03:09.319> I'll<00:03:09.680> try<00:03:09.970> this

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
show both at the same time I'll try this

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.100 
show both at the same time I'll try this
potentiometer<00:03:11.510> did<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.560> guy<00:03:12.739> use<00:03:13.959> check<00:03:14.959> this

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
potentiometer did the guy use check this

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.670 
potentiometer did the guy use check this
out

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
out

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.290 
out
really<00:03:16.459> fine<00:03:16.760> detail<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:19.459> takes<00:03:19.730> almost<00:03:19.970> a

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
really fine detail it takes almost a

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.370 
really fine detail it takes almost a
full<00:03:20.569> turn<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:21.110> go<00:03:21.260> 1<00:03:21.560> volt<00:03:22.780> and<00:03:23.780> that's<00:03:24.019> really

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
full turn to go 1 volt and that's really

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.290 
full turn to go 1 volt and that's really
nice<00:03:24.560> for<00:03:24.950> doing<00:03:25.190> this<00:03:25.340> testing<00:03:25.819> with<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.120> car

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
nice for doing this testing with the car

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.400 
nice for doing this testing with the car
audio<00:03:26.630> amplifier<00:03:27.170> because<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.709> can<00:03:27.890> set<00:03:28.220> it

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
audio amplifier because I can set it

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.880 
audio amplifier because I can set it
turn<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:30.530> down<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.739> little<00:03:31.099> bit<00:03:31.310> more<00:03:32.709> you<00:03:33.709> can

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
turn it down a little bit more you can

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.039 
turn it down a little bit more you can
set<00:03:34.130> it<00:03:34.250> on<00:03:34.400> 12<00:03:34.760> volts<00:03:34.880> to<00:03:35.980> test<00:03:36.980> an<00:03:37.100> amplifier

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
set it on 12 volts to test an amplifier

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.330 
set it on 12 volts to test an amplifier
see<00:03:39.049> we're<00:03:39.200> right<00:03:39.350> at<00:03:39.470> 12<00:03:39.739> and<00:03:40.069> we<00:03:40.160> have

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
see we're right at 12 and we have

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.930 
see we're right at 12 and we have
verified<00:03:40.640> with<00:03:41.269> the<00:03:41.480> flute<00:03:42.080> meter<00:03:42.519> that<00:03:43.519> it<00:03:43.760> is

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
verified with the flute meter that it is

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.800 
verified with the flute meter that it is
dead-on<00:03:44.840> accurate<00:03:45.580> then<00:03:46.580> we<00:03:46.819> could<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.750> know

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
dead-on accurate then we could you know

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.229 
dead-on accurate then we could you know
just<00:03:48.080> turn<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:48.380> up<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:48.620> say<00:03:48.769> well<00:03:48.950> huh<00:03:49.239> let's

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
just turn it up and say well huh let's

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.800 
just turn it up and say well huh let's
see<00:03:50.330> if<00:03:50.540> this<00:03:50.810> a<00:03:51.170> Ryan<00:03:51.830> HCCA<00:03:52.819> amplifier<00:03:53.510> for

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
see if this a Ryan HCCA amplifier for

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.220 
see if this a Ryan HCCA amplifier for
example<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:55.310> regulated<00:03:56.120> or<00:03:56.299> unregulated<00:03:56.780> so

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
example is regulated or unregulated so

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.990 
example is regulated or unregulated so
then<00:03:57.380> we<00:03:57.500> just<00:03:57.530> turn<00:03:57.890> it<00:03:58.010> up<00:03:58.130> just<00:03:58.160> say<00:03:58.580> I<00:03:58.610> don't

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
then we just turn it up just say I don't

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.339 
then we just turn it up just say I don't
know<00:03:59.090> 14<00:03:59.720> 14<00:04:00.349> and<00:04:00.440> a<00:04:00.470> half<00:04:00.500> volts<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:02.840> we<00:04:03.200> could

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
know 14 14 and a half volts and we could

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.229 
know 14 14 and a half volts and we could
test<00:04:03.560> it<00:04:03.739> again<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.609> output<00:04:05.060> is

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
test it again and the output is

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.150 
test it again and the output is
significantly<00:04:06.200> different<00:04:06.470> that<00:04:06.890> we<00:04:06.980> would

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
significantly different that we would

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.080 
significantly different that we would
know<00:04:07.340> that<00:04:08.829> the<00:04:09.829> amp<00:04:10.040> is<00:04:10.220> unregulated

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
know that the amp is unregulated

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.000 
know that the amp is unregulated
so<00:04:11.480> that's<00:04:11.720> what's<00:04:11.930> really<00:04:12.019> cool<00:04:12.410> about<00:04:12.470> this

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
so that's what's really cool about this

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.310 
so that's what's really cool about this
and<00:04:13.340> also<00:04:14.120> having<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.630> ability<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:15.019> go<00:04:15.200> up

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
and also having the ability to go up

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.060 
and also having the ability to go up
with<00:04:15.440> 250<00:04:16.100> amps<00:04:16.760> which<00:04:17.180> is<00:04:17.739> it's<00:04:18.739> not<00:04:18.829> enough

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
with 250 amps which is it's not enough

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.210 
with 250 amps which is it's not enough
for<00:04:19.280> all<00:04:19.570> amplifiers<00:04:20.570> today<00:04:21.019> but<00:04:21.320> it's<00:04:21.470> enough

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
for all amplifiers today but it's enough

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.490 
for all amplifiers today but it's enough
for<00:04:22.490> most<00:04:23.120> of<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.479> old-school<00:04:23.900> apps<00:04:24.169> that<00:04:24.410> we

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
for most of the old-school apps that we

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.330 
for most of the old-school apps that we
would<00:04:24.620> ever<00:04:24.770> test<00:04:26.650> alright<00:04:27.650> folks<00:04:27.890> well<00:04:28.220> there

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
would ever test alright folks well there

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.300 
would ever test alright folks well there
you<00:04:28.460> have<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:28.820> just<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:29.090> quick<00:04:29.360> test<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:30.139> the<00:04:30.919> or

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
you have it just a quick test of the or

you have it just a quick test of the or
a<00:04:31.340> quick<00:04:31.580> demo<00:04:31.880> I<00:04:32.030> should<00:04:32.510> say<00:04:32.979> of<00:04:33.979> the<00:04:34.190> power

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
a quick demo I should say of the power

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.550 
a quick demo I should say of the power
