00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.859
 So, this is my first video. 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.540
 that I'll explain a little bit of the bike 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.889
 Your bike that I bought just now 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.620
 Time, right? 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.109
 I had my first bike was a 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.960
 300 sitcom after I called ninja 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.300
 300 white right in the rio de janeiro 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.230
 was the only one that had the kit went shimura 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.980
 that I had imported from the outside and got 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.009
 one xj that those xj lead né with wheel 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.649
 South was a very good bike and now 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.190
 is to go to the world of ss né that this 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.719
 is one of the idols 675 r 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.480
 so it's a spectacular sensational bike 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.620
 only unfortunately on a bike to ride 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.289
 on a daily basis 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.750
 There's a lot less to the road men in a 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.559
 speedway bike one bike ready for 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.960
 racetrack 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:57.050

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:00.000
 today is front and back aeroquip 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.690
 steering damper so it's a motorcycle 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.979
 so very complete very complete 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.580
 a motorcycle that so very good I during 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.000
 one year 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.710
 I changed three times motorcycle're iii this 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.810
 hence I intend not to change the mars for 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.460
 a long time because I really liked the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.400

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.049

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.930

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.460
 tighten the clutch to start the engine 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.640
 the original state 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.570

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:58.039

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.039

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.850
