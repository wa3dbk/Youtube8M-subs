00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
of the dreaded problem in pharmacology

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.789 
of the dreaded problem in pharmacology
calculating<00:00:10.309> medication<00:00:11.809> with<00:00:12.809> Mike's<00:00:13.500> per

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
calculating medication with Mike's per

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.289 
calculating medication with Mike's per
kilogram<00:00:14.219> per<00:00:14.400> minute<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.820> you're<00:00:14.969> looking

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
kilogram per minute and you're looking

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.970 
kilogram per minute and you're looking
for<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.599> cc's<00:00:16.260> per<00:00:16.289> hour<00:00:16.740> or<00:00:17.460> MLS<00:00:18.029> per<00:00:18.180> hour<00:00:18.980> so

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
for a cc's per hour or MLS per hour so

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.730 
for a cc's per hour or MLS per hour so
let's<00:00:20.250> read<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.460> problem<00:00:20.689> order<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.960> infuse

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
let's read the problem order of infuse

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.859 
let's read the problem order of infuse
dopamine<00:00:23.400> at<00:00:23.550> 8<00:00:23.730> Mike's<00:00:24.000> per<00:00:24.359> kilogram<00:00:24.840> per

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
dopamine at 8 Mike's per kilogram per

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.490 
dopamine at 8 Mike's per kilogram per
minute<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.680> hand<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.760> dopamine<00:00:27.180> mix<00:00:27.570> 800

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
minute on hand is dopamine mix 800

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.720 
minute on hand is dopamine mix 800
milligrams<00:00:28.970> per<00:00:29.970> 500<00:00:30.300> ml<00:00:31.080> or<00:00:31.380> cc's<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.189> d5

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
milligrams per 500 ml or cc's of d5

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.590 
milligrams per 500 ml or cc's of d5
water<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:34.110> patient's<00:00:34.530> weight<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:35.600> 198

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
water and a patient's weight is 198

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.100 
water and a patient's weight is 198
pounds<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.980> how<00:00:38.579> are<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.790> going<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.149> start<00:00:39.570> with

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
pounds so how are we going to start with

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.440 
pounds so how are we going to start with
this<00:00:40.260> problem<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.860> says<00:00:41.579> there<00:00:41.760> calculate<00:00:42.239> how

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
this problem it says there calculate how

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.080 
this problem it says there calculate how
many<00:00:42.719> cc's<00:00:43.020> per<00:00:43.200> hour<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.550> before<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.030> start

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
many cc's per hour so before you start

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.590 
many cc's per hour so before you start
whenever<00:00:45.989> you're<00:00:46.230> starting<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.980> answer

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.049 

calculating<00:00:51.600> medications<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:53.059> be

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
calculating medications you have to be

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.569 
calculating medications you have to be
concerned<00:00:54.510> first<00:00:54.899> what<00:00:55.500> are<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.949> looking<00:00:56.250> for

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
concerned first what are you looking for

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.910 
concerned first what are you looking for
and<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:57.180> time<00:00:57.390> you're<00:00:57.600> looking<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.230> MLS<00:00:58.770> per

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
and this time you're looking for MLS per

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.000 
and this time you're looking for MLS per
hour<00:00:59.210> so<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.320> what<00:01:01.469> we're<00:01:01.590> going<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.829> do

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
hour so this is what we're going to do

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.880 
hour so this is what we're going to do
we're<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.879> label<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.890> order

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
we're going to label this one a order

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.320 
we're going to label this one a order
infused<00:01:05.339> dopamine<00:01:05.729> at<00:01:05.820> eight<00:01:05.970> miles<00:01:06.240> per

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
infused dopamine at eight miles per

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.359 
infused dopamine at eight miles per
kilogram<00:01:06.810> per<00:01:06.960> minute<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.320> definitely<00:01:08.130> this

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
kilogram per minute so definitely this

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.640 
kilogram per minute so definitely this
is<00:01:08.580> your<00:01:08.790> doctor's<00:01:09.180> order<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.170> we're<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.500> to

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
is your doctor's order so we're going to

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.280 
is your doctor's order so we're going to
write<00:01:10.830> here<00:01:11.780> eight<00:01:13.400> Mike's<00:01:14.400> okay<00:01:15.290> per

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
write here eight Mike's okay per

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.770 
write here eight Mike's okay per
kilogram<00:01:17.479> okay<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.009> then<00:01:20.299> we're<00:01:21.299> going<00:01:21.450> to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
kilogram okay and then we're going to

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.480 
kilogram okay and then we're going to
put<00:01:22.020> where<00:01:22.530> we're<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.950> put<00:01:23.100> minutes

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
put where we're going to put minutes

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.539 
put where we're going to put minutes
minutes<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:25.580> also<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:28.100> denominator<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.400> we're

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
minutes is also a denominator so we're

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.260 
minutes is also a denominator so we're
going<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.850> put<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:31.729> below<00:01:32.729> okay<00:01:33.979> now<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.880> we

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
going to put it below okay now as so we

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.020 
going to put it below okay now as so we
know<00:01:36.390> we're<00:01:36.570> looking<00:01:36.600> for<00:01:36.869> MLS<00:01:37.590> per<00:01:37.710> hour<00:01:38.030> so

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
know we're looking for MLS per hour so

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.550 
know we're looking for MLS per hour so
we<00:01:39.689> better<00:01:40.610> cancel<00:01:41.899> we<00:01:42.899> could<00:01:43.079> choose<00:01:43.320> well

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
we better cancel we could choose well

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.469 
we better cancel we could choose well
where<00:01:43.829> do<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.100> have<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.579> start<00:01:44.909> first<00:01:45.149> either

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
where do we have to start first either

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.780 
where do we have to start first either
we<00:01:45.689> cancel<00:01:46.170> Mike's<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.710> cancel<00:01:47.130> kilograms<00:01:47.640> or

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
we cancel Mike's we cancel kilograms or

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.100 
we cancel Mike's we cancel kilograms or
we<00:01:47.909> cancel<00:01:48.329> minutes<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:50.509> for<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> purpose<00:01:51.960> of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
we cancel minutes and for the purpose of

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.889 
we cancel minutes and for the purpose of
this<00:01:52.290> lesson<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:53.060> think<00:01:54.060> it's<00:01:54.180> better<00:01:54.390> it's

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
this lesson I think it's better it's

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.609 
this lesson I think it's better it's
easier<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.320> us<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.950> cancel<00:01:56.939> minute<00:01:57.719> first<00:01:57.960> so

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
easier for us to cancel minute first so

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.880 
easier for us to cancel minute first so
that<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:58.860> could<00:01:59.070> get<00:01:59.219> our<00:01:59.689> okay<00:02:00.689> so

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.960 

how<00:02:04.520> many<00:02:05.020> minutes<00:02:06.020> are<00:02:06.200> there<00:02:06.410> in<00:02:06.650> one<00:02:06.860> hour

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
how many minutes are there in one hour

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.890 
how many minutes are there in one hour
there<00:02:07.970> there<00:02:08.360> is<00:02:08.539> what<00:02:08.869> there<00:02:09.710> are<00:02:09.890> 60<00:02:10.460> minutes

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
there there is what there are 60 minutes

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.140 
there there is what there are 60 minutes
so<00:02:11.900> if<00:02:12.050> let's<00:02:12.320> put<00:02:12.500> 60<00:02:12.650> minutes<00:02:13.070> and<00:02:13.220> then<00:02:13.910> we

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
so if let's put 60 minutes and then we

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.660 
so if let's put 60 minutes and then we
have<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.510> put<00:02:14.690> one<00:02:14.900> hour<00:02:15.110> here<00:02:15.740> as<00:02:15.890> our

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
have to put one hour here as our

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.050 
have to put one hour here as our
denominator<00:02:17.710> why<00:02:18.710> are<00:02:18.770> we<00:02:18.920> putting<00:02:19.130> our<00:02:19.730> as<00:02:20.030> a

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
denominator why are we putting our as a

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.520 
denominator why are we putting our as a
denominator<00:02:20.600> because<00:02:20.930> that's<00:02:21.170> what<00:02:21.350> we're

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
denominator because that's what we're

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
denominator because that's what we're
looking<00:02:21.800> for<00:02:22.070> you<00:02:22.730> see<00:02:22.910> that<00:02:23.090> ml<00:02:24.160> is<00:02:25.160> your

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
looking for you see that ml is your

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.220 
looking for you see that ml is your
numerator<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.720> our<00:02:27.020> is<00:02:27.380> your<00:02:27.560> denominator<00:02:28.130> so

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
numerator and our is your denominator so

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.840 
numerator and our is your denominator so
whenever<00:02:30.230> you're<00:02:30.590> doing<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.370> dimensional

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
whenever you're doing a dimensional

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.720 
whenever you're doing a dimensional
analysis<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:33.620> want<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.920> make<00:02:34.070> sure<00:02:34.310> that<00:02:34.520> your

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
analysis you want to make sure that your

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.800 
analysis you want to make sure that your
ml<00:02:35.209> is<00:02:35.480> your<00:02:36.320> numerator<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:38.180> end<00:02:38.360> up<00:02:38.510> that

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
ml is your numerator and you end up that

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.590 
ml is your numerator and you end up that
your<00:02:39.080> hour<00:02:39.320> is<00:02:39.500> your<00:02:39.920> denominator<00:02:40.570> so<00:02:41.570> let's

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
your hour is your denominator so let's

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.890 
your hour is your denominator so let's
cancel<00:02:41.989> minute<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.680> minute<00:02:42.830> okay<00:02:43.459> now<00:02:44.239> we

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
cancel minute and minute okay now we

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.750 
cancel minute and minute okay now we
have<00:02:45.170> our<00:02:45.860> as<00:02:46.520> our<00:02:46.730> denominator<00:02:48.520> okay<00:02:49.520> and

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
have our as our denominator okay and

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.160 
have our as our denominator okay and
then<00:02:50.180> after<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:51.070> we<00:02:52.070> want<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.400> cancel

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
then after that we want to cancel

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.990 
then after that we want to cancel
micrograms<00:02:54.170> okay<00:02:54.830> how<00:02:55.430> are<00:02:55.580> we<00:02:55.670> going<00:02:55.850> to

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
micrograms okay how are we going to

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.780 
micrograms okay how are we going to
cancel<00:02:56.530> micrograms

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
cancel micrograms

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.900 
cancel micrograms
so<00:02:58.790> canceling<00:02:59.330> micrograms<00:02:59.870> is<00:03:00.459> easy<00:03:01.459> because

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
so canceling micrograms is easy because

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.580 
so canceling micrograms is easy because
we<00:03:02.870> have<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.140> Gibbon<00:03:03.530> in<00:03:03.739> our<00:03:04.510> on<00:03:05.510> hand<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.350> our

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
we have a Gibbon in our on hand the our

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.390 
we have a Gibbon in our on hand the our
stuff<00:03:07.010> on<00:03:07.160> hand<00:03:07.400> is<00:03:07.640> dopamine<00:03:08.630> mix<00:03:09.140> with<00:03:09.620> 800

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
stuff on hand is dopamine mix with 800

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.500 
stuff on hand is dopamine mix with 800
milligrams<00:03:10.850> over<00:03:12.010> 500<00:03:13.010> ml<00:03:13.400> so<00:03:13.580> 500<00:03:14.030> CC's<00:03:14.390> of

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
milligrams over 500 ml so 500 CC's of

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.410 
milligrams over 500 ml so 500 CC's of
the<00:03:14.690> five<00:03:14.870> water<00:03:15.519> so<00:03:16.519> why<00:03:16.760> are<00:03:16.820> we<00:03:16.910> going<00:03:17.090> to

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
the five water so why are we going to

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:25.270 
the five water so why are we going to
put<00:03:19.239> so<00:03:20.239> micrograms<00:03:21.049> so<00:03:21.549> one<00:03:23.110> milligram<00:03:24.280> okay

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
put so micrograms so one milligram okay

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.070 
put so micrograms so one milligram okay
we're<00:03:25.880> going<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.209> put<00:03:26.390> milligram<00:03:26.780> as<00:03:26.930> our

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
we're going to put milligram as our

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.170 
we're going to put milligram as our
numerator<00:03:27.620> because<00:03:28.489> we<00:03:28.670> wanna<00:03:28.910> put<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.170> 1000

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
numerator because we wanna put the 1000

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.080 
numerator because we wanna put the 1000
micro<00:03:32.180> gram<00:03:32.480> as<00:03:33.730> our<00:03:35.080> denominator<00:03:36.280> why<00:03:37.280> so

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
micro gram as our denominator why so

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.360 
micro gram as our denominator why so
that<00:03:38.120> we<00:03:38.360> could<00:03:38.570> able<00:03:39.110> to<00:03:39.410> we<00:03:40.040> would<00:03:40.160> be<00:03:40.250> able

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
that we could able to we would be able

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.990 
that we could able to we would be able
to<00:03:40.549> cancel<00:03:40.910> micrograms<00:03:41.780> as<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:43.250> dinner<00:03:43.519> as

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
to cancel micrograms as the dinner as

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.470 
to cancel micrograms as the dinner as
the<00:03:44.450> numerator<00:03:44.840> there<00:03:45.080> and<00:03:45.799> as<00:03:46.519> the<00:03:46.850> numerator

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
the numerator there and as the numerator

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.370 
the numerator there and as the numerator
here<00:03:47.989> or<00:03:48.440> denominator<00:03:49.070> here<00:03:49.510> now<00:03:50.510> we<00:03:51.260> were

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
here or denominator here now we were

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.789 
here or denominator here now we were
stuck<00:03:51.709> with<00:03:52.060> milligrams<00:03:53.060> right<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:54.549> we<00:03:55.549> have

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
stuck with milligrams right and we have

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.590 
stuck with milligrams right and we have
800<00:03:58.360> milligrams<00:03:59.360> and<00:04:00.250> 500<00:04:01.250> ml<00:04:01.549> so<00:04:02.299> are<00:04:02.450> we

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
800 milligrams and 500 ml so are we

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.449 
800 milligrams and 500 ml so are we
going<00:04:02.750> to<00:04:02.870> put<00:04:03.140> our<00:04:03.290> ml<00:04:04.630> okay<00:04:05.630> remember<00:04:06.590> our<00:04:06.769> ml

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
going to put our ml okay remember our ml

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.229 
going to put our ml okay remember our ml
is<00:04:07.760> always<00:04:08.360> what<00:04:08.600> is<00:04:08.780> always<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:10.760> numerator

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
is always what is always the numerator

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.990 
is always what is always the numerator
so<00:04:11.540> we<00:04:11.660> have<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.900> put<00:04:12.110> 500<00:04:13.569> ml<00:04:14.569> here<00:04:14.959> and<00:04:16.000> we

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
so we have to put 500 ml here and we

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.479 
so we have to put 500 ml here and we
have<00:04:17.180> to<00:04:17.390> put<00:04:17.919> milligram<00:04:18.919> as<00:04:19.070> our<00:04:19.220> denominator

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
have to put milligram as our denominator

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.540 
have to put milligram as our denominator
and<00:04:20.150> why<00:04:20.330> are<00:04:20.390> we<00:04:20.510> doing<00:04:20.660> that<00:04:20.810> because<00:04:21.260> of<00:04:21.739> the

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
and why are we doing that because of the

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.450 
and why are we doing that because of the
milligram<00:04:23.000> here<00:04:23.330> okay<00:04:23.990> so<00:04:24.229> that<00:04:25.190> we<00:04:25.310> can

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
milligram here okay so that we can

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.380 
milligram here okay so that we can
cancel<00:04:26.320> milligram<00:04:27.640> so<00:04:28.640> we<00:04:28.820> want<00:04:29.030> to<00:04:29.150> put<00:04:29.330> 800

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
cancel milligram so we want to put 800

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
cancel milligram so we want to put 800
milligrams<00:04:32.390> here<00:04:33.250> so<00:04:34.720> in<00:04:35.720> order<00:04:35.900> for<00:04:36.050> us<00:04:36.260> to

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
milligrams here so in order for us to

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.760 
milligrams here so in order for us to
cancel<00:04:37.300> milligram<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.479> that's<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.530> reason

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
cancel milligram and that's the reason

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.610 
cancel milligram and that's the reason
why<00:04:39.890> we<00:04:40.789> put<00:04:41.180> replace<00:04:41.810> milligram<00:04:42.320> as<00:04:42.470> our

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
why we put replace milligram as our

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.440 
why we put replace milligram as our
denominator<00:04:42.890> so<00:04:43.490> that<00:04:43.610> we<00:04:43.729> could<00:04:43.880> cancel<00:04:44.090> it

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
denominator so that we could cancel it

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.020 
denominator so that we could cancel it
against<00:04:45.229> the<00:04:45.349> new<00:04:45.500> marina<00:04:46.190> grande<00:04:47.650> numerator

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
against the new marina grande numerator

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.969 
against the new marina grande numerator
so<00:04:50.380> we<00:04:51.380> cancel<00:04:51.800> milligram<00:04:52.250> and<00:04:52.430> milligram<00:04:52.910> and

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
so we cancel milligram and milligram and

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.300 
so we cancel milligram and milligram and
what<00:04:54.979> we're<00:04:55.550> getting<00:04:55.729> mls<00:04:56.390> already<00:04:56.919> but<00:04:57.919> we're

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
what we're getting mls already but we're

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.610 
what we're getting mls already but we're
not<00:04:58.490> yet<00:04:58.610> done<00:04:58.910> because<00:04:59.330> we<00:05:00.080> want<00:05:00.349> to<00:05:00.440> cancel

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
not yet done because we want to cancel

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.920 
not yet done because we want to cancel
kilogram<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.640> in<00:05:01.940> order<00:05:02.150> for<00:05:02.180> us<00:05:02.390> to<00:05:02.479> do<00:05:02.720> that

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
kilogram and in order for us to do that

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.360 
kilogram and in order for us to do that
we<00:05:03.800> will<00:05:03.979> we<00:05:04.190> have<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.490> put<00:05:04.640> one<00:05:04.849> kilogram<00:05:05.180> here

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
we will we have to put one kilogram here

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.180 
we will we have to put one kilogram here
okay<00:05:07.370> so<00:05:08.240> that<00:05:08.360> we<00:05:08.479> could<00:05:08.660> cancel<00:05:08.840> that<00:05:09.260> but

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
okay so that we could cancel that but

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
okay so that we could cancel that but
what<00:05:10.580> is<00:05:10.700> our<00:05:11.349> what<00:05:12.349> is<00:05:12.500> our<00:05:12.680> given<00:05:13.220> pounds

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
what is our what is our given pounds

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.310 
what is our what is our given pounds
patient<00:05:15.020> weight<00:05:15.260> is<00:05:15.640> 198<00:05:16.640> pounds<00:05:16.849> so<00:05:17.570> we<00:05:18.110> want

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
patient weight is 198 pounds so we want

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.500 
patient weight is 198 pounds so we want
to<00:05:18.440> put<00:05:19.330> 198<00:05:20.330> pounds<00:05:20.570> here<00:05:21.460> okay<00:05:22.490> and<00:05:25.510> 198

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
to put 198 pounds here okay and 198

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.670 
to put 198 pounds here okay and 198
pounds<00:05:26.810> is<00:05:28.479> 1<00:05:29.479> kilogram<00:05:29.780> is<00:05:30.080> how<00:05:30.200> many<00:05:30.440> pounds

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
pounds is 1 kilogram is how many pounds

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.820 
pounds is 1 kilogram is how many pounds
2.2<00:05:31.640> pounds<00:05:33.039> okay<00:05:34.539> so<00:05:35.539> that's<00:05:36.169> how<00:05:36.260> you<00:05:36.380> do<00:05:36.650> it

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830 
2.2 pounds okay so that's how you do it

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.100 
2.2 pounds okay so that's how you do it
now<00:05:37.220> you<00:05:37.970> want<00:05:38.120> to<00:05:38.150> cancel<00:05:38.360> all<00:05:38.780> of<00:05:38.930> your

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
now you want to cancel all of your

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.710 
now you want to cancel all of your
variables<00:05:39.470> now<00:05:39.849> cancel<00:05:40.849> kilograms<00:05:41.419> and

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
variables now cancel kilograms and

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.130 
variables now cancel kilograms and
kilograms<00:05:41.780> cancel<00:05:42.760> pounds<00:05:43.780> against<00:05:44.780> pounds

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
kilograms cancel pounds against pounds

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.920 
kilograms cancel pounds against pounds
so<00:05:46.070> what<00:05:46.340> you<00:05:46.490> really<00:05:46.700> have<00:05:46.820> here<00:05:47.120> right<00:05:47.690> now

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
so what you really have here right now

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.200 
so what you really have here right now
are<00:05:48.229> your<00:05:49.190> numbers<00:05:50.200> 865<00:05:51.200> hundred<00:05:51.800> and<00:05:52.120> 198

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
are your numbers 865 hundred and 198

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.029 
are your numbers 865 hundred and 198
that's<00:05:53.419> your<00:05:53.599> numerator<00:05:54.110> against<00:05:54.890> your

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
that's your numerator against your

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.089 
that's your numerator against your
denominator<00:05:55.580> that<00:05:55.820> are<00:05:56.030> what<00:05:56.740> 1802<00:05:57.740> point<00:05:57.950> 2

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099 
denominator that are what 1802 point 2

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:01.180 
denominator that are what 1802 point 2
now<00:05:59.090> you<00:05:59.630> want<00:05:59.810> to<00:05:59.900> multiply<00:05:59.990> everything<00:06:00.919> but

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
now you want to multiply everything but

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.480 
now you want to multiply everything but
multiplying<00:06:01.729> everything<00:06:02.150> would<00:06:02.570> give<00:06:02.840> you

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
multiplying everything would give you

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.790 
multiplying everything would give you
big<00:06:04.490> big<00:06:04.970> numbers<00:06:05.479> so<00:06:05.510> another<00:06:06.380> technique

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
big big numbers so another technique

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.490 
big big numbers so another technique
that<00:06:06.860> you<00:06:07.669> want<00:06:07.880> to<00:06:07.970> learn<00:06:08.120> or<00:06:08.360> you<00:06:09.229> want<00:06:09.409> to

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
that you want to learn or you want to

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.159 
that you want to learn or you want to
use<00:06:09.650> in<00:06:09.890> your<00:06:09.919> computation<00:06:10.340> is<00:06:11.330> to<00:06:11.539> cancel<00:06:11.990> all

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
use in your computation is to cancel all

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.529 
use in your computation is to cancel all
the<00:06:12.349> zeros<00:06:12.770> okay<00:06:13.070> again<00:06:13.729> and<00:06:15.490> denominator

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
the zeros okay again and denominator

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:19.240 
the zeros okay again and denominator
against<00:06:17.539> the<00:06:17.659> numerator<00:06:18.140> so<00:06:18.620> let's<00:06:18.800> count<00:06:19.010> all

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
against the numerator so let's count all

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:25.690 
against the numerator so let's count all
the<00:06:19.400> zeros<00:06:19.960> 1<00:06:20.960> 2<00:06:21.560> 3<00:06:23.289> pay<00:06:24.289> your<00:06:24.560> numerator<00:06:25.010> has<00:06:25.370> 1

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
the zeros 1 2 3 pay your numerator has 1

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.770 
the zeros 1 2 3 pay your numerator has 1
2<00:06:26.150> 3<00:06:26.450> 0<00:06:26.570> so<00:06:27.140> let's<00:06:27.380> cancel<00:06:27.560> this<00:06:27.950> 1<00:06:28.339> 2<00:06:28.640> 3

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
2 3 0 so let's cancel this 1 2 3

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.400 
2 3 0 so let's cancel this 1 2 3
one<00:06:29.900> two<00:06:30.620> three<00:06:32.350> okay<00:06:33.350> so<00:06:33.410> we're<00:06:34.190> stuck<00:06:34.460> with

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
one two three okay so we're stuck with

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.750 
one two three okay so we're stuck with
800<00:06:36.410> time<00:06:36.710> is<00:06:36.889> 2.2<00:06:37.460> so<00:06:38.120> 800<00:06:38.980> multiplied<00:06:39.980> by<00:06:40.130> 2.2

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
800 time is 2.2 so 800 multiplied by 2.2

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:51.490 
800 time is 2.2 so 800 multiplied by 2.2
and<00:06:41.389> that<00:06:42.050> is<00:06:42.200> equivalent<00:06:42.440> to<00:06:48.400> 1760<00:06:49.570> okay<00:06:50.570> then

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 
and that is equivalent to 1760 okay then

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.770 
and that is equivalent to 1760 okay then
don't<00:06:51.590> forget<00:06:51.770> to<00:06:52.389> drag<00:06:53.560> that<00:06:54.560> hour<00:06:54.800> and<00:06:55.780> then

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
don't forget to drag that hour and then

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.230 
don't forget to drag that hour and then
we<00:06:57.130> owned<00:06:59.740> how<00:07:00.740> many<00:07:00.950> did<00:07:01.250> we<00:07:01.280> cancel<00:07:01.790> 3<00:07:01.970> right

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 
we owned how many did we cancel 3 right

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.260 
we owned how many did we cancel 3 right
1<00:07:02.270> 2<00:07:02.810> 3<00:07:03.470> okay<00:07:03.980> and<00:07:04.220> then<00:07:04.610> we<00:07:04.760> want<00:07:04.970> to<00:07:05.030> kind<00:07:05.180> of

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270 
1 2 3 okay and then we want to kind of

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.370 
1 2 3 okay and then we want to kind of
we<00:07:05.419> wanna<00:07:06.130> cancel<00:07:07.180> we<00:07:08.180> want<00:07:08.390> to<00:07:08.450> multiply<00:07:08.540> 8

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:09.380 
we wanna cancel we want to multiply 8

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.570 
we wanna cancel we want to multiply 8
times<00:07:09.770> 6<00:07:10.370> times<00:07:10.610> 5<00:07:10.790> times<00:07:11.419> 1<00:07:11.660> and<00:07:11.840> 8<00:07:11.990> so<00:07:12.380> 8<00:07:12.590> time

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.580 
times 6 times 5 times 1 and 8 so 8 time

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:21.130 
times 6 times 5 times 1 and 8 so 8 time
is<00:07:13.820> 6<00:07:14.150> times<00:07:15.220> 5<00:07:16.220> times<00:07:18.250> 198<00:07:19.250> and<00:07:19.930> this<00:07:20.930> is

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.140 
is 6 times 5 times 198 and this is

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:28.090 
is 6 times 5 times 198 and this is
equivalent<00:07:21.500> to<00:07:22.510> 40<00:07:25.690> 7520<00:07:26.720> again<00:07:27.050> um<00:07:27.590> you<00:07:27.950> want

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:28.100 
equivalent to 40 7520 again um you want

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.870 
equivalent to 40 7520 again um you want
to<00:07:28.130> cancel<00:07:28.840> you<00:07:29.840> want<00:07:30.020> to<00:07:30.080> go<00:07:30.229> up<00:07:30.729> against<00:07:31.729> the

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:31.880 
to cancel you want to go up against the

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.219 
to cancel you want to go up against the
denominator<00:07:32.600> okay<00:07:34.330> you<00:07:35.330> want<00:07:35.510> to<00:07:35.600> go<00:07:35.750> against

00:07:36.219 --> 00:07:36.229 
denominator okay you want to go against

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:37.659 
denominator okay you want to go against
the<00:07:36.380> denominator<00:07:36.919> so<00:07:37.160> you<00:07:37.190> want<00:07:37.400> to<00:07:37.490> cancel

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:37.669 
the denominator so you want to cancel

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:41.800 
the denominator so you want to cancel
this<00:07:38.000> 0<00:07:38.840> and<00:07:39.169> 0<00:07:39.740> so<00:07:40.040> you<00:07:40.100> will<00:07:40.479> you're<00:07:41.479> left

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:41.810 
this 0 and 0 so you will you're left

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:50.920 
this 0 and 0 so you will you're left
with<00:07:43.930> 4752<00:07:45.520> divided<00:07:46.520> by<00:07:48.370> 176<00:07:49.570> which<00:07:50.570> is<00:07:50.750> what

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:50.930 
with 4752 divided by 176 which is what

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:57.330 
with 4752 divided by 176 which is what
so<00:07:51.740> you're<00:07:51.890> getting<00:07:52.280> what<00:07:53.350> 27<00:07:54.700> MLS<00:07:55.700> per<00:07:56.180> hour

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:57.340 
so you're getting what 27 MLS per hour

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.310 
so you're getting what 27 MLS per hour
per<00:07:58.340> hour<00:07:58.729> so<00:07:59.510> that's<00:07:59.660> your<00:07:59.840> answer

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:00.320 
per hour so that's your answer

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.350 
per hour so that's your answer
now<00:08:01.039> there's<00:08:01.250> another<00:08:01.310> solution<00:08:01.880> for<00:08:02.210> this

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:02.360 
now there's another solution for this

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.170 
now there's another solution for this
one<00:08:02.570> and<00:08:02.919> the<00:08:03.919> other<00:08:04.010> solution<00:08:04.310> I<00:08:04.820> will

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:05.180 
one and the other solution I will
