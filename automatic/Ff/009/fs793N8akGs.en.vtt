00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.619
 how about friends my name is uriel batres 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.240
 founder of virtuoso productions and today 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:15.939
 I want to invite you to my new course of 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.220
 piano and keyboard this course consists of 52 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:20.410
 lessons divided into 12 modules in 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.269
 complete with one year in the course 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.220
 of piano and keyboard we will see all the 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.050
 most used techniques to learn to 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.340
 play this instrument from the most 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:33.030
 basic to the most advanced 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.840
 we will be using chord blocks in 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.840
 very closed positions 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.730
 ah 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.829
 some of the concepts addressed in 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.899
 this course you will not find them in 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.089
 no other side as is my exclusive 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.769
 braille piano system the only 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.409
 system that will help you learn to 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.870
 touch without seeing the keys and you're going to play 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.360
 the major triads in their three in their 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.860
 three positions starting at the 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.129
 fundamental for the left hand 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.129
 if you notice here I am in the octave c 2 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.570
 and the first roll sounds if you go to 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.270
 change the boxing to the next 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.000
 position and then the next pressure and 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.920
 then back another of the issues that 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.990
 we address in depth is the system of 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.090
 movable one of the most 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.820
 effective to develop the musical ear 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.010
 and be able to touch without needing to be 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.630
 seeing the logics now the diagram that 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.820
 you are seeing on the blackboard screen 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:39.040
 virtual is precisely the diagram of 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.290
 our system do moble the note c in 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.780
 this case we are going to refer to this note 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:49.380
 comfortable our central do the second 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.750
 degree is 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.189
 you will also learn to harmonize any 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.770
 song in any hue 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.710
 using sophisticated harmonies with 11 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.960
 beans 3 and beans and chromatic harmonies and 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.420
 this sound is used a lot 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.280
 also in jazz and in many other 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.280
 direction styles 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.560

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.480
 you can study again and again in the
