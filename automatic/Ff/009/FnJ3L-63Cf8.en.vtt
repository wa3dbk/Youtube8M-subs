population some people have the disease

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.210 
population some people have the disease
others<00:00:27.330> don't<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:28.439> terms<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> outcome

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220

others don't and in terms of the outcome
of<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.369> test

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
of the test

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.490 
of the test
some<00:00:30.029> people<00:00:30.300> will<00:00:30.449> test<00:00:30.720> positive<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.349> some

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
some people will test positive and some

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.049 
some people will test positive and some
people<00:00:31.769> won't<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.640> when<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:32.880> talk<00:00:33.030> about

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
people won't so when we talk about

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.420 
people won't so when we talk about
sensitivity<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.290> mean<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.680> all<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.160> people

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
sensitivity we mean of all the people

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.430 
sensitivity we mean of all the people
that<00:00:35.790> are<00:00:35.850> positive<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.050> people<00:00:37.410> that

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
that are positive that the people that

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.220 
that are positive that the people that
are<00:00:37.620> circled<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.100> green<00:00:38.420> what<00:00:39.420> proportion<00:00:40.140> of

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
are circled in green what proportion of

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.250 
are circled in green what proportion of
those<00:00:40.670> actually<00:00:41.670> test<00:00:41.969> positive<00:00:42.210> those<00:00:43.140> are

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
those actually test positive those are

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260 
those actually test positive those are
the<00:00:43.350> people<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.620> are<00:00:43.710> circled<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.309> red<00:00:44.370> so

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
the people that are circled in red so

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.910 
the people that are circled in red so
it's<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> fraction<00:00:45.629> sixty-six<00:00:46.350> over<00:00:46.530> seventy

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
it's a fraction sixty-six over seventy

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
it's a fraction sixty-six over seventy
gives<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.219> point<00:00:47.730> nine<00:00:47.879> four<00:00:48.120> times<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.930> by<00:00:49.050> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
gives you point nine four times it by a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.150 
gives you point nine four times it by a
hundred<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.559> you've<00:00:49.649> got<00:00:49.770> ninety<00:00:50.010> four

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
hundred and you've got ninety four

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.340 
hundred and you've got ninety four
percent<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.700> test<00:00:50.940> will<00:00:51.149> identify<00:00:51.350> ninety

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
percent the test will identify ninety

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.510 
percent the test will identify ninety
four<00:00:52.559> percent<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> people<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.430> actually

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
four percent of the people that actually

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.040 
four percent of the people that actually
have<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> disease<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.629> next<00:00:54.870> thing<00:00:54.960> we're

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
have the disease the next thing we're

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.319 
have the disease the next thing we're
going<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.230> talk<00:00:55.379> about<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.800> specificity<00:00:56.670> we're

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
going to talk about is specificity we're

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.790 
going to talk about is specificity we're
interested<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> population<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.649> people

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
interested in the population of people

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.799 
interested in the population of people
who<00:00:59.010> are<00:00:59.250> actually<00:00:59.399> negative<00:00:59.789> those<00:01:00.570> are<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
who are actually negative those are the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.900 
who are actually negative those are the
ones<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.020> encircled<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.710> green<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.219> want

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
ones that encircled in green and we want

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.700 
ones that encircled in green and we want
to<00:01:02.969> know<00:01:03.090> what<00:01:03.510> proportion<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.140> those<00:01:04.320> people

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
to know what proportion of those people

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.490 
to know what proportion of those people
taste<00:01:05.489> negative<00:01:06.000> those<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:07.049> encircled

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
taste negative those that are encircled

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.010 
taste negative those that are encircled
in<00:01:07.590> red<00:01:07.880> so<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.060> case<00:01:09.299> those<00:01:09.510> encircled

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
in red so in this case those encircled

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.020 
in red so in this case those encircled
in<00:01:10.110> red<00:01:10.260> are<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> true<00:01:10.799> negatives<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.729> here<00:01:11.939> we

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
in red are the true negatives so here we

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.310 
in red are the true negatives so here we
saying<00:01:12.530> 827<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.490> 830<00:01:15.240> will<00:01:15.810> correctly

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
saying 827 of the 830 will correctly

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.910 
saying 827 of the 830 will correctly
test<00:01:16.650> negative<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.520> 827<00:01:18.360> over<00:01:18.570> 830<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.409> 0.99

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
test negative so 827 over 830 is 0.99

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.969 
test negative so 827 over 830 is 0.99
which<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.640> 99%<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.259> people<00:01:22.290> who<00:01:22.650> don't<00:01:22.890> have

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
which is 99% so of people who don't have

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.280 
which is 99% so of people who don't have
the<00:01:23.220> disease<00:01:23.780> 99%<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.869> them<00:01:25.020> will<00:01:25.200> be

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
the disease 99% of them will be

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.410 
the disease 99% of them will be
correctly<00:01:25.770> identified<00:01:26.280> by<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.520> test<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.360> I'm

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
correctly identified by this test so I'm

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.130 
correctly identified by this test so I'm
not<00:01:27.540> going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.750> go<00:01:27.810> through<00:01:27.960> all<00:01:28.049> the

not going to go through all the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.780 
not going to go through all the
calculations<00:01:28.650> again<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:29.310> positive<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
calculations again for positive and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.340 
calculations again for positive and
negative<00:01:30.060> predictive<00:01:30.150> value<00:01:30.630> basically<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
negative predictive value basically the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.780 
negative predictive value basically the

exact same principle applies the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.130 
exact same principle applies the
positive<00:01:33.210> predictive<00:01:33.329> value<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
positive predictive value is the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.690 
positive predictive value is the
proportion<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.710> people<00:01:34.890> who<00:01:35.100> test<00:01:35.640> positive

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
proportion of people who test positive

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.969 
proportion of people who test positive
who<00:01:36.450> actually<00:01:36.659> are<00:01:36.990> positive<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.860> the

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
who actually are positive so the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.219 
who actually are positive so the
positive<00:01:38.310> predictive<00:01:38.460> value<00:01:39.000> tells<00:01:39.299> me<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.750> I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
positive predictive value tells me if I

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.920 
positive predictive value tells me if I
go<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> test<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.430> test<00:01:41.729> positive<00:01:41.930> what

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
go for a test and I test positive what

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.660 
go for a test and I test positive what
are<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> chances<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.040> actually<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
are the chances that I actually have the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.310 
are the chances that I actually have the
disease<00:01:44.909> now<00:01:45.540> there's<00:01:45.750> an<00:01:45.840> important

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
disease now there's an important

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.289 
disease now there's an important
difference<00:01:46.710> between<00:01:46.909> sensitivity<00:01:47.909> and

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
difference between sensitivity and

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.179 
difference between sensitivity and
specificity<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:49.079> positive<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:49.890> negative

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
specificity and positive and negative

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.499 
specificity and positive and negative
predictive<00:01:50.280> values<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:50.970> need<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.180> explain

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
predictive values and I need to explain

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.100 
predictive values and I need to explain
this<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.840> you

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
this to you

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.929 
this to you
when<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.500> look<00:01:52.649> at<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> sensitivity<00:01:53.220> test<00:01:53.729> for

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
when we look at the sensitivity test for

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.420 
when we look at the sensitivity test for
example<00:01:54.450> everybody<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.860> green<00:01:56.130> circle

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
example everybody in the green circle

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.149 
example everybody in the green circle
actually<00:01:57.420> has<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.930> disease<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
actually has the disease and so the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.800 
actually has the disease and so the
difference<00:01:59.490> between<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.880> numerator<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
difference between the numerator and the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.260 
difference between the numerator and the
denominator<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.710> numerator<00:02:02.009> being<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.759> 66

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
denominator the numerator being the 66

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.389 
denominator the numerator being the 66
people<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.079> denominator<00:02:04.560> being<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> 66

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
people and the denominator being the 66

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.029 
people and the denominator being the 66
plus<00:02:05.610> 4<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> 70<00:02:06.810> people<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.710> difference

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
plus 4 so the 70 people the difference

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.760 
plus 4 so the 70 people the difference
between<00:02:08.190> those<00:02:08.610> two<00:02:08.940> groups<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.229> function

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
between those two groups is a function

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.229 
between those two groups is a function
of<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> characteristics<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.000> test

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
of the characteristics of the test

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.490 
of the characteristics of the test
itself<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.959> it's<00:02:13.230> not

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
itself and it's not

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.290 
itself and it's not
affected<00:02:13.950> at<00:02:14.040> all<00:02:14.160> by<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.610> prevalence<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:15.210> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
disease because everybody in that group

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.130 
disease because everybody in that group
has<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.940> disease<00:02:18.240> in<00:02:18.690> other<00:02:18.780> words<00:02:18.990> it

everybody<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.850> we're<00:02:23.970> looking<00:02:24.060> at<00:02:24.330> actually

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
everybody that we're looking at actually

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.960 
everybody that we're looking at actually
has<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.230> disease<00:02:25.470> now<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.280> not<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.760> case

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
has the disease now this is not the case

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.220 
has the disease now this is not the case
for<00:02:27.270> positive<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.780> negative<00:02:28.080> predictive

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
for positive and negative predictive

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.350 
for positive and negative predictive
values<00:02:28.830> because<00:02:29.550> when<00:02:29.760> we're<00:02:29.940> looking<00:02:30.090> at<00:02:30.300> a

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
values because when we're looking at a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.790 
values because when we're looking at a
positive<00:02:30.720> or<00:02:30.840> negative<00:02:31.110> predictive<00:02:31.320> value

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
positive or negative predictive value

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.680 
positive or negative predictive value
the<00:02:32.400> difference<00:02:32.790> between<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.120> denominator

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
the difference between the denominator

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.080 
the difference between the denominator
in<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.990> numerator<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.620> affected<00:02:35.550> by<00:02:36.030> the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
in the numerator is affected by the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.160 
in the numerator is affected by the
prevalence<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.750> disease<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:37.140> the

prevalence of the disease in the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.990 
prevalence of the disease in the
community<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.100> it's<00:02:38.220> not<00:02:38.430> simply<00:02:38.850> a

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
community and so it's not simply a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.340 
community and so it's not simply a
function<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.600> characteristic<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.230> the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
function of the characteristic of the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.990 
function of the characteristic of the
test<00:02:40.560> itself<00:02:40.890> now<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.610> still<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.820> useful

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
test itself now this is still a useful

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.210 
test itself now this is still a useful
test<00:02:42.420> but<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.020> need<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.290> remember<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.860> when

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
test but you need to remember that when

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.710 
test but you need to remember that when
you're<00:02:44.340> comparing<00:02:44.670> one<00:02:45.000> test<00:02:45.270> with<00:02:45.450> another

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
you're comparing one test with another

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.479 
you're comparing one test with another
in<00:02:46.020> terms<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.680> positive<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.160> negative

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
in terms of the positive and negative

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.340 
in terms of the positive and negative
predictive<00:02:47.610> value<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.720> need<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.110> be<00:02:49.200> looking

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
predictive value you need to be looking

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.560 
predictive value you need to be looking
at<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.739> same<00:02:49.980> population<00:02:50.610> group<00:02:50.820> or<00:02:51.300> at<00:02:51.390> least

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
at the same population group or at least

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.970 
at the same population group or at least
population<00:02:52.080> groups<00:02:52.320> with<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.800> same

population groups with the same

population groups with the same
incidence<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.489> disease<00:02:53.820> okay<00:02:54.480> that's<00:02:54.690> all

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
incidence of disease okay that's all

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.940
