00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.870
I swear to you

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.250
we'll make it

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.010
Just take a sip

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.400
and let me drive this car

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.710
There's a god of the stoned

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.810
who wouldn't let us break it

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.680
This incredible journey is under the radar

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.220
Don't worry about anything in the whole universe,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.180
tomorrow we'll laugh about today

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.350
Anxiety will just make the travel worse

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.400
I promise nothing will stand in our way...

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.630
You’d better play

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.270
with your ticktocks

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.690
Get yourself a beat

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.510
give your heart some shocks

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.810
You’d better mock

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.040
this very sec’

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.530
You wear your woes

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.870
wrapped around your neck

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.890
Just pass the bottle,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.260
I need someone to save me

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.140
My mouth and throat are impossibly dry

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.640
I wish it was summer

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.870
and we were heading to the sea

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.770
I miss her eyes reflecting the sky...

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.770
You’d better play

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.320
with your ticktocks

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.830
Get yourself a beat

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.510
give your heart some shocks

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.660
You’d better mock

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.150
this very sec’

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.480
You wear your woes

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.630
 wrapped around your neck

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.931
Running to the border

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.922
of our consciousness's disorder,

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.950
our vision extends

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.460
To the beauty of the sunrise,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.450
saying our last goodbyes,

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.550
and time suspends...

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.400
Breaking into pieces

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.220
finally releases

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.450
the tensions we’ve stored

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.100
The survivors will have to

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.240
light some candles for those whom

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.490
they once adored...
