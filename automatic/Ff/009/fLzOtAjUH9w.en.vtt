00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
looking good so first thing I recommend

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:29.800 
looking good so first thing I recommend
doing<00:01:28.340> if<00:01:28.490> your<00:01:28.670> drum<00:01:29.030> that<00:01:29.209> does<00:01:29.420> still<00:01:29.660> have

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
doing if your drum that does still have

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.419 
doing if your drum that does still have
Tom<00:01:30.050> holder<00:01:30.350> on<00:01:30.440> it<00:01:30.560> as<00:01:30.649> you<00:01:30.800> take<00:01:31.009> it<00:01:31.130> out<00:01:31.250> and

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
Tom holder on it as you take it out and

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:33.669 
Tom holder on it as you take it out and
it<00:01:31.940> just<00:01:31.970> bolts<00:01:32.360> in<00:01:32.479> right<00:01:32.630> there<00:01:32.810> as<00:01:33.289> a<00:01:33.350> plate

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
it just bolts in right there as a plate

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.050 
it just bolts in right there as a plate
that'd<00:01:33.890> be<00:01:34.009> on<00:01:34.069> the<00:01:34.160> inside<00:01:34.250> when<00:01:34.850> you<00:01:34.910> take

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
that'd be on the inside when you take

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
rest of it we're gonna totally make from

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.099 
rest of it we're gonna totally make from
scratch<00:03:04.430> so<00:03:05.120> if<00:03:05.480> you're<00:03:05.659> gonna<00:03:05.750> make<00:03:05.840> yours

scratch so if you're gonna make yours

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.599 
scratch so if you're gonna make yours
exactly<00:03:06.620> like<00:03:06.769> mine<00:03:06.950> then<00:03:07.189> you<00:03:07.280> want<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.489> get

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
exactly like mine then you want to get

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.309 
exactly like mine then you want to get
down<00:03:07.849> to<00:03:08.000> this<00:03:08.120> point<00:03:08.329> to<00:03:08.510> strip<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:08.930> down<00:03:08.959> to

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
down to this point to strip it down to

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.199 
down to this point to strip it down to
the<00:03:09.409> basics<00:03:09.639> fill<00:03:10.639> in<00:03:10.760> some<00:03:10.909> of<00:03:10.969> the<00:03:11.030> holes

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
the basics fill in some of the holes

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.209 
the basics fill in some of the holes
with<00:03:11.510> some<00:03:11.689> bolts<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.799> know<00:03:12.919> some<00:03:13.069> nice

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:13.219 
with some bolts you know some nice

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.409 
with some bolts you know some nice
little<00:03:13.459> chrome<00:03:13.609> heads<00:03:13.819> on<00:03:13.969> there<00:03:14.120> just<00:03:14.359> to

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.419 
little chrome heads on there just to

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:15.759 
little chrome heads on there just to
make<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.599> look<00:03:14.719> a<00:03:14.840> little<00:03:14.959> better<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:15.379> I'll

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
make it look a little better and I'll

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.879 
make it look a little better and I'll
show<00:03:15.949> you<00:03:15.980> how<00:03:16.159> to<00:03:16.219> move<00:03:16.370> on<00:03:16.549> from<00:03:16.790> here<00:03:17.889> okay

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
show you how to move on from here okay

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.069 
show you how to move on from here okay
so<00:03:18.949> now<00:03:19.219> we<00:03:19.280> need<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.549> make<00:03:19.849> a<00:03:20.180> base<00:03:20.719> plate<00:03:21.049> for

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
so now we need to make a base plate for

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.890 
so now we need to make a base plate for
the<00:03:21.439> bottom<00:03:21.769> of<00:03:21.889> the<00:03:21.980> drum<00:03:22.219> and<00:03:22.459> then<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.359> bottom

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
the bottom of the drum and then a bottom

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.199 
the bottom of the drum and then a bottom
for<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.560> removable<00:03:24.949> top<00:03:25.310> for<00:03:25.699> the<00:03:25.819> top<00:03:25.849> side

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
for the removable top for the top side

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.610 
for the removable top for the top side
of<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.299> drum<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:27.109> we're<00:03:27.199> gonna<00:03:27.319> make<00:03:27.439> those

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
of the drum so we're gonna make those

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.860 
of the drum so we're gonna make those
out<00:03:27.769> of<00:03:27.859> plywood<00:03:28.099> so<00:03:28.849> like<00:03:29.239> I<00:03:29.359> said<00:03:29.419> my<00:03:29.569> bass

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
out of plywood so like I said my bass

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.439 
out of plywood so like I said my bass
drum<00:03:30.079> is<00:03:30.199> 22<00:03:30.590> inches<00:03:30.889> diameter<00:03:31.250> so<00:03:31.939> I<00:03:31.969> have<00:03:32.209> two

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:32.449 
drum is 22 inches diameter so I have two

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:33.999 
drum is 22 inches diameter so I have two
pieces<00:03:32.629> of<00:03:32.810> plywood<00:03:33.019> that<00:03:33.409> are<00:03:33.590> about<00:03:33.769> two

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:34.009 
pieces of plywood that are about two

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:36.369 
pieces of plywood that are about two
foot<00:03:34.220> by<00:03:34.250> two<00:03:34.400> foot<00:03:34.519> square<00:03:34.939> and<00:03:35.209> that<00:03:35.959> one<00:03:36.139> for

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
foot by two foot square and that one for

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.050 
foot by two foot square and that one for
the<00:03:36.470> bottom<00:03:36.620> piece<00:03:36.919> is<00:03:37.159> gonna<00:03:37.280> be<00:03:37.370> a<00:03:37.459> 3/4<00:03:38.030> inch

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
the bottom piece is gonna be a 3/4 inch

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.729 
the bottom piece is gonna be a 3/4 inch
piece<00:03:38.359> of<00:03:38.479> plywood<00:03:38.659> and<00:03:39.019> then<00:03:39.169> one<00:03:39.409> for<00:03:39.650> the

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
piece of plywood and then one for the

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.559 
piece of plywood and then one for the
top<00:03:39.949> you<00:03:40.340> can<00:03:40.370> use<00:03:40.519> just<00:03:40.879> half-inch<00:03:41.329> plywood

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
top you can use just half-inch plywood

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.199 
top you can use just half-inch plywood
so<00:03:42.379> all<00:03:42.650> you<00:03:42.739> got<00:03:42.859> to<00:03:42.949> do<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.609> grab<00:03:43.819> your<00:03:43.909> drum

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
so all you got to do is grab your drum

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.499 
so all you got to do is grab your drum
and<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.840> want<00:03:44.989> to<00:03:45.049> lay<00:03:45.169> it<00:03:45.349> on<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:47.299> plywood

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:47.509 
and you want to lay it on to the plywood

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:49.780 
and you want to lay it on to the plywood
so<00:03:48.379> that<00:03:48.530> it's<00:03:48.739> you<00:03:48.949> know<00:03:48.979> totally<00:03:49.489> covered

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
so that it's you know totally covered

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.030 
so that it's you know totally covered
and<00:03:49.939> then<00:03:50.359> just<00:03:50.540> take<00:03:50.659> a<00:03:50.689> pencil<00:03:50.930> and<00:03:51.769> you<00:03:51.889> want

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
and then just take a pencil and you want

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.280 
and then just take a pencil and you want
trace<00:03:52.250> around<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.729> entire<00:03:53.060> inside<00:03:53.569> and<00:03:54.169> the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
trace around the entire inside and the

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.680 
trace around the entire inside and the
whole<00:03:54.470> thing

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.840 

and<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:58.350> way<00:03:58.530> you<00:03:58.920> can<00:03:59.040> cut<00:03:59.250> this<00:03:59.400> out<00:03:59.580> and

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
and that way you can cut this out and

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.520 
and that way you can cut this out and
then<00:04:00.330> just<00:04:00.510> slightly<00:04:00.720> say<00:04:00.960> in<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:01.140> edges<00:04:01.410> so

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
then just slightly say in the edges so

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.440 
then just slightly say in the edges so
it's<00:04:01.650> nice<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:01.830> smooth<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.520> it'll<00:04:02.730> slip<00:04:03.000> just

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
it's nice and smooth and it'll slip just

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.420 
it's nice and smooth and it'll slip just
inside<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.020> drum<00:04:04.260> but<00:04:04.860> there<00:04:04.980> won't<00:04:05.100> be<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.250> big

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
inside the drum but there won't be a big

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.920 
inside the drum but there won't be a big
gap<00:04:05.610> or<00:04:05.790> anything<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.240> then<00:04:06.570> that<00:04:06.720> will<00:04:06.870> be

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
gap or anything and then that will be

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.630 
gap or anything and then that will be
the<00:04:06.960> base<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.620> then<00:04:07.920> we'll<00:04:08.040> do<00:04:08.100> exactly<00:04:08.520> the

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
the base and then we'll do exactly the

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.010 
the base and then we'll do exactly the
same<00:04:08.790> thing<00:04:09.000> on<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.210> half<00:04:09.360> inch<00:04:09.540> piece<00:04:09.780> that

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
same thing on the half inch piece that

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.840 
same thing on the half inch piece that
will<00:04:10.140> fit<00:04:10.290> on<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.530> top<00:04:10.800> so<00:04:11.400> I'll<00:04:11.490> cut<00:04:11.670> those

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
will fit on the top so I'll cut those

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.420 
will fit on the top so I'll cut those
out<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.180> I'll<00:04:12.270> show<00:04:12.300> you<00:04:12.420> what<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.630> do<00:04:12.750> next

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
out and I'll show you what to do next

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.670 
out and I'll show you what to do next
okay<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:14.490> I<00:04:14.610> have<00:04:14.760> both<00:04:14.940> this<00:04:15.240> cut<00:04:15.510> now<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:15.960> have

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680

go<00:04:26.040> onto<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.340> top<00:04:26.550> side<00:04:26.790> and<00:04:27.060> it's<00:04:27.180> just<00:04:27.390> a

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
go onto the top side and it's just a

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.970 
go onto the top side and it's just a
little<00:04:27.780> bit<00:04:27.900> loose<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:28.080> it'll<00:04:28.410> slide<00:04:28.530> in<00:04:28.830> and

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
little bit loose so it'll slide in and

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.620 
little bit loose so it'll slide in and
out<00:04:29.010> real<00:04:29.250> good<00:04:29.400> so<00:04:29.850> what<00:04:30.000> I'm<00:04:30.090> going<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.240> do<00:04:30.420> is

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
out real good so what I'm going to do is

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.120 
out real good so what I'm going to do is
the<00:04:30.840> bottom<00:04:31.170> piece<00:04:31.380> I'm<00:04:31.710> going<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.920> paint

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
the bottom piece I'm going to paint

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.860 
the bottom piece I'm going to paint
black<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:32.640> it<00:04:32.700> just<00:04:32.880> kind<00:04:33.060> of<00:04:33.090> disappears<00:04:33.630> and

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
black so it just kind of disappears and

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.870 
black so it just kind of disappears and
then<00:04:34.440> for<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.740> top<00:04:34.950> piece<00:04:35.160> I'm<00:04:35.370> also<00:04:35.580> going<00:04:35.820> to

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
then for the top piece I'm also going to

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.340 
then for the top piece I'm also going to
paint<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.210> black<00:04:36.390> but<00:04:36.630> first<00:04:36.930> we're<00:04:37.200> going<00:04:37.290> to

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
paint it black but first we're going to

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.430 
paint it black but first we're going to
use<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.740> to<00:04:37.920> fit<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:38.820> plank<00:04:39.390> top<00:04:39.660> so<00:04:40.200> that<00:04:40.350> we

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
use it to fit the plank top so that we

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.690 
use it to fit the plank top so that we
can<00:04:40.560> actually<00:04:40.710> cut<00:04:40.950> out<00:04:40.980> the<00:04:41.190> top<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.610> make

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
can actually cut out the top and make

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.830 
can actually cut out the top and make
that<00:04:41.820> all<00:04:41.970> work<00:04:42.150> so<00:04:42.180> I'll<00:04:42.330> show<00:04:42.480> you<00:04:42.510> how<00:04:42.600> to<00:04:42.720> do

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
that all work so I'll show you how to do

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.440 
that all work so I'll show you how to do
that<00:04:42.960> next<00:04:43.200> right<00:04:43.950> now<00:04:44.130> for<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.460> plank<00:04:44.700> top<00:04:44.910> as

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
that next right now for the plank top as

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.640 
that next right now for the plank top as
you<00:04:45.600> can<00:04:45.690> see<00:04:45.780> I<00:04:45.810> had<00:04:45.990> my<00:04:46.020> little<00:04:46.380> half-inch

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
you can see I had my little half-inch

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.260 
you can see I had my little half-inch
piece<00:04:46.890> of<00:04:47.040> plywood<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.520> have<00:04:47.640> it<00:04:47.730> laying<00:04:47.910> on

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
piece of plywood and I have it laying on

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.020 
piece of plywood and I have it laying on
five<00:04:49.260> planks<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:49.890> are<00:04:50.040> all<00:04:50.310> a<00:04:50.340> little<00:04:50.850> bit

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
five planks that are all a little bit

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.790 
five planks that are all a little bit
longer<00:04:51.300> than<00:04:51.570> 24<00:04:52.020> inches<00:04:52.050> because<00:04:52.620> we're

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
longer than 24 inches because we're

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.930 
longer than 24 inches because we're
eventually<00:04:53.190> going<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.460> hook<00:04:53.580> this<00:04:53.760> all

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
eventually going to hook this all

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.970 
eventually going to hook this all
together<00:04:54.090> and<00:04:54.450> cut<00:04:54.600> out<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.990> big<00:04:55.290> 24<00:04:55.800> inch

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
together and cut out a big 24 inch

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.610 
together and cut out a big 24 inch
circle<00:04:56.540> that<00:04:57.540> will<00:04:57.750> be<00:04:57.900> you<00:04:58.110> know<00:04:58.230> it'll<00:04:58.350> stick

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
circle that will be you know it'll stick

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.440 
circle that will be you know it'll stick
out<00:04:58.770> on<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.190> edge<00:04:59.400> of<00:04:59.640> the<00:04:59.820> drum<00:05:00.120> just<00:05:00.360> a

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
out on the edge of the drum just a

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.000 
out on the edge of the drum just a
little<00:05:00.750> bit<00:05:00.930> so<00:05:01.110> that<00:05:01.140> the<00:05:01.320> top<00:05:01.500> is<00:05:01.680> a<00:05:01.710> little

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
little bit so that the top is a little

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.210 
little bit so that the top is a little
bit<00:05:02.100> bigger<00:05:02.250> than<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.520> drum<00:05:02.700> but<00:05:03.450> these

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
bit bigger than the drum but these

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.260 
bit bigger than the drum but these
boards<00:05:05.220> I'm<00:05:05.340> just<00:05:05.520> using<00:05:05.700> because<00:05:06.060> they<00:05:06.180> were

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
boards I'm just using because they were

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.670 
boards I'm just using because they were
leftovers<00:05:06.750> from<00:05:06.900> when<00:05:07.080> we<00:05:07.200> were<00:05:07.320> doing<00:05:07.560> our

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
leftovers from when we were doing our

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.230 
leftovers from when we were doing our
house<00:05:07.860> I<00:05:08.130> actually<00:05:08.280> pulled<00:05:08.670> these<00:05:08.820> out<00:05:09.060> of<00:05:09.180> the

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
house I actually pulled these out of the

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.540 
house I actually pulled these out of the
bathroom<00:05:09.630> a<00:05:10.320> real<00:05:10.740> nightmare<00:05:11.040> looking

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
bathroom a real nightmare looking

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.250 
bathroom a real nightmare looking
bathroom<00:05:11.940> a<00:05:12.000> terrible<00:05:12.390> ugly<00:05:12.720> wooden<00:05:12.930> floors

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
bathroom a terrible ugly wooden floors

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.420 
bathroom a terrible ugly wooden floors
I'll<00:05:13.410> show<00:05:13.500> you<00:05:13.560> a<00:05:13.650> picture<00:05:13.920> to<00:05:14.100> show<00:05:14.130> you<00:05:14.280> how

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
I'll show you a picture to show you how

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:21.380 
I'll show you a picture to show you how
bad<00:05:14.640> it<00:05:14.670> was

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.640 

all<00:05:22.390> right<00:05:22.480> so<00:05:22.630> anyway<00:05:22.840> what<00:05:23.110> I<00:05:23.140> did<00:05:23.320> was<00:05:23.530> they

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
all right so anyway what I did was they

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.110 
all right so anyway what I did was they
were<00:05:23.710> originally<00:05:24.190> 1x6

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
were originally 1x6

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.880 
were originally 1x6
which<00:05:25.900> technically<00:05:26.410> you<00:05:26.620> know<00:05:26.740> the

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
which technically you know the

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.020 
which technically you know the
three-quarter<00:05:27.310> inch<00:05:27.400> stick<00:05:27.640> and<00:05:27.910> they<00:05:27.970> were

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
three-quarter inch stick and they were

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.760 
three-quarter inch stick and they were
five<00:05:28.300> and<00:05:28.420> a<00:05:28.450> half<00:05:28.480> inches<00:05:28.810> wide<00:05:28.840> but<00:05:29.410> I<00:05:29.470> cut

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
five and a half inches wide but I cut

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.230 
five and a half inches wide but I cut
him<00:05:29.890> down<00:05:30.040> to<00:05:30.280> four<00:05:30.550> and<00:05:30.760> three-quarter

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
him down to four and three-quarter

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.880 
him down to four and three-quarter
inches<00:05:31.450> wide<00:05:31.660> so<00:05:31.900> that<00:05:32.050> way<00:05:32.230> when<00:05:32.410> I<00:05:32.440> laid<00:05:32.650> five

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
inches wide so that way when I laid five

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.490 
inches wide so that way when I laid five
of<00:05:33.100> them<00:05:33.250> together<00:05:33.430> was<00:05:34.240> just<00:05:34.270> a<00:05:34.540> tiny<00:05:34.840> bit<00:05:35.260> of

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
of them together was just a tiny bit of

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.980 
of them together was just a tiny bit of
gap<00:05:35.710> in<00:05:35.920> between<00:05:36.010> they're<00:05:36.700> basically<00:05:37.390> 24

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
gap in between they're basically 24

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.540 
gap in between they're basically 24
inches<00:05:38.230> wide<00:05:38.290> which<00:05:38.680> is<00:05:38.710> what<00:05:39.070> I'm<00:05:39.160> wanting<00:05:39.370> a

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
inches wide which is what I'm wanting a

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.780 
inches wide which is what I'm wanting a
24<00:05:40.000> inch<00:05:40.120> top<00:05:40.390> so<00:05:41.140> I<00:05:41.440> laid<00:05:42.100> the<00:05:42.250> disc<00:05:42.430> on<00:05:42.610> there

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
24 inch top so I laid the disc on there

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.400 
24 inch top so I laid the disc on there
and<00:05:42.940> then<00:05:43.060> I'm<00:05:43.150> gonna<00:05:43.270> lay<00:05:43.540> the<00:05:43.780> bass-drum

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
and then I'm gonna lay the bass-drum

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.500 
and then I'm gonna lay the bass-drum
right<00:05:45.100> on<00:05:45.250> there<00:05:45.460> so<00:05:45.580> this<00:05:45.910> is<00:05:46.120> inside<00:05:46.420> the

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
right on there so this is inside the

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.180 
right on there so this is inside the
drum<00:05:46.720> and<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:46.930> bass<00:05:47.050> drum<00:05:47.110> is<00:05:47.440> now<00:05:47.620> sitting<00:05:47.920> on

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
drum and the bass drum is now sitting on

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.560 
drum and the bass drum is now sitting on
the<00:05:48.310> planks<00:05:48.700> and<00:05:48.820> I'll<00:05:48.970> show<00:05:49.180> you<00:05:49.240> how<00:05:49.540> to

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
the planks and I'll show you how to

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.720 
the planks and I'll show you how to
trace<00:05:49.990> them<00:05:50.170> out<00:05:50.260> to<00:05:50.410> cut<00:05:50.590> out<00:05:50.680> the<00:05:50.800> top<00:05:51.010> so

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
trace them out to cut out the top so

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.340 
trace them out to cut out the top so
once<00:05:51.880> I<00:05:51.940> laid<00:05:52.090> my<00:05:52.240> drum<00:05:52.450> down<00:05:52.630> on<00:05:52.960> top<00:05:53.169> of

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
once I laid my drum down on top of

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.909 
once I laid my drum down on top of
everything

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
everything

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.980 
everything
I<00:05:53.950> actually<00:05:54.340> spaced<00:05:54.910> out<00:05:55.090> the<00:05:55.300> planks<00:05:55.690> just<00:05:55.870> a

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
I actually spaced out the planks just a

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.840 
I actually spaced out the planks just a
little<00:05:56.380> bit<00:05:56.470> more<00:05:56.680> so<00:05:57.190> that<00:05:57.370> way<00:05:57.520> I<00:05:57.550> would<00:05:57.760> at

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
little bit more so that way I would at

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.370 
little bit more so that way I would at
least<00:05:57.880> have<00:05:58.090> an<00:05:58.300> inch<00:05:58.480> on<00:05:58.780> these<00:05:58.930> short<00:05:59.169> sides

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
least have an inch on these short sides

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.590 
least have an inch on these short sides
here<00:05:59.760> because<00:06:00.760> we<00:06:00.910> will<00:06:01.030> not<00:06:01.150> go<00:06:01.240> like<00:06:01.360> a<00:06:01.390> 1

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
here because we will not go like a 1

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.180 
here because we will not go like a 1
inch<00:06:01.780> overhang<00:06:02.080> and<00:06:02.440> then<00:06:02.919> what<00:06:03.010> I<00:06:03.070> actually

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
inch overhang and then what I actually

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.710 
inch overhang and then what I actually
did<00:06:03.400> was<00:06:03.610> I<00:06:03.700> got<00:06:03.820> inside<00:06:04.180> the<00:06:04.330> drum<00:06:04.540> and<00:06:04.630> I'm

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
did was I got inside the drum and I'm

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.020 
did was I got inside the drum and I'm
standing<00:06:05.110> on<00:06:05.230> the<00:06:05.380> plywood<00:06:05.590> disc<00:06:06.190> so<00:06:06.850> that

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
standing on the plywood disc so that

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.760 
standing on the plywood disc so that
nothing<00:06:07.419> will<00:06:07.540> move<00:06:07.720> and<00:06:08.050> then<00:06:08.560> we're<00:06:08.680> gonna

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
nothing will move and then we're gonna

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.640 
nothing will move and then we're gonna
take<00:06:09.040> a<00:06:09.310> little<00:06:10.090> skinny<00:06:10.390> drill<00:06:10.630> bit<00:06:10.780> and<00:06:10.990> I'm<00:06:11.620> a

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
take a little skinny drill bit and I'm a

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.370 
take a little skinny drill bit and I'm a
drill<00:06:11.950> a<00:06:12.130> few<00:06:12.370> pilot<00:06:12.669> holes<00:06:12.910> around<00:06:13.350> so<00:06:14.350> that

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
drill a few pilot holes around so that

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.190 
drill a few pilot holes around so that
the<00:06:14.710> I<00:06:14.950> can<00:06:15.250> join<00:06:15.460> the<00:06:15.760> disc<00:06:16.210> to<00:06:16.930> all<00:06:17.080> the

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
the I can join the disc to all the

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.840 
the I can join the disc to all the
plywood<00:06:17.350> planks<00:06:17.770> to<00:06:17.830> become<00:06:18.070> one<00:06:18.250> unit<00:06:18.460> both

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
plywood planks to become one unit both

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.580 
plywood planks to become one unit both
these<00:06:19.000> little<00:06:19.270> one-inch<00:06:19.450> screws<00:06:19.990> so<00:06:20.530> I'm

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
these little one-inch screws so I'm

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.890 
these little one-inch screws so I'm
gonna<00:06:20.710> do<00:06:20.800> that<00:06:20.919> next<00:06:21.100> and<00:06:21.460> then<00:06:22.060> we'll<00:06:22.780> go

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
gonna do that next and then we'll go

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.390 
gonna do that next and then we'll go
around<00:06:23.020> and<00:06:23.440> we'll<00:06:23.590> actually<00:06:23.740> trace<00:06:24.160> a

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
around and we'll actually trace a

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.740 
around and we'll actually trace a
one-inch<00:06:24.760> line<00:06:24.970> around<00:06:25.240> there<00:06:25.360> so<00:06:25.450> we<00:06:25.510> can<00:06:25.600> cut

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
one-inch line around there so we can cut

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.909 
one-inch line around there so we can cut
it<00:06:25.810> out<00:06:25.930> and<00:06:26.110> start<00:06:26.290> working<00:06:26.410> on<00:06:26.650> the<00:06:26.740> top

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
it out and start working on the top

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.340 
it out and start working on the top
right<00:06:27.700> so<00:06:27.850> I<00:06:27.880> got<00:06:28.030> the<00:06:28.180> disc<00:06:28.419> screwed<00:06:28.780> down<00:06:28.930> to

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
right so I got the disc screwed down to

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.560 
right so I got the disc screwed down to
all<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:29.650> planks<00:06:30.040> so<00:06:30.220> now<00:06:30.820> we<00:06:31.180> just<00:06:31.210> got<00:06:31.450> to

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
all the planks so now we just got to

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.969 
all the planks so now we just got to
trace<00:06:31.780> it<00:06:31.990> so<00:06:32.169> let<00:06:32.320> me<00:06:32.350> show<00:06:32.410> you<00:06:32.620> really<00:06:32.740> easy

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
trace it so let me show you really easy

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:37.080 
trace it so let me show you really easy
way<00:06:33.070> to<00:06:33.100> do<00:06:33.280> that<00:06:33.310> I<00:06:35.280> actually<00:06:36.280> just<00:06:36.460> took<00:06:36.790> a

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
way to do that I actually just took a

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.330 
way to do that I actually just took a
piece<00:06:37.600> of<00:06:37.780> wood<00:06:37.930> and<00:06:38.320> I<00:06:38.410> cut<00:06:38.590> a<00:06:38.620> one-inch<00:06:38.890> block

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
piece of wood and I cut a one-inch block

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.290 
piece of wood and I cut a one-inch block
and<00:06:40.030> then<00:06:40.479> also<00:06:40.720> gonna<00:06:40.930> do<00:06:41.729> is<00:06:42.729> put<00:06:43.090> it<00:06:43.210> up

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
and then also gonna do is put it up

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.340 
and then also gonna do is put it up
against<00:06:43.630> the<00:06:43.660> drum<00:06:43.960> and<00:06:44.250> then<00:06:45.250> take<00:06:45.580> my<00:06:45.970> pencil

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
against the drum and then take my pencil

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.080 
against the drum and then take my pencil
and<00:06:47.350> just<00:06:47.590> go<00:06:47.770> around<00:06:47.890> it

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
and just go around it

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.390 
and just go around it
drop<00:06:50.780> your<00:06:50.930> circle<00:06:51.260> and<00:06:51.440> then<00:06:52.070> we'll<00:06:52.160> take<00:06:52.310> the

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
drop your circle and then we'll take the

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.950 
drop your circle and then we'll take the
drum<00:06:52.580> off<00:06:52.730> and<00:06:53.030> you<00:06:53.120> can<00:06:53.270> cut<00:06:53.480> that<00:06:53.600> out<00:06:53.660> and

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
drum off and you can cut that out and

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.740 
drum off and you can cut that out and
you<00:06:54.020> have<00:06:54.170> a<00:06:54.200> perfectly<00:06:54.710> shaped<00:06:54.740> top<00:06:55.750> alright

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.750 
you have a perfectly shaped top alright

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.090 
you have a perfectly shaped top alright
and<00:06:56.960> now<00:06:57.050> I<00:06:57.080> pulled<00:06:57.380> the<00:06:57.440> drum<00:06:57.590> off<00:06:57.740> you<00:06:57.950> can

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 
and now I pulled the drum off you can

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.770 
and now I pulled the drum off you can
see<00:06:58.250> the<00:06:58.370> outline<00:06:58.550> here<00:06:58.970> and<00:06:59.150> it's<00:06:59.570> probably

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
see the outline here and it's probably

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.240 
see the outline here and it's probably
easier<00:07:00.200> to<00:07:00.440> cut<00:07:00.590> this<00:07:00.710> line<00:07:00.920> if<00:07:01.130> you

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.250 
easier to cut this line if you

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.890 
easier to cut this line if you
disassemble<00:07:01.550> the<00:07:01.880> whole<00:07:02.030> thing<00:07:02.210> but<00:07:02.690> right

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
disassemble the whole thing but right

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.300 
disassemble the whole thing but right
before<00:07:03.050> you<00:07:03.260> do<00:07:03.380> that<00:07:03.560> I'd<00:07:03.740> recommend<00:07:04.190> go

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310 
before you do that I'd recommend go

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.590 
before you do that I'd recommend go
ahead<00:07:04.460> and<00:07:04.550> take<00:07:04.640> your<00:07:04.700> pencil<00:07:05.030> and<00:07:05.150> also

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:05.600 
ahead and take your pencil and also

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.390 
ahead and take your pencil and also
trace<00:07:05.900> where<00:07:06.320> the<00:07:06.350> disc<00:07:06.830> meets<00:07:07.160> all<00:07:07.280> the

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400 
trace where the disc meets all the

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.210 
trace where the disc meets all the
planks<00:07:07.820> so<00:07:07.970> you<00:07:08.630> can<00:07:08.810> undo<00:07:09.680> all<00:07:09.830> the<00:07:09.950> screws

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.220 
planks so you can undo all the screws

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.620 
planks so you can undo all the screws
you<00:07:10.250> can<00:07:10.430> take<00:07:10.610> it<00:07:10.730> apart<00:07:10.820> you<00:07:11.180> can<00:07:11.300> paint<00:07:11.540> your

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630 
you can take it apart you can paint your

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.720 
you can take it apart you can paint your
top<00:07:11.960> and<00:07:12.200> your<00:07:12.230> bottom<00:07:12.320> disc<00:07:12.770> black<00:07:13.100> and<00:07:13.640> you

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:13.730 
top and your bottom disc black and you

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.550 
top and your bottom disc black and you
can<00:07:13.760> finish<00:07:14.090> your<00:07:14.180> wood<00:07:14.330> planks<00:07:14.810> and<00:07:15.020> you<00:07:15.440> know

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 
can finish your wood planks and you know

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.170 
can finish your wood planks and you know
a<00:07:15.590> stain<00:07:15.950> or<00:07:16.310> paint<00:07:16.340> or<00:07:16.700> whatever<00:07:16.940> you<00:07:17.000> want

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.180 
a stain or paint or whatever you want

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.720 
a stain or paint or whatever you want
and<00:07:17.360> then<00:07:17.810> you<00:07:18.020> can<00:07:18.170> use<00:07:18.320> those<00:07:18.530> lines<00:07:18.860> to

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:19.730 
and then you can use those lines to
