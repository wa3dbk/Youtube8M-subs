00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:17.960
 specific 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.730
 two carbon model subjects 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.519
 As you can see, I bike the huge 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.140
 suspension with runs of 140 as much 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.869
 front as back 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.449
 this combined with a geometry with a 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.059
 fork a pre-direction very released 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.430
 of 67 degrees makes it a joy 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.650
 very good to work and to make a 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.780
 use of on mountain we could use 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.470
 to do light enduro or to confine 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.470
 of our routes 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.570
 as it comes mounted in santander 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.280
 comes with because he has died two nights in 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.300
 the part of asia we have a stream 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.270
 sector with 140 and travel and blocking in 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.150
 the suspension bottle and in the part 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.460
 back we have a rock software rt 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.460
 composition of open and closed 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.649
 as for transmission the transat 

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:15.020
 sides asked with rap transmissions 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:18.619
 both control rods and changes 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.459
 Concrete knobs x 7 and rear derailleur 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:26.509
 x 9 10 speeds two plates is included 

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:28.310
 also the integrated chains day for 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.109
 two dishes this allows us to have 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.990
 always a constant version of the 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:35.619
 chain and it prevents us from possible outputs 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.619
 chain 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.440
 as for the lack of brakes too 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.400
 they are the novelty range 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.980
 those of ramÃ³n gaya red with discs of 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.570
 four pistons forgiveness four clamps 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:54.050
 pistons and discs of 170 front and 160 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.050
 rear 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.960
 the transat mans also has a 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.729
 telescopic strip with remote control of the 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.219
 giant brand that comes all with the 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.710
 internal wiring and see you currently 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.369
 nothing 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.970
 Y 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.970
 in the sea 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:22.740
 finally with new tires from this 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.620
 year for the compound after being 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.620
 front and 6-4 rear 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.040
 you only have this bicycle 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.599
 available in any of our 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.640
 bilingual stores and you can see it 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.599
