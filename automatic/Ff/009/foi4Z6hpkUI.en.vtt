know any really BS fillers after that is
pretty<00:01:00.150> much<00:01:00.299> destroyed<00:01:00.510> protein<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.799> if<00:01:02.549> you

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
pretty much destroyed protein but if you

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.250 
pretty much destroyed protein but if you
are<00:01:02.820> lactose<00:01:03.210> intolerant<00:01:03.360> this<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.019> kind<00:01:04.229> of

are lactose intolerant this is kind of

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.960 
are lactose intolerant this is kind of
one<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.439> those<00:01:04.559> products<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.729> probably

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
one of those products that you probably

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.789 
one of those products that you probably
don't<00:01:06.270> want<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.510> use<00:01:06.570> because<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.680> we

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
don't want to use because the we

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.440 
don't want to use because the we
concentrate<00:01:08.400> has<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> little<00:01:09.060> bit<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
concentrate has a little bit of the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.450 
concentrate has a little bit of the
lactose<00:01:09.840> or<00:01:09.990> milk<00:01:10.049> sugars<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.649> there<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.219> when

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
lactose or milk sugars in there so when

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.639 
lactose or milk sugars in there so when
you<00:01:11.549> scoop<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:12.030> got<00:01:12.149> 21<00:01:12.630> grams<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.960> protein<00:01:13.140> for

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
you scoop we got 21 grams of protein for

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.649 
you scoop we got 21 grams of protein for
grams<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.340> carbs<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.820> two<00:01:15.149> of<00:01:15.240> those<00:01:15.359> grams

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
know thicker consistency so there's some

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.100 
know thicker consistency so there's some
specifics<00:01:58.040> ounces<00:01:58.430> but<00:01:58.700> yes<00:01:59.450> that's<00:01:59.750> going<00:02:00.050> to
