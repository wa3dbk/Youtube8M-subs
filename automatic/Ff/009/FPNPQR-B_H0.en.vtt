00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.360
 good that there are friends of youtube I am Luis 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.970
 braulio and today I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.210
 how to accelerate your games the way 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.210
 easier 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.470
 to fragment them with the program 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.059
 Game Booster is not that hard good is 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.510
 Download the game booster truth I 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.230
 I do not remember where they downloaded it 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.199
 is the game booster number 3 and 3.5 the 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.809
 beta version is also not going to be 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:48.559
 difference of the version 20 advantage the 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.390
 beta version in the normal version does not 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.300
 I have no idea but they are still 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:58.020
 working there has it 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.940
 you do not have how to tell them with complete no 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.829
 has a trial period so 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.829
 marked and so I 'll have it 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.080
 good this as you want 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.290
 good what is fragmentation what the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.630
 fragmentation is like discharge health and 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.600
 the parts of what you downloaded by 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.290
 example a game are voted for all 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.650
 the team are already in a folder 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:28.670
 but really in time they are 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.290
 and what does the defragmentation that you 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.700
 we give here when we have our game 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.080
 booster we give here 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.150
 what defragmentation does is that 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.690
 that does not see that all the parts are 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.700
 out there watered them together as well 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.370
 as if it were a folder that we are not going to 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.640
 can see obviously for us going 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.470
 will see the same but on the computer what 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.220
 happens is that it will gather all the parts 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.110
 of your game and it is going to be that a 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.140
 little faster or it may be late 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.640
 same the same thing in opening but in the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.010
 playability 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.010
 or playing the game will be more 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.010
 more of the fastest and very fast creating 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.630
 we are going to fragment we select our 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.850
 game in this case of selection of 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:22.160
 minecraft defrag and power 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.590
 minecraft had already fragmenting by 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.379
 is that I do not take long 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.170
 and when he finishes going back if you take 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:32.840
 a game like live for the dead space 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.019
 just neville games so be 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.330
 long that are very history and that 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.269
 graphics can be very good is 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.950
 It may take up to 15 minutes are not 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.500
 is involved is also for the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.720
 pc performance 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.780
 so you can not also for 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.820
 speed up your game you have to update 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.310
 the drivers two drivers you always have 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.320
 have to be updated but then as 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.590
 you can see me no driver is 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.290
 It needs to be updated apart from the mind 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:08.209
 says ideas your operating system the cp1 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.580
 the ram memory and the video card as well 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.130
 It's fascinating good but like I said 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.160
 this experiment in his game and this one already 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.790
 then they go here to game books that is 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.980
 firebox 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.780
 and this we are going to go to you and here is 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.159
 activate but we're going to go to 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:33.319
 configure we give you a click to configure 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:36.170
 and here you will see two things 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.180
 of the programs they are using 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.250
 you but who are not necessary 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.969
 but if you're going to record a gameplay or 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.310
 something like this obviously this first you open 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:50.430
 the program to burn the fire and 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.340
 then you open the game booster and also 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.680
 this is no longer effective where is your 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.090
 program for example if wait all I 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.160
 that I know in any xuxa program using 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.280
 a weapon you see it and you give it marks 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.190
 but until the classic 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.830
 and in addition to gestures that these two things 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.730
 are from the program that I'm using 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.950
 I do not remember this but from xbox start it's 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.139
 the software that I put in my 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.900
 computer legally is not clergy of 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.540
 internet and the one that allows you to play with 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.130
 your control of xbox 360 in certain 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:30.250
 methods and this thing does not improve because 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.370
 but me with that to the esma that why is it 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.240
 something biological 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.639
 and it's good other brands good I'll 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.220
 what I did is mark all of this not 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.060
 I remember girls are more things 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.060
 unnecessary 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:51.360
 and this good these things I do not touch 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:54.970
 I just touched what would be the first 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.730
 non-service process tab 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:02.460
 unnecessary to neither this nor this one I do not 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:04.900
 just touch in the end with the apply and 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.090
 you can activate the game booster of a 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.980
 time 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.090
 and whether it is to find the game you 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:14.520
 you want to play or you can be here and be 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.620
 actions of the game that you are going to play in 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.340
 the selections first in amazon click 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.160
 in the voice and execute 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.470
 you wait for the game to start 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.600
 science and what appears below is 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.350
 because it was just the program that did not 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.490
 I'm using we use good from redinter 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.410
 game 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:39.410
 and this as you can see is already 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.410
 yes 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.849
 always remember 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:51.129
 to configure your game in the options 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:53.649
 video to have a better 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:56.490
 do better after something that is 

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:59.509
 always recommend turning this form off 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.509
 the fish 5 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.940
 and also when we finish playing 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:09.300
 let's go x and the game booster will come back 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:12.539
 automatically to normal mode 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.979
 another thing that I recommend to attend to 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:18.720
 your game 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:21.599
 this kit to the internet this if they do not 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.069
 game like minecraft if this one if you 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:24.900
 come back much faster by removing the 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:27.449
 Internet 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.340
 and the other thing is that if we go to a 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:32.100
 program to record I do not you 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.660
 I would recommend the action program that 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.580
 I'm recording at this moment by 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.750
 true you see the tutorial on screen 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.910
 complete so you can appreciate what 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.380
 the quality of the 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.660
 recording 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.980
 But I'll be with you, I 'm studying and 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:52.249
 put the intro and what I have and maybe 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.090
 it is not appreciated change 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:56.790
 but this one 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.500
 if you put them like this in full screen it goes 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.210
 to look like you're on my computer in 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.919
 this moment 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:05.250
 But hey, I already told you the program 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:07.600
 it's called action and you buy or you 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:12.200
 download legally 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:15.860
 the things that come legal or pop 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:20.030
 Well that's it 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:22.460
 subscribe like and comment comments 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.260
 in case it was not clear to you any doubt that 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.120
 is the one of fragmentation to me either 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.190
 all very clear but I know that they improve the 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.380
 performance in a game 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.300
 and that the program has the best 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:35.210
 world and that the three children bread yes that 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.740
 pact should claim my father but 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.730
 good is everything and I'll tell you again 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:42.470
 subscribe, like it and comment and pass 

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:46.130
 for my channel I also have gameplays 

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:48.260
 slender and several things about it and several 

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:51.400
 tutorials but well this has been all 

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.400
 until next time
