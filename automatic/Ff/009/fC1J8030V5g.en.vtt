trade<00:02:18.520> me<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.069> can<00:02:21.250> do<00:02:21.340> them<00:02:21.489> both

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
trade me so I can do them both

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:32.490 
trade me so I can do them both
BAM<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:25.120> it's<00:02:25.269> 11.3<00:02:26.260> oh<00:02:26.560> yeah<00:02:27.550> what<00:02:31.500> finally

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
BAM so it's 11.3 oh yeah what finally

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.009 
BAM so it's 11.3 oh yeah what finally
right<00:02:32.980> now<00:02:33.160> price<00:02:33.430> tag<00:02:33.670> everything<00:02:34.019> that's

it was it was pretty good XP I did it
all<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.680> engineering<00:03:03.100> so<00:03:03.459> yeah<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:03.730> got<00:03:04.180> a

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
all in the engineering so yeah I got a

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.020 
all in the engineering so yeah I got a
lot<00:03:04.600> of<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.930> engineering<00:03:05.290> experience<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:07.000> oh

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
lot of the engineering experience but oh

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.300 
lot of the engineering experience but oh
well<00:03:07.330> yeah<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.319> series<00:03:08.620> he's<00:03:08.739> done<00:03:08.920> right<00:03:09.099> now

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310

that my zero car and yeah it's actually
upgraded<00:03:30.340> my<00:03:30.459> serger<00:03:30.970> got<00:03:31.269> something<00:03:31.750> new<00:03:31.959> so

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
upgraded my serger got something new so

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.280 
upgraded my serger got something new so
I'm<00:03:33.549> pretty<00:03:34.030> sure<00:03:34.209> you<00:03:34.329> guys<00:03:34.510> will<00:03:34.750> enjoy<00:03:34.840> that

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
I'm pretty sure you guys will enjoy that

I'm pretty sure you guys will enjoy that
and<00:03:35.910> yeah<00:03:36.910> just<00:03:37.209> opening<00:03:37.660> my<00:03:37.690> effigies

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
and yeah just opening my effigies

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.729 
and yeah just opening my effigies
getting<00:03:39.670> some<00:03:39.880> experience<00:03:43.200> or<00:03:44.200> something<00:03:44.440> to

so yeah I'm done with opening it and all

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.449 
so yeah I'm done with opening it and all
on<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.269> engineering<00:03:52.600> so<00:03:53.319> yeah<00:03:53.590> see<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.370> guys

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
on the engineering so yeah see you guys

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.150 
on the engineering so yeah see you guys
later<00:03:54.639> and<00:03:55.060> I<00:03:55.750> hope<00:03:56.290> you<00:03:56.410> enjoyed<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.799> fit<00:03:56.980> and
