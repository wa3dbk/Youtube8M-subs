00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
think we have to moline again this we

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.660 
think we have to moline again this we
will<00:00:40.590> keep<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.100> actually<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> little

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
will keep this is actually a little

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.160 
will keep this is actually a little
better<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.000> think<00:00:44.239> sucks<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.480> were<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.930> low<00:00:46.140> on

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
better I think sucks that were so low on

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.410 
better I think sucks that were so low on
cards<00:00:46.590> but<00:00:46.950> has<00:00:47.250> our<00:00:47.280> colors<00:00:47.760> that's<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.270> sure

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
cards but has our colors that's for sure

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:58.369 
cards but has our colors that's for sure
and<00:00:48.690> how's<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.500> drop<00:00:55.789> and<00:00:57.020> he<00:00:58.020> does<00:00:58.199> not

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
and how's the to drop and he does not

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.750 
and how's the to drop and he does not
well<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.739> guess<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.129> could<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.430> shamble

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
well I guess you could have a shamble

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.229 
well I guess you could have a shamble
shark<00:01:00.920> do<00:01:01.920> we<00:01:02.010> trade<00:01:02.250> for<00:01:02.460> shamble<00:01:02.789> shark<00:01:03.030> I

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
shark do we trade for shamble shark I

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:12.710 
shark do we trade for shamble shark I
think<00:01:03.480> so

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.920 

I<00:01:12.840> any<00:01:13.470> didn't<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.800> it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.800 

okay<00:01:18.400> Crassus<00:01:19.400> is<00:01:19.430> fine<00:01:19.790> we<00:01:20.270> still<00:01:20.570> get<00:01:20.690> to

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
okay Crassus is fine we still get to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:43.540 
okay Crassus is fine we still get to
attack<00:01:21.050> through<00:01:21.320> it

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.280 

we're<00:01:44.180> getting<00:01:44.450> some<00:01:44.630> pressure<00:01:44.900> on<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:48.050> say

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
we're getting some pressure on and say

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.350 
we're getting some pressure on and say
he<00:01:48.680> evolves<00:01:48.950> as<00:01:49.190> Crassus<00:01:49.700> at<00:01:49.850> least<00:01:50.000> once<00:01:50.240> this

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
he evolves as Crassus at least once this

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:58.450 
he evolves as Crassus at least once this
turn<00:01:55.000> yeah<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.120> might<00:01:56.300> evolve<00:01:56.510> it<00:01:56.690> twice<00:01:57.460> Bad

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
turn yeah you might evolve it twice Bad

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.240 
turn yeah you might evolve it twice Bad
News<00:01:58.490> Bears<00:01:58.700> for<00:01:59.150> us<00:01:59.300> oh<00:01:59.920> you<00:02:00.920> didn't<00:02:01.160> ok<00:02:03.220> so<00:02:04.220> I

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
News Bears for us oh you didn't ok so I

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.010 
News Bears for us oh you didn't ok so I

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
think we can actually still attack can't

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:20.100 
think we can actually still attack can't
we<00:02:06.190> now

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.780 

um<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:23.020> could<00:02:23.110> double<00:02:23.560> block<00:02:23.830> something<00:02:24.400> yeah

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790

I'm<00:02:25.210> with<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:27.690> double<00:02:28.690> block<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.900> disciple

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
I'm with that double block a disciple

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.860 
I'm with that double block a disciple
that's<00:02:29.620> pretty<00:02:29.890> much<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.660> otherwise<00:02:31.660> he's

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
that's pretty much it otherwise he's

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.180 
that's pretty much it otherwise he's
losing<00:02:32.170> two<00:02:32.320> of<00:02:32.350> his<00:02:32.530> creatures<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:33.070> our

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
swimmer which would have been much

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:00.770 
swimmer which would have been much
better<00:03:53.129> at<00:03:53.519> we<00:03:53.640> saved<00:03:53.909> it<00:03:54.090> but<00:03:57.170> yikes<00:03:59.780> yeah

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
better at we saved it but yikes yeah

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.930 
better at we saved it but yikes yeah
he's<00:04:00.930> got<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.170> pretty<00:04:01.920> aggressive<00:04:02.159> board<00:04:02.760> here

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
he's got a pretty aggressive board here

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.880 
he's got a pretty aggressive board here
and<00:04:03.030> we're<00:04:03.150> not<00:04:03.269> doing<00:04:04.260> much<00:04:04.379> against<00:04:04.769> that

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
and we're not doing much against that

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.339 
and we're not doing much against that
for<00:04:05.159> damage<00:04:05.519> to<00:04:05.549> turn<00:04:05.790> from<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.349> elusive

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
for damage to turn from that elusive

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:20.479 
for damage to turn from that elusive
Crassus<00:04:15.620> all<00:04:16.620> right<00:04:16.799> we<00:04:16.919> got<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.100> creature<00:04:19.489> it's

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
Crassus all right we got a creature it's

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.650 
Crassus all right we got a creature it's
not<00:04:20.639> nothing<00:04:23.210> hybridization<00:04:24.210> would<00:04:24.360> be<00:04:24.479> good

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
not nothing hybridization would be good

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:32.980 
not nothing hybridization would be good
against<00:04:25.320> this<00:04:25.470> guy<00:04:25.740> after<00:04:26.160> revolves<00:04:26.610> happen

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.920 

good<00:04:33.990> game<00:04:34.320> sir<00:04:34.949> good<00:04:35.310> game<00:04:35.610> okay<00:04:38.810> that<00:04:39.810> was

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
good game sir good game okay that was

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:46.070 
good game sir good game okay that was
certainly<00:04:40.139> lethal<00:04:43.310> yes<00:04:44.310> rupture<00:04:45.090> has<00:04:45.330> done<00:04:46.050> us

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
certainly lethal yes rupture has done us

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:55.089 
certainly lethal yes rupture has done us
well<00:04:46.260> so<00:04:47.220> play<00:04:47.820> a<00:04:47.850> rupture<00:04:48.889> way<00:04:49.889> felt<00:04:50.460> bad<00:04:53.090> I

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
well so play a rupture way felt bad I

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.140 
well so play a rupture way felt bad I
don't<00:04:56.099> think<00:04:56.220> alpha<00:04:56.580> authority<00:04:56.880> is<00:04:56.940> doing

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
don't think alpha authority is doing

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.890 
don't think alpha authority is doing
anything<00:04:57.330> against<00:04:57.930> him<00:04:59.419> except<00:05:00.419> for<00:05:00.450> gridlock

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
anything against him except for gridlock

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.560 
anything against him except for gridlock
but<00:05:01.440> whatever<00:05:02.780> Hydra<00:05:03.780> form<00:05:04.050> is<00:05:04.289> that<00:05:04.320> anything

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
but whatever Hydra form is that anything

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.080 
but whatever Hydra form is that anything
where<00:05:06.570> will<00:05:06.690> we<00:05:06.840> rather<00:05:07.020> just<00:05:07.260> have<00:05:07.410> snap<00:05:07.680> jaws

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
where will we rather just have snap jaws

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.790 
where will we rather just have snap jaws
what<00:05:09.090> could<00:05:09.240> we<00:05:09.330> have<00:05:09.479> over<00:05:09.720> snap<00:05:09.990> jaw<00:05:10.260> like<00:05:10.770> a

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
what could we have over snap jaw like a

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.570 
what could we have over snap jaw like a
spiral<00:05:11.220> tracer<00:05:11.729> I<00:05:11.789> guess<00:05:11.970> of<00:05:12.240> our<00:05:12.360> own<00:05:13.550> get<00:05:14.550> a

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
spiral tracer I guess of our own get a

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.460 
spiral tracer I guess of our own get a
little<00:05:14.760> more<00:05:14.820> aggressive<00:05:15.030> or<00:05:15.570> a<00:05:15.630> burst<00:05:16.289> of

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
little more aggressive or a burst of

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.250 
little more aggressive or a burst of
strength<00:05:16.710> I<00:05:17.389> kind<00:05:18.389> of<00:05:18.419> like<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.660> trick<00:05:18.930> to<00:05:18.960> be

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
strength I kind of like the trick to be

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.560 
strength I kind of like the trick to be
honest
