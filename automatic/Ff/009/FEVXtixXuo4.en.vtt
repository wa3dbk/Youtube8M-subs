00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 for 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.990
 we are three families living in 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.269
 yurts not very far any of the 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.330
 other names of fashion his profits 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.019
 and we are installed in its walls since 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.370
 2007 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.730
 there is a family who is on the ground 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.140
 of friends who lend them 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.730
 and then the other two months and their 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.650
 family we are on our land 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.310
 but it's a tent in the sense that 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.910
 she dismantles are the elements to 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.430
 outside I like its lightness the 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.470
 does that she puts herself somehow 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.730
 take off that remains nothing behind the 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.890
 town hall before us had us had 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.930
 allowed to put us there because we 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.440
 tents and was therefore not allowed 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.140
 to build 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.829
 we did not come here saying we're going 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.829
 violate the law 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:51.239
 there have been six trials in all and we have 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.840
 won 5 and the others then there have been 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.960
 on the yurt 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.609
 finally two since there was call but 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.559
 the others it was because the mayor 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.980
 made numerous orders prohibiting 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.449
 camping in case we would be considered 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.490
 like tents we can not stay 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.940
 because the purpose of this mayor is 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.430
 parte 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.110
 we get here and pitch was neither 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.430
 constructible nor a constructive there 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.100
 had no land use plan 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.780
 here he hurried to make one for 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.520
 to make us inconstructible and once 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.500
 that he did that he sent us from the siege 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.150
 in ten years see you are on a 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.010
 constructible land so illegal and 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.440
 if they have constructions we make 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.220
 inconstructible and if we consider 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.020
 like tents 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.000
 we do not forbid camping like that they 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.100
 have no way to stay that demonstrates 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.590
 that his concern is really that we leave 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.600
 by the way it's stop camping have 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.500
 been annulled by the court for abuse 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.070
 of power and infringements of freedoms 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.020
 outside the village we are very 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.120
 supported in the region we never 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.190
 met anyone who thought we 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.190
 was that we were not in our place in 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.460
 done and in the village people are 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.650
 reserved because he does not dare 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.300
 asserted the mayor the mayor does a lot 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.450
 pressure on everybody and you 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.630
 run not otherwise fear the police that 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.950
 becomes a point where it's obvious that 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.340
 finally it's more just a little 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.380
 squabble 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.270
 he is putting on the street of 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.910
 families with kids what these people 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.290
 which are not illegal since we've been 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.120
 regularized I remind him anyway 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.520
 what to do in cassation is 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.290
 a way of saying we do not accept 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.940
 this decision 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.250
 and then behind us there is a lot 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.800
 people so for respite yes it's 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.760
 suspensive of punishment except that there is a 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.870
 first filter in a good month and we do not 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.459
 do not know if we will pass it 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.770
 he checks that the reason why 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.050
 we're going cassation is valid for the 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.700
 cassation a mistake of law in 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.650
 the rare right it would be to 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.370
 consider a yurt as a 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.709
 construction 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.700
 except that as there is a legal void 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.650
 it's delicate 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.650
 after we can not prove it 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.990
 we have a way of life that opens doors 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.000
 on on news the news 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.720
 city ​​ways the environment to 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.040
 to live with 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.440
 with his environment and to make 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.310
 be careful when you have a toilet 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.690
 dry or ecological sanitation 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.610
 it's still an approach to ecology 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.200
 from a rather positive angle especially that 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.090
 there is no need for millions for the 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.440
 to do so it is within the reach of many 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.390
 many people there are a lot of common 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.140
 in particular in Limousin where there is no 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.570
 not enough people 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.520
 so when a family come young 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.060
 what because that's what want 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.620
 settle 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.950
 compass necessarily means to buy 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:39.050
 because the racks are expensive and when 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.400
 a desire to live close to nature 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.560
 there are mothers they are super happy 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.020
 besides there is in our trial there is 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.080
 attestations of my two seas that 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.550
 say it's not only good of the 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.030
 to do but it's a fault that the 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.360
 refuse 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.100
 in a village a thousand people can 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.930
 not to project ourselves into the future with this 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.910
 story and that's what's the most 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.310
 destructive to us and then good 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.810
 Today I remember that there 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.790
 more than the mayor there is also the state 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.320
 because it is the state that has appealed 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.550
 we had won in November 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.070
 it's not the mayor who could do 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.540
 call the mayor was civil party too 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.870
 find face to face with the park and so 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.280
 the state 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.710
 if the state that appealed so 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.390
 now it is clear that the state 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.600
 supports the abuse of power of this little 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.600
 mayor
