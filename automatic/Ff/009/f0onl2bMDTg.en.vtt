to<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.090> complicated<00:00:36.450> my<00:00:36.899> number<00:00:37.290> one<00:00:37.500> tip<00:00:37.710> is

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
to be complicated my number one tip is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.940 
to be complicated my number one tip is
keep<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.730> simple<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.629> can<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.260> simple<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
keep it simple it can be as simple as a

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.459 
keep it simple it can be as simple as a
bowl<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.489> whole-grain<00:00:41.969> cereal<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.930> milk<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
bowl of whole-grain cereal with milk and

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.700 
bowl of whole-grain cereal with milk and
just<00:00:44.309> having<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.940> really<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.989> packed<00:00:46.469> with

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
just having that really is packed with

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.709 
just having that really is packed with
nutrition<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.670> couldn't<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.090> easier<00:00:48.180> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
nutrition and it couldn't be easier to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.139 
nutrition and it couldn't be easier to
do<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.770> milk<00:00:49.980> itself<00:00:50.340> provides<00:00:50.789> nine

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
do so the milk itself provides nine

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.959 
do so the milk itself provides nine
essential<00:00:51.930> nutrients<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.739> then<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.520> cereal

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
essential nutrients and then the cereal

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.420 
essential nutrients and then the cereal
balances<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.140> with<00:00:55.289> fiber<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.100> antioxidants

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
balances it with fiber and antioxidants

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.450 
balances it with fiber and antioxidants
and<00:00:57.120> together<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.289> really<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.739> great<00:00:58.859> team

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and together it's a really a great team

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.459 
and together it's a really a great team
and<00:00:59.699> one<00:01:00.270> thing<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.840> does<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.050> provide

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
and one thing that it does is provide

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.009
