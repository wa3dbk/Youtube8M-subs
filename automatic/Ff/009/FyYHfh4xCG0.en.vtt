00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
literally just a digital margin game and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.910 
literally just a digital margin game and
we<00:00:58.980> played<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.460> before<00:01:00.199> mr.<00:01:01.199> Manik<00:01:01.710> we

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
we played this before mr. Manik we

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.160 
we played this before mr. Manik we
taught<00:01:02.129> me<00:01:02.280> religious<00:01:02.670> education<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.869> how

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
taught me religious education and how

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.399

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
much of that stock I wonder well we

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.570 
much of that stock I wonder well we
didn't<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> teacher<00:01:13.950> for<00:01:14.220> half<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.549> year

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
didn't have a teacher for half the year

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.359 
didn't have a teacher for half the year
so<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.180> didn't<00:01:15.540> get<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.689> full<00:01:16.369> qualification

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
so we didn't get a full qualification

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.830 
so we didn't get a full qualification
out<00:01:17.460> there<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.939> if<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.180> do<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.420> exam<00:01:18.659> you'll

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
out there like if you do the exam you'll

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.539 
out there like if you do the exam you'll
get<00:01:18.960> half<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.350> qualification<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.340> you

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
get half the qualification if you

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.550 
get half the qualification if you
realize<00:01:20.850> how<00:01:21.000> points<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.689> can<00:01:21.840> opt<00:01:22.020> out<00:01:22.229> so

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
realize how points is you can opt out so

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.140 
realize how points is you can opt out so
