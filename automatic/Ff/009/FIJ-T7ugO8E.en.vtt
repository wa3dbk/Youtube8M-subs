00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello if you get Sanchez in this I will 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.389
 I will teach the different forms of 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.790
 delineate your eyes I will emphasize 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.469
 I'm just going to show you the eyeliner 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.049
 how to change the shape of your eyes 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.940
 modify it or simply accentuate the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.070
 way that if you are interested in this 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.080
 video keep watching it and if you like it 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.789
 remember to leave me little fingers up 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.560
 like and your comments in the box 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.539
 descriptions can also give me their 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.849
 questions here or by twitter that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.570
 arroga floor labor makeup or my 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.219
 facebook lights laura sanchez makeup 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.050
 we start with the first correction for 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.820
 example if your eyes are very close together 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.640
 one another, we're going to make them a 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.550
 little more separated for this we are going to 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.230
 put a pencil eyeliner only 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.530
 accentuating in the outer corner of 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.329
 eye this works the same for shadows and 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.129
 liquid eyeliners if we want that 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.920
 the eyes are more separated there are always 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.180
 to do the accent on the outside 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.380
 we blur with a brush with a 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.380
 conflict 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.300
 as you prefer and also in the end if it is 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.280
 necessary we clean the edges not 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.290
 I also compete for a lot more 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.270
 cute the eyeliner and that's how 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.340
 we achieve the effect 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.570
 if we need to do the opposite is 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.460
 say that the eyes become a little 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.280
 more together because soon they are more 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.200
 separate let's do exactly what 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.740
 same but in the inner corner of 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.740
 eye let's accentuate the shadow there 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.890
 eyeliner or the pencil that we use 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.100
 also we blur brush one 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.299
 I copy and clean the edges so that 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.299
 be much nicer 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.040
 now if we want the eyes to be more 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.410
 great other how easy it is to put 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.470
 illuminator can be a white pencil or 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.930
 skin color in the water line of the eye and 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.330
 then in the line of the eyelashes 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.060
 put a pencil only in a third of 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.430
 the outer corner of the eye as 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.170
 I'm doing here now we blur 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.479
 into 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.350
 and this will give us a no bigger effect 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.350
 and more open 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.130
 on the contrary if what we want 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.349
 now that is smaller then we 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.890
 to make it look more closed for that 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.690
 we put the pencil in the water line of 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.750
 up and down and also around 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.500
 of the eye we do it around the whole 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.690
 eye so that it closes a little more 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.850
 these dark colors and the fact of 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.940
 close all the eye the eyeliner makes 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.240
 let it be a little bit smaller 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.400
 we blur and that's it, that's how 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.500
 we make it a bit smaller 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.750
 now if we suddenly have our eyes a 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.090
 little fallen on the outside corner and 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.670
 we want to raise it a little 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.650
 we are going to use an eyeliner also in 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.840
 pencil and create a list up 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.730
 as I am doing here and we 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.140
 into 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.060
 we can use the finger to help us 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.720
 hold the eyelid and there is a 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.700
 slightly smoother the skin 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.850
 but they have to be careful when 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.320
 blur and release the eyelid finger 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.930
 it falls a little bit because it no longer 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.630
 we are shaking so when they release 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.460
 perfection in the list and lengthen the what 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.770
 that is necessary or as you 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.260
 like 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.659
 that's how we have the light of one eye a 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.980
 little bit higher in the corners 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.079
 now if what we want is that then 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.939
 be a little more fallen in this part 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.189
 we can also do it doing 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.659
 totally the opposite leading instead 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.939
 from up to the tip taking it 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.709
 down if they suddenly think that they do not 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:33.799
 says there's this kind of profit that looks 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.870
 ugly look at marilyn monroe's eyes 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.030
 they are this way and it was then the 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.379
 sexual symbol in his time 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.420
 then they realize they are very 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.950
 nice this what is very famous in 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.829
 asia because it makes the eyes a lot 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.270
 sweeter and more tender especially for 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.360
 create looks like doll 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.550
 also if you have an eye then fit 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.319
 of almond very round and in excess 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.420
 a little more Asian effect 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.569
 now yes I only have the eye very 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.609
 round and I stretch a little 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.939
 What can I do is put the outline of 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.439
 the corner and extend the eye notice that 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.239
 I 'm not carrying the tip or 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:13.209
 up or down I'm just 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.939
 extending with the natural shape of the eye 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.620
 to make it a little longer 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.889
 I am extending horizontally and 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.180
 I'm not taking it to any angle 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:26.050
 we also diffuse with a brush with 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.470
 Copito and that's it if we suddenly want 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.330
 extend it in the inside because 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.860
 We have very wide eyes and no 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.919
 we want to do it in the outer corner 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.750
 as I said in the first example I do 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.180
 in the inner corner this also we 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.310
 helps to lengthen the eye 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.820
 without it going to see more separated the 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.040
 one from another 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.710
 You can also combine these two forms 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.620
 encompassing inside and outside and gives them 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.090
 an arabian eye effect is the way 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.639
 wen perfect almond 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.150
 clean with a little bit around to 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:02.040
 that is more beautiful and ready now for 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.030
 that it is rounder we are going to 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.880
 concentrate the pencil in the center of this 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.500
 shape and then we blur what we already 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.229
 we have right there without applying more 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.419
 product towards the other sides so that 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:18.410
 be much stronger and more accentuated 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.410
 the center of the eye 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.949
 that's how we make it then a 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.949
 little rounder 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.090
 now if they have the overcast eye it is 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.550
 say that the eyelid falls on the 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.130
 eyelid mobile I do not recommend that they use 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.260
 no very heavy eyeliner since no 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.730
 it 's worth it because you're not going to see almost 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.070
 and the only thing he's going to do is that you 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.720
 we will close more overcast what 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.240
 can do is delineate only the 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.550
 line of the eyelashes or very close to 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.380
 eyelashes and this will make these 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.100
 be a little thicker a little more 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.230
 long and a little busier 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.870
 Do not forget to blur to make it more 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:01.130
 natural the effect you already know with brush 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.130
 with copita as you prefer 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.090
 and that's how we make a 1-john core 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.040
 capoted good this was the whole tutorial 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.320
 I hope you liked it and especially 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.000

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.450
 change the shape of the eyes with shadows 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.920
 and also with liquid eyeliner a kiss
