00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.170
 we are in office in magnetically 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.819
 resonance tomography 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:13.269
 here is the magnetic resonance 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:14.569
 tomograph 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:16.109
 Siemens firms 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.890
 you him 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.329
 with magnetic field strength 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.329
 and that is 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.820
 can remember the resonance 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.160
 tomography is one of those methods 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.079
 which are used for visualization 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.340
 various tissues and body structures 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.510
 magnetic resonance imaging and 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.479
 advantage 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:41.659
 came a different media visa 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:42.799
 Ryazan this study 

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:45.879
 spinal cord brain and 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.609
 entertain their spine cervical 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.839
 and thoracic and lumbar 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:51.800
 spine 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.840
 besides this magnetic resonance 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.530
 tomography is the only method 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.710
 which allows you to get from them 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.630
 will arise in the manner of the vessels of the head 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.640
 brain 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.460
 we see here all these games by horses of vessels 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.730
 brain without introducing 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.619
 contrast drug 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.149
 All main lines are visible 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.429
 heating prominent political act and article 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:14.240
 according to the documents of their parents 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.670
 so the group that applies to 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.900
 Russia in Moscow is the middle Polina 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.950
 American beauty 1 0 and 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.410
 one and a half press 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.890
 in our case we are in what 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.840
 the location is in magnetic resonance 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.100
 tomograph 3 thousand he refers to the remotes 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.260
 Vysokopolye could 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.530
 and what is it with what a higher magnetic field 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.840
 the higher the signal-to-noise ratio the higher 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.330
 signal to noise ratio 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.850
 better picture we can 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.700
 make thinner slices and see more 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.260
 subtle pathology that is not even visible 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.090
 on ordinary 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.080
 besides that he is magnetic resonance 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.450
 Vysokopolye magnitka allows 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.810
 getting the fermentation list she 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.990
 almost molecular level 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.990
 uses mr spectroscopy 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.140
 our magnet is wide from Tver 70 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.640
 centimeters and the rise became up to two hundred 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.810
 kilograms it allows all of 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.409
 first overweight patients 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.709
 other city magnetic resonance imager 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.109
 this can not usually do restrictions to 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.139
 120 kilograms 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.359
 the device has a full set of coils for 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.310
 all kinds of research 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.060
 for all kinds of joints for 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.230
 investigating you pelvic for 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.589
 research heart headache 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.739
 spine except that there are all modes 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.299
 research while moving was not 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.859
 taking out the patient stopped we can 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:45.730
 explore 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.839
 since reported 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.169
 any patient should pay attention to 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.759
 what is magnetic resonance 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:53.989
 tomograph conducts 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.719
 if he does research on 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.139
 low-power magnet with low 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.629
 then, respectively, and magnetic resonance 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.999
 tomography will be of poor quality 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.749
 the higher n the tension 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:07.299
 magnetic field all better 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.449
 tomogram we get so 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:11.749
 may start treatment earlier 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.409
 patient's probability of recovery 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:15.479
 is increasing 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:16.219
 several times
