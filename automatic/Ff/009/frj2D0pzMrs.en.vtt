all<00:00:02.760> around<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.270> world<00:00:03.480> our<00:00:03.870> fisheries<00:00:04.470> are

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
all around the world our fisheries are

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.800 
all around the world our fisheries are
being<00:00:04.980> devastated<00:00:05.430> thanks<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.299> habitat<00:00:06.779> loss

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
being devastated thanks to habitat loss

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.290 
being devastated thanks to habitat loss
and<00:00:07.049> overfishing<00:00:07.740> some<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.760> places<00:00:08.970> fish

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
and overfishing some of the places fish

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.480 
and overfishing some of the places fish
depend<00:00:09.690> on<00:00:09.809> most<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.260> thrive<00:00:10.559> our<00:00:10.920> reefs<00:00:11.250> and

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
depend on most to thrive our reefs and

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.030 
depend on most to thrive our reefs and
these<00:00:11.880> are<00:00:12.240> being<00:00:12.540> decimated<00:00:12.929> but<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:13.769> turns

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
these are being decimated but it turns

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.240 
these are being decimated but it turns
out<00:00:14.280> reefs<00:00:14.910> can<00:00:15.509> be<00:00:15.750> rebuilt<00:00:16.139> using<00:00:16.830> some

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
out reefs can be rebuilt using some

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.640 
out reefs can be rebuilt using some
pretty<00:00:17.520> astonishing<00:00:18.090> building<00:00:18.539> blocks<00:00:18.779> we're

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
pretty astonishing building blocks we're

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.650 
pretty astonishing building blocks we're

thanks for having me so what are we
doing<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:28.140> we're<00:00:28.470> going<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.650> talk<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> little

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
doing here we're going to talk a little

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.099 
doing here we're going to talk a little
bit<00:00:29.160> about<00:00:29.310> artificial<00:00:29.849> reefs<00:00:30.210> today<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.660> why

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
bit about artificial reefs today and why

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.600 
bit about artificial reefs today and why
we<00:00:31.289> build<00:00:31.529> them<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.830> how<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.009> build<00:00:32.279> them<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
we build them and how we build them and

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
we build them and how we build them and
who<00:00:32.820> are<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:32.969> first<00:00:33.180> people<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.480> use

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
who are the first people to use

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.870 
who are the first people to use
artificial<00:00:33.989> reefs<00:00:34.430> actually<00:00:35.430> reefs<00:00:35.670> were

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
artificial reefs actually reefs were

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.030 
artificial reefs actually reefs were
created<00:00:36.360> over<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> century<00:00:37.410> ago<00:00:37.500> back<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
created over a century ago back in the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.240 
created over a century ago back in the
late<00:00:38.219> 1800s<00:00:39.030> fishermen<00:00:39.960> realized<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.649> when

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
late 1800s fishermen realized that when

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.190 
late 1800s fishermen realized that when
fallen<00:00:41.670> logs<00:00:41.910> were<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.329> tidal<00:00:42.570> creeks<00:00:42.930> things

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
fallen logs were in tidal creeks things

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.869 
fallen logs were in tidal creeks things
like<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.530> barnacles<00:00:44.160> would<00:00:44.309> grow<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.700> them

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
like that barnacles would grow on them

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.310 
like that barnacles would grow on them
and<00:00:45.000> fish<00:00:45.510> would<00:00:45.690> come<00:00:45.870> around<00:00:45.989> there<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and fish would come around there and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.510 
and fish would come around there and
attract<00:00:46.620> them<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:46.980> they<00:00:47.100> started

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
attract them so they started

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.760 
attract them so they started
deliberately<00:00:48.059> putting<00:00:48.420> logs<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.079> water<00:00:49.289> more

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
deliberately putting logs and water more

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.709 
deliberately putting logs and water more
recently<00:00:50.190> fishermen<00:00:50.789> realized<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.600> when

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
recently fishermen realized that when

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.450 
recently fishermen realized that when
they<00:00:51.899> fished<00:00:52.170> around<00:00:52.350> shipwrecks<00:00:53.160> they<00:00:53.399> were

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
they fished around shipwrecks they were

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.189 
they fished around shipwrecks they were
catching<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.879> lot<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.149> fish<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.780> that

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
catching a lot of fish and that

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.139 
catching a lot of fish and that
eventually<00:00:55.649> turned<00:00:56.160> into<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.520> idea<00:00:56.789> well<00:00:57.000> why

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
eventually turned into the idea well why

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.610 
eventually turned into the idea well why
don't<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.390> create<00:00:57.870> our<00:00:58.020> own<00:00:58.050> shipwreck

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
don't we just create our own shipwreck

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.110 
don't we just create our own shipwreck
and<00:00:58.800> maybe<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.100> can<00:00:59.250> attract<00:00:59.550> more<00:00:59.760> fish<00:00:59.969> as

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
and maybe we can attract more fish as

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.279 
and maybe we can attract more fish as
well<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.809> what<00:01:00.930> are<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
well and so what are you at the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.660 
well and so what are you at the
Department<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.710> Natural<00:01:01.800> Resources<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.609> are

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
Department of Natural Resources what are

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.250 
Department of Natural Resources what are
you<00:01:02.760> trying<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.030> do<00:01:03.149> we're<00:01:03.420> studying<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:03.989> only

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
you trying to do we're studying not only

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.960 
you trying to do we're studying not only
how<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.559> build<00:01:04.860> reefs<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.369> how<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.610> build<00:01:05.850> them

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
how to build reefs but how to build them

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.730 
how to build reefs but how to build them
better<00:01:06.210> what<00:01:06.540> sorts<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.930> materials<00:01:07.080> work

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
better what sorts of materials work

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.590 
better what sorts of materials work
better<00:01:08.010> than<00:01:08.189> other<00:01:08.369> materials<00:01:08.909> trying<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
better than other materials trying to

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.210 
better than other materials trying to
make<00:01:09.720> them<00:01:09.869> more<00:01:09.900> efficient<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.070> can

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
make them more efficient so that we can

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.100 
make them more efficient so that we can
actually<00:01:11.310> produce<00:01:11.670> more<00:01:12.030> fish<00:01:12.299> why<00:01:12.810> do<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.990> do

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
actually produce more fish why do you do

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.810 
actually produce more fish why do you do
that<00:01:13.260> well<00:01:13.950> tell<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.400> what<00:01:14.490> let's<00:01:14.700> go

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
that well tell you what let's go

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.370 
that well tell you what let's go
offshore<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.930> show<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.140> part<00:01:16.350> of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
offshore here and I can show you part of

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.500 
offshore here and I can show you part of
the<00:01:16.470> reason<00:01:16.740> okay

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.910 

you've<00:01:20.510> seen<00:01:20.720> all<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:20.960> boat<00:01:21.110> traffic<00:01:21.380> coming

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
you've seen all the boat traffic coming

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.530 
you've seen all the boat traffic coming
and<00:01:22.100> going<00:01:22.280> all<00:01:22.430> day<00:01:22.610> today<00:01:22.790> all<00:01:22.880> these<00:01:23.180> people

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.480 
and going all day today all these people
are<00:01:23.659> looking<00:01:23.900> for<00:01:23.930> some<00:01:24.229> place<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.470> fish<00:01:24.890> if<00:01:25.280> we

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
are looking for some place to fish if we

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.640 
are looking for some place to fish if we
don't<00:01:25.610> build<00:01:25.940> artificial<00:01:26.510> reefs<00:01:26.930> everybody's

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
don't build artificial reefs everybody's

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.440 
don't build artificial reefs everybody's
going<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.830> go<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.520> limited<00:01:29.090> number<00:01:29.420> of

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
going to go to the limited number of

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.240 
going to go to the limited number of
natural<00:01:29.720> reef<00:01:30.140> sites<00:01:30.409> that<00:01:30.590> we<00:01:30.680> have<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.130> what

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
natural reef sites that we have so what

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.460 
natural reef sites that we have so what
you're<00:01:31.369> actually<00:01:31.490> doing<00:01:31.670> is<00:01:32.229> augmenting<00:01:33.229> the

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
you're actually doing is augmenting the

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.990 
you're actually doing is augmenting the
areas<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:33.950> these<00:01:34.310> fish<00:01:34.549> are<00:01:34.670> able<00:01:34.909> to

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
areas that these fish are able to

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.149 
areas that these fish are able to
populate<00:01:35.180> right<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:36.530> what<00:01:36.710> are<00:01:36.800> some<00:01:36.860> of<00:01:37.100> the

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
populate right so what are some of the

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.590 
populate right so what are some of the
materials<00:01:37.610> that<00:01:37.670> you<00:01:37.820> make<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.090> artificial

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
materials that you make the artificial

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.060 
materials that you make the artificial
reef<00:01:38.750> from<00:01:38.990> this<00:01:39.229> bridge<00:01:39.560> that<00:01:39.770> we've<00:01:39.890> got

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
reef from this bridge that we've got

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.770 
reef from this bridge that we've got
right<00:01:40.100> up<00:01:40.280> here<00:01:40.550> see<00:01:40.790> this<00:01:40.940> is<00:01:41.090> our<00:01:41.240> new<00:01:41.450> bridge

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
right up here see this is our new bridge

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.630 
right up here see this is our new bridge
spanning<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.380> Cooper<00:01:42.680> River<00:01:42.710> prior<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.369> that

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
spanning the Cooper River prior to that

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.120 
spanning the Cooper River prior to that
there<00:01:44.509> were<00:01:44.659> two<00:01:44.869> very<00:01:45.140> old<00:01:45.470> bridges<00:01:45.979> that

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
there were two very old bridges that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.830 
there were two very old bridges that
went<00:01:46.250> across<00:01:46.430> there<00:01:46.820> when<00:01:47.030> they<00:01:47.119> demolished

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
went across there when they demolished

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.420 
went across there when they demolished
that<00:01:47.960> bridge<00:01:48.380> there<00:01:48.710> were<00:01:48.800> over<00:01:48.950> two<00:01:49.280> hundred

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
that bridge there were over two hundred

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.850 
that bridge there were over two hundred
and<00:01:49.640> eighty<00:01:49.909> thousand<00:01:50.659> tons<00:01:50.899> of<00:01:51.050> concrete<00:01:51.500> I

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
and eighty thousand tons of concrete I

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.529 
and eighty thousand tons of concrete I
would<00:01:52.039> have<00:01:52.160> been<00:01:52.460> just<00:01:52.490> put<00:01:52.820> into<00:01:53.000> a<00:01:53.030> landfill

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
would have been just put into a landfill

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.810 
would have been just put into a landfill
so<00:01:53.899> if<00:01:54.080> we<00:01:54.229> can<00:01:54.410> build<00:01:54.619> 12<00:01:55.130> different<00:01:55.460> reef

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
so if we can build 12 different reef

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.180 
so if we can build 12 different reef
sites<00:01:56.119> with<00:01:56.660> all<00:01:56.810> that<00:01:56.990> material<00:01:57.140> great<00:01:57.920> Wow

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
sites with all that material great Wow

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.070 
sites with all that material great Wow
how<00:01:58.789> many<00:01:58.940> pounds<00:01:59.090> of<00:01:59.330> concrete<00:01:59.479> did<00:01:59.869> you<00:01:59.929> say

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
tons of concrete right into 12 different

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.669 
tons of concrete right into 12 different
roofs<00:02:07.729> all<00:02:08.060> around<00:02:08.360> here<00:02:08.600> exactly<00:02:08.929> it's<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.560> lot
