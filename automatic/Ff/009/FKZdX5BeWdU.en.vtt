London and today I'd like to talk to you
about<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.530> laying<00:00:10.920> P<00:00:11.340> -<00:00:11.550> PO<00:00:11.820> 3<00:00:12.150> stabilizer<00:00:12.660> now

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
about the laying P - PO 3 stabilizer now

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.340 
about the laying P - PO 3 stabilizer now
this<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:13.860> based<00:00:14.130> on<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.639> glidecam<00:00:15.420> design<00:00:16.049> and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
this is based on the glidecam design and

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.380 
this is based on the glidecam design and
it's<00:00:16.980> taken<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.310> few<00:00:17.490> other<00:00:17.670> things<00:00:17.760> from<00:00:18.210> other

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
it's taken a few other things from other

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.260 
it's taken a few other things from other
stabilizers<00:00:18.990> too<00:00:19.230> but<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.490> far<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.240> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
stabilizers too but so far this is the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.019 
stabilizers too but so far this is the
closest<00:00:22.080> anything<00:00:22.710> has<00:00:22.920> ever<00:00:23.100> come<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.789> a

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
closest anything has ever come to a

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.179 
closest anything has ever come to a
glide<00:00:24.359> count<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.199> reason<00:00:25.500> I'm<00:00:25.769> saying

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
glide count and the reason I'm saying

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.980 
glide count and the reason I'm saying
glad<00:00:26.400> cameras<00:00:26.699> because<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.599> my<00:00:27.750> base

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
glad cameras because that is my base

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.080 
glad cameras because that is my base
standard<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.980> far<00:00:29.250> that's<00:00:29.519> one<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> best

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
standard so far that's one of the best

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.999 
standard so far that's one of the best
and<00:00:30.390> my<00:00:30.840> funding<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.349> one<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.560> my<00:00:31.619> favorites

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
and my funding on one of my favorites

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.020 
and my funding on one of my favorites
and<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.579> really<00:00:33.329> do<00:00:33.540> feel<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:35.030> really

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
and I really do feel that this is really

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.990 
and I really do feel that this is really
a<00:00:36.180> fantastic<00:00:36.510> alternative<00:00:37.399> option<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
a fantastic alternative option to the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.020 
a fantastic alternative option to the
glide<00:00:39.180> cam<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:40.219> at<00:00:41.219> about<00:00:41.460> half<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.850> cost

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
glide cam and at about half the cost

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.819 
glide cam and at about half the cost
depending<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.570> where<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.780> are<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.140> where

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
depending on where you are and where

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.790 
depending on where you are and where
you're<00:00:43.920> buying<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.219> from<00:00:45.140> so<00:00:46.140> build<00:00:46.649> quality

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
you're buying it from so build quality

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.040 
you're buying it from so build quality
on<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.399> absolutely<00:00:47.489> fantastic<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.840> fact

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
on this is absolutely fantastic in fact

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.869 
on this is absolutely fantastic in fact
better<00:00:49.320> than<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.590> glide<00:00:49.770> cam<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.399> doesn't

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
better than the glide cam it doesn't

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
better than the glide cam it doesn't
feel<00:00:51.090> as<00:00:51.149> fragile<00:00:51.690> as<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> glide<00:00:52.230> cam<00:00:52.440> even

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
feel as fragile as the glide cam even

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.560 
feel as fragile as the glide cam even
though<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> glide<00:00:53.129> cam<00:00:53.340> works<00:00:53.579> hasn't<00:00:54.390> broken

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
though the glide cam works hasn't broken

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.770 
though the glide cam works hasn't broken
on<00:00:54.809> me<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.199> far<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.610> little<00:00:56.940> bit<00:00:57.090> wonky<00:00:57.420> at

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
on me so far it is a little bit wonky at

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.450 
on me so far it is a little bit wonky at
a<00:00:57.960> place<00:00:58.289> where<00:00:58.469> someone<00:00:58.739> else<00:00:58.859> had<00:00:59.010> broken<00:00:59.250> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
a place where someone else had broken it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.760 
a place where someone else had broken it
I<00:00:59.640> sort<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.090> bent<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.539> little<00:01:00.690> bit<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.710> do

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
I sort of bent it a little bit and I do

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.140 
I sort of bent it a little bit and I do
and<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.250> still<00:01:02.460> flies<00:01:02.670> really<00:01:03.359> well<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:04.019> it

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
and it still flies really well but it

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.550 
and it still flies really well but it
doesn't<00:01:06.150> doesn't<00:01:06.540> feel<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:06.869> thirty<00:01:07.170> as<00:01:07.380> this

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
doesn't doesn't feel as thirty as this

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.800 
doesn't doesn't feel as thirty as this
not<00:01:08.070> even<00:01:08.220> close<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:09.119> thing<00:01:09.390> even<00:01:09.659> though

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
not even close this thing even though

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.120 
not even close this thing even though
it's<00:01:09.900> about<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.380> same<00:01:10.650> weight<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.979> glide

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
it's about the same weight as a glide

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.560 
it's about the same weight as a glide
cam<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.490> feels<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.030> going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.210> take<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
cam it feels like it's going to take a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.020 
cam it feels like it's going to take a
beating<00:01:13.170> whereas<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> glide<00:01:14.130> cam<00:01:14.310> feels<00:01:14.640> like

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
beating whereas the glide cam feels like

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.550 
beating whereas the glide cam feels like
you<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.780> really<00:01:16.110> careful<00:01:16.229> with<00:01:16.439> it

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
you have to be really careful with it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.350 
you have to be really careful with it
and<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.770> cover<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.189> foam<00:01:17.460> when<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.880> travel<00:01:18.210> with

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and I cover in foam when I travel with

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.120 
and I cover in foam when I travel with
it<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:19.530> thing<00:01:19.740> I'd<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:19.950> much

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it so with this thing I'd be much

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.920 
it so with this thing I'd be much
happier<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.549> throwing<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.299> around<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.600> little

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
happier just throwing it around a little

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.030 
happier just throwing it around a little
bit<00:01:22.049> more<00:01:22.640> now<00:01:23.640> camera<00:01:24.090> usability<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.040> sort

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
bit more now camera usability and sort

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.090 
bit more now camera usability and sort
of<00:01:26.100> quick<00:01:26.970> release<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.619> great<00:01:28.890> you

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
of quick release on this is great you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.440 
of quick release on this is great you
can<00:01:29.130> use<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.670> comes<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.210> or

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
can use the one that comes with it or

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.800 
can use the one that comes with it or
you<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.049> use<00:01:31.500> your<00:01:31.860> own<00:01:32.240> system<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.720> do

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
you can use your own system like I do

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.810 
you can use your own system like I do
and<00:01:34.590> with<00:01:34.920> your<00:01:35.070> own<00:01:35.159> system<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.700> take

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
and with your own system you can take

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.340 
and with your own system you can take
the<00:01:35.909> camera<00:01:36.030> off<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:36.930> when<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.110> put<00:01:37.259> it

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
the camera off and then when you put it

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.219 
the camera off and then when you put it
back<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.700> know<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.119> if<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.780> Center

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
back on you know that if you just Center

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.450 
back on you know that if you just Center
like<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.740> know<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.130> basically

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
like that you know that it's basically

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.190 
like that you know that it's basically
balanced<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.420> might<00:01:42.570> want<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.750> then<00:01:42.869> fine

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
balanced and you might want to then fine

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.050 
balanced and you might want to then fine
adjust<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.860> just<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.130> tiny<00:01:44.280> bit<00:01:44.460> but<00:01:44.850> generally

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
adjust it just a tiny bit but generally

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.289 
adjust it just a tiny bit but generally
you<00:01:45.479> won't<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.430> or<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.939> don't<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.210> to

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
you won't have to or you don't have to

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.700 
you won't have to or you don't have to
use<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.570> by<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.840> way<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.290> Giotto<00:01:49.680> is

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
use that by the way that's a Giotto is

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.800 
use that by the way that's a Giotto is
one<00:01:49.950> I'll<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.909> do<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> review<00:01:51.750> about

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
one I'll have I do have a review about

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.350 
one I'll have I do have a review about
that<00:01:52.140> I'll<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> link<00:01:52.770> below<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.299> if<00:01:54.299> you

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
that I'll have a link below and if you

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.149 
that I'll have a link below and if you
don't<00:01:54.509> want<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.689> use<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.259> those<00:01:55.619> what<00:01:56.130> you

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
don't want to use one of those what you

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.929 
don't want to use one of those what you
can<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.329> simply<00:01:58.100> remove<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.460> by

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
can do is you can simply remove this by

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.280 
can do is you can simply remove this by
the<00:02:00.000> way<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.299> does<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> very<00:02:00.990> good

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
the way this does have a very good

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.649 
the way this does have a very good
safety<00:02:01.680> system<00:02:02.189> in<00:02:02.280> there<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.969> press

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
safety system in there you have to press

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.440 
safety system in there you have to press
this<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.229> raise<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:05.100> camera<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.240> that's

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
this to raise the camera so that's

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.520 
this to raise the camera so that's
that's<00:02:07.079> really<00:02:07.259> nice<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.649> see<00:02:08.899> this<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.140> much

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that's really nice to see this is much

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.010 
that's really nice to see this is much
better<00:02:10.709> than<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.950> glide<00:02:11.190> cams<00:02:11.459> own

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
better than the glide cams own

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.790 
better than the glide cams own
quick-release<00:02:13.020> system<00:02:13.260> but

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
quick-release system but

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.260 
quick-release system but
it's<00:02:13.920> not<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.100> big<00:02:14.220> issue<00:02:14.310> since<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.790> always<00:02:15.060> use

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
it's not a big issue since I always use

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.050 
it's not a big issue since I always use
my<00:02:15.420> own<00:02:15.570> quick-release<00:02:16.020> systems<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:16.590> top<00:02:17.060> and

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
my own quick-release systems on top and

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.610 
my own quick-release systems on top and
then<00:02:18.480> once<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.810> want<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.990> put<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.200> back<00:02:19.380> on

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
then once you want to put this back on

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.240 
then once you want to put this back on
that<00:02:20.460> goes<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:23.040> then<00:02:23.130> you

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
that goes like that and and then you

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.430 
that goes like that and and then you
will<00:02:23.400> want<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.670> find<00:02:23.880> adjust<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:24.990> what<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.170> do<00:02:25.320> is

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
will want to find adjust it what I do is

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.650 
will want to find adjust it what I do is
I<00:02:25.500> always<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.890> these<00:02:26.130> sort<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.150> half<00:02:27.390> locked

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
I always have these sort of half locked

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.900 
I always have these sort of half locked
when<00:02:28.230> I'm<00:02:28.320> adjusting<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.860> flying<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.730> that

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
when I'm adjusting and flying it so that

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.690 
when I'm adjusting and flying it so that
I<00:02:29.940> can<00:02:30.180> adjust<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.110> like<00:02:32.070> this<00:02:32.250> as<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.490> can<00:02:32.610> see

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
I can adjust it like this as you can see

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.520 
I can adjust it like this as you can see
it's<00:02:32.820> moving<00:02:32.940> but<00:02:33.600> it's<00:02:33.870> not<00:02:33.990> going<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.170> sort

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
it's moving but it's not going to sort

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.050 
it's moving but it's not going to sort
of<00:02:34.560> adjust<00:02:34.710> it's<00:02:35.160> not<00:02:35.250> going<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.430> move<00:02:35.520> on<00:02:35.880> its

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
of adjust it's not going to move on its

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.870 
of adjust it's not going to move on its
own<00:02:36.180> from<00:02:36.570> where<00:02:37.080> it's<00:02:37.200> balanced<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.740> so<00:02:38.430> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
own from where it's balanced to so the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.700 
own from where it's balanced to so the
weight<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.570> camera<00:02:39.720> isn't<00:02:40.020> going<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.260> move

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
weight of the camera isn't going to move

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.410 
weight of the camera isn't going to move
it<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.100> so<00:02:41.520> right<00:02:41.670> now<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.850> can<00:02:42.030> see<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.330> it's

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
it and so right now I can see that it's

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.000 
it and so right now I can see that it's
not<00:02:42.510> bad<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:43.260> I'm<00:02:43.440> just<00:02:43.530> going<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.710> move<00:02:43.830> it

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
not bad so I'm just going to move it

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.170 
not bad so I'm just going to move it
forward<00:02:44.970> forward<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.990> little<00:02:46.080> bit<00:02:46.200> more<00:02:46.380> a

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
forward forward a little bit more a

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.050 
forward forward a little bit more a
little<00:02:48.180> bit<00:02:48.210> more<00:02:48.710> it's<00:02:49.710> quite<00:02:50.700> easy<00:02:50.850> to

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
little bit more it's quite easy to

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.740 
little bit more it's quite easy to
balance<00:02:51.210> quite<00:02:51.540> fast<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.370> generally<00:02:53.370> within

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
balance quite fast and generally within

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.080 
balance quite fast and generally within
ten<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.780> thirty<00:02:55.170> seconds<00:02:55.760> it's<00:02:56.760> going<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.000> be

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
ten to thirty seconds it's going to be

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.820 
ten to thirty seconds it's going to be
balanced<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:59.000> really<00:03:00.000> nice<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.540> regard

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
balanced so really nice on that regard

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.650 
balanced so really nice on that regard
really<00:03:01.830> nice<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.100> balance<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.610> we<00:03:03.210> have<00:03:03.360> final

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
really nice to balance and we have final

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.480 
really nice to balance and we have final
justment<00:03:03.960> knobs<00:03:04.110> here<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.800> won't<00:03:04.980> use<00:03:05.280> any

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
justment knobs here and I won't use any

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.370 
justment knobs here and I won't use any
camera<00:03:06.180> stabilization<00:03:06.420> system<00:03:06.960> like<00:03:07.140> this

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
camera stabilization system like this

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.930 
camera stabilization system like this
that<00:03:07.590> does<00:03:07.740> not<00:03:07.860> have<00:03:08.040> fine<00:03:08.310> adjustment<00:03:08.790> knobs

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
that does not have fine adjustment knobs

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.420 
that does not have fine adjustment knobs
so<00:03:09.420> what<00:03:09.600> we<00:03:09.690> have<00:03:09.810> here<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:10.140> lock<00:03:10.980> four

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
so what we have here is lock four

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.670 
so what we have here is lock four
forward<00:03:11.940> back<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.540> then<00:03:12.810> we<00:03:12.960> have<00:03:13.200> the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
forward back and then we have the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.050 
forward back and then we have the
adjustment<00:03:14.130> four<00:03:14.370> forward<00:03:14.580> back<00:03:14.700> as<00:03:14.940> I've

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
adjustment four forward back as I've

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.390 
adjustment four forward back as I've
shown<00:03:15.270> you<00:03:15.300> and<00:03:15.540> then<00:03:16.140> we<00:03:16.290> have<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.890> lock

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
shown you and then we have the lock

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.790 
shown you and then we have the lock
four<00:03:17.610> left<00:03:17.850> right<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.450> then<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.500> fine

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
four left right and then the fine

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.920 
four left right and then the fine
adjustment<00:03:20.400> four<00:03:20.700> left<00:03:20.970> right<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.480> these

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
adjustment four left right and these

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.229 
adjustment four left right and these
work<00:03:22.170> really<00:03:22.410> well<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:23.100> like<00:03:23.310> on<00:03:23.520> the<00:03:23.880> glide

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
work really well just like on the glide

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.199 
work really well just like on the glide
cam<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:25.010> on<00:03:26.010> some<00:03:26.250> stabilizers<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:26.790> do<00:03:27.030> have

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
cam and on some stabilizers that do have

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.630 
cam and on some stabilizers that do have
this<00:03:27.420> they<00:03:27.959> don't<00:03:28.260> work<00:03:28.709> as<00:03:28.890> well<00:03:28.950> there's<00:03:29.580> a

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
this they don't work as well there's a

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.490 
this they don't work as well there's a
little<00:03:29.790> bit<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:29.910> sort<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.480> issues<00:03:31.110> with<00:03:31.290> them

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
little bit of sort of issues with them

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.110 
little bit of sort of issues with them
or<00:03:31.650> they're<00:03:31.770> too<00:03:31.890> stiff<00:03:32.160> or<00:03:32.340> whatever<00:03:32.610> with

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
or they're too stiff or whatever with

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.080 
or they're too stiff or whatever with
this<00:03:33.360> they<00:03:33.660> work<00:03:33.810> really<00:03:34.110> really<00:03:34.230> nicely<00:03:35.090> now

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
this they work really really nicely now

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.440 
this they work really really nicely now
down<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.959> cameras<00:03:37.650> which<00:03:37.980> ability<00:03:38.550> this<00:03:39.120> thing

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
down to cameras which ability this thing

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.479 
down to cameras which ability this thing
has<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.750> ability<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.140> move<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:40.950> up<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.400> down

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
has the ability to move that up and down

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.640 
has the ability to move that up and down
so<00:03:42.180> this<00:03:42.600> whole<00:03:42.780> piece<00:03:42.989> which<00:03:43.290> is<00:03:43.320> what<00:03:43.440> the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
so this whole piece which is what the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.590 
so this whole piece which is what the
gimbal<00:03:43.920> is<00:03:43.950> attached<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.370> that<00:03:45.060> can<00:03:45.239> move<00:03:45.360> up

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
gimbal is attached to that can move up

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.350 
gimbal is attached to that can move up
and<00:03:45.750> down<00:03:45.900> just<00:03:46.290> by<00:03:46.440> releasing<00:03:46.770> that<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.700> then

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
and down just by releasing that and then

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.000 
and down just by releasing that and then
I<00:03:48.390> move<00:03:48.600> up<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:48.840> down<00:03:48.959> on<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.290> first<00:03:49.620> section

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
I move up and down on the first section

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.190 
I move up and down on the first section
of<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.550> pole<00:03:50.820> and<00:03:51.030> then<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.570> second<00:03:51.870> section

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
of the pole and then the second section

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.840 
of the pole and then the second section
of<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.650> second<00:03:52.890> section<00:03:53.070> of<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.250> pole<00:03:53.400> we'll

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
of the second section of the pole we'll

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.750 
of the second section of the pole we'll
be<00:03:54.330> able<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.570> adjust<00:03:54.870> for<00:03:55.500> fine<00:03:56.160> adjustment<00:03:56.670> so

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
be able to adjust for fine adjustment so

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.650 
be able to adjust for fine adjustment so
that's<00:03:57.000> going<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.209> be<00:03:57.300> your<00:03:57.420> weight

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
that's going to be your weight

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.260 
that's going to be your weight
adjustment<00:03:57.810> as<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.350> more<00:03:59.340> fine<00:03:59.610> control<00:03:59.880> and

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
adjustment as a more fine control and

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.960 
adjustment as a more fine control and
that<00:04:00.660> will<00:04:00.810> go<00:04:00.930> all<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.320> way<00:04:01.350> up<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.770> here<00:04:01.970> what

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
that will go all the way up to here what

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.449 
that will go all the way up to here what
that<00:04:03.090> means<00:04:03.300> is<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:03.989> can<00:04:04.230> put<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.650> 5d<00:04:05.190> on<00:04:05.280> here

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
that means is you can put a 5d on here

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.000 
that means is you can put a 5d on here
or<00:04:05.640> something<00:04:05.940> heavier<00:04:06.239> most<00:04:07.110> cameras<00:04:07.830> at<00:04:07.950> you

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
or something heavier most cameras at you

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.050 
or something heavier most cameras at you
guys<00:04:08.100> will<00:04:08.250> be<00:04:08.310> using<00:04:08.610> this<00:04:08.730> we'll<00:04:08.910> take

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
guys will be using this we'll take

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.479 
guys will be using this we'll take
without<00:04:09.330> any<00:04:09.600> problems<00:04:09.989> just<00:04:10.560> using<00:04:10.920> two

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
without any problems just using two

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.420 
without any problems just using two
weights<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:12.810> it<00:04:12.930> comes<00:04:13.140> with<00:04:13.350> ten<00:04:13.560> so<00:04:14.190> with

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
weights and it comes with ten so with

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.159 
weights and it comes with ten so with
those<00:04:14.610> two<00:04:14.670> weights<00:04:15.060> you<00:04:15.390> can<00:04:15.570> use<00:04:15.780> basically

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
those two weights you can use basically

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.070 
those two weights you can use basically
anything<00:04:16.560> from<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:17.790> 5d<00:04:18.570> with<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> really<00:04:18.930> big

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
anything from a 5d with a really big

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.530 
anything from a 5d with a really big
lens<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.560> maybe<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.280> rail<00:04:20.459> system<00:04:20.669> not<00:04:21.359> that<00:04:21.510> I

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
lens and maybe a rail system not that I

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.640 
lens and maybe a rail system not that I
would<00:04:21.660> really<00:04:21.810> use<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:21.960> real<00:04:22.200> system<00:04:22.440> on<00:04:22.530> here

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
would really use a real system on here

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.400 
would really use a real system on here
but<00:04:22.800> just<00:04:23.070> something<00:04:23.400> really<00:04:23.729> heavy<00:04:24.410> because

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
but just something really heavy because

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.900 
but just something really heavy because
you<00:04:25.710> can<00:04:25.830> have<00:04:25.919> this<00:04:26.039> extended<00:04:26.490> down<00:04:26.669> so

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
you can have this extended down so

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.379 
you can have this extended down so
that'll<00:04:27.120> have

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
that'll have

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.510 
that'll have
balanced<00:04:27.840> for<00:04:28.020> really<00:04:28.199> heavy<00:04:28.349> system<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:28.949> all

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
balanced for really heavy system and all

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.999 
balanced for really heavy system and all
the<00:04:29.550> way<00:04:29.729> down<00:04:29.759> to<00:04:30.240> an<00:04:30.569> NEX<00:04:31.080> camera<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.710> that's

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
the way down to an NEX camera and that's

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.550 
the way down to an NEX camera and that's
where<00:04:32.189> you<00:04:32.310> would<00:04:32.400> move<00:04:32.639> this<00:04:33.319> down<00:04:34.319> a<00:04:34.379> little

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
where you would move this down a little

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.469 
where you would move this down a little
bit<00:04:34.740> and<00:04:35.729> you<00:04:35.789> would<00:04:35.879> have<00:04:35.969> this<00:04:36.120> quite<00:04:36.330> high

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
bit and you would have this quite high

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.360 
bit and you would have this quite high
up<00:04:36.509> and<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:37.379> could<00:04:37.499> have<00:04:37.560> an<00:04:37.680> any<00:04:37.830> X<00:04:37.919> camera<00:04:38.310> or

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
up and you could have an any X camera or

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.059 
up and you could have an any X camera or
an<00:04:38.460> iPhone<00:04:38.789> or<00:04:39.029> GoPro<00:04:39.810> in<00:04:39.990> fact<00:04:40.529> earlier<00:04:41.009> I

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
an iPhone or GoPro in fact earlier I

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.760 
an iPhone or GoPro in fact earlier I
balanced<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.610> with<00:04:41.789> nothing<00:04:42.210> at<00:04:42.389> all<00:04:42.509> and<00:04:42.770> so

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
balanced it with nothing at all and so

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.869 
balanced it with nothing at all and so
that<00:04:43.949> that<00:04:43.979> means<00:04:44.279> that<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.490> don't<00:04:44.669> have<00:04:44.729> to

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:44.879 
that that means that you don't have to

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.070 
that that means that you don't have to
mess<00:04:45.029> about<00:04:45.150> with<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.419> weight<00:04:45.569> like<00:04:45.840> you<00:04:45.960> do

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
mess about with the weight like you do

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.629 
mess about with the weight like you do
on<00:04:46.110> glide<00:04:46.409> cam<00:04:46.590> on<00:04:46.979> glide<00:04:47.249> cam<00:04:47.370> that<00:04:47.520> is<00:04:47.610> a

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
on glide cam on glide cam that is a

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:48.739 
on glide cam on glide cam that is a
little<00:04:47.789> bit<00:04:47.909> of<00:04:47.969> mine<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.270> change<00:04:48.509> weights

00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:48.749 
little bit of mine to change weights

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:50.239 
little bit of mine to change weights
around<00:04:48.870> whereas<00:04:49.229> on<00:04:49.349> this<00:04:49.469> thing<00:04:49.710> you<00:04:49.889> don't

00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:50.249 
around whereas on this thing you don't

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.339 
around whereas on this thing you don't
ever<00:04:50.669> have<00:04:50.819> to<00:04:50.879> you<00:04:51.419> have<00:04:51.449> to<00:04:51.629> carry<00:04:51.960> spare

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
ever have to you have to carry spare

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:53.480 
ever have to you have to carry spare
weights<00:04:52.590> with<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.860> because<00:04:53.039> it<00:04:53.159> will<00:04:53.249> work

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
weights with you because it will work

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.700 
weights with you because it will work
with<00:04:53.699> all<00:04:53.759> your<00:04:53.999> cameras<00:04:54.389> if<00:04:55.169> you<00:04:55.289> do<00:04:55.469> need<00:04:55.680> to

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
with all your cameras if you do need to

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.029 
with all your cameras if you do need to
add<00:04:55.979> extra<00:04:56.460> weights<00:04:56.759> then<00:04:57.590> it<00:04:58.590> does<00:04:58.770> come<00:04:59.009> with

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
add extra weights then it does come with

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.510 
add extra weights then it does come with
a<00:04:59.249> bunch<00:04:59.400> but<00:05:00.270> you<00:05:00.449> generally<00:05:01.250> don't<00:05:02.250> need<00:05:02.430> to

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
a bunch but you generally don't need to

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.659 
a bunch but you generally don't need to
do<00:05:02.610> that<00:05:02.729> so<00:05:03.680> another<00:05:04.680> thing<00:05:04.800> is<00:05:04.919> this<00:05:05.400> does

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
do that so another thing is this does

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.730 
do that so another thing is this does
these<00:05:05.939> weights<00:05:06.150> are<00:05:06.240> easier<00:05:06.779> to<00:05:06.840> remove<00:05:07.500> and

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
these weights are easier to remove and

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.700 
these weights are easier to remove and
add<00:05:07.919> than<00:05:08.340> the<00:05:08.430> glidecam<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:10.050> glide<00:05:10.229> cam<00:05:10.379> has

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
add than the glidecam the glide cam has

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.200 
add than the glidecam the glide cam has
two<00:05:11.009> of<00:05:11.099> these<00:05:11.219> and<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.580> bit<00:05:11.759> I'm<00:05:11.939> going<00:05:12.060> to

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
two of these and a bit I'm going to

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.529 
two of these and a bit I'm going to
remove<00:05:13.139> so<00:05:13.560> that's<00:05:14.430> another<00:05:14.789> plus<00:05:15.150> point<00:05:15.419> to

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
remove so that's another plus point to

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.080 
remove so that's another plus point to
this<00:05:15.629> now<00:05:16.379> it<00:05:16.770> does<00:05:16.949> fold<00:05:17.310> just<00:05:17.789> like<00:05:17.939> the

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
this now it does fold just like the

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.059 
this now it does fold just like the
glide<00:05:18.300> cam<00:05:18.479> and<00:05:18.750> it<00:05:19.020> does<00:05:19.169> require<00:05:19.409> an<00:05:19.710> allen

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:20.069 
glide cam and it does require an allen

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:23.510 
glide cam and it does require an allen
key<00:05:20.219> or<00:05:20.250> a<00:05:20.370> hex<00:05:20.580> key<00:05:20.960> right<00:05:21.960> there<00:05:22.169> and<00:05:22.919> right

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
key or a hex key right there and right

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.409 
key or a hex key right there and right
there<00:05:24.259> to<00:05:25.259> remove<00:05:25.949> this<00:05:26.490> piece<00:05:26.729> and<00:05:27.029> this

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
there to remove this piece and this

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.529 
there to remove this piece and this
piece<00:05:27.479> from<00:05:28.110> the<00:05:28.259> center<00:05:28.620> pole<00:05:28.999> but<00:05:29.999> I<00:05:30.210> find

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
piece from the center pole but I find

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:31.969 
piece from the center pole but I find
that<00:05:30.629> that<00:05:30.689> actually<00:05:31.110> just<00:05:31.409> takes<00:05:31.650> about<00:05:31.830> the

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
that that actually just takes about the

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.950 
that that actually just takes about the
same<00:05:32.129> amount<00:05:32.310> of<00:05:32.580> time<00:05:32.759> as<00:05:32.939> a<00:05:32.969> glide<00:05:33.180> cam<00:05:33.389> so

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
same amount of time as a glide cam so

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.839 
same amount of time as a glide cam so
it's<00:05:34.259> not<00:05:34.469> at<00:05:34.589> all<00:05:34.680> an<00:05:34.860> issue<00:05:35.099> I<00:05:35.400> just<00:05:35.639> have<00:05:35.729> to

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
it's not at all an issue I just have to

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.999 
it's not at all an issue I just have to
keep<00:05:35.969> that<00:05:36.210> in<00:05:36.479> my<00:05:36.599> pocket<00:05:36.930> undo<00:05:37.650> that<00:05:37.800> and

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
keep that in my pocket undo that and

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.219 
keep that in my pocket undo that and
then<00:05:38.490> with<00:05:38.849> the<00:05:38.969> glide<00:05:39.150> camp<00:05:39.389> it<00:05:39.569> unscrews<00:05:40.050> so

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
then with the glide camp it unscrews so

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.469 
then with the glide camp it unscrews so
that<00:05:40.409> piece<00:05:40.620> sort<00:05:40.919> of<00:05:40.979> unscrews<00:05:41.430> and<00:05:41.639> this

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
that piece sort of unscrews and this

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.139 
that piece sort of unscrews and this
piece<00:05:42.689> on<00:05:42.870> screws<00:05:43.310> so<00:05:44.310> it<00:05:44.610> actually<00:05:44.939> takes

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:45.149 
piece on screws so it actually takes

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:46.700 
piece on screws so it actually takes
about<00:05:45.270> the<00:05:45.389> same<00:05:45.479> amount<00:05:45.599> of<00:05:45.779> time<00:05:45.960> so<00:05:46.199> that's

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
about the same amount of time so that's

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.589 
about the same amount of time so that's
all<00:05:46.830> fine<00:05:47.719> now<00:05:49.399> it<00:05:50.399> is<00:05:50.819> apart<00:05:51.360> from<00:05:51.419> that

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
all fine now it is apart from that

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:52.879 
all fine now it is apart from that
there's<00:05:51.810> not<00:05:51.870> really<00:05:51.930> much<00:05:52.139> to<00:05:52.199> say<00:05:52.349> it<00:05:52.710> does

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
there's not really much to say it does

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.869 
there's not really much to say it does
fly<00:05:53.219> really<00:05:53.729> really<00:05:54.210> well<00:05:54.539> it<00:05:55.080> um<00:05:55.740> I<00:05:56.189> do<00:05:56.580> find

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:56.879 
fly really really well it um I do find

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:58.309 
fly really really well it um I do find
out<00:05:57.000> when<00:05:57.120> I<00:05:57.149> fly<00:05:57.479> it<00:05:57.539> I<00:05:57.779> want<00:05:57.990> to<00:05:58.080> keep<00:05:58.199> my

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 
out when I fly it I want to keep my

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.110 
out when I fly it I want to keep my
fingers<00:05:58.649> on<00:05:58.770> here<00:05:58.919> really<00:05:59.279> really<00:05:59.430> gently<00:05:59.879> and

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
fingers on here really really gently and

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.040 
fingers on here really really gently and
sort<00:06:00.899> of<00:06:01.939> just<00:06:02.939> to<00:06:03.000> help<00:06:03.210> control<00:06:03.689> it<00:06:03.870> a<00:06:03.899> little

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
sort of just to help control it a little

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.139 
sort of just to help control it a little
bit<00:06:04.229> but<00:06:04.949> you<00:06:05.550> know<00:06:05.639> it<00:06:05.729> doesn't<00:06:05.879> want<00:06:06.060> to

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:06.149 
bit but you know it doesn't want to

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:08.119 
bit but you know it doesn't want to
swing<00:06:06.539> or<00:06:06.779> tilt<00:06:07.050> on<00:06:07.259> you<00:06:07.439> it<00:06:07.620> doesn't<00:06:07.949> want<00:06:08.039> to

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.129 
swing or tilt on you it doesn't want to

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:10.189 
swing or tilt on you it doesn't want to
the<00:06:08.909> shake<00:06:09.210> isn't<00:06:09.509> going<00:06:09.659> through<00:06:09.960> from<00:06:10.169> your

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
the shake isn't going through from your

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.740 
the shake isn't going through from your
hand<00:06:10.560> and<00:06:10.800> this<00:06:11.310> actually<00:06:11.669> helps<00:06:12.029> eliminate

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
hand and this actually helps eliminate

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.070 
hand and this actually helps eliminate
shake<00:06:13.229> to<00:06:13.500> having<00:06:13.919> your<00:06:14.039> fingers<00:06:14.399> here<00:06:15.080> does

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
shake to having your fingers here does

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.829 
shake to having your fingers here does
help<00:06:16.319> you<00:06:16.469> get<00:06:16.710> a<00:06:17.300> little<00:06:18.300> bit<00:06:18.419> more<00:06:18.539> stability

00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:18.839 
help you get a little bit more stability

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:21.920 
help you get a little bit more stability
but<00:06:19.139> it's<00:06:19.259> not<00:06:19.409> that<00:06:19.529> it's<00:06:19.649> really<00:06:20.870> making<00:06:21.870> a

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
but it's not that it's really making a

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.629 
but it's not that it's really making a
huge<00:06:22.199> difference<00:06:22.379> it's<00:06:22.800> just<00:06:23.069> how<00:06:23.250> I<00:06:23.279> like<00:06:23.520> to

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
huge difference it's just how I like to

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.829 
huge difference it's just how I like to
fly<00:06:23.849> this<00:06:23.909> and<00:06:24.240> I<00:06:25.789> have<00:06:26.789> posted<00:06:27.240> already<00:06:27.449> an

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:27.839 
fly this and I have posted already an

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:30.920 
fly this and I have posted already an
example<00:06:28.469> flying<00:06:28.949> this<00:06:29.159> where<00:06:29.849> they<00:06:30.029> I<00:06:30.629> believe

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
example flying this where they I believe

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.600 
example flying this where they I believe
it<00:06:31.110> with<00:06:31.529> an<00:06:31.680> e<00:06:32.039> XX<00:06:32.610> camera<00:06:33.979> so<00:06:34.979> I'll<00:06:35.459> have<00:06:35.580> a

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
it with an e XX camera so I'll have a

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.279 
it with an e XX camera so I'll have a
link<00:06:35.789> to<00:06:35.879> that<00:06:35.969> below<00:06:36.120> but<00:06:36.479> generally<00:06:36.899> flies

link to that below but generally flies

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:41.090 
link to that below but generally flies
really<00:06:37.740> well<00:06:38.039> and<00:06:39.050> yeah<00:06:40.050> really<00:06:40.620> deaf

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.760 
a highly recommended product something I
would<00:06:45.120> be<00:06:45.240> happy<00:06:45.570> to<00:06:45.600> use<00:06:46.020> something<00:06:46.650> that's

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
would be happy to use something that's

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.830 
would be happy to use something that's
much<00:06:47.040> cheaper<00:06:47.070> than<00:06:47.460> a<00:06:47.670> glidecam<00:06:48.450> which<00:06:48.690> is

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
much cheaper than a glidecam which is

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.170 
much cheaper than a glidecam which is
the<00:06:48.960> only<00:06:49.140> alternative<00:06:49.950> so<00:06:50.730> far<00:06:50.970> that<00:06:51.090> I've

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
the only alternative so far that I've

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.800 
the only alternative so far that I've
seen<00:06:51.450> that's<00:06:52.580> really<00:06:53.580> really<00:06:53.790> worth<00:06:54.060> its<00:06:54.480> cost

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
seen that's really really worth its cost

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.140 
seen that's really really worth its cost
however<00:06:55.080> this<00:06:55.800> thing<00:06:56.070> is<00:06:56.250> about<00:06:56.460> the<00:06:56.640> same<00:06:56.910> at

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.150 
however this thing is about the same at

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.070 
however this thing is about the same at
half<00:06:57.480> the<00:06:57.630> price<00:06:57.840> so<00:06:59.060> for<00:07:00.060> me<00:07:00.270> this<00:07:00.720> is<00:07:01.050> a

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
half the price so for me this is a

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.100 
half the price so for me this is a
really<00:07:01.320> fantastic<00:07:01.500> system<00:07:02.010> and<00:07:02.390> I<00:07:03.390> really<00:07:03.840> do

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.110 
really fantastic system and I really do

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.650 
really fantastic system and I really do
