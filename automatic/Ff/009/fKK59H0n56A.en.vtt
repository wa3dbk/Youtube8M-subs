00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
because the effect will be the same with

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.250 
because the effect will be the same with
with<00:00:43.079> either<00:00:43.350> class<00:00:43.800> setup<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.340> use<00:00:44.610> now

runic accuracy supreme Rican axe
accuracy<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.390> obviously<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:48.780> related<00:00:49.320> to

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
accuracy is obviously just related to

mage<00:00:49.710> now<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.010> equivalent<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.730> fo<00:00:50.940> range

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
mage now the equivalent to that fo range

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.240 
mage now the equivalent to that fo range
i'm<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.660> show<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.809> now<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.890> shop

i'm going to show you now in the shop
and<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> reason<00:00:53.730> why<00:00:53.820> i<00:00:53.850> don't<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.329> or

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
and the reason why i don't have this or

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.150 
and the reason why i don't have this or
is<00:00:54.629> because<00:00:54.899> i<00:00:54.930> personally<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.559> don't<00:00:55.890> range

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
is because i personally just don't range

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.459 
is because i personally just don't range
dps<00:00:56.370> however<00:00:57.300> i<00:00:57.360> want<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.690> add<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.170> into<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
dps however i want to add this into the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.619 
dps however i want to add this into the
video<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.859> anyone<00:00:59.160> who<00:00:59.309> does<00:00:59.609> use<00:01:00.000> ascensions

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
video for anyone who does use ascensions

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.340 
video for anyone who does use ascensions
for<00:01:00.809> example<00:01:01.170> now<00:01:01.710> if<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.280> go<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:03.170> let's<00:01:04.170> say

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
for example now if we go to let's say

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.160 
for example now if we go to let's say
we'll<00:01:04.650> go<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.830> tiff<00:01:05.100> for<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:06.600> try<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.869> find

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
we'll go to tiff for and we try and find

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.870 
we'll go to tiff for and we try and find
supreme<00:01:07.740> sharpshooter<00:01:08.340> they<00:01:08.490> go<00:01:08.670> so

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
supreme sharpshooter they go so

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.030 
supreme sharpshooter they go so
increases<00:01:09.450> your<00:01:09.540> range<00:01:09.810> accuracy<00:01:10.260> by<00:01:10.710> ten

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
increases your range accuracy by ten

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.399 
increases your range accuracy by ten
percent<00:01:11.150> so<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> aura<00:01:12.840> pretty<00:01:13.229> much

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
percent so this is the aura pretty much

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.520 
percent so this is the aura pretty much
equivalent<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:14.070> supreme<00:01:14.580> runic<00:01:14.880> accuracy

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
equivalent to supreme runic accuracy

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.609 
equivalent to supreme runic accuracy
where<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:17.070> tier<00:01:17.580> 4<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.180> obviously<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.380> costs

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
where it's tier 4 and obviously it costs

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.590 
where it's tier 4 and obviously it costs
quite<00:01:19.860> quite<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> lot<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.820> points<00:01:21.210> over<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
quite quite a lot of points over the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.120 
quite quite a lot of points over the
time<00:01:21.900> if<00:01:22.049> you've<00:01:22.200> got<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> bite<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.740> one<00:01:22.979> two

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
time if you've got a bite a one two

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.039 
time if you've got a bite a one two
three<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:24.090> four<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.540> actually<00:01:24.840> purchase

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
three and then four to actually purchase

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.219 
three and then four to actually purchase
supreme<00:01:25.880> it<00:01:26.880> doesn't<00:01:27.090> work<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.330> PvP<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:28.049> this

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
supreme it doesn't work in PvP so this

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.990 
supreme it doesn't work in PvP so this
is<00:01:28.259> just<00:01:28.500> focused<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:28.950> pvm<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.520> course<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.970> you

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
is just focused on pvm of course and you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.210 
is just focused on pvm of course and you
want<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.720> replacing<00:01:31.110> basically<00:01:31.829> supreme

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
want to be replacing basically supreme

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.310 
want to be replacing basically supreme
runic<00:01:32.520> accuracy<00:01:32.939> for<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.329> when<00:01:33.930> your<00:01:34.079> range

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
runic accuracy for this when your range

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.980 
runic accuracy for this when your range
dpsing<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.240> pretty<00:01:36.509> much<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> only

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
dpsing and that is pretty much the only

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.590 
dpsing and that is pretty much the only
difference<00:01:37.829> between<00:01:38.460> major<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.030> rage<00:01:39.150> dpsing

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
difference between major and rage dpsing

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.030 
difference between major and rage dpsing
okay<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.140> want<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> be<00:01:40.409> using<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.799> aura

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
okay so you want to be using that aura

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.190

it's<00:02:28.200> definitely<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.769> next<00:02:28.980> best<00:02:29.189> order<00:02:29.519> to

it's definitely the next best order to

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.220 
it's definitely the next best order to
use<00:02:29.939> because<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.750> gives<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.109> that

use because it gives you that

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.500 
use because it gives you that
temperature<00:02:31.739> an<00:02:31.799> extra<00:02:32.189> boost<00:02:32.510> automatically

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
temperature an extra boost automatically

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.390 
temperature an extra boost automatically
when<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.079> use<00:02:34.200> an<00:02:34.319> autumn<00:02:34.650> ability<00:02:35.099> so<00:02:35.280> you'll

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
when you use an autumn ability so you'll

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.940 
when you use an autumn ability so you'll
start<00:02:35.670> from<00:02:35.849> temp<00:02:36.120> sent<00:02:36.359> also<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:37.439> does<00:02:37.680> stack

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
start from temp sent also it does stack

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.459 
start from temp sent also it does stack
with<00:02:38.189> the<00:02:38.280> ring<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.549> vigor<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:38.969> that<00:02:39.150> also

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:39.469 
with the ring of vigor so that also

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.809 
with the ring of vigor so that also
starts<00:02:40.469> you're<00:02:40.590> drilling<00:02:41.250> off<00:02:41.489> at<00:02:41.639> ten

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
starts you're drilling off at ten

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.550 
starts you're drilling off at ten
percent<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.299> both<00:02:42.540> together<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:43.169> twenty

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
percent so both together is twenty

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.229 
percent so both together is twenty
percent<00:02:43.799> starting<00:02:44.189> off<00:02:44.310> point<00:02:44.549> after<00:02:44.879> you've

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
percent starting off point after you've

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.360 
percent starting off point after you've
used<00:02:45.269> death<00:02:45.810> swiftness<00:02:46.230> for<00:02:46.530> example<00:02:46.950> which

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
used death swiftness for example which

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.459 
used death swiftness for example which
is<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.519> range<00:02:47.790> ultimate<00:02:48.329> ability<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.870> then<00:02:49.349> you

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:49.469 
is a range ultimate ability and then you

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.559 
is a range ultimate ability and then you
can<00:02:49.590> get<00:02:49.709> straight<00:02:49.980> into<00:02:50.159> a<00:02:50.400> threshold<00:02:51.180> range

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
can get straight into a threshold range

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.459 
can get straight into a threshold range
ability<00:02:52.169> and<00:02:52.409> such<00:02:53.159> as<00:02:53.400> whether<00:02:53.760> it's<00:02:54.000> a

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:54.469 
ability and such as whether it's a

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.649 
ability and such as whether it's a
bombardment<00:02:55.469> or<00:02:55.909> snapshot<00:02:56.909> is<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.150> called<00:02:57.329> so

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
bombardment or snapshot is it called so

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.000 
bombardment or snapshot is it called so
you've<00:02:57.959> got<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.139> couple<00:02:58.349> of<00:02:58.469> thresholds<00:02:58.859> there

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
you've got a couple of thresholds there

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.679 
you've got a couple of thresholds there
which<00:02:59.129> you<00:02:59.219> can<00:02:59.340> quickly<00:02:59.609> load<00:03:00.180> off<00:03:00.389> onto

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
which you can quickly load off onto

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.020 
which you can quickly load off onto
virago<00:03:01.409> in<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:02.159> instance<00:03:02.579> and<00:03:02.730> that's<00:03:02.849> why

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
virago in that instance and that's why

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.720
