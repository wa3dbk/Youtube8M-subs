00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:04.959
 Then you often see it in your apartment 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.510
 Full swing 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.839
 Are you an example 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.550
 Enter from the entrance 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.989
 There are many places called kitchen immediately 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:26.689
 Well that it can be promoted to 7 o'clock Friday past 15 o'clock 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.689
 It is this kind of structure for the convenience of parents 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.680
 This pattern is not good either 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.910
 You are above 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.960
 The above is also true 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.130
 It's like this 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.130
 I think it was expensive 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.880
 Same exchange rate or microwave but it's also the same 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.400
 I will go to people in the area 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.660
 This is a flower 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.320
 These parts 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.320
 Hotel Katahama was moved 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.150
 I understood 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.800
 Unfortunately there is no workaround 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.800
 I have no choice but to move 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.170
 Buying from a sense of experience 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.410
 soon 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.110
 Even if exposed to the eye 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.110
 It's like doing that and fighting 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.450
 Hawks 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.289
 On the day 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.060
 I am especially prepared but 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.060
 At the eaves of Toa University's energy 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.590
 I'll get home in this minute 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.610
 Placing it in the fourth place brings its benefits 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.710
 When one carpenter once entered the house 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.900
 It is not possible to put it in the position you can get right away 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.090
 The virtual range should be sent out of sight to the quality of care 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.090
 Is it 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.740
 I will explain the point of the weapon again 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.660
 Winning electromagnetic waves 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.730
 It can be a source of energy for schools, and a tsunami 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.510
 Big energy is wrong when people are going up 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.379
 I will go to the same school 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.309
 It is recommended to go for use with a range of tsunamis that will win 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:25.999
 Made with the first biotech after the close 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.559
 I can not move my health. 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:30.289
 After all though
