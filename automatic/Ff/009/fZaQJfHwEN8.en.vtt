00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.550
 if animals are taken in a vehicle, the driver is obliged to 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.229
 sufficiently secure 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:13.119
 Manufacturers offer different stories 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.249
 for trunk and passenger Straub 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:20.859
 the ADAC has now tested such offers first with a 22 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.279
 Kilogram heavy customer then 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.039
 The first thing was to stop the shops with easy access to the short circuit 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.039
 and one with double connection on the test bench 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.750
 In the crash test, the technology with double bindings proved to be acceptable 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.490
 and conditionally recommendable 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.620
 however, with a simple connection, the impact load is simple 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.150
 not all stand here agree on a complete failure of a system 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.300
 God Agten with whom the dog was actually attached to the vehicle is complete 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.580
 breached 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.610
 which means that there was no restraint and that the goal could be achieved 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.610
 its entire mass of all our office n-energy here 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.379
 in the seat we see here a change the fourth formation the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.290
 of course the driver here especially in the lumbar spine strong 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.690
 that's what it means here 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.040
 Percent injury back area with certainty he has adorned next 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.280
 place 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.960
 the next attempt should be 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.060
 a four kilogram cat lady in the transport box first in the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.000
 Footwell behind the front seats 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.189
 this position proved to be safe and reliable 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.700
 because the Bugsier has almost no freedom of movement also is the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.940
 lateral positioning hardly risk of injury to the animal 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.990
 extremely critical of the alleged security with the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.410
 Vehicle belt Brigitte Fürle and Kurt bracket bursting on impact 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.200
 Consequence wherever possible the four-legged in the trunk 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.170
 we see here a team the grid the visible forms 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.140
 were supported to the ceiling 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.400
 In the normal accident, of course, we have some protection here 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.630
 only because who have the high load here fall accident just in the top 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.330
 Area of ​​the ghetto then of course it can happen that's it he gives 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.550
 dissolves very easily 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.550
 and thereby 4 2 not in the interior 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:10.720
 here measures the size of the dog allowed 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.989
 but should also be used here a transport box 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.060
 important here 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.000
 the positioning transversely to the direction of travel it loads the animal in the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.370
 Trap of an accident least, despite the tireless out 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:25.909
 this looks like a change in the formation 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.639
 the rear seat back 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:32.539
 The formation itself testifies is very high load skat these 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.639
 Straub can be a bit of a trick, though 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:36.529
 minimize 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:40.279
 by here the three points or closes the thus also still for one 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:44.849
 Support Unger own seats per cent and thus all have 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.139
 even more very simple load securing that costs nothing 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.740
 Life costs but can be an animal transport 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.159
 the on every backup 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.989
 the ADAC has also tested this situation 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.989
 the four-legged friend on the hat rack 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.810
 Place at impact with 50 kilometers per hour by the vehicle 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.810
 a deadly danger to humans and animals 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.060
 On the other hand, we protect the greatest possible care adheres to the adac tester 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.509
 balance sheet 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:12.610
 you can see clearly 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.239
 that housing an animal in a box in the trunk 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.149
 that is the first place 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:21.739
 in larger dogs, the cultivation of a separate is still recommended 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.459
 but for a normal and a normal size so the box is the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:26.180
 safest place 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.740
 The box should be installed across the vehicle
