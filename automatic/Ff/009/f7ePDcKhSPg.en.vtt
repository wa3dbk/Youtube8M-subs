over any other enemy you've fought so

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.860 
over any other enemy you've fought so
far<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:32.090> after<00:00:33.090> dealing<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.420> couple<00:00:33.690> hits

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
far is that after dealing a couple hits

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.380 
far is that after dealing a couple hits
to<00:00:34.050> him<00:00:34.200> he<00:00:34.559> will<00:00:34.829> respond<00:00:35.520> by<00:00:35.760> shooting<00:00:36.239> you

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
to him he will respond by shooting you

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.450 
to him he will respond by shooting you
with<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> shotgun<00:00:37.040> which<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.160> going<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.370> be

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
with a shotgun which is going to be

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.760 
with a shotgun which is going to be
enough<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.910> stun<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.450> for<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:40.110> second<00:00:40.469> or<00:00:40.590> so

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
enough to stun you for a second or so

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.709 
enough to stun you for a second or so
and<00:00:41.399> probably<00:00:41.610> allow<00:00:42.059> him<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.420> get<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.629> a

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
and probably allow him to get in a

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.950 
and probably allow him to get in a
follow-up<00:00:42.989> attack<00:00:43.489> unless<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:45.059> gotten

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
follow-up attack unless you have gotten

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.660 
follow-up attack unless you have gotten
far<00:00:46.110> enough<00:00:46.140> away<00:00:46.410> from<00:00:46.680> him<00:00:46.860> one<00:00:47.460> thing<00:00:47.579> to

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
far enough away from him one thing to

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.880 
far enough away from him one thing to
keep<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.879> mind<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.690> need<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.899> hit<00:00:49.110> him<00:00:49.289> once

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
keep in mind is you need to hit him once

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.740 
keep in mind is you need to hit him once
or<00:00:50.039> twice<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.489> then<00:00:50.550> don't<00:00:51.030> get<00:00:51.149> greedy<00:00:51.390> like

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
or twice and then don't get greedy like

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.770 
or twice and then don't get greedy like
I<00:00:51.899> often<00:00:52.500> do<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.890> video<00:00:53.270> after<00:00:54.270> you've

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.020 
the left or right if you dodge straight
backward<00:00:58.500> his<00:00:58.829> shotgun<00:00:59.309> blast<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.969> to

catch you it's not going to do a ton of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.640 
catch you it's not going to do a ton of
damage<00:01:02.789> but<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.570> really<00:01:03.840> does<00:01:04.049> add<00:01:04.260> up<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
damage but it really does add up and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
damage but it really does add up and
you're<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> find<00:01:05.159> yourself<00:01:05.309> running

low<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.290> blood<00:01:07.290> vials<00:01:07.710> you'll<00:01:07.920> be<00:01:08.040> too<00:01:08.189> far

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
low on blood vials you'll be too far

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.730 
low on blood vials you'll be too far
away<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.670> get<00:01:09.150> off<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> counter<00:01:10.049> hit<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.500> get

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
away to get off a counter hit and get

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.609 
away to get off a counter hit and get
some<00:01:11.040> regain<00:01:11.580> health<00:01:11.820> back<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.049> mess<00:01:13.229> this

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
some regain health back it's a mess this

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.890 
some regain health back it's a mess this
is<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.979> second<00:01:14.369> form<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.760> father<00:01:15.119> Gascon<00:01:15.540> he

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
is the second form of father Gascon he

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.510 
is the second form of father Gascon he
extends<00:01:16.890> his<00:01:16.950> weapon<00:01:17.340> into<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.729> long<00:01:18.509> ass<00:01:18.810> axe

and<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.880> basically<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.240> means<00:01:21.450> his<00:01:21.810> range

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
and that basically just means his range

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.749 
and that basically just means his range
is<00:01:22.140> going<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.409> much<00:01:22.650> much<00:01:22.890> further<00:01:23.400> than

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
is going to be much much further than

you were used to in the first fight just

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.490 
you were used to in the first fight just
take<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.400> into<00:01:26.670> account<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.750> are<00:01:27.990> taking

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
take that into account if you are taking

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.289

need<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.640> use<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.630> stun<00:01:39.869> lock<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.229> kind<00:01:40.829> of

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
need to use it the stun lock is kind of

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.740 
need to use it the stun lock is kind of
handy<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:41.729> honestly<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.299> attacks<00:01:42.600> are

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
handy but honestly the attacks are

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.960 
handy but honestly the attacks are
really<00:01:42.960> slow<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:44.159> gives<00:01:44.610> them<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> lot<00:01:44.909> of

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
really slow and gives them a lot of

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.420 
really slow and gives them a lot of
opportunities<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.649> counter-attack<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.890> with

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
opportunities to counter-attack you with

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.999 
opportunities to counter-attack you with
is<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> shotgun<00:01:48.360> or<00:01:48.540> as<00:01:48.689> weapons<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.860> don't

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
is a shotgun or as weapons so you don't

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.289 
is a shotgun or as weapons so you don't
need<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.189> use<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.369> car<00:01:50.520> camera<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.000> found<00:01:51.210> it

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
need to use the car camera I found it

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.319 
need to use the car camera I found it
useful<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:51.899> your<00:01:52.860> mileage<00:01:53.189> may<00:01:53.369> vary<00:01:53.579> one

useful but your mileage may vary one

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.639 
useful but your mileage may vary one
thing<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.659> keep<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:54.899> mind<00:01:54.960> if<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.409> the

thing to keep in mind if you have the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.160

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880

Gascon it will temporarily stun him

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.449 
Gascon it will temporarily stun him
allowing<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:21.109> execute<00:02:22.109> an<00:02:22.920> attack<00:02:23.219> on<00:02:23.370> his

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
allowing you to execute an attack on his

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.610 
allowing you to execute an attack on his
backside<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.180> perhaps<00:02:24.840> Sun<00:02:25.200> him<00:02:25.379> and<00:02:25.530> do<00:02:25.590> a

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
backside and perhaps Sun him and do a

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.220 
backside and perhaps Sun him and do a
visceral<00:02:25.890> attack<00:02:26.780> one<00:02:27.780> thing<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.019> keep<00:02:28.109> in

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
visceral attack one thing to keep in

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.899 
visceral attack one thing to keep in
mind<00:02:28.290> though<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.739> that<00:02:28.769> it<00:02:29.010> will<00:02:29.129> activate<00:02:29.609> his

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
mind though is that it will activate his

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.780 
mind though is that it will activate his
final<00:02:30.480> form<00:02:30.810> which<00:02:31.049> is<00:02:31.170> by<00:02:31.319> far<00:02:31.530> his<00:02:31.709> most

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
final form which is by far his most

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.270 
final form which is by far his most
deadly<00:02:32.790> form<00:02:32.969> a<00:02:33.569> lot<00:02:34.079> earlier<00:02:34.469> than<00:02:34.799> just

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
deadly form a lot earlier than just

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.119 
deadly form a lot earlier than just
normally<00:02:35.639> finding<00:02:35.969> him<00:02:36.120> would<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.530> there's<00:02:38.069> a

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
normally finding him would so there's a

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.229 
normally finding him would so there's a
little<00:02:38.250> bit<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.549> trade-off<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.879> can<00:02:39.120> make

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
little bit of a trade-off you can make

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.000 
little bit of a trade-off you can make
the<00:02:39.329> early<00:02:39.569> part<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.870> fight<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.200> bit<00:02:40.650> easier

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
the early part of the fight a bit easier

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.379 
the early part of the fight a bit easier
but<00:02:41.159> you<00:02:41.219> will<00:02:41.459> have<00:02:41.609> to<00:02:41.760> fight<00:02:41.909> his<00:02:42.090> hardest

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
but you will have to fight his hardest

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.479 
but you will have to fight his hardest
form<00:02:42.629> much<00:02:42.810> longer<00:02:43.200> than<00:02:43.319> you<00:02:43.349> do<00:02:43.590> just

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
form much longer than you do just

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.960 
form much longer than you do just
fighting<00:02:44.790> him<00:02:44.909> the<00:02:45.030> normal<00:02:45.359> way<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.900> obviously

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
fighting him the normal way I obviously

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.699 
fighting him the normal way I obviously
completed<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.209> way<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:49.139> I<00:02:49.260> didn't<00:02:49.620> think

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
completed it this way and I didn't think

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.229 
completed it this way and I didn't think
it<00:02:49.829> was<00:02:49.919> too<00:02:50.310> terribly<00:02:50.700> hard<00:02:50.939> it<00:02:51.030> took<00:02:51.150> me

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
it was too terribly hard it took me

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.000 
it was too terribly hard it took me
maybe<00:02:51.359> four<00:02:51.689> or<00:02:51.720> five<00:02:51.780> tries

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
maybe four or five tries

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.289 
maybe four or five tries
but<00:02:53.280> if<00:02:53.370> you're<00:02:53.489> having<00:02:53.609> a<00:02:53.760> lot<00:02:53.909> of<00:02:54.060> trouble

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
but if you're having a lot of trouble

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.699 
but if you're having a lot of trouble
with<00:02:54.389> the<00:02:54.480> fight<00:02:54.629> you<00:02:54.780> want<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:54.989> mix<00:02:55.079> it<00:02:55.200> up<00:02:55.290> you

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
with the fight you want to mix it up you

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.099 
with the fight you want to mix it up you
can<00:02:55.980> start<00:02:56.340> using<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:57.000> tiny<00:02:57.299> music<00:02:57.659> box<00:02:57.840> in

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
can start using the tiny music box in

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.599 
can start using the tiny music box in
your<00:02:58.260> strategy<00:02:58.379> so<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:58.859> is<00:02:58.919> his<00:02:59.129> third<00:02:59.280> form

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
your strategy so this is his third form

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.229 
your strategy so this is his third form
he<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.150> now<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.480> wolf<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.609> his<00:03:02.609> attacks<00:03:02.969> are<00:03:03.150> a

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
he is now a wolf and his attacks are a

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.030 
he is now a wolf and his attacks are a
lot<00:03:03.569> more<00:03:03.599> brutal<00:03:04.109> he<00:03:04.230> has<00:03:04.349> a<00:03:04.379> lot<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.709> really

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
lot more brutal he has a lot of really

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.640 
lot more brutal he has a lot of really
devastating<00:03:05.790> combos<00:03:06.239> here<00:03:07.079> I'm<00:03:07.230> throwing<00:03:07.500> an

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
devastating combos here I'm throwing an

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.110 
devastating combos here I'm throwing an
oil<00:03:07.919> iron<00:03:08.189> atom<00:03:08.519> which<00:03:08.639> you<00:03:08.760> should<00:03:08.939> have<00:03:09.090> a

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
oil iron atom which you should have a

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.270 
oil iron atom which you should have a
few<00:03:09.329> of<00:03:09.480> if<00:03:10.019> you've<00:03:10.200> been<00:03:10.469> paying<00:03:10.889> attention

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
few of if you've been paying attention

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.520 
few of if you've been paying attention
to<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.400> landscape<00:03:11.819> that<00:03:12.659> actually<00:03:13.260> makes
