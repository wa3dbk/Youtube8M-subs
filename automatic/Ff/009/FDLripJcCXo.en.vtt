00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.450
 for a new video on ff8 so I 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.919
 will put two videos to follow of a 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.059
 high level of the playlist at the level 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.559
 related quests because you will see 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.750
 that cd almost any side quests that 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.530
 come together but for it to be more 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.330
 easy to search 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.880
 I'm really going on a side quest 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.130
 for then I'm going to do a quest 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.720
 schedule for the occult fans you 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.119
 can catch on the horizon when you 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.880
 first arrival in the city and a 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.070
 video for the fisherman's quest 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.090
 of horizon you will see that both 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.950
 almost complete each other but in the end 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.719
 it's going to be it's going to be related but that I 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.700
 are going to make separate video for this 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.050
 be easier to search in the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.110
 plague or if you ever seek the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.340
 magazine q that you want so suddenly 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.780
 as you can see I'm at my 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.730
 first arrival on horizon so that's 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.230
 very important because if kind of you 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.480
 come back to horizon later you will see 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.670
 that the fisherman is no longer there so know 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.379
 all the same that worship fans one and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.649
 two and it seems to me that you can 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.359
 their mugs and CDs on May 3 on 3 and 4 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.770
 you can not suddenly it's very 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.250
 important that the first time that 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.760
 I arrived on the horizon you grabbed 7 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.229
 so this magazine has it if you have 7 400 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.630
 that means you're it's the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.369
 first time you come so me 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.560
 I love especially horizon especially 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.479
 the atmosphere the music i like mans 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.950
 it's one of my favorite and funny 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.689
 the super rebel event 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.189
 so at that moment it's subtle but 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.140
 you have a scale and pressing 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.040
 what you can get off and you 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.040
 see that we are going to arrive in a 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.390
 different area actually where we will be able to 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.710
 to cross the horizon fisherman and that's 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.320
 him who will offer us the magnificent 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.970
 worship magazine fans so he's me 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.020
 seems like it's number 3 which gives so 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.880
 that's why it's important not to 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.840
 miss out on 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.079
 but it's the second that I 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.340
 recovers these findings as preferred 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.780
 attention knowing that there are some there are 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.920
 do the others stood a little 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.780
 little further so there is a second one 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.460
 which is in the CD twice or so 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.860
 it's the last two are at 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.840
 cd 3 I do not know anymore but I have a 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.560
 problem to climb the ladders I 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.880
 gained repression so there we are going to be 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.079
 arrived so I'll show you the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.220
 traits so this is a super video 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.360
 curtain that's really the story of 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.530
 show you where he is and what he needs 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.950
 do not forget it because it's 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.629
 important 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.340
 so we actually have seven fishermen 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.980
 jostled on arriving at the club and I got 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.349
 at first so talking to him or neymar 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.349
 we are going to trigger a special dialogue 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.569
 so excused or neck 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.560
 and he speaks internally 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.710
 so suddenly he will explain to us 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.270
 a little that yeah that's it for that 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.730
 so called m fishermen so suddenly 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.080
 we're going to throw the video right after 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.270
 I will explain to you a little bit 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.710
 different things you can do 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.450
 with him because it could 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.610
 get to get a megalith firm 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.620
 that an object as quite rare 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.480
 it can be nice so if you ever 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.280
 want to make this little head so 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.680
 in thanks he offers us the worship 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:11.140
 fan number 3 so this is so suddenly we 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.580
 got the 2nd so we have two on 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.070
 four normally so the first one who 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.280
 is right there and so we just got 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.020
 the third 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.000
 so it gives us another hint 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.730
 on the geforce 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.980
 So there they are afraid we must 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.230
 have 666 objects to be able to 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.450
 invoke the geforce of this year so 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.220
 in fact it's 6 6 copies of each 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.540
 object so 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.070
 the vise tightens soon we will know 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.050
 how to invoke this geforce so me 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.520
 I explain myself I say again 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.930
 that you do not have the blues you 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.480
 do not need all the magazines 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.440
 to invoke this geforce but know 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.780
 all the same that if you want to get 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.360
 all the object of the game but now we 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.800
 is going to get worship 23 on that we get 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.150
 leave it there and we find ourselves all of 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.180
 following either for the side quest of 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.130
 fisherman be for the next the 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.790
 next to worship fans stumped go 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.790
