00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.930

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.520

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.780
 a room with these colors black white 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:17.270
 yellow was the king of water and was another 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.270
 people are fine then 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.660

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.700
 then he always took for the bubbles of 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.380
 soap excellent value for money 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:51.280
 three of these cost one euro 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:54.729
 then he took prizes for her and temperas 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.940
 they are tiny, well- made cine packages 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.810
 proportionate by measured 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:07.560
 we say that if not the divine when outside 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.560
 bows impaled but I took them 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.970
 common are so cute then i got it 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.540
 always for her the collection in China 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.920
 markers when you go to type 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.830
 restaurant need to stay a while 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.660
 quiet support to color one 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.100
 limited amount to stop the lists 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.680
 a peach 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.240
 then I took the toothbrush 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.240
 with a cute 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.050
 then the famous candle is a cover 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.180
 yellow metal case because I hear 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.890
 part click in combination of the yellow 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:52.910
 and green as too true is good for 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:56.120
 mention to nothing that I like to cut 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.430
 style as you speak I really like the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.950
 linko software has given me a lot 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.580
 inspiration for the furnishing of this 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.400
 room that I will do in Nordic style 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:13.180
 and vice walls 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:16.340
 then I got some Spanish paper 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.590
 that is, I am 20, this is not the only one 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.739
 good proportion between too many veils and for 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.190
 let the little girl be karma sometimes now 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.930
 just not following 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.930
 then at the time 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:36.840
 then i'm one i 'll never be a 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:40.830
 tattoo and I took them I hope and want 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.010
 find they are cute no cellini there is 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.890
 also the lovely carafe then whoever 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:57.890
 know maybe I like it because it starts 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:04:03.870
 doing it is not understanding each other then I got it 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:06.210
 research tents on the stock exchange or if 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.830
 then always a pen though and nice not 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.500
 he never has it and these palms of 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.500
 beautiful fantasies 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.500
 ok 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:21.450
 inside there is a little girl the mythical yes 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.340
 called that to make the designs I 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.900
 I remember how it's called I used to go to mortar 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.480

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.830
 child guarantee three and a half years now 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:35.820
 however you can probably start 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:40.230
 then experiment this backpack for her 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.840
 tell me if it's not too good and the rest 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.500
 for the summer, the small pool, etc. 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.470
 etc 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.470
 all too 5 euros 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:55.699
 then I took you expo and wanted to tell you then 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.830

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:04.400

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:07.430

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.340

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.240

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.330
