made<00:03:05.390> out<00:03:05.570> of<00:03:05.600> ink<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.530> or<00:03:06.920> liquid<00:03:07.370> and

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
made out of ink and or liquid and

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.370 
made out of ink and or liquid and
therefore<00:03:08.030> doesn't<00:03:08.480> follow<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.959> same<00:03:09.140> laws

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
therefore doesn't follow the same laws

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.290 
therefore doesn't follow the same laws
as<00:03:09.410> physical<00:03:10.130> reality<00:03:10.550> you'd<00:03:10.820> think<00:03:10.910> that

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
as physical reality you'd think that

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.840 
as physical reality you'd think that
being<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.690> sort<00:03:11.930> of<00:03:12.050> where<00:03:12.470> squid<00:03:13.160> who<00:03:13.459> can<00:03:13.640> turn

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
being a sort of where squid who can turn

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.550 
being a sort of where squid who can turn
into<00:03:14.120> ink<00:03:14.450> whenever<00:03:14.840> they<00:03:15.019> want<00:03:15.260> would<00:03:15.440> make

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
into ink whenever they want would make

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.040 
into ink whenever they want would make
your<00:03:15.680> life<00:03:15.739> pretty<00:03:16.070> simple<00:03:16.489> but<00:03:16.670> no<00:03:17.239> if<00:03:17.750> you

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
your life pretty simple but no if you

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.840 
your life pretty simple but no if you
get<00:03:18.200> shot<00:03:18.230> by<00:03:18.709> ink<00:03:19.010> that's<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.340> different<00:03:19.640> color

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
get shot by ink that's a different color

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.740 
get shot by ink that's a different color
than<00:03:19.940> you<00:03:20.360> you<00:03:21.080> get<00:03:21.800> sad<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.850> then<00:03:23.120> explode

then you decide you don't want to be in
that<00:05:01.820> game<00:05:02.120> anymore<00:05:02.330> you<00:05:02.930> can't<00:05:03.199> just<00:05:03.410> quit<00:05:03.560> it

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
that game anymore you can't just quit it

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.960 
that game anymore you can't just quit it
you<00:05:04.070> have<00:05:04.160> to<00:05:04.280> wait<00:05:04.400> for<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.639> timer<00:05:04.880> to

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
you have to wait for the timer to

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.400 
you have to wait for the timer to
countdown<00:05:05.300> and<00:05:05.570> sometimes<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.020> timer<00:05:06.259> is

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
countdown and sometimes the timer is

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.070 
countdown and sometimes the timer is
like<00:05:06.590> 200<00:05:07.099> seconds<00:05:07.460> long<00:05:07.669> admittedly<00:05:08.660> you<00:05:08.930> can

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
like 200 seconds long admittedly you can

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.390 
like 200 seconds long admittedly you can
play<00:05:09.289> one<00:05:09.530> of<00:05:09.620> these<00:05:09.740> little<00:05:09.919> mini<00:05:10.160> games

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
play one of these little mini games

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.740 
play one of these little mini games
during<00:05:10.669> that<00:05:10.820> time<00:05:11.000> that<00:05:11.270> are<00:05:11.389> actually

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
during that time that are actually

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.689 
during that time that are actually
really<00:05:12.229> fun<00:05:12.440> but<00:05:12.919> still<00:05:13.099> you<00:05:13.250> should<00:05:13.400> be<00:05:13.490> given

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
really fun but still you should be given

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:14.950 
really fun but still you should be given
the<00:05:13.789> option<00:05:13.940> to<00:05:14.120> quit<00:05:14.330> if<00:05:14.449> you<00:05:14.509> don't<00:05:14.750> want

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
the option to quit if you don't want

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.719 
the option to quit if you don't want
there's<00:05:15.259> also<00:05:15.440> just<00:05:15.560> not<00:05:15.860> enough<00:05:16.160> in<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.580> way

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
there's also just not enough in the way

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.210 
there's also just not enough in the way
of<00:05:16.940> options<00:05:17.389> on<00:05:17.539> how<00:05:17.780> you<00:05:17.840> play<00:05:18.259> online<00:05:18.500> sure

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
of options on how you play online sure

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.589 
of options on how you play online sure
there's<00:05:19.460> a<00:05:19.520> lot<00:05:19.669> of<00:05:19.699> different<00:05:20.030> weapons<00:05:20.330> and

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
there's a lot of different weapons and

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.240 
there's a lot of different weapons and
tons<00:05:20.840> of<00:05:20.960> different<00:05:21.050> kinds<00:05:21.500> of<00:05:21.590> gear<00:05:21.860> that<00:05:21.919> all

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
tons of different kinds of gear that all

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.680 
tons of different kinds of gear that all
have<00:05:22.460> different<00:05:22.639> stat<00:05:23.000> boosts<00:05:23.240> to<00:05:23.509> them

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
have different stat boosts to them

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.050 
have different stat boosts to them
that's<00:05:24.110> really<00:05:24.500> cool<00:05:24.710> but<00:05:25.310> there's<00:05:25.580> only<00:05:25.699> five

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
that's really cool but there's only five

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.270 
that's really cool but there's only five
stages<00:05:26.479> to<00:05:26.780> play<00:05:27.020> online<00:05:27.259> and<00:05:27.710> two<00:05:28.099> different

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
stages to play online and two different

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.180 
stages to play online and two different
modes<00:05:28.639> so<00:05:29.300> sadly<00:05:29.930> fatigue<00:05:30.500> might<00:05:30.710> set<00:05:30.949> in<00:05:31.070> a

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
modes so sadly fatigue might set in a

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.279 
modes so sadly fatigue might set in a
lot<00:05:31.370> sooner<00:05:31.729> than<00:05:31.759> it<00:05:32.000> has<00:05:32.180> to<00:05:32.210> Nintendo<00:05:33.169> would

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
lot sooner than it has to Nintendo would

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:34.749 
lot sooner than it has to Nintendo would
just<00:05:33.440> own<00:05:33.560> a<00:05:33.590> few<00:05:33.830> more<00:05:33.949> stages<00:05:34.250> in<00:05:34.550> there<00:05:34.729> a

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 
just own a few more stages in there a

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.939 
just own a few more stages in there a
few<00:05:34.940> more<00:05:35.240> modes<00:05:35.570> or<00:05:35.990> maybe<00:05:36.139> some<00:05:36.380> sort<00:05:36.650> of<00:05:36.740> co

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
op for the campaign mode that would have

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.420 
op for the campaign mode that would have
gone<00:05:38.870> a<00:05:38.930> long<00:05:39.139> way<00:05:39.380> and<00:05:39.680> maybe<00:05:40.070> they'll<00:05:40.280> do

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
gone a long way and maybe they'll do

gone a long way and maybe they'll do
that<00:05:40.460> the<00:05:40.759> future<00:05:41.180> but<00:05:41.360> for<00:05:41.389> now<00:05:41.570> we<00:05:41.690> can<00:05:41.930> only

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
that the future but for now we can only

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.749 
that the future but for now we can only
review<00:05:42.349> the<00:05:42.409> game<00:05:42.650> we've<00:05:42.860> been<00:05:42.889> handed<00:05:43.430> which

just feels a tiny bit short in terms of
