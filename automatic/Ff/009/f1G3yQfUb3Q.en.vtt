00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.000
 summer sun and fresh garden air 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.590
 would that really want to enjoy the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.110
 This can be best enjoyed on one 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.750
 terrace on comfortable garden furniture and 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.990
 under this glass roof like tel o flex 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.550
 roofs are especially individual 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.630
 glass panes that you like 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.939
 open 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.130
 so is despite the covered terrace for 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.380
 fresh air taken care of we have one 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.300
 lightweight aluminum telescope died the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.950
 They vary according to your body size and depending on 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.170
 on their length 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.399
 and then it will be allowed in this 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.079
 slice for slice to the rear 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.210
 pushed or again 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.309
 brought forward so no big 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.649
 Mechanical effort feather-light died 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.899
 and really easy to use the roof 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.030
 is extremely stable pressed and 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.739
 Stainless aluminum supports form the scaffold 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.079
 They are with a special alloy 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.719
 provide the carriers better protect 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.480
 As every lacquer the government exists in 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.220
 different colors the most common form 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.780
 are actually white and brown and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.540
 Anthracite will kill just as often 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.610
 taken or even bright big silver tones 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.290
 beyond that, of course, every color is 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.630
 available so we have already 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.820
 roofs produced in a hero 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.970
 ivory tone in red in green or blue 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.399
 for the one the color for example the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.540
 window frame of the front door in the roof 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.899
 can repeat and that the whole 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.229
 our harmonious looks to unity 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.729
 double glazing and 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.860
 Plastic coating make the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.090
 slices of the terrace roof unbreakable and 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.680
 extremely stable 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.960
 even in storm and heavy 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.700
 precipitation if you could 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.530
 imagine your own even with hail 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.729
 to ask the car under the car 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.070
 safe in good hands 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.439
 Each disc is with aluminum rails 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.210
 framed that make the roof weatherproof 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.729
 In addition, the individual slices 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.289
 with brushes sealed the aluminum 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.990
 then seemed to be handcrafted to the 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.329
 Glass panes are guaranteed 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.070
 the weather resistance even if the 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.289
 wind is on it and rain is up 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.659
 pushes the maximum up to this 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.700
 old profile is then laterally over the 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.250
 Carrier derived back into the trough 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.619
 The roofs are tight so shoppers can 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.420
 the vitello flex badger not only like 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.430
 sitting outside in the sunshine 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.960
 but also with rain showers and 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.090
 cool temperatures 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.520
 the terrace can be additionally with 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.730
 close glass doors and with infrared 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.010
 heat radiators and on warm days 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.600
 because of the sound system at the 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.900
 side and over the roof for one 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.320
 pleasant cool so can the summer 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.320
 come
