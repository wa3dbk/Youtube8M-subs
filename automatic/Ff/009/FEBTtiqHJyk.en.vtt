so that's how you do it I know I screwed

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.719 
so that's how you do it I know I screwed
up<00:01:49.660> a<00:01:49.720> bit<00:01:49.990> but<00:01:50.260> you<00:01:50.500> should<00:01:50.710> get<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:51.040> hang<00:01:51.610> of

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
up a bit but you should get the hang of

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.110 
up a bit but you should get the hang of
it<00:01:51.820> because<00:01:52.180> that<00:01:52.210> is<00:01:52.479> quite<00:01:52.690> simple<00:01:53.760> if<00:01:54.760> you

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
it because that is quite simple if you

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.180
