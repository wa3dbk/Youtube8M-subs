00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
importing kit from a DIY for XCOM and it

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.870 
importing kit from a DIY for XCOM and it
kind<00:01:53.930> of<00:01:54.020> just<00:01:54.170> mounts<00:01:54.560> across<00:01:54.860> over<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.640> top

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
kind of just mounts across over the top

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.540 
kind of just mounts across over the top
of<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.119> axle<00:01:56.330> and<00:01:58.060> shocks<00:01:59.060> come<00:01:59.300> up<00:01:59.450> like<00:01:59.660> this

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
of the axle and shocks come up like this

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.570 
of the axle and shocks come up like this
so<00:02:01.550> that'll<00:02:01.940> be<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.060> next<00:02:02.300> video<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:04.310> I<00:02:04.430> got

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
but they didn't send me hardware with

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.390 
but they didn't send me hardware with
them<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.550> I<00:02:19.390> don't<00:02:20.380> know<00:02:20.590> why<00:02:20.800> but<00:02:21.040> look<00:02:21.220> at<00:02:21.310> my

so<00:02:28.600> I'm<00:02:28.660> gonna<00:02:28.780> have<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:28.960> get<00:02:29.170> new<00:02:29.200> hardware

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
so I'm gonna have to get new hardware

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.980 
so I'm gonna have to get new hardware
before<00:02:30.580> I<00:02:30.790> could<00:02:30.970> finish<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.360> body<00:02:31.540> mounts

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
before I could finish the body mounts

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:39.150 
before I could finish the body mounts
but<00:02:32.200> uh<00:02:32.520> yeah<00:02:33.520> that's<00:02:33.820> no<00:02:34.060> good<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:38.130> yeah<00:02:39.130> I

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
do run new exhaust pipe from the headers

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.670 
do run new exhaust pipe from the headers
back<00:02:45.730> plus<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.540> have<00:02:46.720> some<00:02:46.750> mufflers<00:02:47.320> for<00:02:47.590> them

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
back plus I have some mufflers for them

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.230 
back plus I have some mufflers for them
and<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:49.980> did<00:02:50.980> find<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.310> couple<00:02:51.550> more<00:02:51.730> hairline

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
and I did find a couple more hairline

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.210 
and I did find a couple more hairline
cracks<00:02:55.800> right<00:02:56.800> here<00:02:57.010> by<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.250> steering<00:02:57.670> box

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
cracks right here by the steering box

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
cracks right here by the steering box
right<00:03:00.220> there<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:01.750> kind<00:03:01.960> of<00:03:02.020> like<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.170> Halfmoon

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
right there so kind of like a Halfmoon

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.839 
right there so kind of like a Halfmoon
so

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.509 

I'll<00:03:07.420> get<00:03:07.629> that<00:03:07.780> all<00:03:07.959> welded<00:03:08.349> up<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:09.189> I'll<00:03:09.310> put

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
I'll get that all welded up and I'll put

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.990 
I'll get that all welded up and I'll put
the<00:03:09.640> plate<00:03:09.879> on<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.720> plate<00:03:11.790> goes<00:03:12.790> right

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
the plate on it the plate goes right

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.470 
the plate on it the plate goes right
over<00:03:13.030> its<00:03:13.480> already<00:03:13.750> molded<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.920> fit<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:16.450> that

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
over its already molded to fit so that

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.479 
over its already molded to fit so that
