planted<00:00:08.280> tank<00:00:09.950> there's<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.250> many<00:00:11.370> different

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
planted tank there's so many different

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.660 
planted tank there's so many different
ways<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:12.030> doing<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.769> and<00:00:13.769> there's<00:00:14.549> no

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
just going to share a few tips that I

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.260 
just going to share a few tips that I
found<00:00:18.720> useful<00:00:19.400> okay<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:20.460> before<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:21.000> begin

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
found useful okay so before we begin

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.689 
found useful okay so before we begin
let's<00:00:21.960> think<00:00:22.199> about<00:00:22.289> first<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.250> plants<00:00:23.609> that

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
let's think about first the plants that

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.420 
let's think about first the plants that
we're<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> use<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.449> tank<00:00:25.430> think

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
we're going to use in the tank think

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.560 
we're going to use in the tank think
about<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> sort<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.970> conditions<00:00:27.420> that

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
about the sort of conditions that

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.269 
about the sort of conditions that
they're<00:00:27.689> going<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.930> need<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.769> all<00:00:29.070> different

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
they're going to need and all different

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.560 
they're going to need and all different
different<00:00:29.760> plants<00:00:30.119> have<00:00:30.269> different

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
different plants have different

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.290 
different plants have different
requirements<00:00:31.160> so<00:00:32.160> some<00:00:32.369> like<00:00:32.550> highlights<00:00:33.059> I

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
requirements so some like highlights I

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.110 
requirements so some like highlights I
like<00:00:33.480> low<00:00:33.660> light<00:00:33.870> some<00:00:34.350> need<00:00:34.559> co2<00:00:34.969> others<00:00:35.969> are

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
like low light some need co2 others are

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.430 
like low light some need co2 others are
quite<00:00:36.300> Hardy<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.809> they're<00:00:37.020> get<00:00:37.170> by<00:00:37.320> without

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
quite Hardy and they're get by without

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.860 
quite Hardy and they're get by without
it<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.579> think<00:00:39.090> about<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.480> plants<00:00:39.750> you're

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
it so think about the plants you're

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.360 
it so think about the plants you're
going<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.050> keep<00:00:40.200> first<00:00:40.590> because<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.160> would

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
going to keep first because that would

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.950 
going to keep first because that would
be<00:00:41.460> useful<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.930> go<00:00:43.079> along<00:00:44.570> okay<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.660> now<00:00:45.899> we

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
be useful as you go along okay so now we

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.920 
be useful as you go along okay so now we
need<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.200> plan<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.950> tank<00:00:47.270> and<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.390> find<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.809> is

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
need to plan the tank and I find this is

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.189 
need to plan the tank and I find this is
a<00:00:48.989> really<00:00:49.440> important<00:00:49.890> stage<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:51.110> planning<00:00:52.110> is

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
a really important stage and planning is

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.410 
a really important stage and planning is
so<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.829> useful<00:00:53.309> when<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.610> design<00:00:53.910> air<00:00:54.090> tank

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
so so useful when your design air tank

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.270 
so so useful when your design air tank
it<00:00:54.960> gives<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.260> really<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.620> chance<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.100> think

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
it gives you really a chance to think

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.580 
it gives you really a chance to think
about<00:00:56.430> how<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:56.969> want<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.420> look<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.930> how<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
about how you want it to look and how to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.549 
about how you want it to look and how to
achieve<00:00:59.010> your<00:00:59.250> goals<00:00:59.719> and<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.899> what<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.379> to

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
achieve your goals and so what I like to

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.619 
achieve your goals and so what I like to
do<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:02.100> maybe<00:01:02.160> draw<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> little<00:01:02.969> picture<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.510> it

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
do is maybe draw a little picture of it

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.539 
do is maybe draw a little picture of it
at<00:01:03.719> first<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.409> then<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.070> gives<00:01:05.220> me<00:01:05.369> something

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
at first and then it gives me something

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.730 
at first and then it gives me something
to<00:01:05.729> work<00:01:05.939> with<00:01:06.000> if<00:01:06.840> you're<00:01:07.080> not<00:01:07.170> creative<00:01:07.590> in

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
to work with if you're not creative in

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.429 
to work with if you're not creative in
don't<00:01:07.950> worry<00:01:08.150> what<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.840> do<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
don't worry what you can do is do a

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.219 
don't worry what you can do is do a
google<00:01:10.920> image<00:01:11.100> search<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.000> then<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.049> see

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
google image search and then you can see

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.050 
google image search and then you can see
how<00:01:13.350> other<00:01:13.470> people<00:01:13.860> plant<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.430> their<00:01:14.640> tanks

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
how other people plant it up their tanks

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.730 
how other people plant it up their tanks
and<00:01:15.210> then<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:15.840> print<00:01:16.049> off<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.200> ideas<00:01:16.710> that

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and then just print off the ideas that

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.929 
and then just print off the ideas that
you<00:01:16.950> find<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:19.009> okay<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.070> when

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
you find that you like okay so when

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.249 
you find that you like okay so when
you're<00:01:21.090> often<00:01:21.299> when<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.479> comes<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.869> putting

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
you're often when it comes to putting

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.710 
you're often when it comes to putting
the<00:01:22.409> tent<00:01:22.560> together<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:23.420> try<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.509> put<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the tent together then try and put the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.749 
the tent together then try and put the
hardscape<00:01:25.140> ian<00:01:25.380> first<00:01:25.710> you'll<00:01:26.400> find<00:01:26.580> that

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
hardscape ian first you'll find that

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.070 
hardscape ian first you'll find that
useful<00:01:26.970> because<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.540> means<00:01:27.780> you're<00:01:27.990> not

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
useful because it means you're not

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.460 
useful because it means you're not
moving<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> plants<00:01:29.070> about<00:01:29.310> as<00:01:29.549> much<00:01:30.470> which

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
moving to the plants about as much which

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.499 
moving to the plants about as much which
could<00:01:31.680> potentially<00:01:31.770> damage<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> roots<00:01:32.790> so

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
could potentially damage the roots so

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.969 
could potentially damage the roots so
put<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:33.810> hearts<00:01:34.020> coping<00:01:34.350> first<00:01:34.619> all<00:01:34.829> your

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
put your hearts coping first all your

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.990 
put your hearts coping first all your
Rock's<00:01:35.189> new<00:01:35.430> bhagwat<00:01:35.850> etc<00:01:37.579> okay<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.640> now<00:01:38.850> we're

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
Rock's new bhagwat etc okay so now we're

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.230 
Rock's new bhagwat etc okay so now we're
moving<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.420> planting<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.140> tank<00:01:40.380> then<00:01:41.240> try

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
moving on to planting the tank then try

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.300 
moving on to planting the tank then try
and<00:01:42.270> group<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.229> same<00:01:43.470> parts<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> same

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
and group the same parts of the same

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.460 
and group the same parts of the same
species<00:01:44.610> together<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.320> do<00:01:46.439> is

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
species together what I like to do is

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.260 
species together what I like to do is
normally<00:01:46.890> by<00:01:47.100> sort<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.759> maybe<00:01:47.880> two<00:01:48.119> or<00:01:48.149> three

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
normally by sort of maybe two or three

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.200 
normally by sort of maybe two or three
parts<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.259> same<00:01:49.409> species<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.310> then<00:01:51.000> just

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
parts of the same species and then just

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.139 
parts of the same species and then just
let<00:01:51.450> say<00:01:51.689> plant<00:01:51.990> them<00:01:52.170> take<00:01:52.380> together<00:01:53.030> in<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
let say plant them take together in the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.090 
let say plant them take together in the
wild<00:01:54.450> you'll<00:01:54.600> never<00:01:54.840> ever<00:01:55.020> see<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.890> one

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
wild you'll never ever see just one

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.920 
wild you'll never ever see just one
single<00:01:56.369> plant<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:56.969> its<00:01:57.000> own<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:57.689> doesn't

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
single plant on its own it just doesn't

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.050 
single plant on its own it just doesn't
look<00:01:58.020> right<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.619> try<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.310> group<00:01:59.490> plants<00:01:59.909> and

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
look right to try and group plants and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.480 
look right to try and group plants and
the<00:02:00.119> same<00:02:00.299> species<00:02:00.600> together<00:02:01.219> that<00:02:02.219> being

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the same species together that being

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.510 
the same species together that being
said<00:02:02.670> though<00:02:03.920> sometimes<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.219> be<00:02:05.250> quite

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
said though sometimes it can be quite

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.370 
said though sometimes it can be quite
nice<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.939> create<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.270> focal<00:02:06.509> point<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:07.170> maybe

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
nice to create a focal point if maybe

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.199 
nice to create a focal point if maybe
you've<00:02:07.590> got<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.770> big<00:02:07.979> one<00:02:08.429> big<00:02:08.640> plant<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
you've got a big one big plant that you

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.410 
you've got a big one big plant that you
want<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.450> use<00:02:09.720> as<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.770> focal<00:02:11.039> point<00:02:11.220> then<00:02:11.580> that's

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
want to use as a focal point then that's

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.640 
want to use as a focal point then that's
the<00:02:12.599> exception<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.260> rule

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the exception to the rule

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.449 
the exception to the rule
can<00:02:14.040> look<00:02:14.159> quite<00:02:14.310> nice<00:02:14.549> and<00:02:14.819> times<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:16.590> try

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
can look quite nice and times and try

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.259 
can look quite nice and times and try
and<00:02:17.519> avoid<00:02:17.730> symmetry<00:02:18.390> in<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.750> tank

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
and avoid symmetry in the tank

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.910 
and avoid symmetry in the tank
personally<00:02:21.269> I<00:02:21.299> don't<00:02:21.450> like<00:02:21.629> symmetry<00:02:22.140> it

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
personally I don't like symmetry it

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.399 
personally I don't like symmetry it
looks<00:02:23.129> too<00:02:23.400> kind<00:02:23.909> of<00:02:24.000> formal<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.720> kind<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.200> fake

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
looks too kind of formal to kind of fake

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.850 
looks too kind of formal to kind of fake
if<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:25.829> like<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.870> like<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.260> natural<00:02:28.409> look<00:02:28.709> in

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
if you like I like the natural look in

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.559 
if you like I like the natural look in
my<00:02:29.010> tank<00:02:30.500> but<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:32.129> don't<00:02:33.090> particularly

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
my tank but I don't particularly

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.690 
my tank but I don't particularly
symmetry<00:02:34.260> but<00:02:34.409> that's<00:02:34.620> entirely<00:02:35.099> up<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.549> you

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
symmetry but that's entirely up to you

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.869 
symmetry but that's entirely up to you
and<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:37.019> final<00:02:37.409> point<00:02:37.439> is<00:02:37.859> try<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.579> get<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> bit

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
and the final point is try and get a bit

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.819 
and the final point is try and get a bit
of<00:02:38.909> contrast<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.689> there<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.470> if<00:02:40.530> you've<00:02:40.680> got<00:02:40.799> a

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
of contrast in there so if you've got a

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.259 
of contrast in there so if you've got a
lot<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:41.040> plants<00:02:41.340> all<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.359> same<00:02:42.540> color<00:02:42.890> light

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
lot of plants all the same color light

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.449 
lot of plants all the same color light
try<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.359> go<00:02:45.480> for<00:02:45.510> official<00:02:46.500> compliments<00:02:47.400> that

try and go for official compliments that

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.490 
try and go for official compliments that
like<00:02:47.819> if<00:02:48.090> you've<00:02:48.269> got<00:02:48.450> loads<00:02:48.720> of<00:02:48.870> green<00:02:49.079> plants

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
like if you've got loads of green plants

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.020 
like if you've got loads of green plants
go<00:02:49.709> for<00:02:49.889> some<00:02:50.040> bright<00:02:50.280> red<00:02:50.489> fish<00:02:50.730> or<00:02:50.909> something

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
go for fish that are you going to stand

out and make a good impact on the viewer

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.710 
out and make a good impact on the viewer
as<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.519> said<00:02:59.700> there's<00:02:59.879> no<00:03:00.030> right<00:03:00.299> or<00:03:00.329> wrong<00:03:00.540> way

as I said there's no right or wrong way

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.360 
as I said there's no right or wrong way
to<00:03:00.750> do<00:03:01.049> this<00:03:01.230> it's<00:03:01.530> all<00:03:01.650> about<00:03:01.859> a<00:03:01.920> learning

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
to do this it's all about a learning

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.849 
to do this it's all about a learning
curve<00:03:02.609> it's<00:03:03.329> about<00:03:03.480> experimenting<00:03:04.109> these

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
curve it's about experimenting these

curve it's about experimenting these
