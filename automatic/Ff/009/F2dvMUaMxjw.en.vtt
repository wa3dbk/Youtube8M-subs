00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello to what mysteries like mister of the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.620
 65 is not like that 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.780
 and maybe good before this I think 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:15.019
 that I'm going to upload a small video 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.200
 in which I introduce a short short of 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.410
 how are we going to record minecraft by 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.410
 there 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.470
 not the pvp asshole 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.420
 and everything was a failure so it's 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.129
 well in addition to that I directly 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.470
 I had to change as well as 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.170
 account then I lost things and I put myself 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.559
 some of the creative and me when I left 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:48.339
 got a few others although that was a 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:52.360
 shit but well then when we left 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:54.400
 we fail and everything and all that but we have 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.110
 some little things more than we had 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.120
 the last time we recorded or so 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.949
 least see everything so the inventories are 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.229
 somewhat different but I think we have 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.480
 tried that it is not that there is not much 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:08.170
 variability and that's it 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.170
 all right 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.100
 we have changed from where the house is 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:15.090
 more here 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.950
 we are singing here 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.490
 there is not a mine that I gave this 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.490
 Alex is 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.880
 because it does not illuminate 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.650
 it is called I am all 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.270
 press the corner and torches 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.270
 because in the end all good too 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.610
 I'm lost to Ã¡lex or no no I have not 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.659
 paid attention in class of how it is 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.130
 this cave 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.130
 it's a little bit caught a lot here 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.200
 take and I take 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.200
 take it 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.690
 already let me think it's not that abel what 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.950
 he's pretty sure the balls 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.950
 they gave us a 1.516 version 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.350
 all right 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.060
 It's good, well, it's been here 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.660

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.000

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.950
