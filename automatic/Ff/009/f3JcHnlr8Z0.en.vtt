you it's surprising of how r this a
little<00:04:49.940> quote<00:04:50.300> here<00:04:50.540> that<00:04:50.660> I<00:04:50.750> put<00:04:51.020> down<00:04:51.050> it's

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
surprising how much memory is built

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.700 
surprising how much memory is built
around<00:04:54.440> things<00:04:55.390> unnoticed<00:04:56.390> at<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:57.020> time<00:04:57.290> and

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
around things unnoticed at the time and

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.370 
around things unnoticed at the time and
that's<00:04:58.640> so<00:04:58.970> true<00:04:59.330> things<00:04:59.840> that<00:05:00.110> we<00:05:00.200> don't

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
that's so true things that we don't

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.520 
that's so true things that we don't
notice<00:05:01.040> a<00:05:01.400> memory<00:05:01.760> is<00:05:01.820> built<00:05:02.180> around<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:02.900> you

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
notice a memory is built around and you

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.900 
notice a memory is built around and you
know<00:05:03.650> sometimes<00:05:04.160> we'll<00:05:04.310> get<00:05:04.430> that<00:05:04.550> aha<00:05:04.700> moment

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
know sometimes we'll get that aha moment

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.590 
know sometimes we'll get that aha moment
and<00:05:05.600> realize<00:05:05.930> that<00:05:05.960> but<00:05:06.830> these<00:05:07.070> are<00:05:07.250> just

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600
