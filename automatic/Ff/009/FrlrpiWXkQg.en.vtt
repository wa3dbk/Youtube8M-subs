00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.670
 Konovalov firm is in 120 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.799
 kilometers from Moscow in a small celeste 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.429
 panko however is known far beyond his 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.500
 beyond 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.779
 because it is here that produce milk to 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.270
 the table of many famous Russian person 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.939
 businessmen and politicians clean air 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.949
 clear water wide open spaces in 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.930
 Russian outback for a farm with 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.779
 prefix eco very suitable place 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.270
 but today is a special day firm 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.440
 for the first time will be a platform for scientific 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.440
 technical tests 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.219
 first test long-awaited approbation 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.410
 apparatus which promises at the root 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.770
 change the technology of obtaining commodity 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.379
 milk all over the world from a cow immediately to 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.079
 the table bypassing the long way of plants and 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.379
 concerns while dairy wali 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:09.170
 there is only an official name and one dna 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.170
 integral milking dairy complex 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.659
 This is the commercial product of which 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.560
 such 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.560
 means 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.870
 this package is cooled and maybe 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:30.140
 immediately 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:32.540
 on the shop counter we have on and to the farm 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.220
 for today fifteen cows they all give 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.380
 wonderful milk-sounding quality 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.670
 environmentally friendly which is not 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.260
 contains no growth hormones are not 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.120
 antibiotics and preservatives are not 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.350
 thickening emulsifiers i.e. 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.900
 product naturally shelf life 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.810
 which is valid for 72 hours 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.730
 for me it is very important that the product from 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.740
 the cows reached as quickly as possible 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.150
 so buy when I found out that you can 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.640
 make a special machine which 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.920
 will allow this product to get very 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.780
 quickly already ready packaging and 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.970
 instantly we can take it to people 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.540
 kids kindergartens and schools, I began to 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.540
 two hands 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.319
 essentially it is a union 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.530
 standard any standard 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.380
 milking machine with our unit 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:25.069
 processing this milk and here it is all together 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:27.500
 we called this integral that's it you 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.800
 see the teat cups which 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.350
 connects to the role of the udder of the cow 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.230
 vivo 4 down the milk hose 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.880
 our top unit hits this top 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.340
 block is just a block of milk intake 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.670
 which is certain 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.830
 storage of incoming milk further 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.110
 under this block is the second block 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.810
 which carries out heating 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.980
 milk preheating to 45 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.110
 degrees that is compared to the mouse 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.690
 the temperature of the cow rises by 10 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.200
 degrees still temperature and further behind him 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.300
 it should be a pasteurizer 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.730
 us built on the principle 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.280
 application of heat treatment from which 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.120
 pre-held and microwave 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.239
 processing results 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.910
 pasteurization 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.060
 which does not require heating the milk above 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.519
 50 degrees which naturally boosts 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.090
 milk quality after this milk 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:29.180
 gets metered dispenser dispenser 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.310
 exactly liter and then this milk passes 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.760
 through the cooling system 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.549
 cools to about 10 degrees or 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.730
 after that goes to the bottom block 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:44.350
 where does it pack in 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.350
 standard packages end 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.580
 idea of ​​professor alexander belonosov 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.530
 and his dairy wonder device and even before 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.840
 first test received a lot 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.880
 reviews and praise in the agrarian world 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.080
 from official papers two patents 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.360
 Russian Federation 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.660
 plus submitted patent application 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.190
 service and the European Union 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.960
 but I can recommend it to my 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.670
 partners within the cluster cluster 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.560
 because nowadays don't sing 95 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.690
 partners of the most different countries 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.940
 different regions of Russia and someone there 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.420
 seven cows at someone 5 this is just this 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.640
 setting 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.980
 It is optimal for small 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.180
 little farmers why create 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.200
 some kind of industrial processing workshop 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.660
 all his milk is two in one person and 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.690
 installation and everything is very simple in 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.690
 using 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:47.070
 this is an absolutely sealed instrument 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.780
 so milk is nowhere in contact with 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.750
 ambient atmosphere in progress 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.550
 processing we there include bactericidal 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.130
 lamps that work all the time and and 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.930
 disinfects therefore exceptions 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.240
 hitting god series here is a problem 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.740
 solved completely 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.600
 now after successful tests 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.100
 developers have to prepare 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.470
 design documentation for 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.210
 mass production run 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.320
 conveyor founders plans through 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.230
 four to five months 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.660
 In addition, Professor Alexander Belonosov 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.120
 sure if you connect his machine 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.860
 By a mutual robot, the cow will be able to 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.700
 give milk completely without 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:27.560
 direct human involvement and this 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:30.440
 another scientific and technical breakthrough 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.760
 This is the main result of these tests. 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.230
 that we experimentally confirmed 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.669
 opportunity 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:43.389
 and the reality of such a complex in 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.389
 operation
