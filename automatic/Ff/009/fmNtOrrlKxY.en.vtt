00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.849
 so today we start with the forest park kuskovo 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.849

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.210
 walking in the park we can enjoy 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.730
 this fresh air this silence can 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.079
 really rest in socks 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.079
 pretty well built 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.689
 as we see here there are inscriptions 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.509
 navigational which indicates that 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.490
 there is a bike rental here that people 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.280
 who come to the park want this period 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.140

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.369
 the park area is actually impressive 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.539
 and walk if you want to get around 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.820
 all forest guys here's a little bit 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.340
 problematic now there is enough 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.720
 hill tyumen it did not stop us to 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.530
 stroll through this wonderful 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.759
 the park and we got to the sports field 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.979
 where we see all kinds of simulators 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:42.030
 completely different absolutely whole normal 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.819
 . operating here we see a sign with 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.280
 operating rules where detailed 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.509
 described as here as well 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.209
 the plate just walking the dogs is prohibited 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.640
 and I am more than sure what is relevant 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.440
 time is strictly monitored 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.360
 there are masons here too where people can 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.220
 to rest began to the chest engaged and 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.439
 trash can means people donâ€™t litter on 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.509
 in fact it is very good and I personally 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.810
 made sure that the playground is completely 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.869
 serviceable and ready to go we got to 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.690
 glade of brides here we see a tree where 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.760
 loving hearts binds you to the day 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.590
 marriage here we can see 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.150
 the utmost importance to children where they 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.879
 can rest here there are houses for 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:26.280
 picnic or also i think in warm time 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:29.730
 Either 7 years, I think you can relax 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.849
 conflagration things and spend time so 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:37.170
 say benefit for yourself from the first look 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:39.690
 more or less nice well seems 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.959
 vodka fine neat on the very 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.569
 inside we see a small mountain 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.290
 garbage and it's actually us a little bit 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.390
 upset but we sincerely believe that 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.700
 park workers will remove this garbage and 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.790
 It is worth a little bit away from the given course 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.870
 and get out of the main road as we get 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:04.709
 in a magical zone park where trees are leaves 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.829
 grass where modest deed trodden 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.549
 road tracks and really should 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:14.400
 confess what is good here and how and 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.769
 you and we were able to notice that not even on 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.889
 The main tracks here are clean and no 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:23.370
 no rubbish and so we finished our 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:26.269
 forest park review kuskovo and we set 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.819
