00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.370
 channel 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.110
 master videos for my name 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.329
 Dmitry I am the site administrator 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.919
 master video and today we continue 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:21.230
 sony vegas lessons 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.279
 today we will make such a mood 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.619
 eyes 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.060
 mastering there I don't know there is a concussion like 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.069
 maybe whatever you want you can call 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.229
 pretty interesting effects which 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:33.380
 can apply different situations 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:35.360
 for example, when a person is a little drunk 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.030
 you can only make a camera size 3 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.160
 hours and so on your fantasy you not 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.390
 let you down so we do open 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.720
 running sony vegas 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.670
 I've already launched here 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.410
 just an ordinary picture I could 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.970
 the videos will become irrelevant just by 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.170
 somehow will be oriented precisely 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:57.470
 further we create 2 more video tracks on 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:03.170
 bottom goes to the rose we open 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:06.740
 fanta drank and slightly increase it for 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.829
 What we increase in order to case 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.180
 when we have a camera going to shake 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:13.910
 just don't go out 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.410
 I had some cut there black lines 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.450
 and other things did not come out as a frame from 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.550
 lens 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.340
 further we copy this track we insert 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.470
 all all three of these two tracks that we 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.010
 created here from Kiev to exactly 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.290
 happened it means transparency is decreasing 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.660
 the very top of the track when the pen 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.380
 appears we drop yes somewhere percent 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.670
 41 there 40 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.100
 this up to 60 ghettos and this is what we leave 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:49.509
 one hundred percent further that we will 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:54.229
 do so overlap control again and 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:56.219
 will animate a little on hearing we found 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.630
 so to speak 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.969
 starting to make contusions means lower 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.920
 buddy we leave alone take 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:09.429
 mediocre cane open and 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.810
 roll somewhere in the second right 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.730
 this is something forcibly short video 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.730
 it will turn out to give names that we look 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.150
 and here so all about a second 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.780
 Here we open the printer 2 tracks and what 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.430
 we do for about 2 seconds we 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.370
 do a little bit of a waste over here like this 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:35.320
 see here already gone blur 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.450
 further on the signs then there are half let's 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.150
 for 4 seconds 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.150
 well then the other side 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.960
 meet this chance seconds 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.390
 Max affairs you so answer and here 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.660
 somewhere 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.680
 approach to so here we close on 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.390
 top to rose 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.580
 also crying and rock do everything 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.430
 quite the opposite that is for 2 seconds 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.160
 Th go right to the 4 seconds that would get 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.709
 lego for 6 seconds like a god rise like this 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.250
 here miss well here here it is so the answer 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.660
 now we lose what we did 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.040
 Here is the person starts 1 structure 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.570
 bifurcation enthusiasts create from everyone 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.300
 places we need to speed up something easier for me 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.780
 do now we still have something missing 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.060
 this video we in this video is not enough 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.470
 elemental blur as possible 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.540
 you can do this just save these 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.790
 all the crumbs and then open and how would 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.000
 video blur effect 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.250
 according to Gauss, then we just keep it 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.870
 video how to save perform from the past 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.010
 lessons 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.130
 Paul translated in and here for example I will not 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.130
 deepen 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.260
 a hundred where 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.769
 save save 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.769
 yes there and 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.300
 windows media video for youtube 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.300
 for example and the market 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.880
 everything she trained we clean the project 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.680
 with and open already this here 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.000
 video that we got from us 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.000
 this is a video 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.650
 need on this video add to and drown 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.650
 mark up for example 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.660
 bad at it so we will do 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:47.550
 come again on the trick we have our video 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.470
 let's cut a little here starting with three 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:54.370
 seconds 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:58.660
 rezom it to 4 seconds further here and so 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:01.510
 and so naturally every piece of us 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.770
 there will be an audio track we take only as 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.030
 here the audio method will create several 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.900
 video tracks 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.750
 and so here we are transferring so would protein 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.180
 I would put on each piece 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.100
 its some kind of effects 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.479
 warm up for example the first piece we don't 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.280
 will touch on the second piece we 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.280
 click soften 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.900
 on this piece we easy warm up 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.449
 without for example we donâ€™t touch anything 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:38.080
 this and then 5 strongly markup loved as 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.530
 the city's us strong tatami 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.530
 well what's his 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:48.990
 that 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.990
 in the end what we got 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.330
 same as you can see not much on smoothly 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:01.880
 It turned out so you even have your video 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.920
 can stretch on like this 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.550
 she kind of went on like that 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.550
 like that plan 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.490
 Well, something like that for today you can 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.470
 play to make better naturally 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.790
 it will understand everything therefore for today everything 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.790
 Thank you for your attention goodbye
