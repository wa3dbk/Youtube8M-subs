 the last two openings I did open 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.550
 a hovering box as connection and a 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.310
 of freedom of the collection but without a doubt 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.120

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.339
 before telling you to develop that mark

 opening of these four envelopes 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.010
 let's start with the oldest ones in 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.650
 this case the plasma storm hell 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.640
 I will not leave this here also for 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.640

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.850
 what 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:35.660
 what do these suns give us? 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:37.860
 we open with code outside about 3 1 2 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.410
 and we start 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.520
 10 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.210

 an energy plasma as a first 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:58.370
 infrequent a local and a gym friend 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.430

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.760
 detail poisoned pokemon great 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.180

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.180
 place me 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.659
 which by the way does not sound so much like 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:17.599
 that does not sing about this collection and how 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.599
 we have investigate is not wrong 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.400

 they are established 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:38.040
 the code was the stage 12 world in this 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.710
 site 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:46.160
 jackie the strip is ladybug 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:52.720
 incae the hiccup 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:54.520
 so much of the catÃ­ a red or cat card 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.460
 let's say that the bank of a tape 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:02.770
 strong very well as the levels we have 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:05.500
 above the icomos lara to be my 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.320
 good to see if at least we have 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.420
 luck and we touch some holographic or 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.860
 something like that although the truth is 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:18.109
 that the tickets are going very well 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.109
 let's that according to the psm 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:28.810

 with the myth 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:46.230
 fracking with the sluc man 2 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.230

 I'm going to get to you and you 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.540
 frequent is worth what more confused 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:00.660
 as the level sum charges side and as is 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:05.280
 lara then an emol guide to last 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.449
 what good is not so bad 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.840
 thing 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:11.039
 I only asked for one game but well, either 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.200
 I wanted to complain because I got a love 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.720
 guys the birds 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.180
 things as they are if you want to leave me 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:24.350
 well, welcome 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.350
 and we're going to open the last one on 13 12 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.280
 and we continue so 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.150
 it's wikileaks 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:38.740
 an energy fight spin 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:42.880
 sink a resistant crutch like 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:46.870
 first frequent electro other case as 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:49.530
 rivers we have the empire and how lara a 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.530
 great peak 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.760
 so let's do the little one that counts 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:58.979
 here diverses has been superior to charge 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.790
 alive link and place and that by the way 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.790
 four are flat 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.580
 not bad 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:12.920
 and as such as they have been the 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:17.300
 speaker group ihg of molecules 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:20.960
 and be me and of course here we have 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.889
 the two stars of this box spending 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.930
 extra 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:30.479
 and make your former jumbo format 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.960
 because none of this has been all for this 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:37.259
 video I hope you liked it and if it is
