on<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.650> theory<00:00:13.889> today<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:15.350> hopefully<00:00:16.350> ticking

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
on the theory today so hopefully ticking

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
basically is it's really a very much a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:25.389 
basically is it's really a very much a
mind<00:01:22.810> day<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.110> then<00:01:25.009> we're<00:01:25.100> gonna<00:01:25.220> work

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
mind day and then we're gonna work

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.310 
mind day and then we're gonna work
together<00:01:25.580> this<00:01:25.850> afternoon<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.780> try<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.140> work

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
together this afternoon to try and work

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.450 
together this afternoon to try and work
out<00:01:27.470> which<00:01:27.619> ones<00:01:27.830> are<00:01:27.979> going<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:28.159> be<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.310> most

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
out which ones are going to be the most

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.460 
out which ones are going to be the most
difficult<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:29.030> defend<00:01:29.270> against<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:29.869> we<00:01:30.289> can

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
difficult to defend against so we can

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.680 
difficult to defend against so we can
use<00:01:30.649> those<00:01:30.830> as<00:01:31.039> great<00:01:31.580> a<00:01:31.610> tracking<00:01:32.000> strike

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
use those as great a tracking strike

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.200 
use those as great a tracking strike
moves<00:01:32.960> this<00:01:33.110> year<00:01:33.319> yes<00:01:34.069> so<00:01:34.250> far<00:01:34.460> we've<00:01:34.610> had<00:01:34.759> the

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
much about getting some clarity around

that we've genuinely got three options
available<00:02:25.250> all<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.120> time<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.920> then

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
available all the time and then

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.940 
available all the time and then
consistently<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.720> know<00:02:29.810> our<00:02:30.260> individual

skill<00:02:31.250> set<00:02:31.519> within<00:02:32.030> those<00:02:32.420> plays<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:33.200> always

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
skill set within those plays is always

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.619 
skill set within those plays is always
critical<00:02:34.099> I<00:02:34.550> think<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.300> level<00:02:35.480> of

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
critical I think the level of

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.479 
critical I think the level of
contribution<00:02:36.319> you<00:02:36.440> notice<00:02:36.739> at<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:36.920> low<00:02:37.069> second

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
contribution you notice at a low second

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.430 
contribution you notice at a low second
year<00:02:37.849> athletes<00:02:38.209> is<00:02:38.360> much<00:02:38.540> better<00:02:38.750> they're<00:02:39.410> a

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440
