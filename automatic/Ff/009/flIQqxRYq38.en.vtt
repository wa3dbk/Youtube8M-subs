more later on into the Easter Egg
actually<00:00:28.750> have<00:00:28.840> to<00:00:28.960> generate<00:00:29.349> this<00:00:29.529> whole

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
actually have to generate this whole

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.310 
actually have to generate this whole
area<00:00:30.130> so<00:00:30.189> you<00:00:30.430> can<00:00:30.579> you<00:00:31.390> know<00:00:31.419> be<00:00:31.630> able<00:00:31.719> to<00:00:31.869> talk

you<00:01:03.309> know<00:01:03.370> just<00:01:03.670> above<00:01:03.879> that<00:01:04.030> little<00:01:04.269> platform

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
you know just above that little platform

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.090 
you know just above that little platform
once<00:01:04.900> you<00:01:05.050> jump<00:01:05.379> there<00:01:05.530> that<00:01:05.710> platform

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
once you jump there that platform

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.800 
once you jump there that platform
actually<00:01:06.190> falls<00:01:06.700> down<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.210> you<00:01:07.300> go<00:01:07.390> down<00:01:07.630> into

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
actually falls down and you go down into

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.719 
actually falls down and you go down into
the<00:01:08.020> hole<00:01:08.170> so<00:01:08.680> when<00:01:09.040> you<00:01:09.130> decide<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:09.550> want<00:01:09.700> to

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
the hole so when you decide you want to

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:10.950 
the hole so when you decide you want to
get<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:09.940> LSAT<00:01:10.360> you<00:01:10.450> want<00:01:10.570> to<00:01:10.630> make<00:01:10.720> sure<00:01:10.840> you

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
get the LSAT you want to make sure you

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.570 
get the LSAT you want to make sure you
have<00:01:11.080> enough<00:01:11.320> money<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:11.860> you<00:01:11.890> want<00:01:12.250> to<00:01:12.340> rush

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
have enough money and you want to rush

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.460 
have enough money and you want to rush
as<00:01:12.790> fast<00:01:13.030> as<00:01:13.210> you<00:01:13.330> can<00:01:13.540> into<00:01:13.780> it<00:01:14.049> and<00:01:14.229> grab<00:01:14.440> it

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
as fast as you can into it and grab it

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.960 
as fast as you can into it and grab it
as<00:01:14.650> fast<00:01:14.830> as<00:01:14.950> you<00:01:15.010> can<00:01:15.159> because<00:01:15.310> it<00:01:15.549> does<00:01:15.729> fall

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
as fast as you can because it does fall

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.000 
as fast as you can because it does fall
down<00:01:16.150> rather<00:01:16.330> quickly<00:01:16.450> so<00:01:17.410> you<00:01:17.500> can't<00:01:17.860> have

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
down rather quickly so you can't have

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.410 
down rather quickly so you can't have
everyone<00:01:18.460> trying<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.790> jump<00:01:19.030> up<00:01:19.150> there<00:01:19.180> at<00:01:19.390> the

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
everyone trying to jump up there at the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.150 
everyone trying to jump up there at the
same<00:01:19.630> time<00:01:19.870> it's<00:01:20.050> not<00:01:20.230> gonna<00:01:20.410> happen<00:01:20.650> only<00:01:20.890> one

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
same time it's not gonna happen only one

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.510 
same time it's not gonna happen only one
person<00:01:21.520> can<00:01:21.640> do<00:01:21.820> it<00:01:21.970> in<00:01:22.630> this<00:01:22.810> case<00:01:23.140> I<00:01:23.440> was<00:01:23.890> it

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
person can do it in this case I was it

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.010 
person can do it in this case I was it
was<00:01:24.640> not<00:01:24.730> the<00:01:24.850> first<00:01:25.030> person<00:01:25.180> to<00:01:25.330> get<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.540> 2000

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
was not the first person to get the 2000

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.510 
was not the first person to get the 2000
when<00:01:26.110> I<00:01:26.170> was<00:01:26.260> the<00:01:26.350> closest<00:01:26.740> one<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.010> as<00:01:27.400> soon

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
when I was the closest one and as soon

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.730 
when I was the closest one and as soon
as<00:01:27.670> I<00:01:27.790> soon<00:01:28.510> as<00:01:28.600> I<00:01:28.690> got<00:01:28.870> it<00:01:28.990> I<00:01:29.080> ran<00:01:29.260> over<00:01:29.290> there

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
as I soon as I got it I ran over there

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.590 
as I soon as I got it I ran over there
and<00:01:29.980> got<00:01:30.400> myself<00:01:30.640> some<00:01:31.000> points<00:01:31.360> so<00:01:31.420> that<00:01:31.570> I

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
and got myself some points so that I

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.510 
and got myself some points so that I
could<00:01:31.870> get<00:01:32.380> up<00:01:32.440> there<00:01:32.620> and<00:01:32.740> pick<00:01:32.860> up<00:01:33.010> the<00:01:33.100> LSAT

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
could get up there and pick up the LSAT

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.250 
could get up there and pick up the LSAT
and<00:01:33.730> the<00:01:34.180> else<00:01:34.360> side<00:01:34.540> in<00:01:34.630> this<00:01:34.690> game<00:01:34.900> is<00:01:35.020> really
