00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.550
 uaga nor televisions that such good not 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:09.760
 I'm excited lost because here is 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.760
 he saw her 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:34.329
 let's see what it takes x 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.329
 that carries the box is one more 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:45.839
 with your permission with extra videos I suppose 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:50.170
 me in the game and seven days of karaoke 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:52.539
 let's see these ahead now of 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:57.629
 side and the pretty ones from behind that the 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.629
 Chat sample with good 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.110
 the game scenarios so let's go 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.910
 ability 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:13.540
 it's supposed to be like that 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:16.110
 here we raised the tab we saw 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.110
 i 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.689
 he lives the apartment 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.390
 I think then I said it would be a bit 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:30.280
 special I had thought to do a boxing 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.200
 which is the same but put it on camera 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.150
 reverted you know what I write 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.460
 rewind what but first we 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.900
 we should look at it and second that I thought 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.440
 a gigantic stupidity 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.460
 so I'm going to do the boxes of this already 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:51.680
 I have basically on the ground it's worth 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.720
 this is the pipe charger the source of 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.390
 feeding 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.430
 here is normal with the code of 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:05.590
 karaoke me and the super new super mario 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.580
 bros you we're going to see no I'm not going to 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.580
 lower the factors 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.200
 normal people use 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.540
 all right 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.140
 now 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.930
 come super mario 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.930
 two or two tickets 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:46.569
 two types of fluid and well to these 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.569
 restrictions he 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.730
 the disc is different 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.069
 the disc is different from normal because 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:00.650
 here is the one that brings 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.650
 in a super luis and me so it's looking 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.730
 different I think I think let's put 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.730
 This here 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.569
 well below here we have good the 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.000
 accessories to rest the rest of the 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.970
 inv have rested whatever the 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.930
 console the charging base this is what 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.950
 the console the hdmi 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.950
 and the sensor bar that is there 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:41.120
 let's leave history and go with the 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.030
 part number 2 which is where the 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:48.700
 console 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:52.950
 it sent well first with the console 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.950
 Montorio's is already different 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.900
 oh my god if you want what 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:06.070
 we go in parts because this is orgasmic 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.070
 remove the plastic is organic 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.920
 I suppose I think I suppose that 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.150
 will remain the fingers more without happen more 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.750
 little problem but well I do not think it happens 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.060
 nothing here we leave it and now we go with 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.950
 the command and could do effect of 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.860
 comparison because clearly well I have 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.860
 the white knob and the black knob 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:43.400
 what a little more elegant elegant than 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:46.460
 the white in terms of a color and such 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.990
 for the other it is clearly equal and the 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:54.380
 buttons I liked to use this much 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.840
 this is going 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.830
 when carrying down 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:04.480
 we will leave here 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:08.890
 and we will do the one of supermario tri de 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:14.790
 word that good then in bed because 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.790
 I'm very good open with the pencil 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.129
 well here we have the back part 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.510
 from behind mario gato 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:42.289
 the pretty nice front part of it 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:47.060
 we open 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:54.680
 manual the cortito we have also 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:57.199
 lying and the cd the dvd or whatever 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.030
 very nice everything you already know that what 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:03.639
 I always think that what matters is 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:06.560
 the box is valid and I hope you liked it 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.539
 is a boxing me right now with yes 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.479
 I have exams but I sweat a little 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.479
 I'm going to play super mario sweet work 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.320
 and the super mario brothers 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.070
