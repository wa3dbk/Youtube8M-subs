00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello what internet and mobile networks 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.029
 this is droid er.ru happy new year friends with 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.700
 new happiness and we are on 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.830
 ces 2015 in las vegas and on 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.509
 presentations of asus in the summer 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.540
 another exhibition when not a hare computer 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.250
 asus introduced a new laptop or 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.660
 tablet super slim which are called 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.490
 transformer book chi 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.410
 like a tank sales did not arrive but 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.090
 now it turned out that this one product and 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.519
 decided to turn the whole line into three 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.990
 The device now has which belong 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.619
 transformer book chi brand 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.230
 and let's take a look at them and so there are 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.870
 three models for 12 half inches by 10 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.760
 inches and 9 inches respectively as 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.530
 name implies all dress up 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.930
 are separated and can turn from 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.450
 laptop tablet everything doesn't work on 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.399
 windows 8.1 then there will be progress until 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.800
 windows 10 in terms of characteristics all 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.690
 less like significant difference 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.210
 except the screens in resolution is 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.760
 processor suddenly the younger models who 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.329
 9 and 10 inch intel line processors 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.879
 atom z 37 75 older model us half 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.799
 and inches processor more powerful intel 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.020
 core m which is put full 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.700
 laptops and of course this is not oh series 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.799
 will not really mount video on it 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.470
 Convenient note view for office tasks 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.259
 This average model fits 10 and 1 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.270
 inches full hd 1 and 2 resolution 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.250
 gigabytes of internal memory of course 2 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.200
 camera from a constructive point of view me 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.210
 like that for the first time in the line 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.610
 transformer somewhere in order to separate 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.350
 the tablet part from the dock is not needed 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.090
 produce extra complicated 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.619
 actions just take and lift 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.360
 display is paid in general device 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.280
 compact enough and told me that 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.049
 he is super easy well here here together 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.759
 with a dock weighs a kilo 80 grams 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.350
 The camera looks very impressive at 5 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.759
 megapixels front on 2 here 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.799
 there is absolutely no standard 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.110
 sizes only micro beaten there is one 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.229
 micro visby 30 is a slot for micro sd 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.280
 cards and for hdmi cable general all 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.430
 micrometers 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.200
 by the way metal case me 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.180
 it seems like a very decent option for 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.009
 compact students will fit into any 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.540
 bag any backpack you can take 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.680
 get on couples clear gave 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.530
 you can take notes in something 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.610
 play on the touch screen if you 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.970
 will satisfy you 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.720
 in the windows store this is the top variations on 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.940
 12 inches called cheat t300 mechanism 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.010
 connecting is just as simple here 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.110
 of course, that have a full keyboard 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.020
 we are not here with ports here either 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.970
 big beating solid metro decided 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.760
 save on the square this he is good 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.830
 because the thickness of the device is only 7 and 6 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.950
 inch and if you take only the tablet together 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.990
 with docking station it turns out 16 and a half 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.030
 millimeters less than two centimeters to me 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.590
 It seems cool but you can not insert a flash drive 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.190
 You can not insert a mouse in general more 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.020
 suffering 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.430
 certain you are also doomed if not 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.050
 adapters by the way unlike ours 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.820
 there are no main camera models here only 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.010
 video chat camera 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.620
 Well, as I said inside the processor 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.440
 intel core m driving variations on 1 and 2 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.790
 gigahertz and 08 gigahertz and proper 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.200
 the lines that it specifically designed 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.209
 for portable laptops if boring 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.060
 walk with a simple metallic dark 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.100
 design there is a solution you can wear one 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.930
 from such covers four options of clothes 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.330
 gray here is such a cool carrot 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.880
 black and dark navy from 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.150
 such interesting clips for clamping 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.010
 headphones and then she's on a magnet 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.630
 is attached to the ethics of this cover i 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.340
 I think that there is even a chance that you have bags 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.980
 the whole thing is not lost but I would not 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.390
 was so sure about this shoes 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.810
 probably the most curious model from 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.930
 This line of 8-inch Brianna like 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.400
 590 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.940
 see how small compact 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.890
 just 750 grams together with the keyboard 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.530
 weighs me seems very cool story 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.540
 will even fit into some women's clutches 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.130
 the keyboard is it full-fledged on 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.780
 inconvenient to type no. By the way 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.070
 speaking in this model but he is not needed 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.080
 because the display is very 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.580
 close everything is easy and poke a finger 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.380
 in terms of characteristics, all the same 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.720
 the same 10-inch model 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.760
 modest processor intel atom 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.730
 is there one bike byte of RAM and two 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.140
 2 and 5 megapixel cameras 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.120
 tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-by and large 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.430
 It turned out very nice line and yes 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.140
 the price tag is quite good this model is average 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.440
 10 " on the correct price list 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.130
 on 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.810
 called the test costs 400 dollars 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.880
 9 inch model costs $ 300 well 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.160
 and the biggest senior variation 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.170
 will cost 700 sales start 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.220
 scheduled for February see what 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.360
