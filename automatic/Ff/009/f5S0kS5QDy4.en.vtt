00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
guess I don't know does your minecraft

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.260 
guess I don't know does your minecraft
guy<00:01:33.810> get<00:01:34.020> tired<00:01:34.380> out<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.909> then<00:01:35.909> he<00:01:36.030> slowly

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
guy get tired out and then he slowly

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.480 
guy get tired out and then he slowly
starts<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.810> descend<00:01:37.200> again<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.250> kind<00:01:38.460> of

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
starts to descend again so it's kind of

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.149 
starts to descend again so it's kind of
like<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.150> jump<00:01:39.600> boost<00:01:40.020> which<00:01:40.710> makes

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
like it's just a jump boost which makes

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.700 
like it's just a jump boost which makes
it<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.000> because<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.360> makes<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.990> guess

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
it I like it because it makes it I guess

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.310 
it I like it because it makes it I guess
