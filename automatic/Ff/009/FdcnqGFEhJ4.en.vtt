00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
now your spinach arch makeup would be

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.960 
now your spinach arch makeup would be
really<00:01:24.600> runny<00:01:24.869> very<00:01:25.409> liquidy<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.369> that's<00:01:26.820> not

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
really runny very liquidy and that's not

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.210 
really runny very liquidy and that's not
what<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.240> want<00:01:27.570> okay<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.500> I'll<00:01:28.920> with<00:01:29.100> my

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
what we want okay so I'll with my

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.920 
what we want okay so I'll with my
spinach<00:01:29.579> squeeze<00:01:29.880> dry<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.509> it

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
spinach squeeze dry you can see it

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.200 
spinach squeeze dry you can see it
didn't<00:01:31.380> amount<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:32.250> much<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.729> looked<00:01:32.939> at

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
didn't amount to as much as it looked at

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.609 
didn't amount to as much as it looked at
all<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.720> that's<00:01:33.900> why<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.049> have<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.320> squeeze

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
all so that's why you have to squeeze

gonna<00:06:44.159> love<00:06:44.250> this<00:06:44.639> I<00:06:44.849> don't<00:06:45.030> know<00:06:45.090> anybody<00:06:45.509> who

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:45.719 
gonna love this I don't know anybody who

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:47.990 
gonna love this I don't know anybody who
doesn't<00:06:46.020> absolutely<00:06:46.530> love<00:06:47.430> spinach<00:06:47.849> and

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
doesn't absolutely love spinach and

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.330 
doesn't absolutely love spinach and
artichoke<00:06:48.389> dip<00:06:48.419> so<00:06:49.319> I<00:06:49.710> don't<00:06:49.979> see<00:06:50.099> why<00:06:50.219> they

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
artichoke dip so I don't see why they

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.129 
artichoke dip so I don't see why they
wouldn't<00:06:50.520> love<00:06:50.669> this<00:06:50.729> one<00:06:51.120> and<00:06:51.360> it's<00:06:51.900> even

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139 
wouldn't love this one and it's even

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:53.719 
wouldn't love this one and it's even
better<00:06:52.289> because<00:06:52.409> it's<00:06:53.009> a<00:06:53.099> little<00:06:53.340> bit<00:06:53.460> lighter

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 
better because it's a little bit lighter

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.640 
better because it's a little bit lighter
and<00:06:54.060> so<00:06:54.210> you<00:06:54.300> don't<00:06:54.449> have<00:06:54.539> to<00:06:54.690> have<00:06:54.840> you<00:06:55.560> know
