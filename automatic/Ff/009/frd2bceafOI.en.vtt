so<00:00:09.240> yeah<00:00:09.389> this<00:00:09.929> isn't<00:00:10.139> going<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.410> be<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.559> regular

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
so yeah this isn't going to be a regular

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.009 
so yeah this isn't going to be a regular
segment<00:00:11.370> at<00:00:12.000> least<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.269> have<00:00:12.420> no<00:00:12.540> intention<00:00:12.960> of

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
segment at least I have no intention of

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.450 
segment at least I have no intention of
making<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.440> one<00:00:15.619> because<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.770> think<00:00:17.070> doing

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
making it one because I think doing

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.519 
making it one because I think doing
videos<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:18.000> hate<00:00:18.180> mail<00:00:18.210> would<00:00:18.630> just<00:00:19.380> encourage

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
videos of hate mail would just encourage

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.929 
videos of hate mail would just encourage
people<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.039> write<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.340> fake<00:00:20.520> hate<00:00:20.730> mail<00:00:20.910> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
people to write the fake hate mail and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.759 
people to write the fake hate mail and
usually<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.480> can<00:00:21.600> spot<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.930> from<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> mile<00:00:22.350> off<00:00:22.380> so

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
usually I can spot it from a mile off so

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.210 
usually I can spot it from a mile off so
in<00:00:23.730> fact<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.060> may<00:00:24.960> be<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.199> joke<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:26.070> no

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
in fact this may be a joke I have no

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.700 
in fact this may be a joke I have no
idea<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.789> was<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.449> retarded<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.199> thought

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
idea it was so retarded that I thought

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.800 
idea it was so retarded that I thought
maybe<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.099> was<00:00:29.189> just<00:00:29.250> somebody<00:00:29.519> being<00:00:30.510> funny

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
maybe it was just somebody being funny

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.240 
maybe it was just somebody being funny
but<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.439> more<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.650> look<00:00:31.859> at<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.070> more<00:00:32.130> I

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
but the more I look at it the more I

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.729 
but the more I look at it the more I
think<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.489> guy<00:00:32.610> might<00:00:32.640> actually<00:00:32.969> be<00:00:33.180> serious

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
think this guy might actually be serious

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.549 
think this guy might actually be serious
so<00:00:34.739> anyway<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.360> quick<00:00:36.360> sort<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.719> explanation<00:00:37.020> I
