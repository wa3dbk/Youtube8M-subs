00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.540
 ah 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.300
 Y 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.480
 hello dear curious videogamers 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.580
 I present this new program in 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.920
 where each chapter will be bringing 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.020
 the mysterious stories and some 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.390
 how many Easter eggs on the world 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.820
 of gaming, let's start with one of the 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.370
 most popular mysteries but also one 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:41.489
 of the oldest 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.489
 today we present the song of total 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.620
 the song of tot here is an ancient 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.780
 easter egg there are many 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.120
 nintendo titles from games 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.010
 classic to the most modern what 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.590
 interesting is that this song 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.230
 remains hidden in all cases 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.839
 the name of the song comes from 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.119
 surname of its own author the engineer 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.130
 in sound case myth is here composer 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.680
 in many of the titles of nintendo 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.049
 the first game in which I almost put myself 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.380
 the song secretly was in a title 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.450
 for the game boy of the man ex x a 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.240
 game that never came out of Japan and that 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.119
 simulated a 3-d environment similar to 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.740
 star fox for super nintendo for 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.560
 find the song in this title 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.689
 we must go to level 4 and in the image 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.509
 where the mad scientist appears with 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:38.399
 idiot face we should wait 40 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.399
 seconds and we will listen to the song 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.940
 t 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.920
 The funny thing is that a few years ago the 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.810
 game had a readaptation for day 6 and 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.380
 we can find the song in the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.380
 same place 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.990
 in 1992 I took on work in an innovator 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.800
 game for the super nintendo called 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.110
 mario paint a fossil father of photoshop 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.820
 the game had very few levels and 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.410
 the only thing you had to do was 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.440
 coloring with a mouse that came 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.140
 integrated the melody was hidden in 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.770
 the main menu after clicking on 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.770
 Mary's side 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.800
 and that same year went on sale super 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.599
 mario land 2 this was the first game in 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.630
 the one that shigeru miyamoto and kasumi 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:58.000
 they worked more professionally and 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.790
 it would be from this point that it almost 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.400
 would become your favorite composer 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.480
 along with koji kondo genius behind the 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.730
 cell and mario bros music 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.860
 to listen to the song we must 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.840
 access the game over screen and 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.840
 wait there for 2 minutes and 30 seconds 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.569
 this prosthetic package 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.550
 all right 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.550
 from the USA 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.410
 another game in which we find the 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.510
 song is in link's awakening what 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.180
 we need to do is enter the house 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.370
 of richard and once being there at 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.890
 just like the super mario land 2 we must 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.940
 to wait 2 minutes and 30 seconds and 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.940
 we can hear it 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.020
 Y 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.950
 and the same happens in the link's version 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.710
 awakening and ex in the Japanese version 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.800
 from the same game we can also listen 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.300
 the song however in this title what 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.940
 What we should do is name the 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.019
 character as a total and in doing so it 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.019
 I would listen to the song 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.650
 Another curious fact is that a group of 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.599
 hackers entered the game code and 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.099
 hidden in it was the melody 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:41.099
 that sounded pretty macabre 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.930
 until now it is believed impossible to access 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.930
 she playing the game in a common way 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.540
 more modern securities in which 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.660
 we can find this song are josh 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.420
 and story for nintendo 64 luigi's mansion 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.490
 pikmin 2 and many other games in the 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.330
 which I assumed leaves its hidden signature of 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.330
 19 notes 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:23.340
 however there is still another curious factor 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.530
 about the composer since supposedly 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.360
 is represented as a character in 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.189
 one of the video games in which he 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.189
 participated and pop 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.870
 already of the fans of nintendo locate 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.400
 very well the saga of animal crossing the 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.190
 current president of nintendo satoru 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.870
 iwata was in charge at that time of 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.540
 design of the animal characters 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.400
 crossing iwata created many of the 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.460
 characters based on team members 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.830
 behind the game and casually the 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.250
 sound manager of the game was the 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.140
 Mr. K his myth attacks however if 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.120
 we mentioned the name of the composer 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.510
 as a Japanese I would do it correctly 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:07.260
 It would be assuming full and abbreviated mos 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:10.230
 the second word would be everything to kakÃ¡ that 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.180
 could be the key dog that maybe the 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.290
 most emblematic character of all the 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.270
 game 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.340
 this character appeared to all 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.490
 Saturdays to sing and give you a 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.370
 random song or you could ask him 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.350
 a specific song and it is through 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.360
 this method that in this game we can 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.520
 find the song 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.870
 for this you will have to ask him to touch the 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.870
 famous key that he made 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.780
 i 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.780
 ah 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.510
 ah 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.330
 and well I hope you enjoyed this
