00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.830
 what's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.349
 destiny new video we have something 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.110
 very interesting for you and indeed 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.450
 something that was not in the patchnotes 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.220
 but it will be very important and we will 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.960
 already had in the last weeks 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.330
 talked about that probably the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.850
 twilight strike of the heroic 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.560
 strike is decoupled so we 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.090
 for example, the dusk strike 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.429
 go and fight nicole 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.470
 but then in the same week then 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.270
 for the coins before God must know 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.460
 that was already hinted at 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.110
 that maybe you want to do that and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.020
 the patch will come out tomorrow 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.420
 or tomorrow, the ec2 house 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.219
 the wolves are activated so we know 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.870
 At twilight strike there could be changes 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.739
 give but what we did not know 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.840
 is that also something with patch 1 2 0 1 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.120
 brand new in the twilight strikes 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.680
 comes in and it will be 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.410
 to be likely when you are in 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.090
 then twilight time will be killed 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.070
 you will not just go back to orbit 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.909
 but you can do that 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.159
 dusk strike no longer enter 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.320
 what the fuck is going on and we have 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.140
 here even picture material what that 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.350
 all you see you see this red 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.270
 button and if that in your inventory 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.009
 is active then you are for the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.430
 Twilight strike for the week 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.049
 but you can do it all 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.450
 even picking up again if you are 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.780
 go to the speaker there you can 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.939
 buy item which will regenerate your light 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.040
 lets the lock becomes 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.500
 and then you can go back in 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.060
 go in the twilight strike and that 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.070
 is a very interesting thing that 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.750
 That's what I do, that's what it does 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.220
 even a little trickier if you 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.049
 then in the end what you do not die again 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.310
 be pure but then you go first 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.909
 to the speaker and maybe straight 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.009
 that is why this ability of 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.540
 materials exchanges to the speaker 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.759
 misplaced that, for example, then 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.399
 light particle can acquire or 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.890
 can exchange a strange coins 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.409
 and so, and yes we do not know if 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.360
 that will be active from tomorrow that is 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.869
 a pure speculation everything we do 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.789
 to have 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.790
 in quotes everything 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.609
 is in game material of someone who 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.099
 Apparently this feature is provided 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.689
 Frey has how shocked first as 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.049
 We saw that best your opinion 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.569
 to 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.010
 Would you welcome that ? What does it look like ? 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.220
 So with us it is so we have 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.359
 over 200 not particles on that so we 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.859
 will not break it now 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:32.489
 problem is just that they then 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:34.170
 stop to speak but have to 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.720
 Of course you can do that too 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.459
 several of these light regenerating 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.439
 so you can get the items 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.989
 maybe also use directly 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:44.340
 what do you say in general about this topic 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.170
 We will be interested in burning 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.109
 discuss coffins with and once again 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.480
 People We are not bungie employees 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.150
 we research only the whole day and 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.859
 we sow what we sow 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.959
 we are not responsible if 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.239
 that does not come into play and then otherwise 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.340
 I would like to have this video if possible 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.019
 I was glad to have a thumbs up 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.419
 up there to support us 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.239
 and if you are not one of our daily ones 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.889
 want to miss the video more 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.760

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.760
