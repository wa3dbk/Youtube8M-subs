00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
less skin with any firmer but I really

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.540 
less skin with any firmer but I really
liked<00:05:06.750> this<00:05:06.930> one<00:05:07.110> because<00:05:07.290> it's<00:05:07.620> quite<00:05:07.920> a<00:05:08.160> kind

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
liked this one because it's quite a kind

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.190 
liked this one because it's quite a kind
of<00:05:08.640> runny<00:05:08.910> lotion<00:05:09.360> and<00:05:09.510> I<00:05:09.570> find<00:05:09.780> that's<00:05:09.900> a<00:05:10.050> good

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
of runny lotion and I find that's a good

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.020 
of runny lotion and I find that's a good
moisturizer<00:05:10.410> to<00:05:10.919> use<00:05:11.040> before<00:05:11.550> I'm<00:05:11.820> fake

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
tanning I find it just gives the most

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.830 
tanning I find it just gives the most
smoothest<00:05:14.190> application<00:05:14.790> for<00:05:14.940> fake<00:05:15.090> tan<00:05:15.300> so<00:05:15.810> I
