factory levels up the research tab is

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.980 
factory levels up the research tab is
you<00:02:50.730> know<00:02:50.880> when<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.210> upgrade<00:02:51.420> these<00:02:51.720> levels

makes<00:03:00.090> your<00:03:00.860> energy<00:03:01.860> plant<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.370> then

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
makes your energy plant and then

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.090 
makes your energy plant and then
exploration<00:03:03.990> which<00:03:04.530> is<00:03:04.650> one<00:03:04.800> of<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.950> hardest

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
exploration which is one of the hardest

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.220 
exploration which is one of the hardest
to<00:03:05.370> get<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.760> where<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.240> can<00:03:06.390> expand<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:07.050> new

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
to get is where you can expand to new

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.200 
to get is where you can expand to new
territory<00:03:07.830> so<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.100> can<00:03:08.250> have<00:03:08.430> not<00:03:08.790> just<00:03:09.000> one

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
territory so you can have not just one

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.650 
territory so you can have not just one
settlement<00:03:09.570> but<00:03:09.810> multiple<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.480> can

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
settlement but multiple and so you can

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.780 
settlement but multiple and so you can
gain<00:03:12.840> more<00:03:13.020> resources<00:03:13.530> your<00:03:14.100> army<00:03:14.370> type<00:03:14.670> is

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
gain more resources your army type is

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.460 
gain more resources your army type is
basically<00:03:15.240> just<00:03:15.270> showing<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.870> who's

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
basically just showing you who's

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.420 
basically just showing you who's
attacking<00:03:16.890> who's<00:03:17.760> defending<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:19.280> for<00:03:20.280> your

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
attacking who's defending and for your

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.490 
attacking who's defending and for your
civilization<00:03:21.150> then<00:03:21.360> just<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.840> storage<00:03:22.260> box

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
civilization then just a storage box

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.250 
civilization then just a storage box
that<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:22.950> can<00:03:23.040> expand<00:03:23.550> later<00:03:23.760> map<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:25.050> where

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
that you can expand later map is where

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.280 
that you can expand later map is where
you<00:03:25.410> just<00:03:25.850> pull<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:26.970> point<00:03:27.270> out<00:03:27.480> see<00:03:27.900> different

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
you just pull it point out see different

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.320 
you just pull it point out see different
people<00:03:28.830> civilizations<00:03:29.730> what<00:03:29.910> alliances

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
people civilizations what alliances

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
people civilizations what alliances
there<00:03:30.750> are<00:03:30.900> things<00:03:31.740> like<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.510> warfare<00:03:33.510> now

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
there are things like the warfare now

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.130 
there are things like the warfare now
you<00:03:34.410> can<00:03:34.740> train<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.459> start<00:03:35.940> missions<00:03:36.360> pretty

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
you can train and start missions pretty

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.870 
you can train and start missions pretty
much<00:03:37.320> you<00:03:37.440> can<00:03:37.590> either<00:03:37.709> choose<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.100> move

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
much you can either choose to move

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.870 
much you can either choose to move
resources<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:40.190> someone's<00:03:41.190> area<00:03:41.640> or

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
resources to someone's area or

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.729 
resources to someone's area or
settlement<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.959> can<00:03:43.140> spy<00:03:43.440> on<00:03:43.470> that

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
settlement you can spy on that

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.590 
settlement you can spy on that
settlement<00:03:44.160> see<00:03:44.310> how<00:03:44.459> many<00:03:44.610> resources<00:03:45.270> they

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
settlement see how many resources they

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.900 
settlement see how many resources they
have<00:03:45.630> what's<00:03:46.260> defending<00:03:46.860> them<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.310> then<00:03:47.820> you

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
have what's defending them and then you

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.850 
have what's defending them and then you
can<00:03:48.030> attack<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.510> subway<00:03:48.870> basically<00:03:49.770> the

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
can attack the subway basically the

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.040 
can attack the subway basically the
whole<00:03:49.980> tackling<00:03:50.520> is<00:03:50.730> if<00:03:51.000> you're<00:03:51.239> succeed<00:03:51.840> in

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
whole tackling is if you're succeed in

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.870 
whole tackling is if you're succeed in
attacking<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:53.130> gain<00:03:53.340> twenty<00:03:53.670> five<00:03:53.850> percent

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
attacking you gain twenty five percent

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.880 
attacking you gain twenty five percent
of<00:03:54.420> their<00:03:54.600> resources<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.230> are<00:03:55.290> built<00:03:55.590> up<00:03:55.709> so

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
of their resources that are built up so

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.860 
of their resources that are built up so
let's<00:03:56.010> say<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.280> have<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.760> hundred<00:03:57.180> thousand<00:03:57.690> food

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
let's say I have a hundred thousand food

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.840 
let's say I have a hundred thousand food
and<00:03:58.110> someone<00:03:58.350> attacks<00:03:58.650> me<00:03:58.770> in<00:03:58.950> wins<00:03:59.190> they<00:03:59.640> game

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
and someone attacks me in wins they game

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
been wanting for a long time in my

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.920 
been wanting for a long time in my
opinion<00:04:58.729> it<00:04:59.729> does<00:04:59.969> start<00:05:00.180> a<00:05:00.270> little<00:05:00.569> slow

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
opinion it does start a little slow

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.830 
opinion it does start a little slow
because<00:05:01.560> you<00:05:02.190> know<00:05:02.479> upgrading<00:05:03.479> buildings

because you know upgrading buildings

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.290 
because you know upgrading buildings

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
usually takes an hour or two so it's not

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:10.249 
usually takes an hour or two so it's not
