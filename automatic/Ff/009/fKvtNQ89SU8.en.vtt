going to take us on a little journey
tell<00:00:43.540> me<00:00:43.660> a<00:00:43.690> little<00:00:43.870> bit<00:00:44.019> about<00:00:44.170> this

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
tell me a little bit about this

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.920 
tell me a little bit about this
mechanism<00:00:45.129> well<00:00:45.760> this<00:00:45.909> is<00:00:46.030> a<00:00:46.059> digital<00:00:46.300> imaging

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
mechanism well this is a digital imaging

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.600 
mechanism well this is a digital imaging
system<00:00:47.320> that<00:00:47.470> uses<00:00:47.650> digital<00:00:48.010> camera

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
system that uses digital camera

wheels indicate the condition of the

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.630 
wheels indicate the condition of the
alignment<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:53.500> then<00:00:53.680> allow<00:00:53.920> you<00:00:53.980> to<00:00:54.339> make<00:00:54.519> the

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
alignment and then allow you to make the

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.100 
alignment and then allow you to make the
adjustments<00:00:55.210> required<00:00:55.329> in<00:00:55.750> a<00:00:55.809> very<00:00:56.050> short

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
adjustments required in a very short

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.530 
adjustments required in a very short
period<00:00:56.350> of<00:00:56.620> time<00:00:56.680> Mary<00:00:57.430> so<00:00:58.000> can<00:00:58.120> you<00:00:58.149> give<00:00:58.360> us<00:00:58.449> a

period of time Mary so can you give us a

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.759 
period of time Mary so can you give us a
little<00:00:58.659> demonstration<00:00:58.839> and<00:00:59.440> show<00:00:59.500> us<00:00:59.739> how

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
little demonstration and show us how

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.100 
little demonstration and show us how
it's<00:00:59.890> done<00:01:00.150> absolutely<00:01:01.150> very<00:01:01.600> easy<00:01:01.809> we<00:01:02.080> just

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
it's done absolutely very easy we just

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.840 
it's done absolutely very easy we just
simply<00:01:02.619> ask<00:01:02.799> the<00:01:02.949> computer<00:01:03.100> to<00:01:03.339> start<00:01:03.699> the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
simply ask the computer to start the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.460 
simply ask the computer to start the
alignment<00:01:04.299> select<00:01:04.659> the<00:01:04.780> vehicle<00:01:05.199> that<00:01:05.229> we

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
alignment select the vehicle that we

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.219 
alignment select the vehicle that we
have<00:01:05.710> have<00:01:06.640> our<00:01:06.790> specifications<00:01:07.630> then<00:01:08.080> we

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
have have our specifications then we

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.260 
have have our specifications then we
attach<00:01:08.560> our<00:01:08.799> sensors<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.369> the<00:01:09.460> vehicle<00:01:09.850> which

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
attach our sensors to the vehicle which

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.300 
attach our sensors to the vehicle which
is<00:01:10.390> very<00:01:10.630> easily<00:01:10.869> done<00:01:11.320> we<00:01:11.860> Center<00:01:12.189> that

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
is very easily done we Center that

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.730 
is very easily done we Center that
target<00:01:12.759> so<00:01:13.630> just<00:01:13.810> go<00:01:13.930> ahead<00:01:13.960> and<00:01:14.170> center<00:01:14.560> that

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
target so just go ahead and center that

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.620 
target so just go ahead and center that
right<00:01:15.340> up<00:01:15.520> so<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.790> computer<00:01:16.119> can<00:01:16.270> see<00:01:16.420> that

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
right up so the computer can see that

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.050 
right up so the computer can see that
lock<00:01:16.960> that<00:01:17.170> down<00:01:17.409> into<00:01:17.650> place<00:01:17.920> we've<00:01:18.850> done

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
lock that down into place we've done

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.730 
lock that down into place we've done

less all ready to go to we have our

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.280 
less all ready to go to we have our
initial<00:01:28.210> information<00:01:28.479> and<00:01:28.990> what<00:01:29.079> we're<00:01:29.200> going

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
initial information and what we're going

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.260 
initial information and what we're going
to<00:01:29.409> do<00:01:29.500> now<00:01:29.710> is<00:01:30.250> roll<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.820> car<00:01:31.000> backwards

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
to do now is roll the car backwards

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.719 
to do now is roll the car backwards
about<00:01:31.689> 8<00:01:31.869> inches<00:01:31.900> and<00:01:32.439> forward<00:01:33.039> to<00:01:33.490> acquire

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
about 8 inches and forward to acquire

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.279 
about 8 inches and forward to acquire
our<00:01:33.759> measurements<00:01:34.420> on<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.630> step<00:01:34.899> of<00:01:35.049> the<00:01:35.109> rear

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
our measurements on the step of the rear

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.559 
our measurements on the step of the rear
wheel<00:01:35.469> to<00:01:35.619> do<00:01:35.740> that<00:01:35.920> can<00:01:36.159> follow<00:01:36.399> back<00:01:36.789> so<00:01:37.420> what

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
wheel to do that can follow back so what

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.179 
wheel to do that can follow back so what
we'll<00:01:37.719> do<00:01:37.869> then<00:01:37.899> is<00:01:38.259> will<00:01:38.409> simply<00:01:38.799> now<00:01:38.920> just

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
we'll do then is will simply now just

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.789 
we'll do then is will simply now just
roll<00:01:39.429> the<00:01:39.579> vehicle<00:01:39.939> okay<00:01:40.840> see<00:01:41.319> the<00:01:41.469> screen

roll the vehicle okay see the screen

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.380 
roll the vehicle okay see the screen
turned<00:01:42.069> green<00:01:42.399> and<00:01:42.460> we're<00:01:42.700> going<00:01:42.939> to<00:01:42.969> hold<00:01:43.270> for

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
turned green and we're going to hold for

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.260 
turned green and we're going to hold for
a<00:01:43.569> moment<00:01:43.719> tell<00:01:44.679> it<00:01:44.799> advances<00:01:45.340> we<00:01:45.880> roll<00:01:46.119> it

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
a moment tell it advances we roll it

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.480 
a moment tell it advances we roll it
forward<00:01:46.920> into<00:01:47.920> position

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
forward into position

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.760 
forward into position
we<00:01:49.909> lock<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.299> wheel<00:01:50.479> okay<00:01:51.110> now<00:01:51.380> it<00:01:51.619> will

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
we lock the wheel okay now it will

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.649 
we lock the wheel okay now it will
advance<00:01:52.159> and<00:01:52.430> then<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.790> technology<00:01:53.479> that's

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
advance and then the technology that's

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.139

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.100 
going to be in a bind so I have to have
some<00:02:34.310> pressure<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.650> this<00:02:36.830> comes<00:02:37.069> around<00:02:38.110> this

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
some pressure so this comes around this

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.610 
some pressure so this comes around this
one<00:02:39.319> stays<00:02:39.590> stationary<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:42.230> one<00:02:42.410> comes

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
one stays stationary that one comes

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.490

a little bit about this device sure sure
it<00:02:58.700> is<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.880> road<00:02:59.570> force<00:02:59.840> variation<00:03:00.170> machine<00:03:00.739> not

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
it is a road force variation machine not

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.770 
it is a road force variation machine not
only<00:03:01.370> does<00:03:01.700> it<00:03:01.730> balance<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.299> wheel<00:03:02.420> or<00:03:02.570> tire

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
only does it balance the wheel or tire

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.110 
only does it balance the wheel or tire
to<00:03:03.140> keep<00:03:03.320> it<00:03:03.440> from<00:03:03.560> vibrating<00:03:04.220> but<00:03:04.880> it<00:03:04.970> also

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
to keep it from vibrating but it also

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.740 
to keep it from vibrating but it also
can<00:03:05.540> take<00:03:06.350> this<00:03:06.500> roller<00:03:06.829> and<00:03:07.510> see<00:03:08.510> if<00:03:08.630> the
