don't lose any damage or any fall damage

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.909 
don't lose any damage or any fall damage
and<00:04:05.819> if<00:04:06.389> you<00:04:06.510> hold<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.840> space<00:04:07.169> button<00:04:07.440> even

and if you hold the space button even

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.920 
and if you hold the space button even
more<00:04:08.250> you'll<00:04:08.699> be<00:04:08.910> able<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.150> spring<00:04:09.510> up<00:04:09.690> in<00:04:09.870> the

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
more you'll be able to spring up in the

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.830 
more you'll be able to spring up in the
air<00:04:10.109> a<00:04:11.069> lot<00:04:11.459> higher<00:04:11.790> than<00:04:11.849> if<00:04:12.299> you<00:04:12.389> just<00:04:12.419> have

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
air a lot higher than if you just have

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.890 
air a lot higher than if you just have
if<00:04:13.049> you<00:04:13.139> just<00:04:13.500> tapped<00:04:13.739> it<00:04:13.980> see<00:04:14.540> so<00:04:15.540> that's

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
if you just tapped it see so that's

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.339 
if you just tapped it see so that's
really<00:04:16.199> cool<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:17.269> I<00:04:18.269> think<00:04:18.630> it'd<00:04:18.870> be<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:19.019> good<00:04:19.289> a

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
really cool and I think it'd be a good a

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.850 
really cool and I think it'd be a good a
combination<00:04:19.979> with<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.579> glider
