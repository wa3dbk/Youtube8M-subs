ball mode I came in
don't<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.459> even<00:02:43.650> don't<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.800> go<00:02:46.350> Paul<00:02:50.250> anyway

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
don't you even don't you go Paul anyway

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.160 
don't you even don't you go Paul anyway
so<00:02:52.060> yeah<00:02:52.150> that's<00:02:52.480> basically<00:02:52.570> what<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.020> get

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
so yeah that's basically what you get

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.760 
so yeah that's basically what you get
here<00:02:53.350> is<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.560> three<00:02:53.709> modes<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.900> they<00:02:59.500> have

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
here is the three modes so they have

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.890 
here is the three modes so they have
that<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.820> course<00:03:00.850> guess<00:03:01.360> what<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.780> does

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
that and of course guess what it does

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.350 
that and of course guess what it does
have<00:03:02.050> compatibility<00:03:02.620> where's<00:03:03.190> our<00:03:03.489> sangoku

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
have compatibility where's our sangoku

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.050 
have compatibility where's our sangoku
driver<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.020> we<00:03:05.110> just<00:03:05.230> turn<00:03:05.440> this<00:03:05.590> on<00:03:06.060> where's

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
driver so we just turn this on where's

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.740 
driver so we just turn this on where's
the<00:03:07.150> switch

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
the switch

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.410 
the switch
there<00:03:07.989> it<00:03:08.110> is<00:03:08.200> oh<00:03:10.860> yeah<00:03:11.890> Sengoku<00:03:12.370> driver<00:03:12.820> I

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
there it is oh yeah Sengoku driver I

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.110 
there it is oh yeah Sengoku driver I
have<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:13.750> do<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.019> every<00:03:14.200> time<00:03:14.230> I'm<00:03:14.500> sorry<00:03:16.860> so

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
have to do that every time I'm sorry so

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.280 
have to do that every time I'm sorry so
just<00:03:19.120> open<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.480> up<00:03:19.600> with<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.810> switch<00:03:19.989> right<00:03:20.140> here

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
just open it up with a switch right here

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:29.420 
just open it up with a switch right here
and<00:03:20.530> Haitian<00:03:24.090> sweet<00:03:25.090> cow<00:03:25.769> just<00:03:26.769> plug<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.040> in

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:43.910 

close<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:30.549> up

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:56.340 

regardless<00:03:54.810> there<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:55.900> go

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
regardless there you go

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.050 
regardless there you go
you<00:03:56.740> have<00:03:56.860> now<00:03:57.010> transformed<00:03:57.640> into<00:03:57.670> coming

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
you have now transformed into coming

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.270 
you have now transformed into coming
right<00:03:58.180> a<00:03:58.210> guy<00:03:58.420> in<00:03:58.540> my<00:03:58.630> Suika<00:03:59.110> arms<00:03:59.440> game<00:03:59.980> is<00:04:00.160> the

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
right a guy in my Suika arms game is the

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.340 
right a guy in my Suika arms game is the
only<00:04:00.310> one<00:04:00.700> that's<00:04:00.880> used<00:04:01.270> this<00:04:01.480> so<00:04:01.720> far<00:04:02.020> so

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
only one that's used this so far so

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.510 
only one that's used this so far so
basically<00:04:02.770> you<00:04:02.920> want<00:04:03.040> to<00:04:03.100> keep<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.310> dyeing

basically you want to keep the dyeing

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.240 
basically you want to keep the dyeing
faceplate<00:04:03.970> on<00:04:04.000> there<00:04:04.440> again<00:04:05.440> here<00:04:05.890> you<00:04:05.950> go<00:04:06.070> you

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
faceplate on there again here you go you

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.720 
faceplate on there again here you go you
got<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.570> specific<00:04:07.570> weapon<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:08.350> that<00:04:08.730> arms

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
have compelled compatibility with the

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.520 
have compelled compatibility with the
mousou<00:04:58.360> saber<00:04:58.599> but<00:04:58.870> i<00:04:58.900> don't<00:04:59.110> have<00:04:59.229> that<00:04:59.259> yet

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
mousou saber but i don't have that yet

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.050 
mousou saber but i don't have that yet
but<00:04:59.710> when<00:04:59.800> I<00:04:59.830> do<00:04:59.949> I'll<00:05:00.610> show<00:05:00.669> off<00:05:00.940> the

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
but when I do I'll show off the

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.809 
but when I do I'll show off the
compatibility<00:05:01.599> with<00:05:02.199> that<00:05:02.560> so<00:05:03.190> again<00:05:03.370> to<00:05:03.610> the

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:03.819 
compatibility with that so again to the

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.300 
compatibility with that so again to the
entrant<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:04.270> close<00:05:04.630> it<00:05:04.810> up<00:05:04.900> and<00:05:05.590> that<00:05:05.919> on<00:05:06.190> the

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
entrant and close it up and that on the

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.409 
entrant and close it up and that on the
show<00:05:06.460> they<00:05:06.639> pretty<00:05:06.789> much<00:05:06.880> do<00:05:07.060> that<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:07.360> that's

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
show they pretty much do that and that's

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.930 
show they pretty much do that and that's
made<00:05:07.659> attention<00:05:08.289> D<00:05:08.740> transform<00:05:09.190> on<00:05:09.430> transform

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
made attention D transform on transform

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:18.830 
made attention D transform on transform
whatever<00:05:10.389> you<00:05:10.630> want<00:05:10.840> to<00:05:10.930> say<00:05:11.229> it<00:05:15.539> there<00:05:16.539> you<00:05:16.599> go

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
there you have the Sarika lock seed

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.180 
there you have the Sarika lock seed
again<00:05:26.310> you<00:05:27.310> know<00:05:27.900> I'm<00:05:28.900> kind<00:05:29.530> of<00:05:29.650> going<00:05:29.919> in<00:05:30.099> on
