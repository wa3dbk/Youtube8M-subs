00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 chapter 5 then there was great clamor from 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.130
 people and their women against their 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.780
 Jewish brothers there were those who said 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.750
 we our children and our daughters 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.150
 we are many therefore we have come 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.010
 borrow grain to eat and live and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.020
 there were those who said we have pledged 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.910
 our lands our vineyards and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.830
 our houses to buy grain to 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.230
 cause of hunger and there were those who said 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.449
 we have borrowed money for the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.150
 tribute of the king on our lands and 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.160
 vineyards now well our meat is like 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.739
 the flesh of our brothers our 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.719
 children as their children and here that we 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.790
 we gave our children and our daughters to 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.219
 bondage and some of our daughters 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.379
 they are already and we have no possibility of 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.960
 rescue them because our lands and 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.730
 our vineyards are from others and I get angry 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.640
 nga so when I heard their cry and 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.530
 these words then meditate and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.320
 rebuked the nobles and the officers 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.660
 and I told them you demand interest each of 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.210
 these brothers and summon against them 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.760
 a great assembly and I told them we 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.350
 according to our possibilities we rescue 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.480
 to our Jewish brothers who had 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.400
 been sold to the nations 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.580
 you sell even to your brothers 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.730
 and they will be sold to us and shut up 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.070
 they did not have to answer and I said no 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.020
 it's good what you do I will not walk jce in 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.310
 the fear of our god not to be 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.370
 opprobrium of the enemy nations 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.050
 our also me and my brothers and my 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.390
 servants we have lent them money and 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.820

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.010

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.260
 lands their vines their olive groves and their 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.660
 houses and one hundredth of the money 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.060
 of the grain of the wine and the oil that 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.550
 demand is from them as interest and 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.150
 They said we will refund it and nothing 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.650
 we will demand we will do as you say 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.540
 then summon the priests and they 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.540
 I made them swear they would do according to this 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.700
 I also shook my dress and said so 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.310
 shake god out of your house and your work 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.190
 to every man who does not fulfill this and so 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.670
 be shaken and empty and answered all the 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.070
 congregation Amen and praised Jehovah and 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.840
 the people did according to this also 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.640
 since the day the king sent me 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.800
 was governor of them on earth 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.319
 of Judah since the year 20 of the king 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.230
 artaxerxes until the year 32 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.450
 12 years neither me nor my brothers ate the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.040
 the governor's bread but the first 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.530
 governors who were before me 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.840
 they overwhelmed the people and took from them 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.150
 for bread and for wine more than 40 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.370
 silver cycles and even his servants will 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.700
 they dominated the town but I did not 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.069
 well because of the fear of god also in 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.680
 the work of this wall restore my part and 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.400
 we do not buy inheritance and all my servants 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.439
 together they were there in the work also 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.120
 150 Jews and officers and those who came 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:47.819
 of the nations that were around 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.069
 we were at my table and what was 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.590
 prepared for each day was an ox and 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.230
 six chosen sheep were also 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.049
 prepared for me birds and every ten days 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.939
 He came in all abundance and with all this 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.069
 he never required the governor's bread 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.769
 because the servitude of this town was 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:09.019
 serious remember me for good my god 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.019
 and everything I did for this town
