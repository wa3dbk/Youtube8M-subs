00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello to you aqua blog today i 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.330
 I'll tell you how to make homemade 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:12.630
 carbon dioxide generator ie 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:18.000
 homemade cheap carbon feed 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:20.720
 gas to the aquarium for this us 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.050
 need to take two bottles 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:30.689
 enough for half a liter strand dropper 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:36.600
 two covers this i already did on it 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:43.070
 I'll show you how and of course the glue and tell 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.070
 how is the principle of this system 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.940
 take the lid and drill not in the hole 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:58.680
 what I like about her dropper 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:02.100
 there are such adapters of it 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.570
 enough to smear with glue and put in 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:16.950
 plug and already connect to it 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:22.950
 dropping a dropper with 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:31.049
 bottle cap on the green bottle will be 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:31.909
 soda in this cover we drill two 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:40.770
 holes 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:43.350
 we insert two tubules it is long 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.780
 tubule insert another tube from 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.770
 droppers it to fit 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:57.439
 to the bottom of our bottles 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:02.030
 yes, Iâ€™ll tell you everything, why we are connecting 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.030
 drip to the tube length 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:18.040
 and the other to the prince is inserted another 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:20.140
 the hole where the tube is small again is not 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.690
 forget all the joints grease glue 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.690
 because it will all be under pressure 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.950
 we insert our reactor system further 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:36.750
 co2 is a tube in which side 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.750
 spruce twig dry 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:53.130
 here is our system is sure to be ready 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.700
 it is necessary that there was a clamp as well as filing 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.300
 the aquarium is also between our two 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.300
 bottles 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:09.450
 put a green bottle of soda in 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.020
 transparent bottle pour lemon 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:20.370
 acid fill it in about 100 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:26.340
 milliliters of water 100 150 and start like this 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:30.390
 here is a special thing to do is to have water 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.350
 winter on the acid hit a bottle of soda 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:39.480
 then it turns out the reaction stands out 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:43.500
 carbon dioxide and already this pressure goes to 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.290
 citric acid since this duct 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:52.410
 small this liquid will not go into this 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:59.070
 tube and not get this bottle it 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:02.420
 pressure increases and slowly goes 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:06.230
 to the aquarium for this one 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:11.700
 tubing with sl2 reactor 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:16.489
 when the pressure decreases then here in this 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:21.919
 kimono acid tubes going 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:28.100
 water and falls into this bottle 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:28.100
 again the reaction is already underway 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:34.500
 already on the new carbon dioxide 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:40.490
 which goes down this one 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.490
 bottle and then to the co2 reactor 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.320
 if you want to see how that 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:49.590
 filled and working see 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.630
 the next video to be on it 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:56.250
 channel if you liked the video then 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.630
 subscribe to our channel come on 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.979
 Our groups VKontakte classmates 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:08.130
 go to our website where it will be 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:10.699
 described narrated and put likes to 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.699
 see you soon
