so if you have to run this TNT minecart

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.999 
so if you have to run this TNT minecart
over<00:02:07.810> this<00:02:07.990> it's<00:02:08.290> not<00:02:08.470> going<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.679> do<00:02:08.799> anything

minecraft<00:02:13.090> for<00:02:13.270> me<00:02:13.420> is<00:02:13.569> specifically<00:02:14.110> used<00:02:14.230> to

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
minecraft for me is specifically used to

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.790 
minecraft for me is specifically used to
like<00:02:14.830> some<00:02:15.069> mini<00:02:15.280> game

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
like some mini game

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.680 
like some mini game
it's<00:02:16.010> used<00:02:16.310> for<00:02:16.460> troll<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:16.940> your<00:02:17.090> friends<00:02:17.600> and

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
it's used for troll and your friends and

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.200 
it's used for troll and your friends and
in<00:02:17.930> fact<00:02:18.140> i<00:02:18.380> believe<00:02:18.680> on<00:02:18.890> pc<00:02:19.310> if<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:19.850> shoot<00:02:20.030> an

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
in fact i believe on pc if you shoot an

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.210 
in fact i believe on pc if you shoot an
arrow<00:02:20.360> at<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.840> will<00:02:20.990> explode<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:21.890> hopefully

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
arrow at it it will explode so hopefully

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.500 
arrow at it it will explode so hopefully
that<00:02:22.340> will<00:02:22.430> be<00:02:22.580> coming<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.910> console<00:02:23.180> edition

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
that will be coming to console edition

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.230 
that will be coming to console edition
as<00:02:23.660> well<00:02:24.040> exactly<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.190> same<00:02:25.430> with<00:02:25.880> this<00:02:26.180> one

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
as well exactly the same with this one

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.210 
as well exactly the same with this one
which<00:02:26.660> is<00:02:26.840> obviously<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.200> detector<00:02:27.650> rail<00:02:27.830> you

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
which is obviously the detector rail you

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.740 
which is obviously the detector rail you
run<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.490> over<00:02:28.550> it<00:02:28.820> nothing's<00:02:29.450> going<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.690> happen

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
run it over it nothing's going to happen

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.570 
run it over it nothing's going to happen
it's<00:02:30.170> not<00:02:30.260> going<00:02:30.380> to<00:02:30.500> blow<00:02:30.560> up<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:30.800> TMT<00:02:31.100> and

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
it's not going to blow up the TMT and

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.190 
it's not going to blow up the TMT and
obviously<00:02:31.790> with<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.090> normal<00:02:32.360> rails<00:02:32.540> it's<00:02:33.050> not

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
obviously with the normal rails it's not

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.180 
obviously with the normal rails it's not
going<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.380> happen<00:02:33.500> because<00:02:33.710> you<00:02:34.010> know

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
going to happen because you know

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.740 
going to happen because you know
obviously<00:02:34.370> nowhere<00:02:34.940> else<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.210> an<00:02:35.270> activatable

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
obviously nowhere else to an activatable

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.750 
obviously nowhere else to an activatable
wow<00:02:36.020> something<00:02:36.890> different<00:02:37.280> such<00:02:37.460> as<00:02:37.640> the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
wow something different such as the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.750 
wow something different such as the
activator<00:02:38.240> round<00:02:38.540> if<00:02:39.380> you<00:02:39.620> run<00:02:39.860> at<00:02:40.040> tnt<00:02:40.490> on<00:02:40.520> it

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
activator round if you run at tnt on it

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.700 
activator round if you run at tnt on it
it<00:02:40.970> will<00:02:41.180> explode<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.140> basically<00:02:42.590> the

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
it will explode so basically the

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.340 
it will explode so basically the
activator<00:02:43.160> rail<00:02:43.400> activates<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.180> tnt<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:45.290> the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
activator rail activates the tnt and the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.620 
activator rail activates the tnt and the
cool<00:02:45.620> thing<00:02:45.650> about<00:02:45.920> this<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.610> where<00:02:47.270> it<00:02:47.360> does

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
cool thing about this is where it does

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.450 
cool thing about this is where it does
explode<00:02:48.260> as<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:48.770> can<00:02:48.890> see<00:02:49.040> explodes

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
explode as you can see explodes

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.520 
explode as you can see explodes
absolutely<00:02:49.880> everything<00:02:50.150> there<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.870> doesn't

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
absolutely everything there it doesn't

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.710 
absolutely everything there it doesn't
destroy<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.430> activator<00:02:52.940> rail<00:02:53.210> or<00:02:53.450> what<00:02:53.600> it's

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
destroy the activator rail or what it's

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.870 
destroy the activator rail or what it's
attached<00:02:54.080> to<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.500> just<00:02:54.710> explodes<00:02:55.280> absolutely

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
attached to it just explodes absolutely

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.220 
attached to it just explodes absolutely
everything<00:02:56.120> around<00:02:56.630> it<00:02:56.870> now<00:02:56.960> I'm<00:02:57.020> going<00:02:57.170> to
