00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.250
To ask why we fight …

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.450
… is to ask why the leaves fall.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.300
It is in their nature.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.000
Perhaps … there is a better question.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.150
[grumble]

00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:36.100
[smile]

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.470
Why do we fight? …

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.300
… To protect home …

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.330
… and family …

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.050
… To preserve balance …

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.300
… and bring harmony.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.200
For my kind … the true question is …

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.200
… what is worth fighting for?
