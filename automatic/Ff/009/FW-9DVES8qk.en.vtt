00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
of products but because I've heard so

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.690

much<00:02:09.750> about<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.500> figured<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.099> just<00:02:11.310> should

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
much about it I figured I just should

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.820 
much about it I figured I just should
try<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.810> see<00:02:13.050> if<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.349> actually<00:02:13.380> works

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
try it and just see if it actually works

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.970
