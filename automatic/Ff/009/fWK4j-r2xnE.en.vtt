 Art science 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:10.839
 Slide 1 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:12.519
 Of course, the joy of joy 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:13.489
 now allowed 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:15.539
 almost two years 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.130
 it is really large-scale 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.920
 Project 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.179
 I demand 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.249
 interdisciplinary 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.319
 he has completed two years 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.919
 Ralf Bochert returned 7 Foundation 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.879
 the cooperation with the 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.879
 October to go to the covenant is unforgotten 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.160
 Cooperation with the Körber Foundation 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.150
 previously by 1 20 percent 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.060
 Dollinger is as goal on Cuba 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.240
 as a result he is this fascinating exhibition 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.729
 not really 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:55.729
 the complex has been overcome 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.159
 really want to represent 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:00:59.050
 and the federal government 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.360
 through the centuries 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.710
 Violent acts as it has changed 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.050
 a few weeks ago 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.090
 Honoring the term from 1 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.290
 is characterized 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.280
 Of course, this is not Christianity 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.550
 but also she is the only one in the 2 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.400
 for themselves 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.930
 to present a first draft 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.160
 of miracles, of course 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.159
 certainly 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.860
 in the past but also in the present 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.649
 Returning green, the materialistic 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.840
 Max Weber and Deutz 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.250
 the club has 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.820
 and still pleased 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.170
 and that is the 1 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.170
 Verity is a contract yesterday 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.590
 in an interrogation 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.609
 said that in the twentieth century will be 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:41.010
 Canonization instead 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.390
 we were on the 18th 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.950
 Although RWE rejected a city Cologne took place as the one in a 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.300
 Century 4 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.940
 from practice 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.940
 Art is an important topic 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.390
 is interested Veith 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.409
 per 1 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.620
 surprising synergy effect the weight 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.060
 the works of art 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.900
 as this is 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.129
 she keeps asking her question almost always 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.219
 where from 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.319
 and the rain tires 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.599
 but it was more pointed 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.199
 Economists could expect only after another corner 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.869
 it gives materialization to those who still believe in ghosts 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.449
 also playfully tables all sit 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:26.749
 90th century 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:28.119
 the combination 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:30.339
 with the spirits 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.499
 and this connection 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:34.079
 you realize that tech 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.569
 Thomas Schüttes say goodbye 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.419
 The Bruins are now held from August 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:41.449
 so this 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.019
 Connection here goes even further 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.919
 Berlin 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.639
 60 and accept the love 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:49.679
 so to speak 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:51.509
 the warmly the 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:52.810
 of contemporary art 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.719
 that this exhibition 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.789
 Of course, first of all a catch-up game 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:58.469
 Wunderlist and 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.199
 Best Swiss I was still saying a lot but it is also an exhibition 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:04.969
 tried people 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.029
 for contemporary art 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:08.489
 Art in general 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.409
 Processes is here 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.620
 to inspire the usually touching and fascinating 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.620
 Do not worry too much, this is a task 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.959
 Education goes 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.979
 Here the discipline Stenson soften to this effect 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:26.979
 that people are the adults to the natural sciences 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:32.069
 Percent of the trade go to the museum where he hangs artworks everywhere 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.629
 The art has a lot to say about questions of science and technology 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.849
 However, you have to learn a bit of sight in this way 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.660
 Newspaper 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.039
 this exhibition 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:47.739
 named Honor is an exhibition about the borders have in the shop Action and Eat 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.009
 if you say so APA 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:54.759
 In order to avoid upper limits are not to look for topographic abroad and also in the 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.449
 inner of the braked 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.989
 Pröll's money is gone as systematic 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.399
 this means 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:02.049
 the West had 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.760
 inevitably not about this form until today, rationality Bank does not always have 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.849
 the same 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.309
 you can even say 

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:12.730
 that what we today are strong for rationally sustained 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.969
 that from a discussion of the late Middle Ages 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:17.439
 around the Budendorf 

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:19.229
 and if we say today 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.129
 here is scientific thinking too that believe a solution that one solution 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:26.120
 To have a company but that is what you want 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.550
 at the Lower Saxony 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.629
 was actually apart 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:32.689
 with these questions expressed so developed 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:33.919
 that is science 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.919
 Technology supervised 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.680
 if you look at the history of the moon, you can 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.740
 the wonder 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.630
 Ships is a leader in the divorce of something that is not in it 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.039
 existing worldview fits in 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.759
 and that goes for both religions and science 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.919
 as well as for art 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.940
 if one is this motive of opening on a party-day religion so 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.229
 That is allright 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.939
 is the legend Tuesday to the opening 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:05.080
 anyway 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.110
 Torrichter accompanied in the beyond, paradise lurks the best role 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.310
 the sudden 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.259
 where religion organizes the church 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.710
 the ratio of the website of the other side world 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.530
 b and wonder that during the day are likely to board big moments 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.009
 Propose to be a hint where the government 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.009
 the sign on it 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.469
 Gloor should need 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:33.939
 Scientists go 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:37.039
 she tries to rationalize everything, writes Kaufmann 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.020
 first thoughts have little to do at the same time a rational must percent 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.930
 the total is Wolf Bear and have nothing more to do 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.810
 Scientific research depends on it again and again 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:49.979
 moments 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.479
 is now available and sure Alps where to date an innovation a piece 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.930
 less planned 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.499
 but on it 

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:00.969
 possibly giving new direction over decades and into living together 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:02.629
 on this planet 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:03.930
 considering on the 4th 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.469
 the problems that exist 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:07.009
 maybe with new hopes 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.050
 young people who do not provide ground 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.770
 There are also problems 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.770
 and the art finally 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:19.449
 but first you do not want to rest 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:24.199
 to give the dwelling block an adequate means to the Christian miracle 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:30.270
 different roles Swiss pictures of our urban wildcat strike 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.270
 are in the region quarrels between Catholics and Protestants 

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:36.309
 Twitter is not clear 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:39.860
 nacamar involvement of art and artists as we know it today 

00:06:39.859 --> 00:06:43.839
 come the works of art that you see here and this is about 

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:45.559
 recorded a few weeks ago 

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:47.869
 next to Steinbrück Contemporary Art 

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:49.460
 SID all that Sams 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.770
 consequences 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.219
 so release of 

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:53.249
 and art 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:55.189
 im at the art festival 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:56.539
 the Bund 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:58.580
 it argues that knowledge arises 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.610
 the conventional Switzerland 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.349
 Kiel also allowed her workers to give shape to this opening 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:06.849
 to keep it open 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:09.099
 and make new suggestions 

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:10.279
 What 

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:12.590
 he is at problems and issues 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.639
 important in this world are rare 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:16.229
 entertaining 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:18.580
 very politically very critical 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.990
 or just fun in the case of test subjects had signal with the help of a 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.990
 New Year's Eve rocket champion shoots off 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:31.669
 every athlete in sight like many of the 4 2 won we know of course quite 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:33.849
 trigger other associations 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:35.819
 art, in a certain way 

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:37.810
 he cast doubt on instances 

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.119
 for him, that is the most work 

00:07:40.119 --> 00:07:41.990
 to open the reserves 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.840
 to obtain
