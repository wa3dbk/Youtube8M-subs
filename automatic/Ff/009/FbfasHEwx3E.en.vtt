ridiculous levels of performance they

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.170 
ridiculous levels of performance they
called<00:00:24.930> them<00:00:25.050> hyper<00:00:25.260> bikes<00:00:25.670> and<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:26.760> 2012

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
called them hyper bikes and in 2012

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.450 
called them hyper bikes and in 2012
Kawasaki<00:00:28.019> has<00:00:28.140> given<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.470> bike<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> serious

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
update to make sure it remains the bike

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.770 
update to make sure it remains the bike
to<00:00:31.920> beat<00:00:32.130> but<00:00:32.790> you'd<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> bit<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.690> a

ZX Fundy to really notice the difference
just<00:00:36.630> from<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> visuals<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:38.960> zx-14r<00:00:39.960> is

just from the visuals the zx-14r is

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.549 
just from the visuals the zx-14r is
undoubtedly<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.399> big<00:00:41.670> bike<00:00:41.940> long<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.020> low<00:00:43.260> like

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
undoubtedly a big bike long and low like

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.799 
undoubtedly a big bike long and low like
a<00:00:43.590> thoroughbred<00:00:44.129> drag<00:00:44.610> racer<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.210> from<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
a thoroughbred drag racer and from the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.510 
a thoroughbred drag racer and from the
side<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.170> silhouette<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.739> very<00:00:47.070> much<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
side the silhouette is very much the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.330 
side the silhouette is very much the
same<00:00:47.700> as<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.030> always<00:00:48.090> has<00:00:48.480> been<00:00:49.039> from<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.070> rear

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
same as it always has been from the rear

the view also remains largely unchanged
as<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.059> should<00:00:54.270> because<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.750> riding<00:00:55.050> position

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
as it should because the riding position

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.439 
as it should because the riding position
retains<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.890> same<00:00:56.070> proportions<00:00:56.670> which<00:00:57.149> means

retains the same proportions which means

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.260 
retains the same proportions which means
it<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.629> roomy<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.230> comfortable<00:00:59.000> perhaps<00:01:00.000> the
