reason the mug show's been away for a
few<00:00:16.230> weeks<00:00:16.410> was<00:00:16.680> because<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.010> needed<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.340> break<00:00:17.369> I

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
few weeks was because I needed a break I

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.580 
few weeks was because I needed a break I
was<00:00:17.910> getting<00:00:18.150> really<00:00:18.449> burn<00:00:18.840> out<00:00:19.050> from<00:00:19.260> doing

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
was getting really burn out from doing

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.740 
was getting really burn out from doing
it<00:00:19.710> every<00:00:20.039> single<00:00:20.369> week<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.330> was<00:00:21.510> going

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
it every single week and I was going

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.779 
it every single week and I was going
through<00:00:21.840> way<00:00:22.439> too<00:00:22.470> many<00:00:22.980> mugs<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.550> should

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
through way too many mugs and I should

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.210 
through way too many mugs and I should
have<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:25.050> show<00:00:25.260> sometimes<00:00:25.710> went<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.099> like

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
have the show sometimes went on to like

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.310 
have the show sometimes went on to like
five<00:00:26.580> hours<00:00:26.609> or<00:00:27.090> something<00:00:27.300> which<00:00:27.599> hurts<00:00:28.140> my

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
five hours or something which hurts my

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.290 
five hours or something which hurts my
 brain<00:00:28.949> looking<00:00:29.640> at<00:00:29.760> mug<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:30.119> five

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
 brain looking at mug for five

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.089 
 brain looking at mug for five
hours<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:31.289> what<00:00:31.410> we're<00:00:31.529> gonna<00:00:31.619> do<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
hours so what we're gonna do in the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.639 
hours so what we're gonna do in the
future<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.759> my<00:00:33.030> mug<00:00:33.239> show<00:00:33.480> anyway<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.050> we'll

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
future for my mug show anyway is we'll

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.560 
future for my mug show anyway is we'll
probably<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:34.980> look<00:00:35.250> at<00:00:35.370> 150<00:00:36.210> mugs<00:00:36.420> as

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
probably just look at 150 mugs as

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.840 
probably just look at 150 mugs as
opposed<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.079> 500<00:00:37.890> which<00:00:38.070> we<00:00:38.219> looked<00:00:38.370> at<00:00:38.520> some

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
opposed to 500 which we looked at some

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.090 
opposed to 500 which we looked at some
times<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.420> we'll<00:00:40.200> probably<00:00:40.410> call<00:00:40.680> after

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
times and we'll probably call after

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.100 
times and we'll probably call after
about<00:00:41.280> two<00:00:41.550> hours<00:00:41.579> or<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.090> cos<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.930> probably

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
about two hours or so cos I can probably

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.410 
about two hours or so cos I can probably
handle<00:00:43.379> two<00:00:43.710> hours<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.820> anything<00:00:45.210> longer

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
handle two hours but anything longer

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.540 
handle two hours but anything longer
than<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.840> my<00:00:46.079> brain<00:00:46.379> starts<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.860> fry<00:00:47.190> so

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
than that and my brain starts to fry so

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.190 
than that and my brain starts to fry so
basically<00:00:48.360> what<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.539> want<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:49.140> a
