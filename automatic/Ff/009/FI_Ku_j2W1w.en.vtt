00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
football place where this way we're

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.980 
football place where this way we're
really<00:01:22.860> jealous<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.820> lifestyle<00:01:24.390> yeah<00:01:24.689> I

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
think if I was a hockey player in Sweden

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.600 
think if I was a hockey player in Sweden
I'd<00:01:27.330> probably<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:28.500> blonde<00:01:28.740> hair<00:01:28.829> be<00:01:29.280> less<00:01:29.460> of

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
I'd probably have blonde hair be less of

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.550 
I'd probably have blonde hair be less of
a<00:01:29.700> belly<00:01:30.020> Navia<00:01:31.110> every<00:01:31.560> night<00:01:31.740> VRT<00:01:32.549> eNOS<00:01:33.270> wins

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
club farming we've got kind of get

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.580 
club farming we've got kind of get
partial<00:01:38.640> factor<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.390> could<00:01:39.720> be<00:01:39.900> grand<00:01:40.200> but

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
partial factor it could be grand but

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.990 
partial factor it could be grand but
we've<00:01:41.040> actually<00:01:41.220> got<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.549> be<00:01:41.610> better<00:01:41.820> at

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
