00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.710 
those training videos you've tried in
the<00:01:52.430> past<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:52.970> how<00:01:53.060> they<00:01:53.180> probably<00:01:53.420> didn't

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
the past and how they probably didn't

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.430

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
and that's because they show and explain

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.270 
and that's because they show and explain
things<00:01:57.110> that<00:01:57.260> you<00:01:57.470> don't<00:01:57.590> actually<00:01:57.800> do<00:01:58.130> at
