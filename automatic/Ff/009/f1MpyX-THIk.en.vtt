the<00:00:54.030> EMP<00:00:54.300> grenade<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.809> because<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.410> lot<00:00:56.010> of

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
the EMP grenade is because a lot of

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.439 
the EMP grenade is because a lot of
people<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.430> run<00:00:56.640> sentry<00:00:57.000> guns<00:00:57.210> and

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
things like that so you sort of don't

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.340 
things like that so you sort of don't
want<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.149> change<00:01:00.359> classes<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.170> get

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
want to have to change classes to get

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.439 
want to have to change classes to get
you<00:01:01.590> get<00:01:02.010> your<00:01:02.129> EMP<00:01:02.340> grenade<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.879> always<00:01:03.149> run

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
you get your EMP grenade so I always run

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.289 
you get your EMP grenade so I always run
an<00:01:03.570> EMP<00:01:03.899> grenade<00:01:04.260> dead<00:01:05.159> silence<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> must<00:01:06.060> I

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
an EMP grenade dead silence is a must I

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.580 
an EMP grenade dead silence is a must I
think<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.780> awareness<00:01:07.170> if<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.439> wear<00:01:07.560> a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
think and awareness if you wear a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.130 
think and awareness if you wear a
headset<00:01:08.010> flak<00:01:08.939> jacket<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:09.390> well<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.659> you're<00:01:10.049> on

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
headset flak jacket as well if you're on

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.240 
headset flak jacket as well if you're on
the<00:01:10.170> hardpoint<00:01:10.650> or<00:01:10.799> things<00:01:10.950> like<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.130> you

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
the hardpoint or things like that you

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.679 
the hardpoint or things like that you
don't<00:01:11.340> want<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.820> die<00:01:11.970> from<00:01:12.119> grenades<00:01:12.540> at

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
don't want to die from grenades at

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.359 
don't want to die from grenades at
people<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.140> throwing<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.710> that's

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
people going to be throwing so that's

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.070 
people going to be throwing so that's
why<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.640> see<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.939> don't<00:01:15.210> really<00:01:15.360> run<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.630> lethal

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
why you see I don't really run a lethal

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.870 
why you see I don't really run a lethal
because<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.619> figure<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.460> people<00:01:17.729> are<00:01:17.790> going

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
because I figure that people are going

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.690 
because I figure that people are going
to<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.030> running<00:01:18.500> flak<00:01:19.500> jacket<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.549> they're

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
to be running flak jacket and if they're

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.980 
to be running flak jacket and if they're
not<00:01:20.790> running<00:01:20.939> flak<00:01:21.270> jacket<00:01:21.600> their<00:01:21.720> silly

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
not running flak jacket their silly

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.810 
not running flak jacket their silly
because<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.710> if<00:01:22.979> you're<00:01:23.100> playing<00:01:23.280> objective

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
because it's if you're playing objective

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.130 
because it's if you're playing objective
you<00:01:23.909> will<00:01:24.060> be<00:01:24.180> doing<00:01:24.299> from<00:01:24.509> grenades<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.110> I

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
you will be doing from grenades so I

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.630 
you will be doing from grenades so I
don't<00:01:25.500> run<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> grenade<00:01:25.979> because<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.310> figure

all<00:03:03.040> similar<00:03:03.310> very<00:03:03.760> similar<00:03:03.819> classes<00:03:04.389> guys

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
all similar very similar classes guys

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.059 
all similar very similar classes guys
but<00:03:04.930> I<00:03:04.989> really<00:03:05.260> do<00:03:05.379> think<00:03:05.560> these<00:03:05.739> are<00:03:05.829> the<00:03:05.889> ones

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
but I really do think these are the ones

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.080 
but I really do think these are the ones
that<00:03:06.129> you<00:03:06.310> want<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.519> use<00:03:06.700> if<00:03:06.819> you're<00:03:06.879> going<00:03:07.030> to

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
that you want to use if you're going to

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.089 
that you want to use if you're going to
