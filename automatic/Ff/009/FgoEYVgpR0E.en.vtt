 nobody lets me go 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:39.360

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.309
 every year from the other courts for 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.320

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.800
 yes in the descent I went very 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.840
 quick 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.180
 incredible the incredible descent the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.550
 position the position you have that 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.920
 it's working what's it 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:11.939
 comes from skiing that comes from where no no that 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:15.630
 I had me a position more 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.750
 ergonomic bike we go faster on 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.369
 nature to acquire greece have 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.070
 done but in this position and then we 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.630
 goes down just tinkoff comes from 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.890
 tell us your boss that you were 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.670
 probably one of the best runners 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.470
 of the world 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.470
 it's rather reassuring for the future 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:41.159
 for the future credit but I have faith 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.259
 in myself I'm not in the process of 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.120
 win because everyone thinks I 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.060
 am the best 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.870
 in the break everyone close me 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.140
 the door because they do not want to lose 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:58.410
 so it's difficult but I come 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.180
 to be in front and I want to win is sure 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.950
 also it is that the public loves you 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.600
 because the applause that took 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.770
 just now there are few runners 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.580
 on the turn who have these applause 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:19.260
 and his fans who are there without death of 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:21.420

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.740

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.740
 will get it on the battery
