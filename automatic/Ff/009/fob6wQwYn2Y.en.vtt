00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
is that if you use the smaller pieces

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.570 
is that if you use the smaller pieces
you<00:00:53.180> form<00:00:53.480> smaller<00:00:53.870> balls<00:00:54.740> that<00:00:55.190> they're<00:00:55.460> able

candy-making dipping chocolate because

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.039 
candy-making dipping chocolate because
it<00:02:49.859> turns<00:02:50.549> out<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.000> nice<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.569> don't<00:02:51.750> have<00:02:51.900> to

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
it turns out so nice you don't have to

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.229 
it turns out so nice you don't have to
mix<00:02:52.260> anything<00:02:52.590> with<00:02:52.829> it<00:02:53.069> it's<00:02:53.370> ready<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:54.030> go

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
mix anything with it it's ready to go

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.339 
mix anything with it it's ready to go
for<00:02:54.569> you<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:56.280> has<00:02:56.519> kind<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.389> that<00:02:57.599> crunchy

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
for you and it has kind of that crunchy

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.069 
for you and it has kind of that crunchy
coating<00:02:58.650> shell<00:02:59.220> is<00:03:00.060> what<00:03:00.359> it<00:03:00.480> forms<00:03:00.840> on<00:03:00.989> the

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
coating shell is what it forms on the

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:07.929 
coating shell is what it forms on the
outside<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:05.389> you<00:03:06.389> can<00:03:06.569> use<00:03:06.750> white<00:03:07.049> chocolate

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
outside and you can use white chocolate

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.349 
outside and you can use white chocolate
dark<00:03:08.939> chocolate<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.780> can<00:03:09.810> drizzle<00:03:11.359> several

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
dark chocolate you can drizzle several

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:18.440 
dark chocolate you can drizzle several
different<00:03:12.689> toppings<00:03:13.139> on<00:03:13.379> top<00:03:16.609> we<00:03:17.609> like<00:03:17.879> to<00:03:18.120> use

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
different toppings on top we like to use

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.420 
different toppings on top we like to use
and<00:03:18.810> i<00:03:18.959> usually<00:03:19.109> don't<00:03:19.470> wait<00:03:19.680> too<00:03:19.919> long<00:03:20.099> to<00:03:20.159> do

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
and i usually don't wait too long to do

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.009 
and i usually don't wait too long to do
this<00:03:20.579> because<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:21.060> chocolate<00:03:21.480> starts<00:03:21.750> to

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
this because the chocolate starts to

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.339 
this because the chocolate starts to
harden<00:03:22.169> and<00:03:22.639> if<00:03:23.639> you<00:03:24.389> wait<00:03:24.599> too<00:03:24.810> long<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.049> put

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
harden and if you wait too long to put

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:26.539 
harden and if you wait too long to put
some<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.590> your<00:03:25.620> toppings<00:03:26.099> on<00:03:26.220> they<00:03:26.340> won't

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
some of your toppings on they won't

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.009 
some of your toppings on they won't
stick<00:03:26.879> so<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.150> need<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.450> do<00:03:27.599> it<00:03:27.720> while<00:03:27.900> the

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
stick so you need to do it while the

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.159 
stick so you need to do it while the
chocolate<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.590> still<00:03:28.799> soft<00:03:29.389> so<00:03:30.389> what<00:03:30.569> I<00:03:30.599> do<00:03:30.750> is

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
chocolate is still soft so what I do is

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.879 
chocolate is still soft so what I do is
I<00:03:31.949> take<00:03:32.129> the<00:03:32.280> non-pro<00:03:32.699> reels<00:03:32.909> and<00:03:33.739> while<00:03:34.739> my

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
I take the non-pro reels and while my

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.069 
I take the non-pro reels and while my
chocolate<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.430> still<00:03:35.669> soft<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:36.299> just<00:03:36.840> do<00:03:37.049> a

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
chocolate is still soft I just do a

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:45.099 
chocolate is still soft I just do a
couple<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.500> sprinkles<00:03:37.739> on<00:03:38.669> top<00:03:38.729> of<00:03:39.299> each<00:03:39.419> one

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.930 

once<00:03:46.109> you<00:03:46.409> have<00:03:46.650> all<00:03:46.680> these<00:03:47.129> done<00:03:47.430> you'll<00:03:47.699> want

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
once you have all these done you'll want

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.849 
once you have all these done you'll want
to<00:03:48.000> refrigerate<00:03:48.690> them<00:03:48.870> again<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.739> the

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859

chocolate will completely hardened and
you<00:03:52.650> can<00:03:52.829> peel<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.159> right<00:03:53.190> off<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.549> this<00:03:53.909> tray

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
you can peel it right off of this tray

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:58.939 
you can peel it right off of this tray
off<00:03:54.659> of<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:55.019> wax<00:03:55.260> paper<00:03:55.699> and<00:03:56.900> put<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.079> onto<00:03:58.409> a
