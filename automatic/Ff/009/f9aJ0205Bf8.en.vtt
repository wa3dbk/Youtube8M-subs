earth what the hell happened on this
game<00:02:05.000> honestly<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:10.070> probably<00:02:11.070> one<00:02:11.430> of

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
game honestly that is probably one of

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.040 
game honestly that is probably one of
the<00:02:11.700> weirdest<00:02:12.300> kind<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.780> endings<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.690> game

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
the weirdest kind of endings to a game

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.690 
the weirdest kind of endings to a game
I've<00:02:16.380> actually<00:02:21.290> game<00:02:22.290> designed<00:02:22.860> by<00:02:23.190> there<00:02:23.580> is

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
I've actually game designed by there is

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.570 
I've actually game designed by there is
no<00:02:23.940> accounting<00:02:24.630> for<00:02:24.660> tastes<00:02:25.440> right

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.390 

how

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
how

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.380 
how
but<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:35.950> honestly<00:02:36.950> do<00:02:37.519> not<00:02:37.549> get<00:02:37.909> that<00:02:38.060> folks

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
but I honestly do not get that folks

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.360 
but I honestly do not get that folks
that<00:02:39.079> was<00:02:39.290> certainly<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.980> strange<00:02:40.549> ending<00:02:40.970> I

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
that was certainly a strange ending I

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.190 
that was certainly a strange ending I
selected<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.549> I<00:02:43.610> didn't<00:02:43.909> want<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.090> join<00:02:44.510> him

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
selected that I didn't want to join him

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:57.800 
selected that I didn't want to join him
and<00:02:45.439> I<00:02:45.709> want<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.099> to<00:02:49.780> well<00:02:50.780> folks

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.750 

that's<00:02:58.810> certainly<00:02:59.560> interesting<00:02:59.710> to<00:03:00.580> say<00:03:00.730> the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
that's certainly interesting to say the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.870 
that's certainly interesting to say the
least<00:03:04.770> that's<00:03:05.770> not<00:03:06.160> something<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.790> I've

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
least that's not something that I've

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.490 
least that's not something that I've
seen<00:03:07.180> before<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:09.160> do<00:03:09.940> remember<00:03:10.660> I've<00:03:10.959> got<00:03:11.290> that

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
seen before I do remember I've got that

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.620 
seen before I do remember I've got that
file<00:03:11.770> icon<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.400> original<00:03:12.790> game<00:03:12.819> but<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.360> don't
