supergnes<00:00:17.990> Singh<00:00:18.140> software<00:00:18.910> and<00:00:19.910> they<00:00:19.999> got<00:00:20.150> a

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:20.179 
supergnes Singh software and they got a

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:21.220 
supergnes Singh software and they got a
midi<00:00:20.329> control<00:00:20.689> here<00:00:20.869> we're<00:00:20.960> just<00:00:20.990> going<00:00:21.199> to

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
midi control here we're just going to

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.859 
midi control here we're just going to
get<00:00:21.320> a<00:00:21.380> quick<00:00:21.529> demo<00:00:22.060> from<00:00:23.060> intermix<00:00:23.449> of<00:00:23.689> this

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
get a quick demo from intermix of this

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.259 
get a quick demo from intermix of this
so<00:00:24.169> maybe<00:00:24.800> you<00:00:25.009> could<00:00:25.159> just<00:00:25.189> quickly<00:00:25.789> run<00:00:25.909> over

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
so maybe you could just quickly run over

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.950 
so maybe you could just quickly run over
it<00:00:26.359> and<00:00:26.480> we'll<00:00:26.599> learn<00:00:26.749> this<00:00:27.679> is<00:00:27.829> um<00:00:28.599> the<00:00:29.599> drum

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
it and we'll learn this is um the drum

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.509 
it and we'll learn this is um the drum
sequencer<00:00:30.199> right<00:00:30.710> here<00:00:30.859> we'll<00:00:31.009> pull<00:00:31.159> up<00:00:31.279> the

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 
sequencer right here we'll pull up the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.820 
sequencer right here we'll pull up the
pads<00:00:31.759> you<00:00:31.970> can<00:00:31.999> actually<00:00:32.329> turn<00:00:32.540> around<00:00:35.830> right

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
pads you can actually turn around right

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.630 
pads you can actually turn around right
we<00:00:37.100> can<00:00:37.250> actually<00:00:37.580> pull<00:00:37.850> up<00:00:37.970> a<00:00:38.090> synthesizer<00:00:38.720> to

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
we can actually pull up a synthesizer to

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.400 
we can actually pull up a synthesizer to
and<00:00:40.640> play<00:00:40.970> on<00:00:41.210> it<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:41.840> it's<00:00:41.990> almost<00:00:42.200> like<00:00:42.380> a

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
and play on it so it's almost like a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.670 
and play on it so it's almost like a
loop<00:00:42.590> sequencer<00:00:43.160> right<00:00:43.370> or<00:00:43.640> exactly<00:00:44.600> yeah

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
loop sequencer right or exactly yeah

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.870 
loop sequencer right or exactly yeah
loop<00:00:45.680> sequence<00:00:46.070> we<00:00:46.190> can<00:00:46.400> set<00:00:46.580> it<00:00:46.670> we<00:00:46.730> have<00:00:46.850> a

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
loop sequence we can set it we have a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.700 
loop sequence we can set it we have a
four<00:00:47.150> bar<00:00:47.330> loop<00:00:47.540> set<00:00:47.840> right<00:00:48.020> now<00:00:48.200> all<00:00:48.590> right

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
four bar loop set right now all right

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.310 
four bar loop set right now all right
pull<00:00:49.280> up<00:00:49.370> another<00:00:49.520> synthesizer<00:00:50.270> drag<00:00:51.020> it<00:00:51.170> back

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320

around one kilo so 22 pounds that's a
standard<00:02:40.030> midi<00:02:40.330> controller<00:02:40.810> there<00:02:41.110> which<00:02:41.319> i

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
standard midi controller there which i

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.900 
standard midi controller there which i
guess<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.650> can<00:02:41.800> buy<00:02:41.890> as<00:02:41.950> an<00:02:42.100> accessory<00:02:42.400> for<00:02:42.580> it
