00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.729
 political asylum appeared 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.409
 in general, yes indeed it manifested itself 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.969
 for the first time there eight days before 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.039
 my data from the age of 23 lured in a capsule 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.959
 his model was not surprising either 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.700
 even afraid to imagine where he slept in 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.500
 In this case, because they were looking for him all 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.030
 here are my fellow journalists just 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.769
 already complain that they report 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.750
 Sheremetyevo knows better than its own 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.489
 flat th in the dark then he is sleepy 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.390
 walks to the touch 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.640
 but it is not even allowed to creep in 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.340
 some have already grown up on a cube with 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.440
 us on because all aircraft are torn 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.930

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:38.670
 the journey will agree yes fly 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:42.769
 preparing the project appeared non-core 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.540
 was giving an interview 0 not he wrote a letter 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.530
 to the authorities of ecuador where he thanked for 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.560
 what they 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.850
 further opportunities to fly to Russia 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.480
 why is he not yet 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:59.450

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:01.099
 days no thanks said 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.690
 what to consider will be long Russia 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.879
 too it is necessary to say so coquettish 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.049
 say but we will consider and so long 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:11.420
 Russia thanks yah that's what exactly 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.370
 Khanate that his all the letters and so on 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.890
 some interviews that leak out 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.040
 do not get our Russian journalists 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.760
 colleagues and perhaps even us as 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.849
 then raiter then it means Hong Kong 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.829
 some newspaper and so on so calls 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.530
 I have doubts that it exists 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.470
 but he is like a unicorn. 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.090
 the rater came up with his letter 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.489
 let's throw in the right we, too, that no one 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.269
 we will also think of something 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.400
 basis about what prospects 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.069
 from snowden up to get political 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.720
 asylum in general, judging by the statements 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:53.510
 President of Russia there are prospects 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.079
 get and the only thing that vladimir 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.079
 Putin at a press conference 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.510
 can 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.160
 said that you can in certain 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.160
 now wears 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:15.360
 I'll ask here 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:20.280
 I didn't even look at the time 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:24.000
 it seems still early he ska 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.010
 Vladimir Putin said that snowden 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.360
 can get can stay in russia 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.000
 subject to certain conditions 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.490
 the main condition which is to stop 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.130
 repairing bone is not against american 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.500
 partners, which is even interesting what it means 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.480
 execution can say the eyes of the world opened 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.070
 really opened such an open secret to 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.530
 it seems as if everyone thought that 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.930
 special services are quietly calm and everything is clear there 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.970
 just a pair of completed statement 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.820
 pre- fill a bunch of shit with see 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.850
 like default but not caught either 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.220
 she's not margot alone don't get caught in this 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.800
 case he discovered maybe a secret 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.030
 an open secret but the secret of which is not necessary 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.030
 it was talking so
