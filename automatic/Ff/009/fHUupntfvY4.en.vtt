00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.560 
video in this video we're going to talk
about<00:00:15.440> chord<00:00:15.860> voicings<00:00:16.340> so<00:00:17.300> the<00:00:17.420> whole

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
about chord voicings so the whole

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.230 
about chord voicings so the whole
concept<00:00:17.960> is<00:00:18.110> how<00:00:18.350> we<00:00:18.410> can<00:00:18.740> get<00:00:19.640> away<00:00:19.880> from<00:00:19.939> a

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
concept is how we can get away from a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.690 
concept is how we can get away from a
typical<00:00:20.660> power<00:00:20.840> chord<00:00:21.170> progression<00:00:21.890> and<00:00:22.040> add

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
typical power chord progression and add

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.300 
typical power chord progression and add
replace<00:00:23.450> or<00:00:23.750> change<00:00:24.200> the<00:00:24.380> position<00:00:24.800> of<00:00:24.919> some

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
replace or change the position of some

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.300 
replace or change the position of some
notes<00:00:25.880> in<00:00:26.689> order<00:00:27.050> to<00:00:27.230> make<00:00:27.410> that<00:00:27.619> chord<00:00:27.919> sound

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
notes in order to make that chord sound

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.749 
notes in order to make that chord sound
more<00:00:28.550> interesting<00:00:29.829> so<00:00:30.829> alright<00:00:31.550> now<00:00:31.669> I'm

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
example number one and then I'm going to

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:56.380 
example number one and then I'm going to
explain<00:00:34.370> all<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:34.970> voicings<00:00:35.329> iqs

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.420

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
beginning I used a minor voicing this

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.760 
beginning I used a minor voicing this
one<00:01:05.390> this<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> pretty<00:01:06.810> cool<00:01:07.290> voicing

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
minor voicing again that's a major

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.310 
minor voicing again that's a major

major<00:01:41.160> 7th<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:42.539> works<00:01:42.869> fine<00:01:43.229> when<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.950> use

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
major 7th this works fine when you use

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.370 
major 7th this works fine when you use
that<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.880> sixth<00:01:45.180> degree<00:01:45.300> of<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.990> natural

that in the sixth degree of a natural
minor<00:01:46.649> scale<00:01:49.460> that's<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.729> minor<00:01:51.000> version<00:01:51.240> again

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.330 

that's<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.729> major<00:02:00.000> voicing<00:02:00.660> your<00:02:00.869> note<00:02:01.740> major

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
that's a major voicing your note major

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.760 
that's a major voicing your note major
third<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.569> octave<00:02:03.929> and<00:02:05.270> if<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.420> move<00:02:07.140> my

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
third and the octave and if I move my

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.669 
third and the octave and if I move my
octave<00:02:08.190> one<00:02:08.640> step<00:02:08.970> lower<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:10.110> becomes<00:02:10.470> a

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
octave one step lower it becomes a

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.910 
octave one step lower it becomes a
dominant<00:02:10.950> 7th<00:02:11.550> chord<00:02:11.849> with<00:02:12.720> note<00:02:12.989> major<00:02:13.560> third

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920

dominant 7th chord with note major third
minor<00:02:14.489> seventh<00:02:18.140> well<00:02:19.140> actually<00:02:19.380> in<00:02:19.830> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
minor seventh well actually in the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.280 
minor seventh well actually in the
example<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.370> do<00:02:20.430> this

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
example I do this

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.710 
example I do this
which<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:23.500> my<00:02:23.710> nor<00:02:24.220> been<00:02:24.400> enough<00:02:24.670> nine<00:02:24.970> voicing

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
which is my nor been enough nine voicing

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.370 
which is my nor been enough nine voicing
but<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.260> replaced<00:02:26.680> this<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.460> note<00:02:27.850> with<00:02:28.270> my<00:02:28.480> open

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
but I replaced this a note with my open

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:40.080 
but I replaced this a note with my open
a<00:02:29.410> string<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:38.290> right<00:02:38.680> now<00:02:38.830> I'm<00:02:38.920> gonna<00:02:39.040> play<00:02:39.310> the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
a string so right now I'm gonna play the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:03:06.470 
a string so right now I'm gonna play the
the<00:02:40.120> whole<00:02:40.690> example<00:02:41.020> slower<00:02:41.770> for<00:02:42.040> you

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.080 

you<00:03:06.810> can<00:03:06.990> use<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.350> voicing<00:03:07.830> with<00:03:08.040> your<00:03:08.820> plain

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
you can use this voicing with your plain

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.110 
you can use this voicing with your plain
tone<00:03:09.330> as<00:03:09.540> well<00:03:09.980> so<00:03:10.980> here<00:03:11.190> comes<00:03:11.460> example

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
tone as well so here comes example

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.780 
tone as well so here comes example
number<00:03:12.360> two<00:03:12.890> where<00:03:13.890> I'm<00:03:14.070> gonna<00:03:14.250> show<00:03:14.490> you<00:03:14.550> only

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
number two where I'm gonna show you only

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.940 
number two where I'm gonna show you only
the<00:03:15.210> new<00:03:15.360> voicings<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.930> haven't<00:03:16.260> sown<00:03:16.500> do

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
the new voicings that haven't sown do

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:44.510 
the new voicings that haven't sown do
you<00:03:18.560> until<00:03:19.560> now

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.850 

so<00:03:45.520> in<00:03:45.670> this<00:03:45.760> example<00:03:46.140> let's<00:03:47.140> take<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:47.620> step<00:03:47.830> by

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
so in this example let's take it step by

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.920 
so in this example let's take it step by
step

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.309 

that's<00:03:53.530> my<00:03:53.920> r7<00:03:54.640> voicing<00:03:55.150> how<00:03:55.629> I<00:03:55.659> read<00:03:56.110> note

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
that's my r7 voicing how I read note

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:07.970 
that's my r7 voicing how I read note
here<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.860> felt<00:03:57.610> here<00:03:57.909> in<00:03:57.939> my

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.270 

that's<00:04:08.550> a<00:04:08.730> major<00:04:08.970> seventh<00:04:09.510> voicing<00:04:09.989> I<00:04:10.230> use<00:04:10.620> rib

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
that's a major seventh voicing I use rib

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.150 
that's a major seventh voicing I use rib

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.580 
that's a major washing it's pretty known
Rick<00:04:29.830> node<00:04:30.360> major<00:04:31.360> third

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
Rick node major third

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.640 
Rick node major third
and<00:04:33.100> if<00:04:33.220> I<00:04:33.340> move<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.699> fifth<00:04:33.970> one<00:04:34.479> step<00:04:35.050> higher

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
and if I move the fifth one step higher

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:42.680 
and if I move the fifth one step higher
it<00:04:35.830> becomes<00:04:36.250> s<00:04:36.580> sixth<00:04:39.630> major<00:04:40.630> third<00:04:41.020> major<00:04:41.500> six

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
it becomes s sixth major third major six

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.260 
it becomes s sixth major third major six
and<00:04:43.690> that's<00:04:44.349> a<00:04:44.470> minor<00:04:44.650> voicing<00:04:45.030> root<00:04:46.030> node

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
and that's a minor voicing root node

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.719 
and that's a minor voicing root node
minor<00:04:46.840> third<00:04:49.349> so<00:04:50.349> that<00:04:50.889> was<00:04:51.039> all<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.310> voicings

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
minor third so that was all the voicings

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.839 
minor third so that was all the voicings
