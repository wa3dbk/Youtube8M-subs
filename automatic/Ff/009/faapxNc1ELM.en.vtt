race<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.600> more<00:00:48.840> technologically<00:00:49.559> advanced

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
race is more technologically advanced

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.010 
race is more technologically advanced
and<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.610> going<00:00:50.789> through<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.090> years<00:00:51.300> talking

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
and it's going through the years talking

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.270 
and it's going through the years talking
about<00:00:52.110> all<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.620> breakthroughs<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.100> have

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
about all of the breakthroughs that have

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.010 
about all of the breakthroughs that have
come<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.910> then<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.449> goes<00:00:54.600> ahead<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.870> goes

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
come and then it goes ahead and goes

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.000 
come and then it goes ahead and goes
into<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.379> future<00:00:55.649> two<00:00:56.309> years<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.180> 20<00:00:57.600> 20<00:00:57.960> 20<00:00:58.379> 45

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
into the future two years of 20 20 20 45

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.580 
into the future two years of 20 20 20 45
2060<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.989> years<00:01:01.230> into<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> future

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
2060 and so on so years into the future

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.310 
2060 and so on so years into the future
and<00:01:02.070> they<00:01:02.489> explain<00:01:03.000> how<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:03.930> create<00:01:04.199> new

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
and they explain how as we create new

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.500 
and they explain how as we create new
technology<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.460> eventually<00:01:05.729> becomes<00:01:06.210> so

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
technology it eventually becomes so

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.660 
technology it eventually becomes so
complex<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.229> advanced<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.520> could

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
complex so advanced that it could

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.090 
complex so advanced that it could
potentially<00:01:08.760> destroy<00:01:09.360> us<00:01:09.750> now<00:01:10.680> guys<00:01:10.860> I

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
potentially destroy us now guys I

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.740 
potentially destroy us now guys I
actually<00:01:11.280> made<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> theory<00:01:12.090> about<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
actually made a theory about this the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.570 
actually made a theory about this the
other<00:01:12.780> day<00:01:12.960> talking<00:01:13.680> about<00:01:14.040> how<00:01:14.250> I'm<00:01:14.369> sure

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
other day talking about how I'm sure

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.859 
other day talking about how I'm sure
that<00:01:14.729> there's<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.210> some<00:01:15.479> giant

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
that there's going to be some giant

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.109 
that there's going to be some giant
corporation<00:01:16.500> or<00:01:16.680> some<00:01:17.430> corporation<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.060> has

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
corporation or some corporation that has

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.609 
corporation or some corporation that has
much<00:01:18.390> more<00:01:18.420> technologically<00:01:19.290> advanced

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
much more technologically advanced

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.649 
much more technologically advanced
equipment<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.700> it'll<00:01:20.970> eventually<00:01:21.210> wipe

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
equipment and that it'll eventually wipe

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.780 
equipment and that it'll eventually wipe
out<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> entire<00:01:21.990> human<00:01:22.350> race<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.670> you'd

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
out the entire human race so if you'd

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.890 
out the entire human race so if you'd
like<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.909> check<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.360> theory<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.659> will

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
like to check out that theory I will

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.969 
like to check out that theory I will

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
below but guys I kind of called this I

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.440 
below but guys I kind of called this I
kind<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.430> assume<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.909> there<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.090> going<00:01:30.270> to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
kind of assume that there was going to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.450 
kind of assume that there was going to
be<00:01:30.479> some<00:01:31.020> future<00:01:31.409> warfare<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.979> was<00:01:32.070> kind<00:01:32.369> of

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
be some future warfare it was kind of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.920 
be some future warfare it was kind of
obvious<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:33.600> under<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> impression

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
obvious and I was under the impression

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.600 
obvious and I was under the impression
that<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.829> was<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.220> be<00:01:35.250> some

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
that there was going to be some

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.190 
that there was going to be some
technology<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.509> would<00:01:36.570> eventually<00:01:36.750> wipe

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
technology that would eventually wipe

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.990 
technology that would eventually wipe
out<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> human<00:01:37.650> race<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.220> from<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> looks<00:01:38.909> of

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
out the human race and from the looks of

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.580 
out the human race and from the looks of
his<00:01:39.150> trailer<00:01:39.420> that's<00:01:39.930> exactly<00:01:40.140> what<00:01:40.530> it

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
his trailer that's exactly what it

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.740 
his trailer that's exactly what it
appears<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.040> be<00:01:41.189> doing<00:01:41.579> now<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.299> thing<00:01:42.420> that

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
appears to be doing now the thing that

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.840 
appears to be doing now the thing that
