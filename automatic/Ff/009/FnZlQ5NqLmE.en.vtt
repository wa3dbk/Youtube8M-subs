let's keep walking down here get the
Intel<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:47.080> stairs<00:02:47.860> if<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:49.390> play<00:02:49.630> this

Intel the stairs if you play this
mission<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.560> probably<00:02:50.950> would<00:02:51.250> have<00:02:51.340> gotten<00:02:51.579> a

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
mission you probably would have gotten a

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.220 
mission you probably would have gotten a
five-star<00:02:52.420> your<00:02:53.260> completion<00:02:54.120> but<00:02:55.120> finest<00:02:55.780> if

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
five-star your completion but finest if

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.860 
five-star your completion but finest if
I'm<00:02:56.410> just<00:02:56.590> gonna<00:02:56.709> do<00:02:56.860> each<00:02:57.040> mission<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:58.420> this

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
I'm just gonna do each mission so this

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.890 
I'm just gonna do each mission so this
one<00:02:59.019> isn't<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.380> hard<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.680> complete<00:03:00.660> just<00:03:01.660> go

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
one isn't that hard to complete just go

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.670 
one isn't that hard to complete just go
left<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.880> tell<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.450> this<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.170> last<00:03:05.200> room

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
left and tell that this is the last room

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.940 
left and tell that this is the last room
this<00:03:06.489> is<00:03:06.670> where<00:03:06.700> most<00:03:06.940> of<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.180> enemies<00:03:07.360> are<00:03:07.950> so

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
this is where most of the enemies are so

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.160 
this is where most of the enemies are so
you<00:03:09.430> can't<00:03:09.640> just<00:03:09.700> want<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.060> take<00:03:10.780> out<00:03:10.959> as<00:03:11.049> many

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
you can't just want to take out as many

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.840 
you can't just want to take out as many
as<00:03:11.349> you<00:03:11.440> can't<00:03:11.650> silently<00:03:13.110> get<00:03:14.110> it<00:03:14.489> I'm<00:03:15.489> trying
