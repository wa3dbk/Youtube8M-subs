00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.949
 Ah lead 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.400
 Let's take a look at the state laws that come out of the bike ride landscape. 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.410
 I'll do it 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:21.140
 I will play the solo line slowly from the intro song for the first time. 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.609
 Now the important implementation is hammering and playoff ending slide 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.010
 Used 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.010
 I'll try to be natural. 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.010
 U 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.570
 For Knitted 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.570
 U 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.829
 U 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.079
 Yes 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.079
 U 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.030
 I'll see you soon. 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.800
 a 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.510
 woo 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.490
 A toal to 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.490
 U 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:25.690
 Next, let's take a look at the partial stroke method of Section 1 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.690
 I 'll grab the g code and try to be genius. 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.350
 g code d code and we will go 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.350
 U 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.360
 I will try to connect slowly to a pattern of two codes in one word. 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.270
 Next code 2 - I'll keep coming back 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.920
 That is my non-flying 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.009
 I'll use this one as a link to the front of the minor. 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:21.120
 Indeed take different room Poodle 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:21.120
 I will connect the codes to the nodes in a minor t. 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.770
 U 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.770
 U 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.060
 love 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.530
 U 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:47.520
 Next, we will play the applied pattern 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:51.870
 Next up, Aina 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:56.760
 Take 7c 20 50 Mr. 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.240
 Who played with the application pattern to pattern my word with eimhayi or d code 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.240
 I'll do it 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.220
 222 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.220
 Oh 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.790
 222 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.790
 on 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.790
 U 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:26.469
 When you actually play a variety of 16p light stroke 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:30.450
 If you mix and play together, it will be a better performance. 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:30.450
 I will finish the blessing explanation above. 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.100
 Ah
