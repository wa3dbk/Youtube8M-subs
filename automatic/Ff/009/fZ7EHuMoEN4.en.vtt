 I did not understand, for some reason it is written: "Advertising". Now check. 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.800
 Courses are open in our city (i.e. in Omsk) 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.300

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.640
 At one of the classes visited 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.240
 our (TRC "Antenna-7") correspondents. 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.580
 It is written in Russian-English: “Omsklife”, i.e. "Omsk life".

 and self-improvement. 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.300
 Our first 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.680
 main steps to success 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.440
 begin at school. 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.200
 For the guys 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.040

 turns out to be decisive. 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.760
 After all, often 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.860
 precisely because of a careless and illegible letter 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.540
 teachers can not put the child 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.060
 high appreciation. 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.680
 Pavel Sedletsky: “We have seven children in our family, 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.320
 and with one of our sons - Roman - 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.320
 there was such a story. 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.340
 He is left handed. 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.680
 He was a good student at school, 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.660
 but in Russian language and literature 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.620
 he always had bad grades 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.360
 for what he wrote poorly. 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.500
 What he wrote with his left hand, 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.400
 he still managed to somehow smear 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.920
 and ended up getting bad grades 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.360
 for the quality of your letter. 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.640
 What he wrote 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.980
 he couldn't even make out himself 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.780
 so it was clumsily everything is written usually. " 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.340
 You imagine: 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.860
 my same as chicken paw 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.980
 wrote earlier 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.020
 and now it's such a beauty! 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.380
 A sight for sore eyes! 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.700
 And we have my brother, remember 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.880
 as he wrote terribly, he writes. 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.220
 I don't know anymore 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.100
 what to do with it. 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.740
 He sometimes his handwriting 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.280
 he can't make out himself ... 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.660

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.320

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.660
 on a neat new letter 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.680
 in just three weeks. 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.360
 Thanks to the existing in Omsk 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.940

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.640
 not only beautiful, but also fast. 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.340
 The path to beautiful handwriting 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.800
 turns into an exciting adventure. 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.340
 The disadvantages of writing students overcome 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.460

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.760

 much higher than the old! 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.920
 In 2010 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.600

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.880

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.100

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.080
 and also became a member 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.240
 competitive program 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.460
 "100 best goods of Russia". 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.820
 Pavel Sedletsky: “The handwriting has changed a lot, radically. 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.840
 And so, when he (ie son Roman) 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.680
 then wrote an essay at school 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.780
 the teacher did not believe that it was him, 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.260
 gave him a bad mark - "two". 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.420
 And when he tried to explain 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.460
 prove that he wrote 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.220
 she didn't believe 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.000
 until he brought workbooks, 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.020
 by which he corrected the handwriting. 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.360
 When the teacher saw 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.460
 then only believed and said 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.660
 that she will be of all her students 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.860
 send to this school (i.e., the Calligrapher). 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.540
 It was 12 years ago, he grew up, 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.860
 studying now at the institute 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.200
 he has a wonderful handwriting. ” 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.960
 Besides the positive changes in handwriting, 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.540
 the character of its owner is changing significantly, 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.520
 increases self-esteem. 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.860
 The guys have a desire 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.280
 strive for more success 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.860
 and achieve the desired 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.940
 they become more assertive 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.620
 and self-confident. 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.360
 This is definitely positive. 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.960
 will affect the fate of the child. 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.720
 In school, such changes 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.760
 cause delight. 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.080
 Teachers do not believe the eyes 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.060
 and classmates are trying to find out 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.520
 where do they learn to write so beautifully. 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.940
 Tatyana Leontyeva: “Beautifully written work 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.860
 expresses respect 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.900
 writing to the reader. 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.860
 Therefore beautifully written works 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.360
 clear handwriting 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.960
 at school are much higher 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.800
 ugly written. 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.180
 A child with a beautiful 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.120
 clear and fast handwriting 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.400
 self-esteem is much higher. " 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.880
 And how did you manage 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.640
 so retrained? 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.440
 They helped us 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.520
 in the center of handwriting correction. 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.560
 By the way, I recommend you to go there. 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.700
 They still have their own website. 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.460
 You can yourself 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.980
 everything is beautiful there to see. 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.040
 How amazing! 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.940
 Come to the center of handwriting correction, 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.980

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.820
 for your child will be a pledge 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.680
 his continued success and victories. 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.660
 It could well be someone's advertising. But now it will be. 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.160
 Here it is necessary to sing along: "In the throes of a new life!" 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.920
 And one more time: “By the way, but life!” 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.220
