00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.569
 hi to all so I'm back on 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.309
 chain 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.000
 it's been quite a while that I have not 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.650
 made videos of concrete tutorials I 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.260
 just middle between last week 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.720
 it's just a little thing like that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.970
 so that was for gesture and the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.800
 back is anything but alexis 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.289
 the internal parts so it's a little 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.789
 hot to see all this is so there 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.260
 today to make up for all that I 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.480
 will make you a unique special trick 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.210
 never done yet on the chain that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.239
 any rider would not have dared 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:43.320
 think i do two tutorial in a video 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.850
 happy so that the tray 580 f 35 181 of 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.480
 basic I spent crying you 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.239
 see the mcs 780 it goes like this 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.610
 then to perceive a little too much of these 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.870
 specimens completely stupid in 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.020
 trying to do month quests 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.020
 about in my lodge the bin 780 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:14.189
 Ile-de-France 780 first the low 704 the 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.090
 feet small position it's going to be 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.700
 similar to in bed except that the foot 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.240
 before going to be more forward outright 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.360
 on the olive trees to end up for 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.810
 can finish the rotation small 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.020
 powerslide in chicks with the first 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.720
 so the bac 780 everything is in schools 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.500
 is meant above all in the shoulders so 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.180
 we will throw the shoulders like that 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.470
 arrive like the shoulders of Vienna 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.950
 parallel to the board 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.250
 we will start our life and it will sweat 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.280
 as you are in airbus 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.250
 you are at 90 degrees to the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.979
 initial trigger you go big 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.030
 plated and with the front foot trigger 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.520
 a hymn to textbooks 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.430
 to be able to sign a rotation in 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.880
 what's that live so that's a lot of 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.760
 practices be clean and is there a 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.110
 little so here's the 780 front 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.050
 it's a bit the same principle 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:22.310
 these kinds we will do the same with the 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.850
 shoulders of the toes a bit advanced 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.580
 then it will be accountable bluntly and there 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.530
 we will do the same at 90 degrees by 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.510
 relation to the initial position bac 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:40.670
 gets to finish the finish the rotation 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.400
 then manual jar like that so here you go 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.280
 it's the idea it's a trick to take 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.290
 it's a tricks who is he and more a 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.239
 backside and it serves you a lot for 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.400
 jara cops in the slides and for 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:57.890
 the greeks all that and then that's 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:02.560
 french charles variations trip 2 lo 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.720
 it's the end of 2 all in one so
