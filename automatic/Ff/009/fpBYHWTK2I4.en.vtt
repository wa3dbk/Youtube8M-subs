necessarily the best choice so there's

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:43.770

just giving you great response to that
individual<00:04:14.889> melee<00:04:15.519> weapon<00:04:15.790> and<00:04:15.879> we<00:04:15.939> want<00:04:16.090> to

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
individual melee weapon and we want to

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.670 
individual melee weapon and we want to
make<00:04:16.299> sure<00:04:16.329> that<00:04:16.479> each<00:04:16.720> one<00:04:16.959> of<00:04:17.019> them<00:04:17.199> has<00:04:17.260> a

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
make sure that each one of them has a

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.529 
make sure that each one of them has a
different<00:04:17.919> feel<00:04:18.340> as<00:04:18.699> a<00:04:18.940> different<00:04:19.329> ability

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
different feel as a different ability

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.569 
different feel as a different ability
the<00:04:19.900> apps<00:04:20.049> for<00:04:20.320> example<00:04:20.709> can<00:04:20.889> take<00:04:21.130> certain

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
the apps for example can take certain

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.750 
the apps for example can take certain
boss<00:04:21.909> monsters<00:04:22.360> out<00:04:22.539> with<00:04:22.659> a<00:04:22.690> single<00:04:23.020> hit

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
boss monsters out with a single hit

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.529 
boss monsters out with a single hit
obviously<00:04:24.760> there's<00:04:24.940> a<00:04:25.000> danger<00:04:25.360> that<00:04:25.389> comes

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
obviously there's a danger that comes

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.029 
obviously there's a danger that comes
with<00:04:25.900> getting<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.320> close<00:04:26.560> to<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:26.889> boss

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
with getting that close to the boss

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.379 
with getting that close to the boss
monster<00:04:27.430> so<00:04:27.580> there's<00:04:27.759> a<00:04:27.820> trade-off<00:04:28.090> between

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
monster so there's a trade-off between

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.240 
monster so there's a trade-off between
you<00:04:29.080> know<00:04:29.169> how<00:04:29.259> much<00:04:29.409> of<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.560> badass<00:04:29.770> you<00:04:30.070> think

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
you know how much of a badass you think

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.350 
you know how much of a badass you think
you<00:04:30.340> are<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:30.550> how<00:04:30.610> much<00:04:30.669> of<00:04:30.789> a<00:04:30.940> badass<00:04:31.120> you

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
you are and how much of a badass you

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
the wall you know which also helps

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.240 
the wall you know which also helps
separate<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:20.410> group<00:05:20.620> which<00:05:20.830> was<00:05:20.860> one<00:05:21.100> of<00:05:21.190> the

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
separate the group which was one of the

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.190 
separate the group which was one of the
goals<00:05:21.400> of<00:05:21.550> the<00:05:21.639> smoker<00:05:21.940> was<00:05:22.540> to<00:05:22.720> you<00:05:22.900> know<00:05:22.990> as

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
goals of the smoker was to you know as

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.360 
goals of the smoker was to you know as
you<00:05:23.380> know<00:05:23.410> if<00:05:23.590> you<00:05:23.650> played<00:05:23.889> the<00:05:24.010> game<00:05:24.040> if

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
you know if you played the game if

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.040 
you know if you played the game if
everybody's<00:05:25.150> together<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:25.630> playing<00:05:25.840> as<00:05:26.020> a

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
everybody's together and playing as a

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.810 
everybody's together and playing as a
unit<00:05:26.380> chances<00:05:26.830> of<00:05:26.950> survival<00:05:27.370> are<00:05:27.430> pretty<00:05:27.639> good

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
unit chances of survival are pretty good

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.580 
unit chances of survival are pretty good
once<00:05:28.330> you<00:05:28.450> get<00:05:28.540> separated<00:05:28.750> chances<00:05:29.440> go<00:05:29.560> down

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
once you get separated chances go down

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.190 
once you get separated chances go down
pretty<00:05:30.070> dramatically<00:05:30.580> so<00:05:31.030> the<00:05:31.150> charger<00:05:31.540> in<00:05:31.990> a

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
pretty dramatically so the charger in a

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.659 
pretty dramatically so the charger in a
similar<00:05:32.500> but<00:05:32.620> very<00:05:32.800> different<00:05:33.160> fashion<00:05:33.550> is

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
similar but very different fashion is

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.790 
similar but very different fashion is
there<00:05:33.850> to<00:05:34.000> separate<00:05:34.360> people<00:05:34.720> keep<00:05:35.350> people<00:05:35.650> off

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
there to separate people keep people off

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.920 
there to separate people keep people off
the<00:05:36.040> wall<00:05:36.220> and<00:05:36.430> then<00:05:37.000> I<00:05:37.210> guess<00:05:37.570> one<00:05:37.780> of<00:05:37.810> the

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
the wall and then I guess one of the

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.180 
the wall and then I guess one of the
animators<00:05:38.350> of<00:05:38.500> designers<00:05:38.889> thought<00:05:39.040> it<00:05:39.100> would

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
animators of designers thought it would

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.350 
animators of designers thought it would
be<00:05:39.310> fun<00:05:39.460> if<00:05:39.580> you<00:05:39.639> could<00:05:39.760> just<00:05:39.790> pick<00:05:40.060> you<00:05:40.150> up<00:05:40.180> and

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
be fun if you could just pick you up and

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.940 
be fun if you could just pick you up and
pound<00:05:40.570> your<00:05:40.690> head<00:05:40.840> into<00:05:41.020> the<00:05:41.050> pavement<00:05:41.229> too<00:05:41.650> so

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
pound your head into the pavement too so

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.230 
pound your head into the pavement too so
that<00:05:42.070> was<00:05:42.160> sort<00:05:42.250> of<00:05:42.340> like<00:05:42.460> a<00:05:42.520> bonus<00:05:42.850> item<00:05:43.150> on

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
that was sort of like a bonus item on

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.330 
that was sort of like a bonus item on
top<00:05:43.450> of<00:05:43.600> the<00:05:43.690> original<00:05:44.500> design<00:05:44.800> goal<00:05:45.010> for<00:05:45.220> him

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
top of the original design goal for him

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.279 
top of the original design goal for him
so<00:05:45.880> all<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.450> things<00:05:46.630> all<00:05:46.780> the<00:05:46.840> enviros<00:05:47.140> we've

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
so all the things all the enviros we've

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:48.630 
so all the things all the enviros we've
seen<00:05:47.440> so<00:05:47.560> far<00:05:47.680> I<00:05:47.740> think<00:05:47.860> when<00:05:48.070> New<00:05:48.310> Orleans

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
seen so far I think when New Orleans

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.430 
seen so far I think when New Orleans
you're<00:05:48.820> saying<00:05:49.030> what<00:05:49.780> other<00:05:49.960> end<00:05:50.110> varmints

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
you're saying what other end varmints

Nordic and perhaps one or two others so

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.909 
Nordic and perhaps one or two others so
you<00:06:10.690> know<00:06:10.810> our<00:06:11.080> plan<00:06:11.289> is<00:06:11.470> that<00:06:11.590> each<00:06:11.680> one<00:06:11.860> of

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
you know our plan is that each one of

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:14.580 
you know our plan is that each one of
those<00:06:12.070> to<00:06:12.250> bring<00:06:12.430> something<00:06:12.850> new<00:06:13.060> so<00:06:13.930> today<00:06:14.440> we

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
those to bring something new so today we

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.990 
those to bring something new so today we
brought<00:06:14.830> some<00:06:15.100> more<00:06:15.280> of<00:06:15.400> the<00:06:15.550> New<00:06:15.639> Orleans

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
brought some more of the New Orleans

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.469 
brought some more of the New Orleans
campaign<00:06:16.740> at<00:06:17.740> comic-con<00:06:18.610> for<00:06:18.910> example<00:06:19.240> we<00:06:19.330> may

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 
campaign at comic-con for example we may

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.060 
campaign at comic-con for example we may
bring<00:06:19.690> the<00:06:19.840> swamp<00:06:20.110> campaign<00:06:20.620> and<00:06:20.830> then<00:06:20.919> it

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
bring the swamp campaign and then it

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.620 
bring the swamp campaign and then it
packed<00:06:21.310> something<00:06:21.669> different<00:06:22.060> one<00:06:22.479> thing

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
packed something different one thing

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.060 
packed something different one thing
that's<00:06:22.720> important<00:06:23.110> to<00:06:23.200> note<00:06:23.350> is<00:06:23.500> that<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:23.950> New

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
that's important to note is that the New

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.560 
that's important to note is that the New
Orleans<00:06:24.370> campaign<00:06:24.729> is<00:06:24.910> set<00:06:25.090> in<00:06:25.210> daylight<00:06:25.539> but

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
Orleans campaign is set in daylight but

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.360 
Orleans campaign is set in daylight but
the<00:06:25.780> entire<00:06:26.050> game<00:06:26.289> is<00:06:26.470> not<00:06:26.590> set<00:06:26.889> in<00:06:26.919> daylight<00:06:27.340> I

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
the entire game is not set in daylight I

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.800 
the entire game is not set in daylight I
think<00:06:27.580> that's<00:06:27.700> one<00:06:27.820> of<00:06:27.850> the<00:06:27.940> things<00:06:28.000> folks

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
think that's one of the things folks

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.360 
think that's one of the things folks
took<00:06:29.080> away<00:06:29.320> as<00:06:29.380> a<00:06:29.500> bit<00:06:29.620> of<00:06:29.680> a<00:06:29.740> confusion<00:06:30.100> from

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
took away as a bit of a confusion from

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.610 
took away as a bit of a confusion from
e3<00:06:30.520> the<00:06:30.940> swamp<00:06:31.210> for<00:06:31.479> example<00:06:31.840> which<00:06:31.960> I<00:06:32.200> believe

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
e3 the swamp for example which I believe

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.260 
e3 the swamp for example which I believe
is<00:06:32.680> going<00:06:32.860> to<00:06:32.979> be<00:06:33.070> the<00:06:33.160> reveal<00:06:33.430> comic-con<00:06:33.850> is<00:06:34.210> a

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270 
is going to be the reveal comic-con is a

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.390 
is going to be the reveal comic-con is a
nighttime<00:06:34.780> mission<00:06:35.410> and<00:06:35.590> as<00:06:35.710> I<00:06:36.070> mentioned

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
nighttime mission and as I mentioned

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.159 
nighttime mission and as I mentioned
during<00:06:36.460> the<00:06:36.639> preamble<00:06:37.120> here<00:06:37.270> today<00:06:37.600> we're

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
during the preamble here today we're

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:39.719 
during the preamble here today we're
playing<00:06:38.410> with<00:06:38.590> fog<00:06:38.860> in<00:06:39.070> that<00:06:39.220> mission<00:06:39.430> to

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
playing with fog in that mission to

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:41.430 
playing with fog in that mission to
reduce<00:06:40.120> visibility<00:06:40.750> for<00:06:40.930> players<00:06:41.139> that<00:06:41.350> are

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
reduce visibility for players that are

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.690 
reduce visibility for players that are
mowing<00:06:41.620> through<00:06:41.889> it<00:06:42.039> pretty<00:06:42.160> quickly<00:06:42.310> and

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
mowing through it pretty quickly and

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.230 
mowing through it pretty quickly and
acting<00:06:43.000> as<00:06:43.120> a<00:06:43.150> title<00:06:43.539> a<00:06:43.570> well-oiled<00:06:44.410> machine

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
so I mean all predictions for III will

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.129

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:50.139 
hold us will help him for half life

hold us will help him for half life
episode<00:06:50.590> 3<00:06:50.830> he<00:06:51.010> tells<00:06:51.250> anything<00:06:51.640> about<00:06:51.880> that
