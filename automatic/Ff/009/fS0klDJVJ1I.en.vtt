the<00:00:00.329> Nick<00:00:00.510> on<00:00:00.630> one<00:00:00.840> system<00:00:01.079> was<00:00:01.770> built<00:00:02.129> from

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
the Nick on one system was built from

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.860 
the Nick on one system was built from
the<00:00:02.399> ground<00:00:02.490> up<00:00:02.909> so<00:00:03.210> what<00:00:03.360> we<00:00:03.419> mean<00:00:03.540> by<00:00:03.570> that<00:00:03.689> is

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
the ground up so what we mean by that is

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.960 
the ground up so what we mean by that is
we<00:00:03.990> spent<00:00:04.290> four<00:00:04.650> years<00:00:04.759> looking<00:00:05.759> at<00:00:05.850> the

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
we spent four years looking at the

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.579 
we spent four years looking at the
market<00:00:06.420> looking<00:00:06.899> at<00:00:06.990> what<00:00:07.080> competitors<00:00:07.350> are

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
market looking at what competitors are

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.190 
market looking at what competitors are
doing<00:00:07.620> understanding<00:00:08.550> what<00:00:08.639> customers<00:00:09.090> want

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
doing understanding what customers want

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.020 
doing understanding what customers want
and<00:00:10.200> rather<00:00:10.380> than<00:00:10.590> just<00:00:10.920> think<00:00:11.130> let's<00:00:11.759> try<00:00:11.880> and

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
and rather than just think let's try and

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.030 
and rather than just think let's try and
make<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.179> meaty<00:00:12.450> product<00:00:12.929> or<00:00:13.139> using<00:00:13.740> existing

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
make a meaty product or using existing

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.430 
make a meaty product or using existing
technologies<00:00:14.759> we've<00:00:15.360> gone<00:00:15.599> from<00:00:15.870> kind<00:00:16.379> of

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
technologies we've gone from kind of

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.590 
technologies we've gone from kind of
demand<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.250> we've<00:00:17.760> built<00:00:18.029> on<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.270> and

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
demand and we've built on that and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.269 
demand and we've built on that and
created<00:00:18.869> what<00:00:19.439> we<00:00:19.529> think<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> camera<00:00:20.250> that

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
created what we think is a camera that

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.939 
created what we think is a camera that
the<00:00:20.400> customer<00:00:20.789> want<00:00:21.000> but<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.350> j1

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the customer want but this is the j1

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.640 
the customer want but this is the j1
with<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.430> 10<00:00:23.670> millimeter<00:00:24.060> pancake<00:00:24.480> lens<00:00:24.720> as

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
with the 10 millimeter pancake lens as

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.089 
with the 10 millimeter pancake lens as
you<00:00:25.859> can<00:00:26.010> see<00:00:26.220> very<00:00:26.970> small<00:00:27.359> compact<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.199> and

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
you can see very small compact and and

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.730 
you can see very small compact and and
on<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> camera<00:00:30.269> there's<00:00:30.990> very<00:00:31.170> few<00:00:31.260> buttons

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
on the camera there's very few buttons

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.069 
on the camera there's very few buttons
you'll<00:00:32.040> notice<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.579> very<00:00:33.300> simple<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.930> use

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
you'll notice it's very simple to use

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.950 
you'll notice it's very simple to use
that's<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.649> key<00:00:34.829> word<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.190> easy<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.850> use<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.840> in

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
that's the key word is easy to use so in

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
nikuman cameras are interchangeable lens

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.990 
nikuman cameras are interchangeable lens
cameras<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.740> see<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> lens<00:01:50.820> release

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000

button so i can take the lens off and
obviously<00:01:55.500> that's<00:01:55.680> your<00:01:55.920> sensor<00:01:56.549> there<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
obviously that's your sensor there and

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.530 
obviously that's your sensor there and
then<00:01:58.310> reattach<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.549> so<00:01:59.759> this<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.060> obviously

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
then reattach then so this is obviously

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.510 
then reattach then so this is obviously
a<00:02:00.810> wide<00:02:01.079> range<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.500> 1<00:02:01.680> nikkor<00:02:01.979> lenses<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.460> can

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
a wide range of 1 nikkor lenses you can

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.219 
a wide range of 1 nikkor lenses you can
choose<00:02:02.790> from<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.270> 10<00:02:03.570> millimeter<00:02:03.930> and

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
choose from this is 10 millimeter and

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.280 
choose from this is 10 millimeter and
there's<00:02:05.100> also<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.340> 10<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.700> 30<00:02:05.939> standard<00:02:06.600> zoom<00:02:06.630> as

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
there's also a 10 to 30 standard zoom as

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.999 
there's also a 10 to 30 standard zoom as
well<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.920> 32<00:02:08.580> 110<00:02:09.119> millimeter<00:02:09.830> super<00:02:10.830> zoom

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
well as a 32 110 millimeter super zoom

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.920 
well as a 32 110 millimeter super zoom
and<00:02:11.250> there<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.670> actually<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.270> dedicated<00:02:12.660> video

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
and there is actually a dedicated video

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.670 
and there is actually a dedicated video
lens<00:02:13.260> that

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
lens that

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.949 
lens that
10<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:13.890> 100<00:02:14.310> with<00:02:14.489> power<00:02:15.180> zooms<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.810> don't

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
10 to 100 with power zooms you don't

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.569 
10 to 100 with power zooms you don't
actually<00:02:16.109> have<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.530> manually<00:02:17.069> zoom<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.519> it

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
actually have to manually zoom and it

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:18.860 
actually have to manually zoom and it
gives<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.879> really<00:02:18.120> smooth<00:02:18.420> movie

at<00:02:55.889> 30<00:02:56.489> frames<00:02:56.730> per<00:02:56.970> second<00:02:57.359> so<00:02:57.450> wonder<00:02:57.659> a

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
at 30 frames per second so wonder a

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.959 
at 30 frames per second so wonder a
second<00:02:58.019> it'll<00:02:58.169> take<00:02:58.319> 20<00:02:58.500> images<00:02:58.829> of<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.760> scene

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969 
second it'll take 20 images of the scene

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.970 
second it'll take 20 images of the scene
and<00:03:00.239> in<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.930> camera<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.439> will<00:03:01.500> look<00:03:01.680> at<00:03:01.799> it<00:03:01.889> and

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
and in the camera it will look at it and

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.860 
and in the camera it will look at it and
