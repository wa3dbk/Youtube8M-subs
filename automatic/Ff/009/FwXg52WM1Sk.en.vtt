to ride it just seems to work as far as

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.139 
to ride it just seems to work as far as
flipping<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.920> turning<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.520> combination<00:00:57.059> of

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
flipping and turning the combination of

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.549 
flipping and turning the combination of
everything<00:00:58.430> first<00:00:59.430> thing<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.730> do<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:01.050> bend

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
trick and the way they explain it is

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.450 
trick and the way they explain it is
that<00:01:40.020> they're<00:01:40.409> doing<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.860> switch<00:01:41.100> varial

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
that they're doing a switch varial

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.010 
that they're doing a switch varial
heelflip<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.150> then<00:01:42.329> they<00:01:42.450> turn<00:01:42.689> their<00:01:42.869> body

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020

late<00:01:43.490> personally<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.549> think<00:01:44.670> about<00:01:45.060> doing<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
late personally I think about doing it

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.499 
late personally I think about doing it
all<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.659> one<00:01:45.960> motion<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.970> other<00:01:48.119> way<00:01:48.299> doesn't

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
all in one motion the other way doesn't

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.910 
all in one motion the other way doesn't
work<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:48.899> me<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.259> may<00:01:49.380> work<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:49.770> you

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
work for me but it may work for you

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.469 
work for me but it may work for you
that's<00:01:50.640> how<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.820> hear<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> lot<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.270> people

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
that's how I hear a lot of people

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.420 
that's how I hear a lot of people
describe<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.990> learning<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> hip<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.399> a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
describe it learning it on a hip is a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.010 
describe it learning it on a hip is a
good<00:01:53.610> idea<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.390> don't<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.720> turn<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
good idea you don't have to turn the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.649 
good idea you don't have to turn the
four<00:01:55.229> 180<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.860> kind<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.100> 90<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:57.630> a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
four 180 you can kind of 90 it so a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.109 
four 180 you can kind of 90 it so a
couple<00:01:57.960> things<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.549> can<00:01:59.549> go<00:01:59.700> wrong<00:01:59.880> with

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
couple things that can go wrong with

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.910 
couple things that can go wrong with
this<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.600> make<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.869> not<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.229> much<00:02:01.380> fun<00:02:01.680> with

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
this that make it not so much fun with

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.480 
this that make it not so much fun with
the<00:02:02.040> switch<00:02:02.219> for<00:02:02.369> heel<00:02:02.670> is

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
the switch for heel is

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.580 
the switch for heel is
if<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:04.120> miss<00:02:04.330> your<00:02:04.540> flick<00:02:04.870> if<00:02:05.080> you<00:02:05.230> don't<00:02:05.410> get
