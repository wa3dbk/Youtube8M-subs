00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 let's visualize that we are here in 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.850
 a new share what it will do 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.160
 challenge of the big pool me but of a 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.080
 first person version what do you think 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.019
 if we try this is going to be 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.639
 practically death fights for god 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.529
 holy can not you think another 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.010
 possibility because I the only thing I see 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.080
 it is death arriving in which he plays 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.910
 with that good motorcycle or that 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.500
 then we are going to play 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.859
 I'll be able to call this magician once a 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.080
 ask where is my bitch you hit a 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:37.469
 entry into my table and then what 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:42.360
 we call and from the west although I already 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.360
 I said effect there I go because we are going to see 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.840
 here how it has to be here so there 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.610
 so much is there for us now yes then in 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.860
 First person is how we walk in these 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.649
 First person days is how are we going to 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.870
 get to kinshasa issues that still 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.430
 it's still hard for me 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.590
 I go because that is extremely but 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.510
 extremely dangerous to know to reach 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.460
 here with love because we passed directly 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.840
 in two moments here it always happens 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.179
 direct one 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.939
 let's go see is more than if we achieve 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:14.820
 that great pools in one in one shot 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.100
 teacher could be like the epic thing that 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.049
 I have done in my whole life is a little 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.429
 risky and possibly be beyond 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.770
 die very easily 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:29.179
 I'm sorry that there is that rod thank you 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.179
 officer, I'm paying 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.640
 clothes then 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:49.229
 then let's go instrument to the 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.329
 most important place of this video to see 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.899
 If we did it, I do not know, it depends on what 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.399
 that I'm going to crash I'm going to 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.799
 crash from a moment that I'm going to 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.929
 mark the place because if I do not die 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.340
 yes or yes or how smart that is subject was 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.340
 the area is here 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.080
 and ready ready and up up 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.720
 my son up we may may I am going to die 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:24.270
 I'm sure I'm going to die I do not see anything 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.270
 I do not know where I am 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.370
 let's go to your to whom we have to get to 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.380
 place and we will try to make cuts 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.080
 so that you see in the most 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.270
 cruel that is going to die here fear was 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.250
 so let's see more are a little bit 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:47.710
 level or this or that we go can not have 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.320
 fear that here these males are like me 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.670
 and how do I know we're here and in this 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.260
 moment is night more than less 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.030
 odds I have less 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.920
 odds I look like I do not need it 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.470
 this higher than it is or that they were 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.770
 assholes raise up is more 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.530
 relevant raise to see there on top of 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.680
 the clouds are not assholes daddy do not be 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.140
 asshole is not asshole or we look 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.880
 and then they say that we are more or less 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.800
 above 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.830
 we still lack, we still lack 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.410
 although before arriving we have to be 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.120
 located we will see above that we 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.280
 we set to see how we are I think that 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.180
 we are coming in fact 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.180
 we are coming to the area 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.480
 with me soft brave brave no no no 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.820
 no no no I do not know what happens what happens what 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.970
 happen you know there's more to the return is that 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.440
 yes it was there this bad to see and see 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.950
 to see again we go back to the point 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.710
 original is the original point ok let's go 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.940
 there lie I do not keep the top 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.390
 percent said ways is death 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.090
 eyes now so great pool that in 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.000
 first person never before tried 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.430
 today what is this why we go so far 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.090
 to see the pools where I see them where 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.670
 but I think I see more if 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.090
 I'm fine I'm good master this gives me 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.090
 a lot of fear 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.370
 it will be that we achieved it it will be that it was luck 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.489
 the last time will be that this 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.699
 let's try to fall in front 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.220
 I'm leaving I want to see only in front 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:26.470
 it was super clear that it is already 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.360
 located to that is the one that I'm going 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.040
 trusted teacher in fact I think that 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:36.070
 There is same where I fell from when it happens 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:37.449

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:44.290
 I think and bad I'm fine I do not know is that 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.720
 I have medium to see to see that there will be 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.910
