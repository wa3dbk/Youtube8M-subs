slightly misunderstood and it has to do
with<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.119> increase<00:00:18.510> in<00:00:18.539> early<00:00:18.900> access<00:00:19.050> games

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
with the increase in early access games

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.500 
with the increase in early access games
that<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.310> where<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> user<00:00:20.850> usually<00:00:21.090> pays<00:00:21.480> a

that is where a user usually pays a

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.779 
that is where a user usually pays a

stuff<00:00:28.109> along<00:00:28.380> those<00:00:28.560> lines<00:00:28.890> now<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.910> issue

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
stuff along those lines now the issue

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.609 
stuff along those lines now the issue
with<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> majority<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.439> people

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
with that is that the majority of people

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.040 
with that is that the majority of people
see<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.130> as<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> way<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.730> get<00:00:33.000> games<00:00:33.300> early<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
see it as a way to get games early and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.049 
see it as a way to get games early and
if<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.890> try<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.130> criticize<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.940> these

if you try to criticize one of these
games<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.510> often<00:00:36.870> get<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> response<00:00:37.440> along<00:00:37.800> the

alpha testing or shut the fuck up or
lots<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.620> potential<00:00:43.920> now<00:00:44.550> if<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.940> hand<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.300> a

lots of potential now if I hand you a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.180 
lots of potential now if I hand you a
collection<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.899> logs<00:00:46.200> you're<00:00:46.770> going<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.070> say

collection of logs you're going to say

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.380 
collection of logs you're going to say
it<00:00:47.280> has<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.550> potential<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.149> build<00:00:48.270> a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
it has the potential to build a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.229 
it has the potential to build a
treehouse<00:00:48.690> some<00:00:49.590> even<00:00:49.920> go<00:00:50.039> as<00:00:50.219> far<00:00:50.489> as<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
treehouse some even go as far as the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.939 
treehouse some even go as far as the
coolest<00:00:51.629> treehouse<00:00:51.870> ever<00:00:52.260> made<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.829> that's

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
coolest treehouse ever made and that's

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.459 
coolest treehouse ever made and that's
kind<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> promises<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.660> get<00:00:54.960> from

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
kind of the promises that we get from

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.830 
kind of the promises that we get from
Studios<00:00:55.920> who<00:00:56.070> make<00:00:56.219> early<00:00:56.489> access<00:00:56.850> games<00:00:57.180> they

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
Studios who make early access games they

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.049 
Studios who make early access games they
get<00:00:58.109> away<00:00:58.559> with<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.980> because<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.820> audience

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
get away with it because if the audience

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.420 
get away with it because if the audience
points<00:01:00.480> out<00:01:00.629> flaws<00:01:01.199> they<00:01:01.920> usually<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.370> get

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
points out flaws they usually just get

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.460 
points out flaws they usually just get
shot<00:01:02.730> down<00:01:02.940> by<00:01:03.120> supporters<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.019> game<00:01:04.170> and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
shot down by supporters of the game and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.950 
shot down by supporters of the game and
this<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.460> why<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.850> incredibly<00:01:06.420> important

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
this is why it is incredibly important

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.109 
this is why it is incredibly important
to<00:01:06.990> label<00:01:07.229> games<00:01:07.560> correctly<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.340> understand

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
to label games correctly and understand

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.390 
to label games correctly and understand
what<00:01:09.330> these<00:01:09.510> labels<00:01:09.960> mean<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.890> let's<00:01:11.130> go<00:01:11.280> over

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
what these labels mean so let's go over

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.190 
what these labels mean so let's go over
the<00:01:11.520> common<00:01:11.790> steps<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.510> testing<00:01:12.990> there<00:01:13.170> is

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the common steps of testing there is

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.070 
the common steps of testing there is
unit<00:01:14.010> testing<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.939> integration<00:01:15.119> testing

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
unit testing and integration testing

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.130

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.050 
system testing alpha testing and beta
testing<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:20.040> last<00:01:20.250> two<00:01:20.460> are<00:01:20.610> probably<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
testing the last two are probably the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.399 
testing the last two are probably the
ones<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.330> are<00:01:21.420> most<00:01:21.509> familiar<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:22.110> you

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
ones that are most familiar to you

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.740 
ones that are most familiar to you
because<00:01:23.280> with<00:01:23.729> most<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.060> today's<00:01:24.270> games<00:01:24.570> they

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
because with most of today's games they

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.570 
because with most of today's games they
are<00:01:24.840> usually<00:01:25.170> public<00:01:25.619> now<00:01:26.189> I'm<00:01:26.369> going<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.549> use

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
are usually public now I'm going to use

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.399 
are usually public now I'm going to use
an<00:01:26.729> analogy<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.479> through<00:01:27.689> all<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:27.990> these<00:01:28.229> so

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
an analogy to go through all of these so

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.830 
an analogy to go through all of these so
let's<00:01:28.439> take<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.070> car<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:30.000> example<00:01:30.150> starting

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
let's take a car for example starting

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.530 
let's take a car for example starting
off<00:01:31.020> with<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.409> unit<00:01:32.070> testing<00:01:32.540> specifically

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
off with the unit testing specifically

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.960 
off with the unit testing specifically
it's<00:01:33.720> testing<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.439> code<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.890> units<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.460> we're

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
it's testing the code in units so we're

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.460 
it's testing the code in units so we're
going<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.240> take<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.479> basic<00:01:36.869> components<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
going to take the basic components of a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.560 
going to take the basic components of a
car<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.009> each<00:01:38.369> will<00:01:38.520> be<00:01:38.610> tested<00:01:39.030> individually

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
car and each will be tested individually

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.690 
car and each will be tested individually
to<00:01:39.689> see<00:01:39.720> if<00:01:39.960> they<00:01:40.110> work<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.280> done<00:01:41.549> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
to see if they work this is done to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.340 
to see if they work this is done to
catch<00:01:41.850> any<00:01:42.119> early<00:01:42.509> problems<00:01:42.960> which<00:01:43.140> would

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
catch any early problems which would

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.319 
catch any early problems which would
save<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.009> project<00:01:44.189> time<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> future<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
save the project time in the future and

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.480 
save the project time in the future and
it<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.869> done<00:01:46.140> privately<00:01:46.710> by<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.009> creators<00:01:47.460> of

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
it is done privately by the creators of

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.179 
it is done privately by the creators of
the<00:01:47.729> car<00:01:47.939> next<00:01:48.780> we<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.140> integration<00:01:49.770> testing

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
the car next we have integration testing

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.889 
the car next we have integration testing
so<00:01:50.430> we're<00:01:50.880> gonna<00:01:50.970> take<00:01:51.180> all<00:01:51.329> these<00:01:51.450> parks<00:01:51.780> we

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
so we're gonna take all these parks we

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.080 
so we're gonna take all these parks we
have<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.439> put<00:01:52.619> them<00:01:52.770> together<00:01:53.040> they<00:01:53.850> may

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
have and we put them together they may

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.359 
have and we put them together they may
be<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> drivetrain<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.140> engine<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
be like the drivetrain the engine the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.500 
be like the drivetrain the engine the
steering

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
steering

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.510 
steering
and<00:01:57.870> this<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.260> meant<00:01:58.440> to<00:01:58.560> fix<00:01:58.800> any<00:01:59.010> problems

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
and this is meant to fix any problems

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.830 
and this is meant to fix any problems
that<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.910> deal<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.300> interaction

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
that have to deal with the interaction

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.140 
that have to deal with the interaction
of<00:02:00.930> parts<00:02:01.520> now<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.580> next<00:02:02.850> step<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.120> really

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
of parts now the next step is really

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.480 
of parts now the next step is really
important<00:02:03.870> it's<00:02:03.960> called<00:02:04.200> system<00:02:04.950> testing

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
important it's called system testing

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.550 
important it's called system testing
it's<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.760> step<00:02:06.000> prior<00:02:06.300> to<00:02:06.570> alpha<00:02:07.020> which<00:02:07.530> is

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
it's the step prior to alpha which is

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.770 
it's the step prior to alpha which is
the<00:02:07.860> which<00:02:08.700> was<00:02:08.880> what<00:02:09.030> most<00:02:09.270> early<00:02:09.510> access

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
the which was what most early access

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.050 
the which was what most early access
games<00:02:10.020> are<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.350> so<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.280> details<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:11.910> step

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
games are in so the details in this step

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.450 
games are in so the details in this step
allow<00:02:12.330> us<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.600> see<00:02:12.780> what<00:02:13.230> we<00:02:13.320> can<00:02:13.650> criticize<00:02:14.070> in

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
allow us to see what we can criticize in

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.180 
allow us to see what we can criticize in
the<00:02:14.550> game<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.880> has<00:02:15.030> reached<00:02:15.300> alpha<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.190> this

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
the game that has reached alpha and this

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.350 
the game that has reached alpha and this
is<00:02:17.370> support<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:17.910> this<00:02:18.030> case<00:02:18.210> it's

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
is support and in this case it's

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.460 
is support and in this case it's
supposed<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.630> ensure<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.140> car<00:02:19.350> is

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
supposed to ensure that the car is

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.050 
supposed to ensure that the car is
working<00:02:19.650> as<00:02:19.950> expected<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.670> I'm<00:02:20.730> talking

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
working as expected and I'm talking

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.820 
working as expected and I'm talking
about<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.330> major<00:02:21.540> parts<00:02:22.020> not<00:02:22.200> small<00:02:22.500> flaws

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
about the major parts not small flaws

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.350 
about the major parts not small flaws
those<00:02:23.070> are<00:02:23.190> for<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.370> next<00:02:23.610> step<00:02:23.820> this<00:02:24.300> is

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
those are for the next step this is

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.820 
those are for the next step this is
where<00:02:24.600> we<00:02:24.690> would<00:02:24.810> test<00:02:25.080> if<00:02:25.260> we<00:02:25.560> can<00:02:25.710> actually

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
where we would test if we can actually

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.890 
where we would test if we can actually
start<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.340> car<00:02:26.550> see<00:02:27.180> if<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.300> brakes<00:02:27.600> work

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
start the car see if the brakes work

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.720 
start the car see if the brakes work
basically<00:02:28.230> all<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> major<00:02:28.890> components<00:02:29.070> and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
basically all the major components and

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.340 
basically all the major components and
ensure<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.720> will<00:02:30.810> start<00:02:31.080> for<00:02:31.230> everyone

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
ensure that it will start for everyone

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.560 
ensure that it will start for everyone
who<00:02:31.680> gets<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.920> drive<00:02:32.070> this<00:02:32.370> car<00:02:32.670> in<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.240> public

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
who gets to drive this car in the public

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.450 
who gets to drive this car in the public
alpha<00:02:33.750> testing<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.590> that's<00:02:35.130> what<00:02:35.220> we<00:02:35.310> have

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
alpha testing and that's what we have

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.700 
alpha testing and that's what we have
lastly<00:02:35.940> alpha<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.540> beta<00:02:36.810> testing<00:02:37.500> which<00:02:37.680> is

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
lastly alpha and beta testing which is

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.770 
lastly alpha and beta testing which is
mainly<00:02:38.490> what<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.730> video<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.150> referring<00:02:39.630> to

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
mainly what this video is referring to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.570 
mainly what this video is referring to
so<00:02:40.020> both<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.620> these<00:02:40.800> are<00:02:40.950> meant<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.160> improve

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
so both of these are meant to improve

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.850 
so both of these are meant to improve
the<00:02:41.790> quality<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.660> product<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.620> still

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
the quality of the product but still

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.110 
the quality of the product but still
they<00:02:43.950> have<00:02:44.100> very<00:02:44.280> different<00:02:44.340> meanings<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:44.970> want

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
they have very different meanings I want

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.790 
they have very different meanings I want
to<00:02:45.180> restate<00:02:45.510> some<00:02:46.080> points<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.680> an

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
to restate some points that in an

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.730 
to restate some points that in an
article<00:02:47.100> by<00:02:47.430> Luke<00:02:48.030> trailer<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.570> believe<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.990> was

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
article by Luke trailer I believe it was

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.830 
article by Luke trailer I believe it was
he<00:02:50.370> has<00:02:50.459> written<00:02:50.760> multiple<00:02:51.180> articles<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.750> how

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
he has written multiple articles and how

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.690 
he has written multiple articles and how
beta<00:02:52.050> programs<00:02:52.500> should<00:02:52.680> work<00:02:52.920> when<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.520> comes

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
beta programs should work when it comes

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.670 
beta programs should work when it comes
to<00:02:53.880> software<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.540> this<00:02:54.930> is<00:02:55.050> all<00:02:55.200> part<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.560> a

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
to software and this is all part of a

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.310 
to software and this is all part of a
beta<00:02:55.980> test<00:02:56.340> management<00:02:56.760> blog<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:58.140> is

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
beta test management blog so this is

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.440 
beta test management blog so this is
some<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.560> stuff<00:02:58.770> he<00:02:58.920> said<00:02:59.160> in<00:02:59.760> alpha<00:03:00.150> you

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
some of the stuff he said in alpha you

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.780 
some of the stuff he said in alpha you
should<00:03:00.600> expect<00:03:00.930> plenty<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.470> bugs<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:02.160> crashes

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
should expect plenty of bugs it crashes

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.060 
should expect plenty of bugs it crashes
and<00:03:03.000> missing<00:03:03.360> features<00:03:03.780> while<00:03:04.320> in<00:03:04.500> beta<00:03:04.709> you

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
and missing features while in beta you

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.760 
and missing features while in beta you
should<00:03:05.250> see<00:03:05.430> fewer<00:03:05.700> bugs<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.239> features

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
should see fewer bugs and features

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.590 
should see fewer bugs and features
completed<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:08.010> alpha<00:03:08.880> usually<00:03:09.150> lasts<00:03:09.390> much

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
completed and alpha usually lasts much

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.279 
on the other hand is a whole different
story<00:05:03.340> I<00:05:03.970> was<00:05:04.270> about<00:05:04.419> to<00:05:04.539> make<00:05:04.599> a<00:05:04.660> video<00:05:04.930> going

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
story I was about to make a video going

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.499 
story I was about to make a video going
over<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.770> war<00:05:05.919> face<00:05:06.130> beta<00:05:06.400> but<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:06.669> figured<00:05:07.000> it

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509 
over the war face beta but I figured it

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:08.879 
over the war face beta but I figured it
would<00:05:07.599> be<00:05:07.660> necessary<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:08.169> talk<00:05:08.470> about<00:05:08.710> this

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
would be necessary to talk about this

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.010 
would be necessary to talk about this
first<00:05:09.280> when<00:05:10.030> you<00:05:10.120> give<00:05:10.270> your<00:05:10.389> game<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.720> label

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
first when you give your game the label

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.200 
first when you give your game the label
of<00:05:11.169> beta<00:05:11.380> it<00:05:11.889> means<00:05:12.160> it's<00:05:12.400> pretty<00:05:12.699> much<00:05:12.880> right

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
of beta it means it's pretty much right

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.180 
of beta it means it's pretty much right
for<00:05:13.630> the<00:05:13.810> final<00:05:14.110> release<00:05:14.229> it's<00:05:14.889> meant<00:05:15.130> for

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
for the final release it's meant for

your customers to test every aspect of

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
the game the whole product team is

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.400 
the game the whole product team is
involved<00:05:19.180> including<00:05:19.840> those<00:05:19.990> who<00:05:20.199> are<00:05:20.320> in

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
involved including those who are in

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.230 
involved including those who are in
charge<00:05:20.650> of<00:05:20.860> marketing<00:05:21.070> so<00:05:21.760> if<00:05:21.970> you<00:05:22.060> didn't

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
charge of marketing so if you didn't

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.060 
charge of marketing so if you didn't
like<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.449> battlefield<00:05:22.900> beta<00:05:23.110> chances<00:05:23.919> are

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
like the battlefield beta chances are

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.439 
like the battlefield beta chances are
you're<00:05:24.310> not<00:05:24.340> going<00:05:24.699> to<00:05:24.880> like<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.090> full<00:05:25.270> game

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
you're not going to like the full game

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:26.129 
you're not going to like the full game
when<00:05:25.599> it's<00:05:25.720> released

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
when it's released

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.649 
when it's released
so<00:05:26.289> overall<00:05:27.070> the<00:05:27.370> point<00:05:27.639> of<00:05:27.820> an<00:05:27.940> alpha<00:05:28.300> or<00:05:28.419> beta

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:28.659 
so overall the point of an alpha or beta

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:30.689 
so overall the point of an alpha or beta
is<00:05:28.990> for<00:05:29.349> feedback<00:05:29.560> it's<00:05:30.220> fine<00:05:30.490> to<00:05:30.639> have

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.370 
is for feedback it's fine to have
