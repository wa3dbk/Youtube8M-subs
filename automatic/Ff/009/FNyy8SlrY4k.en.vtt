00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.570 

we're<00:00:13.119> here<00:00:13.360> with<00:00:13.480> dr.<00:00:13.660> Katie<00:00:14.289> Walter<00:00:14.769> to<00:00:15.369> look

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
we're here with dr. Katie Walter to look

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.249 
we're here with dr. Katie Walter to look
at<00:00:15.699> the<00:00:15.820> methane<00:00:16.209> coming<00:00:16.539> off<00:00:16.750> of<00:00:16.900> this<00:00:17.080> Lake

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:17.259 
at the methane coming off of this Lake

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:18.690 
at the methane coming off of this Lake
and<00:00:17.529> methane<00:00:17.830> is<00:00:18.009> a<00:00:18.039> really<00:00:18.460> powerful

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
and methane is a really powerful

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.730 
and methane is a really powerful
greenhouse<00:00:19.150> gas<00:00:19.599> so<00:00:19.900> it's<00:00:20.079> very<00:00:20.230> important<00:00:20.680> to

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
greenhouse gas so it's very important to

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.400 
greenhouse gas so it's very important to
climate<00:00:21.130> change<00:00:23.430> we<00:00:24.430> are<00:00:24.460> at<00:00:25.029> a<00:00:25.539> lake<00:00:26.140> that's

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
climate change we are at a lake that's

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.729 
climate change we are at a lake that's
down<00:00:26.619> by<00:00:26.829> Denali<00:00:27.250> and<00:00:28.349> parts<00:00:29.349> of<00:00:29.469> the<00:00:29.559> lake

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
down by Denali and parts of the lake

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.619 
down by Denali and parts of the lake
have<00:00:29.919> a<00:00:29.950> lot<00:00:30.129> of<00:00:30.160> methane<00:00:30.640> and<00:00:30.879> parts<00:00:31.450> of<00:00:31.540> the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:31.629 
have a lot of methane and parts of the

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:33.720 
have a lot of methane and parts of the
lake<00:00:31.779> don't<00:00:31.930> have<00:00:32.140> very<00:00:32.259> much<00:00:32.500> methane<00:00:32.950> so<00:00:33.579> we

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
lake don't have very much methane so we

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.950 
lake don't have very much methane so we
haven't<00:00:34.030> want<00:00:34.149> to<00:00:34.210> understand<00:00:34.600> where<00:00:34.809> that

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
haven't want to understand where that

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:43.190 
haven't want to understand where that
methane<00:00:35.320> is<00:00:35.440> coming<00:00:35.770> from

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.400 

permafrost<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.430> fine<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:45.600> actually<00:00:45.990> warming

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
permafrost is fine it's actually warming

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.560 
permafrost is fine it's actually warming
up<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.800> thawing<00:00:47.040> beneath<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.760> lakes<00:00:47.970> and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
up and thawing beneath the lakes and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.070 
up and thawing beneath the lakes and
that<00:00:48.780> process<00:00:49.580> feed<00:00:50.720> bacteria<00:00:51.720> that<00:00:51.870> makes

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
that process feed bacteria that makes

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.650 
that process feed bacteria that makes
methane<00:00:52.470> so<00:00:53.010> when<00:00:53.220> we<00:00:53.340> look<00:00:53.550> across<00:00:53.700> the<00:00:54.150> map<00:00:54.360> I

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
methane so when we look across the map I

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.870 
methane so when we look across the map I
look<00:00:54.930> across<00:00:55.200> the<00:00:55.380> Arctic<00:00:55.740> we<00:00:56.430> see<00:00:56.610> all<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
look across the Arctic we see all the

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.340 
look across the Arctic we see all the
millions<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.300> lakes<00:00:57.540> we<00:00:57.810> recognize<00:00:58.320> that

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
millions of lakes we recognize that

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.920 
millions of lakes we recognize that
those<00:00:58.680> links<00:00:59.040> are<00:00:59.190> all<00:00:59.340> emitting<00:00:59.940> methane<00:01:00.420> I'm

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
those links are all emitting methane I'm

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.890 
those links are all emitting methane I'm
going<00:01:01.380> up<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.710> Inlet<00:01:02.160> here<00:01:02.420> where<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.450> think<00:01:03.750> I

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
going up this Inlet here where I think I

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.890 
going up this Inlet here where I think I
found<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.410> methane<00:01:04.830> hot<00:01:05.339> spot<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:06.450> looks<00:01:06.690> like

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
found a methane hot spot it looks like

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.930 
found a methane hot spot it looks like
the<00:01:07.020> ice<00:01:07.170> has<00:01:07.410> been<00:01:07.560> kept<00:01:07.830> open<00:01:08.280> by<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.610> high

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
the ice has been kept open by a high

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.030 
the ice has been kept open by a high
rate<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.510> methane<00:01:09.810> bubbling<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.620> can<00:01:10.770> see<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
rate of methane bubbling you can see the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.950 
rate of methane bubbling you can see the
bubbles<00:01:11.340> kind<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.880> coming<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.300> and<00:01:12.510> popping<00:01:12.840> at

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
bubbles kind of coming up and popping at

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.260 
bubbles kind of coming up and popping at
the<00:01:13.020> surface<00:01:14.540> as<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:16.080> see<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.369> temperature

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the surface as we see the temperature

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.880 
the surface as we see the temperature
increases<00:01:18.660> that<00:01:18.930> are<00:01:19.050> projected<00:01:19.650> for<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
increases that are projected for the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.030 
increases that are projected for the
future<00:01:20.479> that<00:01:21.479> means<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> places<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
future that means that the places in the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.800 
future that means that the places in the
Arctic<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.490> are<00:01:23.700> frozen<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.450> permafrost

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
Arctic that are frozen the permafrost

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.280 
Arctic that are frozen the permafrost
environment<00:01:25.680> warms<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> thaws<00:01:26.910> and<00:01:27.360> today

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
environment warms and it thaws and today

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.320 
environment warms and it thaws and today
there<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.130> much<00:01:29.369> carbon<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
there is as much carbon in the

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.210 
there is as much carbon in the
permafrost<00:01:30.509> as<00:01:31.200> there<00:01:31.410> is<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.740> atmosphere

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
permafrost as there is in the atmosphere

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.090 
permafrost as there is in the atmosphere
so<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.360> all<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.930> permafrost<00:01:34.200> warms<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.920> thaws

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
so if all the permafrost warms and thaws

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.150 
so if all the permafrost warms and thaws
and<00:01:35.490> all<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.390> carbon<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.229> converted<00:01:37.649> to

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
and all of that carbon is converted to

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.520 
and all of that carbon is converted to
greenhouse<00:01:38.520> gases<00:01:38.840> it<00:01:39.840> would<00:01:39.990> double<00:01:40.410> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
greenhouse gases it would double the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.980 
greenhouse gases it would double the
amount<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.860> co2<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.399> atmosphere<00:01:41.840> but<00:01:42.840> in

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
amount of co2 in the atmosphere but in

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.990 
amount of co2 in the atmosphere but in
fact<00:01:43.290> much<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.280> permafrost<00:01:44.580> thaws

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
fact much of the permafrost thaws

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.630 
fact much of the permafrost thaws
beneath<00:01:45.420> lakes<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.530> estimate<00:01:47.160> that<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
beneath lakes and we estimate that the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.249 
beneath lakes and we estimate that the
amount<00:01:47.940> of<00:01:48.090> methane<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.660> can<00:01:48.810> come<00:01:49.050> out<00:01:49.080> of

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
amount of methane that can come out of

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.040 
amount of methane that can come out of
lakes<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.950> 10<00:01:50.819> times<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.479> amount<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.720> methane

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
lakes is 10 times the amount of methane

00:01:52.050 --> 00:02:04.630 
lakes is 10 times the amount of methane
that's<00:01:52.410> right<00:01:52.649> now<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.250> atmosphere

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640
