00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
just grabbing hair and attaching it to

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.699 
just grabbing hair and attaching it to
the<00:02:53.400> lower<00:02:53.850> strand<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.630> looping<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.230> over<00:02:55.350> and

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
through okay now here's the tricky part

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.490 
through okay now here's the tricky part
you're<00:03:05.670> going<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.850> turn<00:03:06.060> around<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:07.380> want

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
you're going to turn around and you want

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.590 
you're going to turn around and you want
to<00:03:07.739> continue<00:03:08.220> doing<00:03:08.370> this<00:03:08.580> on<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:09.060> under<00:03:09.390> side

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
to continue doing this on the under side

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.390 
to continue doing this on the under side
as<00:03:09.840> well<00:03:10.050> but<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.739> are<00:03:10.770> going<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.100> have<00:03:11.250> to

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
as well but you are going to have to

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.449 
as well but you are going to have to
just<00:03:12.030> get<00:03:12.360> used<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.870> your<00:03:13.440> hands<00:03:13.800> holding

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459

just get used to your hands holding
everything<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:15.450> may<00:03:15.600> take<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.840> little

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
everything this may take a little

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.380 
everything this may take a little
practice<00:03:16.110> but<00:03:16.470> trust<00:03:17.220> me<00:03:17.370> if<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.820> can<00:03:18.090> do<00:03:18.239> this

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
practice but trust me if I can do this

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.690 
practice but trust me if I can do this
you<00:03:18.450> can<00:03:18.690> do<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.840> too<00:03:19.050> just<00:03:19.830> want<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.550> make<00:03:20.670> sure

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
you can do it too just want to make sure

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.520 
you can do it too just want to make sure
that<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.300> are<00:03:21.600> holding<00:03:21.900> onto<00:03:22.170> everything

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
that you are holding onto everything

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.610 
that you are holding onto everything
pretty<00:03:23.220> securely<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.720> I'm<00:03:24.989> just<00:03:25.230> grabbing

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
pretty securely so I'm just grabbing

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.380 
pretty securely so I'm just grabbing
here<00:03:25.860> adding<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:26.700> bottom<00:03:27.209> piece

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
here adding it to that bottom piece

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.979 
here adding it to that bottom piece
looping<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.350> over<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:29.010> then<00:03:29.580> grabbing<00:03:30.120> more

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
looping it over and then grabbing more

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.199 
looping it over and then grabbing more
hair<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.500> just<00:03:32.190> continuing<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.790> do<00:03:33.030> that

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
hair and just continuing to do that

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.440 
hair and just continuing to do that
until<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:33.930> reach<00:03:34.350> close<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.760> bottom<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.090> my

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
until I reach close to the bottom of my

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.440 
until I reach close to the bottom of my
ear<00:03:36.720> on<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.170> other<00:03:37.320> side

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
ear on the other side

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.870 
ear on the other side
and<00:03:39.920> then<00:03:40.920> of<00:03:41.040> course<00:03:41.069> you<00:03:41.340> want<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.550> pin

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
and then of course you want to pin

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.089 
and then of course you want to pin
everything<00:03:42.390> in<00:03:42.569> place<00:03:42.810> especially<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.860> end

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
everything in place especially the end

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.910 
everything in place especially the end
of<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:44.730> twist<00:03:45.510> because<00:03:45.810> you<00:03:46.590> don't<00:03:46.770> want

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
of that twist because you don't want

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.160 
of that twist because you don't want
that<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.099> fall<00:03:47.250> loose<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:48.510> I'm<00:03:48.690> just<00:03:48.900> pinning

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
that to fall loose so I'm just pinning

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.650 
that to fall loose so I'm just pinning
and<00:03:49.470> looping<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.099> into<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.940> twist<00:03:51.239> right<00:03:51.510> now

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
and looping it into the twist right now

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.170 
and looping it into the twist right now
and<00:03:52.040> doing<00:03:53.040> at<00:03:53.220> least<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.459> few<00:03:53.610> of<00:03:53.700> those<00:03:53.819> you

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
and doing at least a few of those you

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.240 
and doing at least a few of those you
still<00:03:54.420> see<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.959> end<00:03:55.140> will<00:03:55.560> want<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:55.950> slip

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
still see that the end will want to slip

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.190 
still see that the end will want to slip
out<00:03:56.459> so<00:03:57.030> I'm<00:03:57.239> just<00:03:57.420> grabbing<00:03:57.600> a<00:03:57.900> bobby<00:03:58.080> pin

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
out so I'm just grabbing a bobby pin

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.500 
out so I'm just grabbing a bobby pin
going<00:03:58.739> underneath<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.400> Criss<00:03:59.790> crossing<00:04:00.330> that

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
going underneath and Criss crossing that

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.690 
going underneath and Criss crossing that
other<00:04:00.750> bobby<00:04:01.020> pin<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:01.830> that<00:04:01.860> it'll<00:04:02.190> be<00:04:02.280> secure

you could do whatever braid you want I'm
just<00:05:22.610> doing<00:05:23.030> a<00:05:23.120> basic<00:05:23.270> one<00:05:23.630> here

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.530 

of<00:05:31.220> course<00:05:31.430> once<00:05:31.670> you<00:05:31.850> reach<00:05:32.000> the<00:05:32.180> end<00:05:32.330> go

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
of course once you reach the end go

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.020 
of course once you reach the end go
ahead<00:05:32.570> and<00:05:32.810> secure<00:05:32.930> it<00:05:33.200> a<00:05:33.560> smaller<00:05:34.070> band<00:05:34.700> would

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
ahead and secure it a smaller band would

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.670 
ahead and secure it a smaller band would
probably<00:05:35.330> be<00:05:35.420> better<00:05:35.570> but<00:05:35.900> I<00:05:36.140> just<00:05:36.260> use<00:05:36.530> the

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
probably be better but I just use the

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.580 
probably be better but I just use the
one<00:05:36.800> that<00:05:36.920> I<00:05:36.950> had<00:05:37.130> and<00:05:37.400> there<00:05:37.970> is<00:05:38.120> that<00:05:38.300> look

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
one that I had and there is that look

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.840 
one that I had and there is that look
it's<00:05:39.590> just<00:05:39.830> so<00:05:40.130> feminine<00:05:40.670> and<00:05:40.730> so<00:05:41.330> cute<00:05:42.850> you

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
could also create a button with the

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.130 
could also create a button with the
braid<00:05:46.190> and<00:05:46.490> if<00:05:47.120> you<00:05:47.210> have<00:05:47.300> longer<00:05:47.600> hair<00:05:47.630> just

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
braid and if you have longer hair just

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.510 
braid and if you have longer hair just
twist<00:05:48.410> it<00:05:48.530> around<00:05:48.590> into<00:05:48.980> a<00:05:49.040> bun<00:05:49.220> and<00:05:49.370> secure
