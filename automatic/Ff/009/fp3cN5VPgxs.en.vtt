typical<00:05:03.979> Nintendo<00:05:04.669> fashion<00:05:05.270> it<00:05:05.449> looks<00:05:05.690> like

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
typical Nintendo fashion it looks like

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.089 
typical Nintendo fashion it looks like
melee<00:05:06.500> which<00:05:06.919> came<00:05:07.160> out<00:05:07.190> on<00:05:07.699> this<00:05:08.180> old<00:05:08.389> thing

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
melee which came out on this old thing

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.010 
melee which came out on this old thing
which<00:05:10.099> is<00:05:10.280> also<00:05:10.460> when<00:05:10.760> people<00:05:10.789> still<00:05:11.210> play<00:05:11.479> but

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
which is also when people still play but

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.839 
which is also when people still play but
then<00:05:12.289> again<00:05:12.410> it<00:05:12.949> would<00:05:13.039> be<00:05:13.160> like<00:05:13.340> at<00:05:13.520> a<00:05:13.669> low

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
then again it would be like at a low

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:15.760 
then again it would be like at a low
three<00:05:14.389> came<00:05:14.690> out<00:05:14.900> and<00:05:15.050> still<00:05:15.320> look<00:05:15.500> to<00:05:15.650> like

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
three came out and still look to like

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.670 
three came out and still look to like
halo<00:05:16.130> combat<00:05:16.370> Evolved<00:05:17.150> or<00:05:17.630> a<00:05:17.690> before<00:05:18.260> came<00:05:18.500> out

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
halo combat Evolved or a before came out

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.170 
halo combat Evolved or a before came out
it<00:05:18.770> looks<00:05:18.889> like<00:05:18.949> halo<00:05:19.250> combat<00:05:19.520> Evolved<00:05:19.970> and

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
it looks like halo combat Evolved and

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.480 
it looks like halo combat Evolved and
played<00:05:20.449> like<00:05:20.690> it<00:05:20.870> -<00:05:21.050> of<00:05:21.229> course<00:05:21.289> playing<00:05:22.250> like

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
played like it - of course playing like

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.339 
played like it - of course playing like
it<00:05:22.639> would<00:05:22.729> be<00:05:22.760> better<00:05:22.849> than<00:05:23.240> what<00:05:23.389> halo<00:05:23.599> 4<00:05:23.990> was

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
it would be better than what halo 4 was

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.580 
it would be better than what halo 4 was
but<00:05:25.389> basically<00:05:26.389> it<00:05:26.750> looks<00:05:26.960> like<00:05:27.169> it's<00:05:27.349> never

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
but basically it looks like it's never

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.790 
but basically it looks like it's never
changed<00:05:28.340> since<00:05:28.789> that<00:05:28.940> game<00:05:29.360> I<00:05:29.659> mean<00:05:30.500> I'm<00:05:30.680> not

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.420 
even making this up it looks like bled
not<00:05:35.510> graphic<00:05:36.020> wise<00:05:36.169> but<00:05:36.470> it<00:05:36.680> just<00:05:36.889> it<00:05:37.130> looks

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
not graphic wise but it just it looks

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.159 
not graphic wise but it just it looks
like<00:05:37.580> it's<00:05:37.729> going<00:05:37.940> to<00:05:37.970> play<00:05:38.300> the<00:05:38.479> exact<00:05:38.870> same
