00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:05.529
 in this video tutorial we will learn to use the max kappa maki alta tool 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:06.570
 tour 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.009
 ie the characteristic one and visits acdc allows to sample 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:16.369
 for information regarding the materials of colors specularity of 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:17.529
 lighting 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.949
 directly from the photos imported from internal izip arms then I love you on god 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.949
 how to do 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.679
 in this example we will try to reproduce the characteristics of human skin 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.550
 we import a photo inside the frame rizzi trash ma print 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.649
 ie the kinder material offered color so that the color of the material away 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.890
 photo does not affect the characteristics of the photograph 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.829
 so let's go on textur 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.770
 import and browse to get to our image I find it here 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.769
 then grain on the selected image 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.770
 and let's go to open file juice in order to resize 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.220
 the document to the same size as the photo 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.290
 we immediately insert three-dimensional objects to see the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.150
 features has 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.280
 switch off 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.190
 the imported texture 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.460
 let's get back to construction material photo 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.460
 and let's select the example 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.190
 utorrent is from 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.340
 without drawing it first we immediately convert into naples but exit 3d 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.090
 let's see some level of subdivision against 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.180
 akiyama about 250,000 polygons 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.350
 Now let's drag our element 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.810
 we insert has no face we put for example 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.540
 a sphere preferred the different characteristics also here we go in little 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.920
 of mestre of 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.920
 divide 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.720
 to get more detail 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.720
 track - subject 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.650
 they are ready to use gmail wrong turn 2 mac crack 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:19.069
 the morning tour tool we find inside the langhe tool two. 5d 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.069
 so let's go to synpol brace 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.179
 es coriano up to the last 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:29.329
 morning 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.329
 or ball quest icon with arrow 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.400
 it works this way we have to 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.719
 first of all look for the colors 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.140
 basic pellets 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.749
 ours 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.749
 our skin in this case example here in the center 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.619
 I'll call you and hold on 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:55.779
 as we see we have an arrow that indicates the direction we are setting 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:57.069
 assume 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.379
 this certain color with the certain sphere that indicates us more clearly 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.069
 precisely our work for you and me are choosing 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.560
 what color that clearance features then 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.279
 for the skin in this direction 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:15.649
 we position aquarium 100 towards us 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:17.010
 we release 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.689
 we see that they are reproduced for every product 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:25.000
 and these characteristics of color on our massacre tt i 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:27.059
 missionaries 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:32.340
 we run when we pass over our mouse. we can still go 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.609
 ficarolo notes 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.789
 we can sample as many points as we obviously want the mansion will be 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:42.680
 number of the most precise points 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.190
 the correspondence between the two materials will be greater 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.189
 let's go for example to the side neck 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:52.599
 and we can this other color 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.339
 in this direction 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:57.119
 so we have the first nuance 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:00.329
 - let's set other shades 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.329
 frank prints by holding and dragging 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.019
 we are thus reproducing but faithfully room 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.379
 color 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.029
 of fashion skin in this case 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:28.999
 violence instead how to be able 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:31.729
 set the mirroring 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.729
 let's go upstairs . with a strong lighting 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.909
 for example here 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.039
 as usual we drag hold down to 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.379
 the corner 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:46.379
 the first to let me press the control key 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.120
 drag the mouse to the right to avoid the preview star 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.180
 the circle that indicates us 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.289
 la the strength of the lighting itself 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.289
 the big effect 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.789
 when satisfied we leave enough effect 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:09.409
 invisible but not too firm 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.360
 and with her I was immediately reproduced exactly deejay - window frames 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.430
 Three-dimensional 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.990
 we can add how many of these contrasts we want by holding 

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:27.879
 that I have the controller pressed again 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:31.009
 we always have it despite so many before 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.479
 of the evening 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.629
 hahaha satisfied we release 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:40.639
 and so we created eeeh roma we tried to reproduce the color and the 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.239
 characteristics of this material in our revenue start time of course 

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:51.319
 the greater our live the greater our sampling process will be 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:52.719
 realism 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.370
 then I love immediately 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.800
 how can we further refine these 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:01.250
 in this gold of ours we go up 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.869
 matirial 

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:06.099
 click on the arrow or drag to bring it 

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:08.339
 in the palette 

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:10.569
 on the right 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:12.990
 we sell south 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.139
 modifiers
