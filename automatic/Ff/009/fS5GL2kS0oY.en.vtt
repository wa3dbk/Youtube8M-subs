00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.480
 most recently there was noise when supposedly 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.029
 shores of Sweden swam supposedly Russian 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.100
 submarine something happened 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.769
 unknown supposedly someone appeared there 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.780
 transmitted and the directional signal in 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.990
 side of Russia and then somewhere here 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.509
 again these Swedes swam away his long long 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.289
 looking not only for what they were looking for 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.349
 they found 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.749
 the admiral has declared himself on these searches to us 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.300
 cost 20 million crowns but this is almost 5 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:31.880
 million dollars yes that is somehow 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.070
 strange here we are looking for something up 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.660
 some sort of submarine then we say 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.760
 what about me and how much we have this money and 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.440
 builders 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.379
 You guys are military and that's how I 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.850
 I understand not military but nonetheless 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.769
 submarine is a big piece of iron in 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.539
 which which makes noise which moves 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.550
 which moves it intersects 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.410
 acoustic devices it closes 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.109
 satellites do not occur by airplanes 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.239
 evolving still there surely is 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.239
 means which we do not know well but not 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.850
 there is and here's how if you saw it and 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.469
 what kind of missed means first we 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.790
 you can only assume that there 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.920
 actually happened because 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.850
 Thoroughly information is not the first but 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.890
 military do not think in terms of money well 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.900
 what so euro 30 you imagine 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.450
 commander such uiii how much we today 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.860
 on the shooting range of money shot oh oh oh 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.480
 let's shoot through as then 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.150
 more aircraft do not need to fly 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.710
 so much fuel lit already special 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.660
 People but here now apparently Yeltsin 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.520
 thought yes so the planes didn't fly 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.840
 the tanks didn’t shoot anything at all 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.670
 it is not a matter of military thinking in categories 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.010
 country defense 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.810
 long honor but not money if they 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.880
 start thinking in terms of money to them 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.950
 then together with finances go over 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.070
 or tax inspection somewhere true 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.170
 but certainly not the military Swedish military 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.180
 with all the oddities of the Swedish military he 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.830
 too, these should not even though who was 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.870
 Stockholm saw the changing of the guard 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.690
 royal palace somewhere in such white 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.240
 boots it is not clear how to march honestly 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.270
 saying respect for the swedish army immediately to 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.179
 zero 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:08.729
 well god bless her farther in during cold 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.979
 wars during the Soviet Union was 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.019
 several cases of exactly the same 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.900
 when the swedes were catching 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.209
 tear up Soviet submarines and photos 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.129
 published so on what was behind this 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.629
 Now it is very difficult to remember but recently 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.220
 Americans recognized that it was 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.530
 special operation about dimu pony 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.049
 demonization of the Soviet Union well that is 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.660
 pose a threat to the military so that later 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.700
 end up so through all sorts of media there there they are 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.769
 scary then worse so let's 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.200
 trident missiles let's take there let's 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.209
 Pershing 2 place in Europe and more 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.989
 Something well, you need to show 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.299
 enemy image 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.370
 if the Russians do not want to swim in Sweden 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.739
 tass will go two options swim there 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.590
 someone else and say that he is Russian and 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.209
 the second option would not swim and no one 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.630
 Swedes will be actively looking for someone 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:58.410
 really mean which of the options 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.569
 now we mean I don't know but myself 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.500
 fact here prague cooking it seems to me it 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.780
 tailoring freud 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.609
 because if this admiral 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.829
 Swedish would really be sure 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.870
 he is a boat to never about money 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.540
 did not say well, that is, yes at least the whole 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.840
 sweden budget native spend but find 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.480
 foe catch on shore we pull out 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.000
 show the world and so that no one else 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.609
 I did not swim and I have the impression that 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.060
 He does not agree but the meaning is such that I 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:30.480
 I know that there is no one there is already 20 million 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.220
 crowns came together earlier on this nonsense and here 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.560
 my swedish patriotic heart 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.829
 the wheel can be a strong guard 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.230
 I know that there is nothing, but if 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.940
 first your question go to how many 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.700
 week looking for a Russian submarine 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.470
 spent and the state budget of burkina faso yes and 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.710
 nothing in the end 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.930
 not found therefore it is still rather 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.900
 all this seems to me to be a continuation 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.660
 of those operations of the CIA to demonize Russia, I 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.390
 today there are such good sites on 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.520
 read the media that we write there 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.970
 british all other partners there 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.100
 articles 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.810
 I read American right today 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.060
 the magazine to issue a policy means that 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.370
 Russian air force exhibits a very large 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.640
 activity constant flights mean in 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.250
 different combinations there up tankers 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.380
 fighter-bombers are all near 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.390
 borders on atari are melting fly and poor 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.950
 NATO does not give rest, then they all 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.450
 intercepted but it says what it means 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.150
 airspace was disturbed 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.710
 only once in estonia i don't know lie 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.550
 as a gelding on the dishes I ask 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.320
 americans up 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.090
 but never the less he writes once 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.790
 It was broken and then everything flew up 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.890
 unfolded left and that's why there 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.880
 I said this sentence is written and 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.570
 recently 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.450
 several Russian bombers 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:54.230
 imitated the bombing of stockholm this 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:59.100
 how is the end of the quote 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:01.050
 I do not know, but again coincidence sits myself 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.450
 some swede and reads listen to these 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.490
 Russians generally become impudent again underwater 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.500
 the boats here are swimming they already imitate 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.600
 the bombing of stockholm let's us 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.900
 Sweden will join NATO so it is calmer 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.640
 somehow it will be well here with this 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.220
 I think the information is more understandable 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.440
 it becomes more well, why Russian 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.870
 air force simulate Stockholm bombing 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.919
 I think Shellac Komi Northern War 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.479
 ended in 1721 yes there was still 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.240
 several military conflicts with 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:31.670
 Swedish last in general at times 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.160
 Napoleonic wars 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.050
 well and what bombardment of stockholm 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.300
 why should we work them out but ours 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.970
 they say why bomb the city should be bombed 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.240
 military objects are not artem leg it 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.190
 of course that's why there ’s nothing else 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:51.320
 I know but it certainly looks like the information on 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:53.270
 utg that is, we are seeing the next round 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.850
 cold war everything repeats everything for now 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.860
 was we just seeing a sequel 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.150
 infinitely his opposition between 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.150
 civilization states
