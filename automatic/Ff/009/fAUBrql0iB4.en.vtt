00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
together within itself the crane does

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.569 
together within itself the crane does
just<00:01:14.880> barely<00:01:15.180> fit<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.189> then<00:01:17.189> then

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
just put this one on top and then you

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.889 
just put this one on top and then you
just<00:01:20.520> keep<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:21.240> through<00:01:21.450> each<00:01:21.539> of<00:01:21.719> these

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
just keep going through each of these

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.590 
just keep going through each of these
where<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.520> alternate<00:01:23.520> putting<00:01:23.880> these<00:01:24.060> inside

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
where you alternate putting these inside

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.349 
where you alternate putting these inside
and<00:01:24.990> they're<00:01:25.679> meant<00:01:25.859> to<00:01:25.920> be<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.310> little<00:01:26.609> big<00:01:26.789> I

know sometimes when we've done lids like
this<00:01:30.060> I've<00:01:30.450> made<00:01:30.749> them<00:01:30.899> a<00:01:30.960> little<00:01:31.259> bit<00:01:31.409> more

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
this I've made them a little bit more

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.349 
this I've made them a little bit more
exact<00:01:32.039> this<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.579> meant<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.850> be<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.329> little

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
exact this is meant to be just a little

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.120 
exact this is meant to be just a little
bit<00:01:33.659> bigger<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.139> that<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.499> have<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> little

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
bit bigger so that you can have a little

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.219 
bit bigger so that you can have a little
bit<00:01:35.249> more<00:01:35.490> ease<00:01:35.819> of<00:01:36.539> putting<00:01:36.840> them<00:01:37.079> inside

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
bit more ease of putting them inside

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.679 
bit more ease of putting them inside
each<00:01:37.439> other<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.100> when<00:01:38.999> the<00:01:39.090> person<00:01:39.270> opens

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
each other and when the person opens

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.870 
each other and when the person opens
that<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:39.929> not<00:01:40.109> so<00:01:40.530> incredibly<00:01:41.130> difficult

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
that it's not so incredibly difficult

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.999 
that it's not so incredibly difficult
and<00:01:42.389> annoying<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.109> want<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.350> avoid<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.829> of

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
and annoying you want to avoid that of

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.359 
and annoying you want to avoid that of
course<00:01:44.219> but<00:01:45.619> if<00:01:46.619> you're<00:01:46.770> looking<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.189> lid

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
that doesn't come off so easily this is

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.770 
that doesn't come off so easily this is
a<00:01:49.469> little<00:01:49.799> bigger<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.429> that<00:01:50.490> sense<00:01:50.939> though<00:01:51.179> but

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780

could be really pretty too so um I've
got<00:03:06.750> here<00:03:07.290> how<00:03:08.280> many<00:03:08.430> colors<00:03:08.819> are<00:03:08.940> there<00:03:09.000> one

two three four five six seven eight nine

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.610 
two three four five six seven eight nine
I<00:03:13.019> think

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
I think

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.770 
I think
vii<00:03:15.859> yeah<00:03:16.859> nine<00:03:17.250> colors<00:03:17.489> so<00:03:18.359> I<00:03:18.390> did<00:03:18.599> nine

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
vii yeah nine colors so I did nine

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.699 
vii yeah nine colors so I did nine
sheets<00:03:19.079> of<00:03:19.230> paper<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:20.870> that's<00:03:21.870> just<00:03:22.200> for<00:03:22.530> the

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
sheets of paper and that's just for the

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.960 
sheets of paper and that's just for the
for<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.549> boxes<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:28.370> they<00:03:29.370> were<00:03:29.430> just

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
for the boxes and they were just

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.069 
for the boxes and they were just
centimeter<00:03:30.569> in<00:03:30.900> difference<00:03:31.500> in<00:03:31.799> size<00:03:32.099> so

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
centimeter in difference in size so

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.650 
centimeter in difference in size so
14:15<00:03:34.079> was<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.440> first<00:03:34.620> one<00:03:34.829> fourteen

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
14:15 was the first one fourteen

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.819 
14:15 was the first one fourteen
thirteen<00:03:36.660> twelve<00:03:36.709> eleven<00:03:37.849> ten<00:03:38.849> nine<00:03:39.829> eight

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
thirteen twelve eleven ten nine eight

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.080 
thirteen twelve eleven ten nine eight
and<00:03:41.310> seven<00:03:42.299> centimeters<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.760> that<00:03:44.760> gives<00:03:45.000> me

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
and seven centimeters and that gives me

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.559 
and seven centimeters and that gives me
the<00:03:45.419> sizes<00:03:46.109> for<00:03:46.139> all<00:03:46.440> of<00:03:46.620> these<00:03:46.769> and<00:03:47.099> then<00:03:47.819> for

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
the sizes for all of these and then for

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.920 
the sizes for all of these and then for
the<00:03:48.720> little<00:03:48.959> tiny<00:03:49.169> crane<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:50.010> used<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:51.120> five<00:03:51.569> by

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
the little tiny crane I used a five by

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.370 
the little tiny crane I used a five by
five<00:03:51.959> centimeter<00:03:52.829> paper<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.849> it<00:03:54.810> is<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.959> little

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
five centimeter paper and it is a little

five centimeter paper and it is a little
on<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.560> big<00:03:55.799> side<00:03:55.859> if<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.430> wanted<00:03:56.669> to<00:03:56.730> go<00:03:56.849> a

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
on the big side if you wanted to go a

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.400 
on the big side if you wanted to go a
little<00:03:56.970> bit<00:03:57.269> smaller<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.720> could<00:03:57.930> but<00:03:58.139> it<00:03:58.230> does

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
little bit smaller you could but it does

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.589 
little bit smaller you could but it does
fit<00:03:58.680> in<00:03:58.829> diagonally<00:03:59.519> if<00:03:59.700> you<00:03:59.940> lay<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.569> down

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
fit in diagonally if you lay it down
