00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.839
 this season what happened so far were I saw the two of the sons of the east 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:09.630
 between the masculine and the feminine 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.119
 and I just saw the neon parade 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.410
 the visit but in fact are the brands that I like the most are my 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.410
 Preferred associations that I like and personal 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.619
 I'm going to vote here last Monday, carlota joaquina that actually 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.800
 what to do on their soundtrack 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.090
 the identified man and the coral a plant with the marks alexandre 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.729
 herchcovitch nor why 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:35.070
 when the scenes with vitinho first place is my best friend 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.890
 and I who am a friend of him 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.750
 turn 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.560
 the beginning of the brand of liquor he began to do so at the 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.470
 90 we were friends and I kind of followed him during all this time 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.230
 so besides my fans there are a thousand things there 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.990
 I like his work, I admire that he does 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.330
 I think he supports all or 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.240
 anyway this is damião and the following is a newer brand 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.670
 I've been here for some time. 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.670
 I like it very much and I admire it very much. 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.460
 especially their work 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.190
 efe 6 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.510
 there was no relation to the fashion was treated as the lottery 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.710
 ideally no claim 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.040
 Like I said to you, self-concept ago. 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.480
 I met Alex also in the early 90's. 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.149
 evening footprint 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.349
 and he invited me to parade to take part in the first parade 

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:32.780
 his graduation 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.530
 already the track passed through my head 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.150
 brush someone cold 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.810
 enter into this environment 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.320
 and it was like everything happened on the committee 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.530
 I did it, he said 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.980
 the graduation 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.400
 and so on in the next few years I did all the parades of milk 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.219
 airbus hospital and its morumbi fashion 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.159
 the federation placement henrique remembers that the last time I spoke 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.350
 for him it was then 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.630
 in 99 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.000
 Ah that's how it starts tomorrow 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.420
 also selection of the fashion world 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.960
 so we together with this fashion thing is a good agreement that I made 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.279
 parallel 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.669
 It was working on the night of São Paulo. 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.669
 I was an obsession until the door of the living room shelves 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.470
 in the duel of the first athletes 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.049
 search engine and such 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.530
 For a long time I was doing this along with the parades 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.930
 if it comes to a certain moment that 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.819
 I was leaving the party door 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.389
 and I passed the other side would do through catheter I started to play 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.529
 and it all started as a joke 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:40.850
 a great success I know that Sao Paulo Saturday residents called me 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.780
 and invited all propagated what could be done a participation in the cops 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.689
 with me 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.329
 it's clear it's a sum 7 on the hour 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.769
 and I made this participation 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:51.989
 the sieve 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.739
 fattening I only do well and I won as everybody loved it and I started it 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.449
 to make this cover better than to play for me 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.499
 What do I do until today? 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.749
 created something else happened 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:07.739
 along with that was that after a while here I started beyond playing 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.139
 On the festivities Make Tracks game The Parades 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.839
 as for the selection for example that I'm going to make of carlota joaquina the two 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:16.780
 projects are currently following 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.860
 I have two nights of that victory 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.510
 partnership with alexandre herchcovitch 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.510
 this is worth light that once we make fortnightly 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:27.009
 the manager 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.279
 that's what we 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:34.439
 always looking to emphasize is the hunch of a 100% night pop 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.109
 playing old songs missing songs 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.209
 from time to time making themed special offers with transport 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.460
 suggested 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.829
 is something that works people like the super right 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.369
 today for example goes to the hat party 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:48.569
 how we people 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.389
 always during the fashion season people end up doing a themed party 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.309
 or do the last wig overcame Japan by hat 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:59.799
 It's super fun people in the spirit of Islam 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.579
 So for fun, anyway. 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.500
 per share before profit has another night of glory also on Saturday which 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:07.029

 I fight pop show that is one night only mine 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:10.819
 where unemployment 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.989
 I upload people who are friends and who do things for me that I never knew 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.400
 from home to make performances 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.289
 and other transvestites 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.120
 And the funniest thing is that to play tonight I call a group of friends to 

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:25.969
 make a function of the facts 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:30.439

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:34.879

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.160
 marcelo wada 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.330
 the cover of the project and even houses because they are people who 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.889
 everyone knows in the middle of the night fashion that we did a super photo 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.990
 Nice to play tonight when the super right and we already have the next 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.610

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.860
 wait 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.729
 I'm not a journal contributor. 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.009

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:57.919

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.050

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.000
 in the next edition that will be now I can palpate on the team made a 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.659
 super interview with alexandre herchcovitch asked several things 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.909

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:17.020
 dating in the bones 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.819
 Why always interview someone? 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.099
 and ask all about the person's wardrobe 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:26.020
 and this passes in magazine still throws the unemployment and that they are by accident fighting 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.509
 every three months 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:28.809
 itamar franc 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:32.019
 with this procedure, the game-training with his role 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.510

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.530

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.370
