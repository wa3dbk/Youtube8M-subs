00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.430
 projects we have this season 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.280
 I'm looking forward to the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.619
 Rosenkavalier bathing in Baden 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.210
 I think it's a phenomenal piece and 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.000
 Of course I am very glad that I do that 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.200

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.509
 they all come to Baden bathing 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.880
 rosenkavalier yes i am looking forward to 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.400
 this time actually on everything 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.720
 because there is also one in each piece 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.490
 has already played a hundred times 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.280
 always something new to discover and 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.170
 I also believe in the handset if one 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.329
 Just look at other things 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.250
 concentrated and that's why I'm happy 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.960
 Actually, I'm looking forward to everything 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.780
 actually very much on the projects we do 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.220
 do with our chef together 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.350
 I think we are very beautiful 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.390
 schumann and brahms I have in the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.570
 I've been there for 36 years 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.560
 then never done so 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.970
 combination of schumann and brahms 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.619
 symphonies I think that's a very good one 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:03.320
 Idea where I also think that 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.050
 it is very beautiful that is probably sibelius 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.979
 the project is just what you have 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.420
 milieus symphony makes and rosenkavalier 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.580
 I have not played so well yet 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.959
 that should be pretty hard but 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.989
 I'm really happy about that too 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.980
 it that I once again my 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.900
 term again with wars indeed the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.010
 I especially like concerts 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.560
 Of course, those are happy with his 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.170
 rattle the schumann brahms cycle becomes 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.940
 determined very interesting but also the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.790
 second time on the I am very happy 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.920
 I just like to like pieces and I know 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.510
 also that collects that makes particularly well 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.440
 but I am also very happy 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.480
 to the concerts with Kirill Petrenko 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.570
 the sixth painter that I believe will be 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:59.780
 very exciting to experience like him 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:02.090
 makes painters and of course quite whole 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.500
 I am especially happy that Marlies 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.340
 the hand is finally back to us 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.100
 comes and of course bernard 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.730
 haitink we are always happy and happy 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.320
 grateful 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.769
 I'm looking forward to the new season 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.959
 very much that there are a lot of russian music 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.140
 played 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:26.090
 especially for jackowski and at the beginning 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.430
 a lot of whiskey rachmaninov I'm whole 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.660
 curious there is my first year here 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.690
 Of course, I am looking forward to it 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.450
 pretty much everything but very special 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.700
 of course, the new york trip will be me 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.510
 never been to new york and it will be 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.570
 certainly very nice 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.100
 So I'm really looking forward to that 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.100
 what we started with about us 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.870
 and that on the matthouse passion that is 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.940
 Although the third attempt but I think 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.060
 always that it grows together more and more 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.060
 And it will be a great performance 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.100
 and I think so especially when we are in 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.410
 the olper tor play and then in 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.290
 new york that 's a very charming one 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.090
 atmosphere and I like this 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.130
 piece also because it is very 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:13.980
 currently it is going to hate to fear to 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:18.239
 violence but also with sorrow and love 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:21.360
 and passions and also the music of 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.680
 Bach is totally timeless so it is 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.110
 actually always up to date 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.260
 yes I am glad that I am after the 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.910
 summer break may work again 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.000
 my violin may take the hand and good 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.530
 prepared to go into the new season and 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.630
 I am especially happy to do two 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.340
 programs in the next season to 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.390
 one on the brahms requiem with 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.710
 christian thielemann in january 2015 and 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.630
 the other program on me 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.640
 It's incredibly busy because it's a long one 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.190
 cherished wish of the orchestra was under 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.290
 from me that we film music 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.200
 stop in the forest stage in 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.790
 june 2015 these are my season 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.300
 highlights and i am happy if you 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.190
 are there 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.560
 is as vonn I am of course 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.160
 especially on the fifth painter in the 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.380
 April with different nelsons I am pleased 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.000
 to the new season 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.840
 I am especially looking forward to Matthaus 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.610
 happen 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.760
 this is the highlight of the year for 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.600
 me personally and I'm happy too 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.000
 bathing on a bath 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:25.200
 we play rosenkavalier that's mine 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.200
 favorite opera and that can hardly wait 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:19.419
 sharing experience infrastructure cities 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.919
 ever that is for me the 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:23.530
 playing time especially because it's the last one 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.630
 saison is with andreas plaue our 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.440
 Soloist of my teacher was at the 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.880
 academy and whom I adore 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.360
 admirers both musically and 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.009
 human and then I find it 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.560
 interesting that we have these very many 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:41.169
 Cycles play the brahms symphonies 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.550
 schumann's symphonies and a civilian 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:45.039
 from their we record 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:48.880
 So that's a very interesting one 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:50.530
 potpourri so to speak until christmas and 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.479
 i feel like this one 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.180
 symphonies in the cycle plays sweat 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:57.340
 the orchestra just more together 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.280
 Of course it grows when you have several 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.710
 symphonies and one plays 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.740
 I find the listener served 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.770
 the music is not alag art 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.479
 Otherwise you live in to the subscription 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:14.280
 concert with wars but lowers knowledge 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:14.280
 put together a menu
