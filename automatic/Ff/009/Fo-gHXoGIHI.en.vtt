00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
that I've created and put them together

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.200 
that I've created and put them together
into<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.170> kind<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.769> wooden<00:00:23.310> foundation<00:00:23.910> for<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
into a kind of wooden foundation for the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.589 
into a kind of wooden foundation for the
case<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.630> these<00:00:24.900> pots<00:00:25.289> are<00:00:26.060> the<00:00:27.060> bottom<00:00:27.420> top

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
case and these pots are the bottom top

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.830 
case and these pots are the bottom top
these<00:00:27.960> sides<00:00:28.410> go<00:00:28.890> for<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.519> lid<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.570> box

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
these sides go for the lid and the box

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.569 
these sides go for the lid and the box
itself<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.590> wooden<00:00:31.949> blocks<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.430> will

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
itself the wooden blocks that will

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.280 
itself the wooden blocks that will
create<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.180> little<00:00:33.329> box<00:00:33.660> underneath<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
create the little box underneath the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.080 
create the little box underneath the
neck<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.739> some<00:00:35.040> smaller<00:00:35.280> wood<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.640> place<00:00:35.670> that

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
neck and some smaller wood in place that

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.240 
neck and some smaller wood in place that
would<00:00:36.180> be<00:00:36.239> reinforcement<00:00:37.230> at<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.680> head<00:00:37.980> sock

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
would be reinforcement at the head sock

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.610 
would be reinforcement at the head sock
and<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:38.879> apart<00:00:39.090> now<00:00:39.629> these<00:00:39.930> along<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
and but apart now these along with the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.770 
and but apart now these along with the
blocks<00:00:40.890> will<00:00:41.250> work<00:00:41.460> as<00:00:41.730> anchor<00:00:42.210> points<00:00:42.600> when<00:00:42.750> I

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
blocks will work as anchor points when I

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.410 
blocks will work as anchor points when I
glued<00:00:43.110> these<00:00:43.410> sides<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.489> bottom<00:00:44.910> top<00:00:45.120> but

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
glued these sides to the bottom top but

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.630 
glued these sides to the bottom top but
I<00:00:45.570> don't<00:00:46.020> know<00:00:46.260> if<00:00:46.440> they<00:00:46.590> will<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:46.950> enough<00:00:47.340> so

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
I don't know if they will be enough so

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.979 
I don't know if they will be enough so
if<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.879> feel<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> foundation<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.840> on

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
if you feel that the foundation is on

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.930 
if you feel that the foundation is on
study<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.500> will<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:49.920> add<00:00:50.100> some<00:00:50.430> more<00:00:50.460> anchor

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
study I will just add some more anchor

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.810 
study I will just add some more anchor
points<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.449> again<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.489> really<00:00:53.489> don't<00:00:54.000> know<00:00:54.410> cuz

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
points but again I really don't know cuz

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.869 
points but again I really don't know cuz
I'm<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:56.879> guessing<00:00:57.649> yeah<00:00:58.649> let's<00:00:59.609> get<00:00:59.760> it

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
I'm just guessing yeah let's get it

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.680 
I'm just guessing yeah let's get it
let's<00:01:00.570> start<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.020> down

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.870 

and<00:01:04.200> let's<00:01:04.440> start<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:04.830> telling<00:01:05.280> these<00:01:05.430> so

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
and let's start with telling these so

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:15.980 
and let's start with telling these so
that<00:01:06.180> they<00:01:06.860> fit<00:01:07.860> properly

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:04:46.670 

I<00:01:16.020> can't<00:01:16.770> go<00:01:16.950> any<00:01:17.190> third<00:01:17.400> or<00:01:17.550> now<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.620> yeah

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.840 

so<00:04:47.880> there<00:04:48.880> is<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.419> box<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.110> litter<00:04:50.610> for<00:04:51.610> the

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
so there is the box and litter for the

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.730 
so there is the box and litter for the
foundation<00:04:52.630> at<00:04:52.750> least<00:04:52.960> as<00:04:53.199> I'm<00:04:53.500> sure<00:04:53.650> you

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
foundation at least as I'm sure you

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.320 
foundation at least as I'm sure you
could<00:04:53.889> tell<00:04:54.039> for<00:04:54.190> a<00:04:54.280> time-lapse<00:04:54.789> out<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.180> add

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
could tell for a time-lapse out to add

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.420 
could tell for a time-lapse out to add
some<00:04:55.660> anchor<00:04:56.050> points<00:04:56.410> for<00:04:56.650> these<00:04:56.949> sites<00:04:57.250> to

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
some anchor points for these sites to

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.180 
some anchor points for these sites to
first<00:04:57.850> of<00:04:58.030> this<00:04:58.240> staple<00:04:58.570> but<00:04:59.020> also<00:04:59.289> to<00:04:59.530> line<00:04:59.979> up

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
first of this staple but also to line up

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.400 
first of this staple but also to line up
right<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.759> shape<00:05:01.030> so<00:05:01.419> for<00:05:01.600> the<00:05:01.660> lid<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:02.050> have<00:05:02.229> to

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
right the shape so for the lid I have to

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.010 
right the shape so for the lid I have to
add<00:05:02.500> two<00:05:02.770> pairs<00:05:03.130> at<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.580> neck<00:05:03.759> part<00:05:04.030> and<00:05:04.330> one

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020

pair<00:05:05.289> at<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.830> body<00:05:06.009> part<00:05:06.310> and<00:05:06.490> for<00:05:06.639> the<00:05:06.759> box<00:05:06.940> I

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
pair at the body part and for the box I

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.939 
pair at the body part and for the box I
already<00:05:07.630> have<00:05:07.780> these<00:05:07.960> books<00:05:08.350> as<00:05:08.620> anchor

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
already have these books as anchor

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.010 
already have these books as anchor
points<00:05:09.280> so<00:05:09.370> we<00:05:09.610> have<00:05:09.729> to<00:05:09.850> add<00:05:09.970> one<00:05:10.240> pair<00:05:10.539> at<00:05:10.810> the
