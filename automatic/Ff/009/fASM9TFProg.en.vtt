yourself a very high level and they and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.580 
yourself a very high level and they and
I<00:01:18.210> think<00:01:18.450> that's<00:01:18.630> what<00:01:18.840> all<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> speculation

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
I think that's what all the speculation

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.350 
I think that's what all the speculation
comes<00:01:19.770> from<00:01:19.920> some<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.549> also<00:01:20.729> put<00:01:21.060> two<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.330> two

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
comes from some I also put two and two

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.490 
comes from some I also put two and two
together<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.780> think<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.110> might<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.409> bit

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
together and think that might be a bit

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.530 
together and think that might be a bit
of<00:01:22.590> insurance<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:23.130> case<00:01:23.159> Gary<00:01:23.580> cable<00:01:24.060> goes<00:01:24.240> but

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
of insurance in case Gary cable goes but

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
so okay i can assure that no that's not

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.770 
so okay i can assure that no that's not
