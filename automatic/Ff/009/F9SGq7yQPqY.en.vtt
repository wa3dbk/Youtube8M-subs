00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.320
 In this video we will learn to do the mechanical assembly of the lightning robot. 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.359
 I leave you in a video link where we learned how to mount the circuit, 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.240
 And here's the other link where we learned to see how it worked 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.079
 electronically the circuit. 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.239
 If you have not seen it, it is better to see these videos before. 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.100
 The first thing we must do with the assembly is to separate sensitivity 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.460
 of the two photo resistors. 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.500
 If I leave them like this, when light comes to the photo, the resistance on the right side, 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.020
 The photo on the left side of the resistance is going to get to notice. 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.260
 Then it will not work. 

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:47.859
 Touch designing a system that separates. 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.799
 That is to say, the light that arrives on the one hand does not ALANCE to see the other and vice versa. 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:56.239
 That's why what we take is a role, 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520
 we rub it, 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.519
 we take the photo resistance, 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.960
 we put the photo resistance inside the rolled paper, 

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:10.239
 we sealed it with a tape 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.359
 and we cut a diagonal. 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.859
 We install it this way in the circuit. 

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:21.079
 Thus the light entered by a band, 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.620
 but on this other side you can not enter. 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.380
 If you can paint it here in black, it's much better. 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.480
 We do it for the two photo resistors. 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:33.400
 Here is the optimization for both sensors. 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.519
 Inside are the photo resistors. 

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:43.039
 Now we will install the engines. Cut out a piece of cardboard 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.179
 that of more or less the width 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.200
 of the protoboard 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.900
 And in this, with a piece of tape, 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.820
 I tie the motocross reducers on both sides. 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.480
 Tape for an engine 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.739
 and tape for the second engine. 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.759
 Sufficient for them to remain fixed. 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.639
 Then I take an elastic band, I place the motors 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:17.159
 below the protoboard, 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.340
 Do not place them too far back because or if the car is never lifted up. 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.800
 Better in a third part. 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.600
 Later we will place the weight of a battery here 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.860
 of 9 volts. That will allow us 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.780
 That the car rise up. I grab an elastic band, 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:34.219
 bending it in two, 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.300
 the passage through the first engine 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.840
 and the stretch to pass it on the other engine. 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.760
 Then I turn around 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.580
 and I take it to the bottom. 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.659
 The engines are already installed. 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.699
 Remember that at the time of connecting they are crossed. this engine 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:12.299
 go with this circuit 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.780
 and this with this one. 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.199
 Now I connect the wheels to a reducing motorcycle 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.620
 When buying the reducing motorcycle it is good to buy the tires, 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.640
 so that they fold easily once. 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.539
 If I want them to be fixed I put a silicone point 

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:26.679
 to keep them fixed. 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.620
 Finally we need to install the battery of nine volts. 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.640
 We put it in the back to counterbalance, lift the bands, 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.300
 and install it. 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.639
 In the market they sell a connector for this type of batteries, I do not have it, 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.939
 so i'll connect 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:48.780
 with some caimans. 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.180
 Connect the positive one 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.879
 I connect the negative one. 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.740
 The robot is ready to start working. 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.159
 Remember to give a "I like" video. 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.340
