this<00:00:38.580> guitar<00:00:38.760> right<00:00:39.629> off<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> bat<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.530> that

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
this guitar right off the bat is that

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.250 
this guitar right off the bat is that
when<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.949> play<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.190> acoustically<00:00:42.260> it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
when you play it acoustically it

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.310 
when you play it acoustically it
resonates<00:00:43.769> if<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.400> just<00:00:44.579> hit<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> note<00:00:45.199> you<00:00:46.199> can

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
resonates if you just hit a note you can

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.810 
resonates if you just hit a note you can
hear<00:00:46.470> the<00:00:46.589> sustained<00:00:47.010> right<00:00:47.220> away<00:00:47.430> from<00:00:47.640> just

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
hear the sustained right away from just

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.979 
hear the sustained right away from just
hittin<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.030> note<00:00:48.089> without<00:00:48.420> any<00:00:48.839> of<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
hittin the note without any of the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.920 
hittin the note without any of the
effects<00:00:49.290> on<00:00:49.500> or<00:00:49.650> any<00:00:49.769> of<00:00:49.830> the<00:00:49.949> amplification

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
effects on or any of the amplification

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.210 
effects on or any of the amplification
so<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.409> the<00:00:52.559> way<00:00:52.650> it<00:00:52.799> resonates

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
so I like the way it resonates

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.380 
so I like the way it resonates
immediately<00:00:53.670> when<00:00:53.790> you<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:54.000> play<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
immediately when you just play the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.329 
immediately when you just play the
guitar<00:00:54.659> so<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.470> think<00:00:55.589> good<00:00:55.739> guitars<00:00:56.040> should

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
guitar so I think good guitars should

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.070 
guitar so I think good guitars should
you<00:00:56.879> know<00:00:56.970> almost<00:00:57.360> feel<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.659> kind<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.839> like<00:00:57.989> an

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
you know almost feel it kind of like an

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.390 
you know almost feel it kind of like an
acoustic<00:00:58.500> guitar<00:00:58.530> when<00:00:58.860> you<00:00:58.949> play<00:00:59.100> their<00:00:59.280> you

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
acoustic guitar when you play their you

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.250 
acoustic guitar when you play their you
know<00:00:59.489> it<00:01:00.239> should<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.420> kind<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.689> loud<00:01:00.839> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
know it should be kind of loud and

is a little is it different from the
tele<00:01:27.600> obviously<00:01:27.990> because<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.260> a<00:01:28.350> strat<00:01:28.620> but

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
tele obviously because it's a strat but

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.910
