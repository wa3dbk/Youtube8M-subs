00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:06.840 
every now and then I'm just like

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:21.010 
every now and then I'm just like
pressing<00:00:07.110> the<00:00:07.290> net<00:00:07.440> too<00:00:07.560> much

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.240 

I<00:00:23.260> first<00:00:24.260> you<00:00:24.380> got<00:00:24.500> sellout<00:00:24.830> like<00:00:24.920> chip<00:00:25.130> in

I first you got sellout like chip in

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.130 
I first you got sellout like chip in
charge<00:00:25.490> and<00:00:25.850> you<00:00:25.910> throw<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:26.180> LOB<00:00:26.360> like<00:00:26.930> I

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
charge and you throw the LOB like I

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.600 
charge and you throw the LOB like I
hardly<00:00:27.470> ever<00:00:27.650> lob<00:00:28.010> so<00:00:28.160> it<00:00:28.220> works<00:00:28.370> really<00:00:28.490> well

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
hardly ever lob so it works really well

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.400 
hardly ever lob so it works really well
and<00:00:28.850> I<00:00:28.910> do<00:00:28.970> do<00:00:29.240> do<00:00:29.720> this<00:00:30.250> the<00:00:31.250> key<00:00:31.460> is<00:00:31.670> I'm

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
and I do do do this the key is I'm

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.440 
and I do do do this the key is I'm
showing<00:00:33.410> slice<00:00:33.739> backhand<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:34.489> then<00:00:35.150> I<00:00:35.270> go<00:00:35.420> to

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
showing slice backhand and then I go to

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.210 
showing slice backhand and then I go to
the<00:00:35.630> LOB<00:00:35.840> I<00:00:36.230> aim<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:36.800> down<00:00:37.220> the<00:00:37.489> alley<00:00:38.140> high<00:00:39.220> so

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
the LOB I aim it down the alley high so

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.290 
the LOB I aim it down the alley high so
it's<00:00:40.340> a<00:00:40.370> tough<00:00:40.520> one<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:40.700> hit<00:00:40.850> if<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:41.150> net

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
it's a tough one to hit if the net

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.479 
it's a tough one to hit if the net
person<00:00:41.600> reads<00:00:41.809> it<00:00:42.070> he'd<00:00:43.070> have<00:00:43.129> to<00:00:43.340> go

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
person reads it he'd have to go

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.580 
person reads it he'd have to go
backwards<00:00:44.090> to<00:00:44.690> his<00:00:44.840> right<00:00:45.110> to<00:00:45.379> hit<00:00:45.500> the

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
backwards to his right to hit the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.900 
backwards to his right to hit the
overhead<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.040> he<00:00:46.309> pretty<00:00:46.489> much<00:00:46.610> would<00:00:46.790> have

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
overhead and he pretty much would have

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.360 
overhead and he pretty much would have
to<00:00:47.059> hit<00:00:47.150> it<00:00:47.270> between<00:00:47.390> us<00:00:47.600> it<00:00:48.290> would<00:00:49.070> be<00:00:49.190> a<00:00:49.220> very

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
to hit it between us it would be a very

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.479 
to hit it between us it would be a very
tough<00:00:49.640> over<00:00:49.850> hit<00:00:49.970> the<00:00:50.059> hip<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:50.650> then<00:00:51.650> you<00:00:52.250> have

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
tough over hit the hip and then you have

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:53.800 
tough over hit the hip and then you have
to<00:00:52.580> read<00:00:52.790> where<00:00:52.970> they<00:00:53.030> are<00:00:53.180> at<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.390> net<00:00:53.570> like

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
to read where they are at the net like

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.910 
to read where they are at the net like
where<00:00:54.079> are<00:00:54.140> they<00:00:54.260> standing<00:00:54.530> if<00:00:54.770> they're

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
where are they standing if they're

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.960 
where are they standing if they're
standing<00:00:55.100> really<00:00:55.250> close<00:00:55.340> to<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:55.670> service
