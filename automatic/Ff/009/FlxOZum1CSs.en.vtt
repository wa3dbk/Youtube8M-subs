00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
that's be honest where he would just

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.050 
that's be honest where he would just
type<00:01:55.079> out<00:01:55.229> an<00:01:55.350> exact<00:01:55.649> sentence<00:01:56.399> or<00:01:56.549> word<00:01:56.700> from

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.810 
the sketch verbatim I mean it really
doesn't<00:01:59.280> get<00:01:59.340> much<00:01:59.490> better<00:01:59.579> than<00:01:59.729> that

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
doesn't get much better than that

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.209 
doesn't get much better than that
especially<00:02:00.090> since<00:02:00.509> we<00:02:00.780> put<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.259> much<00:02:01.439> effort

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
especially since we put so much effort

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.530 
especially since we put so much effort
into<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.520> sketch<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.939> really<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.240> how<00:02:03.420> my

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
contrast to the last scene the lighting

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.309 
contrast to the last scene the lighting
for<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.390> scene<00:02:22.599> was<00:02:22.750> actually<00:02:23.019> terrible

seaweed<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.090> modern<00:02:28.330> cinema<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:28.989> we<00:02:29.170> really

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
calling his night down but I eventually

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.199 
calling his night down but I eventually

but I really think that I would be able
to<00:02:56.709> play<00:02:56.829> me<00:02:57.010> better<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:59.079> know<00:02:59.110> off<00:02:59.319> the

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
to play me better and you know off the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.740 
to play me better and you know off the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.660 
record I also didn't really want him in
the<00:03:01.810> film<00:03:01.930> because<00:03:02.260> he<00:03:02.290> he'd<00:03:02.860> really<00:03:03.099> just<00:03:03.280> he

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
the film because he he'd really just he

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.630 
the film because he he'd really just he
looks<00:03:03.819> like<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.060> giant<00:03:04.299> baked<00:03:04.569> potato<00:03:04.959> hmm<00:03:05.620> if<00:03:06.489> I
