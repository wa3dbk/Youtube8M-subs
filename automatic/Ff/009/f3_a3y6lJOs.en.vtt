you're going to want to do you're going
to<00:00:11.910> want<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.090> spawn<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.540> go<00:00:12.599> right<00:00:12.840> into<00:00:12.990> the

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
to want to spawn and go right into the

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.629 
to want to spawn and go right into the
corner<00:00:13.469> where<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.650> do<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.099> just<00:00:14.130> look<00:00:14.370> straight

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
corner where I do and just look straight

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.000 
corner where I do and just look straight
up<00:00:14.820> at<00:00:15.030> sea<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.480> if<00:00:16.170> you're<00:00:16.320> lucky<00:00:16.619> enough<00:00:16.650> it

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
up at sea and if you're lucky enough it

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.160 
up at sea and if you're lucky enough it
will<00:00:17.190> land<00:00:17.369> directly<00:00:17.609> on<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.990> could

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
will land directly on it and you could

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.759 
will land directly on it and you could
even<00:00:19.410> possibly<00:00:20.390> get<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.630> impact<00:00:22.320> kill<00:00:22.590> from

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
even possibly get a impact kill from

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.259 
even possibly get a impact kill from
this<00:00:22.949> if<00:00:23.189> you're<00:00:23.340> fast<00:00:23.699> enough<00:00:24.029> you're<00:00:24.180> going

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
this if you're fast enough you're going

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.599 
this if you're fast enough you're going
to<00:00:24.359> have<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.570> really<00:00:24.779> move<00:00:25.260> because<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.340> flag

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
to have to really move because the flag

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.060 
to have to really move because the flag
is<00:00:26.789> what<00:00:27.119> are<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.330> right<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.779> their<00:00:28.109> spawn<00:00:28.380> so

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
is what are we right in their spawn so

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.380 
is what are we right in their spawn so
next<00:00:29.279> we're<00:00:29.429> going<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.670> doing<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.060> for<00:00:30.240> a

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
next we're going to be doing it for a

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.260 
next we're going to be doing it for a
from<00:00:31.109> C<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.430> right<00:00:32.640> when<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.880> spawn<00:00:33.090> in

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
from C to a so right when you spawn in

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.479 
from C to a so right when you spawn in
again<00:00:33.630> you're<00:00:33.809> going<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.020> want<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.230> go<00:00:34.410> over<00:00:34.489> to

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
again you're going to want to go over to

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.970 
again you're going to want to go over to
this<00:00:35.760> corner<00:00:36.090> right<00:00:36.480> here<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.809> again<00:00:37.800> you're

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
this corner right here and again you're

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.560 
this corner right here and again you're
going<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.160> want<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.399> shoot<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.760> really<00:00:39.239> fast

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
going to want to shoot it really fast

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.090 
going to want to shoot it really fast
because<00:00:39.930> if<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.350> don't<00:00:40.530> they're<00:00:40.800> just<00:00:40.980> going

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
because if you don't they're just going

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.100 
because if you don't they're just going
to<00:00:41.160> cap<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.640> because<00:00:42.270> both<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.540> these<00:00:42.780> flags

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
to cap it because both of these flags

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.990 
to cap it because both of these flags
are<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:43.739> next<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.160> their<00:00:44.370> spawn<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.789> if<00:00:44.910> you

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
are right next to their spawn so if you

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.490 
are right next to their spawn so if you
do<00:00:45.149> want<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> get<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.539> spawn<00:00:45.899> shot<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.350> these

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
do want to get a spawn shot on these

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.319 
do want to get a spawn shot on these
flags<00:00:46.770> you're<00:00:47.460> going<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.149> on

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
flags you're going to have to have on

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.090 
flags you're going to have to have on
some<00:00:48.600> extreme<00:00:48.989> conditioning<00:00:49.530> or<00:00:49.680> something

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
some extreme conditioning or something

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.279 
some extreme conditioning or something
like<00:00:50.340> light<00:00:50.670> weight<00:00:50.940> or<00:00:51.149> something<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.230> that

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
like light weight or something like that

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.709 
like light weight or something like that
so<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.860> maneuver<00:00:53.610> over<00:00:54.030> into<00:00:54.600> these

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
so you can maneuver over into these

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.869 
so you can maneuver over into these
corners<00:00:55.289> fast<00:00:55.710> enough<00:00:57.020> so<00:00:58.020> yeah<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.820> this<00:00:59.820> is

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
corners fast enough so yeah and this is

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.090 
corners fast enough so yeah and this is
for<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:01.219> 2b<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.730> from<00:01:02.969> Flags<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.530> what

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
for a 2b this is from Flags a to be what

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.810 
for a 2b this is from Flags a to be what
you're<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.369> want<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.580> do<00:01:05.670> you're<00:01:05.790> going

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
to want to spawn and go directly into

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.230 
to want to spawn and go directly into
the<00:01:07.799> back<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.220> spawn<00:01:08.460> into<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.880> corner

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the back of the spawn into the corner

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.480 
the back of the spawn into the corner
and<00:01:09.390> look<00:01:09.840> directly<00:01:10.320> up<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.920> one's<00:01:11.220> really

and look directly up this one's really
easy<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.510> want<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.689> camp<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.290> keep

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
easy if you just want to camp here keep

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.109 
easy if you just want to camp here keep
killing<00:01:14.280> yourself<00:01:14.640> because<00:01:14.820> you'll<00:01:14.939> keep

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
killing yourself because you'll keep

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.210 
killing yourself because you'll keep
spawning<00:01:15.390> there<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.040> eventually<00:01:17.040> you'll

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
spawning there and eventually you'll

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.770 
spawning there and eventually you'll
just<00:01:17.280> keep<00:01:17.520> killing<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.000> lot<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.270> people<00:01:18.420> you'll

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
just keep killing a lot of people you'll

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.480 
just keep killing a lot of people you'll
get<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> lot<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.320> kills<00:01:19.500> from<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.830> because<00:01:20.280> you

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
get a lot of kills from this because you

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.590 
get a lot of kills from this because you
could<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.670> camp<00:01:21.000> there<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.210> just<00:01:21.450> look

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
could just camp there and just look

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.960 
could just camp there and just look
directly<00:01:22.020> up<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.380> would<00:01:23.280> recommend<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:23.880> you're

directly up at B and these both are
amazing<00:01:43.470> spots<00:01:44.009> because<00:01:44.340> they're<00:01:44.520> directly

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
these two little um whatever I don't

know<00:02:25.659> what<00:02:25.780> they're<00:02:25.900> called<00:02:26.019> though<00:02:26.200> they

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
know what they're called though they

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.289 
know what they're called though they
look<00:02:26.560> like<00:02:26.620> cement<00:02:27.099> blocks<00:02:27.609> or<00:02:27.939> something

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
look like cement blocks or something

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.970 
look like cement blocks or something
just<00:02:28.810> go<00:02:28.989> right<00:02:29.200> in<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.379> middle<00:02:29.560> of<00:02:29.709> them<00:02:29.829> and

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
just go right in the middle of them and

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.039 
just go right in the middle of them and
hopefully<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.819> will<00:02:30.939> land<00:02:31.120> directly<00:02:31.359> on<00:02:31.870> them

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
hopefully it will land directly on them

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.429 
hopefully it will land directly on them
this<00:02:32.590> is<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.980> 100%<00:02:33.909> chance<00:02:34.420> of<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:35.019> actually

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
this is a 100% chance of you actually

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.459 
this is a 100% chance of you actually
killing<00:02:35.769> him<00:02:36.719> because<00:02:37.719> it<00:02:37.870> wins<00:02:38.049> literally

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:38.469 
killing him because it wins literally

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.470 
killing him because it wins literally
directly<00:02:38.739> on<00:02:39.069> him<00:02:39.340> if<00:02:39.609> you<00:02:39.819> don't<00:02:40.000> get<00:02:40.269> a

directly on him if you don't get a

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.289 
directly on him if you don't get a
impact<00:02:41.139> kill<00:02:41.439> you'll<00:02:41.620> get<00:02:41.829> a<00:02:42.010> grenade<00:02:42.939> kill

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
impact kill you'll get a grenade kill

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.330 
impact kill you'll get a grenade kill
unless<00:02:43.480> he<00:02:43.749> has<00:02:43.870> flak<00:02:44.200> jacket<00:02:44.680> then<00:02:44.889> if<00:02:45.129> you

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
unless he has flak jacket then if you

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.369 
unless he has flak jacket then if you
shoot<00:02:45.549> -<00:02:45.790> he'll<00:02:46.090> die<00:02:46.269> anyway<00:02:46.719> it's<00:02:46.930> it's<00:02:47.200> a

shoot - he'll die anyway it's it's a

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.089 
shoot - he'll die anyway it's it's a
