00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the first time and I just wanna

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
think it's a Korean thing might be that

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.050 
think it's a Korean thing might be that
they<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.280> somewhere<00:01:41.549> else<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> world

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
they have it somewhere else in the world

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.520 
they have it somewhere else in the world
but<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:42.570> seen<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.110> first<00:01:43.350> time

deal this is like the unhealthy version
without<00:03:03.629> too<00:03:03.989> many<00:03:04.110> fruity<00:03:04.500> conceals

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.589 
without too many fruity conceals
still<00:03:05.310> see<00:03:05.459> one<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.819> red<00:03:05.940> layers<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.420> there

still see one of the red layers in there

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.330 
still see one of the red layers in there
which<00:03:07.019> is<00:03:07.140> probably<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.560> beans<00:03:07.800> but<00:03:08.069> this<00:03:08.220> is

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
which is probably the beans but this is

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.460 
which is probably the beans but this is
basically<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:09.269> tiramisu<00:03:09.690> being<00:03:10.080> soon<00:03:10.260> and

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
basically the tiramisu being soon and

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.430 
basically the tiramisu being soon and
that<00:03:10.860> stuff<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.390> amazing<00:03:12.390> I'm<00:03:12.810> gonna<00:03:12.959> try<00:03:13.230> that

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
that stuff is amazing I'm gonna try that

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.750 
that stuff is amazing I'm gonna try that
right<00:03:13.830> away<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.190> first<00:03:14.400> time<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.700> I

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
right away it's first time that I

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.670 
right away it's first time that I
actually<00:03:14.909> had<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.300> kind<00:03:15.629> doesn't<00:03:16.319> look<00:03:16.500> as

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
actually had this kind doesn't look as

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.949 
actually had this kind doesn't look as
healthy<00:03:16.890> as<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.459> food<00:03:17.670> stuff<00:03:18.060> but<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.569> guess

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
healthy as the food stuff but I guess

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.350 
healthy as the food stuff but I guess
it's<00:03:19.170> probably<00:03:19.440> twice<00:03:20.069> as<00:03:20.370> tasty<00:03:20.790> okay<00:03:21.300> so

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
it's probably twice as tasty okay so

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.670 
it's probably twice as tasty okay so
it's<00:03:21.599> a<00:03:21.659> little<00:03:21.690> bit<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:21.989> awkward<00:03:22.260> actually<00:03:22.409> to

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
it's a little bit of awkward actually to

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.890 
it's a little bit of awkward actually to
eat<00:03:22.800> like<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.129> with<00:03:23.370> one<00:03:24.060> microphone<00:03:24.690> one

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
eat like this with one microphone one

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.479 
eat like this with one microphone one
hand<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.230> split<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.590> other<00:03:25.680> but<00:03:26.159> you<00:03:26.220> have<00:03:26.340> to

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
hand and split the other but you have to

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.930 
hand and split the other but you have to
crush<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:26.940> stuff<00:03:27.180> first<00:03:27.390> so<00:03:28.610> you<00:03:29.610> crush

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
crush that stuff first so you crush

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.550 
crush that stuff first so you crush
everything<00:03:30.239> together<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:31.140> looks<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.470> little

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
everything together it looks a little

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.750 
everything together it looks a little
bit<00:03:31.769> like<00:03:31.860> no<00:03:32.010> more<00:03:32.159> test<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.700> you

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
bit like no more test you and you

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.070 
bit like no more test you and you
actually<00:03:33.060> have<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.299> fruit<00:03:33.510> in<00:03:33.659> there<00:03:33.840> but<00:03:34.049> I

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
actually have the fruit in there but I

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.020 
actually have the fruit in there but I
really<00:03:34.709> dig<00:03:34.860> tiramisu<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.580> like<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.849> best

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
really dig tiramisu is it like the best

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.059 
really dig tiramisu is it like the best
stuff<00:03:36.299> in<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.510> entire<00:03:36.750> world<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.830> wanted

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
stuff in the entire world and I wanted

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.770 
stuff in the entire world and I wanted
to<00:03:38.159> try<00:03:38.340> that<00:03:38.549> so<00:03:39.030> basically<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.480> get<00:03:39.629> the

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
to try that so basically you get the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.839 
to try that so basically you get the
stuff<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.170> mash<00:03:40.409> everything<00:03:40.620> together<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.489> I

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
stuff you mash everything together and I

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.160 
stuff you mash everything together and I
don't<00:03:41.970> know<00:03:42.269> what<00:03:42.420> actually<00:03:42.569> is<00:03:42.810> in<00:03:42.959> there<00:03:43.140> I

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
don't know what actually is in there I

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.270 
don't know what actually is in there I
think<00:03:43.230> it's<00:03:43.470> some<00:03:43.620> yogurt<00:03:43.950> it's<00:03:44.159> also

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
think it's some yogurt it's also

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.220 
think it's some yogurt it's also
sometimes<00:03:44.580> a<00:03:44.790> little<00:03:44.970> bit<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.150> ice<00:03:45.269> cream<00:03:45.299> we

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
sometimes a little bit of ice cream we

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.780 
sometimes a little bit of ice cream we
have<00:03:46.349> two<00:03:46.500> tiramisu<00:03:47.129> itself<00:03:47.489> in<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:47.730> case

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
have two tiramisu itself in this case

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.910 
have two tiramisu itself in this case
usually<00:03:48.269> it's<00:03:48.510> like<00:03:48.629> the<00:03:48.750> fruits<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.110> the<00:03:49.769> red

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
usually it's like the fruits to the red

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.770 
usually it's like the fruits to the red
beans<00:03:50.159> at<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.519> bottom<00:03:50.819> a<00:03:50.849> lot<00:03:51.150> of<00:03:51.299> crushed<00:03:51.569> ice

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
beans at the bottom a lot of crushed ice

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.420 
beans at the bottom a lot of crushed ice
and<00:03:52.170> I<00:03:52.200> think<00:03:52.379> they<00:03:52.470> do<00:03:52.799> a<00:03:52.830> little<00:03:52.920> bit<00:03:53.099> of<00:03:53.189> milk

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
and I think they do a little bit of milk

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.670 
and I think they do a little bit of milk
and<00:03:53.670> other<00:03:53.879> yogurt<00:03:54.299> stuff<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:54.599> there<00:03:54.780> so<00:03:55.530> it's

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
and other yogurt stuff in there so it's

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.220 
and other yogurt stuff in there so it's
not<00:03:56.040> as<00:03:56.330> unhealthy<00:03:57.330> as<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.689> would<00:03:57.840> think<00:03:57.870> it's

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
not as unhealthy as you would think it's

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.570 
not as unhealthy as you would think it's
not<00:03:58.349> like<00:03:58.470> ice<00:03:58.620> cream<00:03:58.950> it's<00:03:59.159> actually<00:03:59.459> like

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
not like ice cream it's actually like

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.009 
not like ice cream it's actually like
really<00:04:00.000> good<00:04:00.150> especially<00:04:00.450> when<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.810> get<00:04:00.930> the

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
really good especially when you get the

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.839 
really good especially when you get the
fruit<00:04:01.200> ones<00:04:01.470> we<00:04:02.099> chose<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.489> get<00:04:02.610> like<00:04:02.760> the

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
fruit ones we chose to get like the

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.699 
fruit ones we chose to get like the
unhealthy<00:04:03.330> version<00:04:03.629> today<00:04:03.870> but<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.530> stuff

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
unhealthy version today but that stuff

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:17.260 
unhealthy version today but that stuff
is<00:04:04.860> really<00:04:05.250> really<00:04:05.400> good<00:04:05.700> at<00:04:06.060> least<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.269> hope<00:04:06.330> so

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.330 

really<00:04:18.270> hasty<00:04:18.950> probably<00:04:19.950> a<00:04:19.980> little<00:04:20.130> bit<00:04:20.310> more

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340
