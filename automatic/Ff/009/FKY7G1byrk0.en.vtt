the<00:00:31.730> seagate<00:00:32.149> goflex<00:00:32.710> ultraportable<00:00:33.710> dries

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
the seagate goflex ultraportable dries

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:36.729 
the seagate goflex ultraportable dries
it<00:00:34.489> is<00:00:34.610> very<00:00:34.879> small<00:00:35.300> ice<00:00:35.960> went<00:00:36.289> ahead<00:00:36.379> and<00:00:36.620> got

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
it is very small ice went ahead and got

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.040 
it is very small ice went ahead and got
the<00:00:36.890> 500<00:00:37.399> gigabytes<00:00:37.850> I<00:00:38.149> think<00:00:38.660> after<00:00:38.870> I

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
the 500 gigabytes I think after I

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.079 
the 500 gigabytes I think after I
transferred<00:00:39.530> all<00:00:39.769> my<00:00:39.800> files<00:00:40.190> i<00:00:40.640> only<00:00:40.910> used

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:41.089 
transferred all my files i only used

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:43.389 
transferred all my files i only used
about<00:00:41.210> 40<00:00:41.719> gigs<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.679> it's<00:00:42.829> definitely<00:00:43.219> big

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
about 40 gigs so it's definitely big

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:44.829 
about 40 gigs so it's definitely big
enough<00:00:43.429> for<00:00:43.789> what<00:00:43.909> I<00:00:43.940> need<00:00:44.210> it<00:00:44.359> for<00:00:44.390> if<00:00:44.749> you're

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
enough for what I need it for if you're

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:46.569 
enough for what I need it for if you're
going<00:00:44.989> to<00:00:45.050> be<00:00:45.170> backing<00:00:45.559> up<00:00:45.710> everything<00:00:45.859> or

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
going to be backing up everything or

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.819 
going to be backing up everything or
have<00:00:46.699> multiple<00:00:46.879> computers<00:00:47.570> you<00:00:48.440> might<00:00:48.620> need<00:00:48.769> a

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
have multiple computers you might need a

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.259 
have multiple computers you might need a
bigger<00:00:49.069> one<00:00:49.280> but<00:00:49.309> for<00:00:49.670> most<00:00:49.819> you're<00:00:50.120> just

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
bigger one but for most you're just

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.389 
bigger one but for most you're just
basic<00:00:50.719> backups<00:00:51.199> 500<00:00:51.890> gigabytes<00:00:52.249> would

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
basic backups 500 gigabytes would

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.149 
basic backups 500 gigabytes would
probably<00:00:52.730> be<00:00:52.850> enough<00:00:53.120> for<00:00:53.269> a<00:00:53.329> lot<00:00:53.510> of<00:00:53.539> people

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
probably be enough for a lot of people

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:56.770 
probably be enough for a lot of people

compatible with both the USB to point

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:05.620 
compatible with both the USB to point
out<00:01:03.620> and<00:01:03.800> three<00:01:04.190> point<00:01:04.460> out<00:01:04.610> my<00:01:05.150> computer<00:01:05.600> just

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
out and three point out my computer just

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.450 
out and three point out my computer just
has<00:01:05.930> two<00:01:06.170> point<00:01:06.500> oh<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:06.620> it<00:01:06.890> doesn't<00:01:07.159> really<00:01:07.220> do

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
has two point oh so it doesn't really do

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.969 
has two point oh so it doesn't really do
anything<00:01:07.670> extra<00:01:08.119> for<00:01:08.149> me<00:01:08.450> but<00:01:09.439> if<00:01:09.530> you<00:01:09.619> do<00:01:09.770> have

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
the three-point oh it's supposed to

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.389 
the three-point oh it's supposed to
transfer<00:01:11.570> up<00:01:11.719> to<00:01:11.750> 10<00:01:12.049> times<00:01:12.320> faster<00:01:12.890> than<00:01:12.920> your

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
transfer up to 10 times faster than your

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.999 
transfer up to 10 times faster than your
regular<00:01:13.549> USB<00:01:14.229> one<00:01:15.229> of<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.439> main<00:01:15.649> things<00:01:15.890> that

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
regular USB one of the main things that

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.789 
regular USB one of the main things that
drew<00:01:16.250> me<00:01:16.280> to<00:01:16.640> this<00:01:16.820> particular<00:01:17.270> brand<00:01:17.930> is<00:01:18.229> i

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
drew me to this particular brand is i

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.469 
drew me to this particular brand is i
know<00:01:18.860> all<00:01:19.159> of<00:01:19.189> them<00:01:19.460> probably<00:01:19.640> most<00:01:20.119> of<00:01:20.329> them

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
know all of them probably most of them

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.120 
know all of them probably most of them
probably<00:01:20.509> do<00:01:20.990> this<00:01:21.200> but<00:01:21.409> this<00:01:21.500> one<00:01:21.740> shows<00:01:21.920> it

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
probably do this but this one shows it

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.520 
probably do this but this one shows it
right<00:01:22.280> on<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.520> box<00:01:22.549> it<00:01:23.030> says<00:01:23.200> you<00:01:24.200> can<00:01:24.350> share

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
right on the box it says you can share

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.260 
right on the box it says you can share
files<00:01:24.710> really<00:01:25.130> easy<00:01:25.310> between<00:01:25.579> your<00:01:25.909> mac<00:01:26.090> in

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
files really easy between your mac in

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.480 
files really easy between your mac in
your<00:01:26.390> pc<00:01:26.869> since<00:01:27.619> i<00:01:27.770> don't<00:01:27.829> have<00:01:28.130> any

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
your pc since i don't have any

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.270 
your pc since i don't have any
experience<00:01:29.119> transferring<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:30.259> max<00:01:30.590> I<00:01:30.860> figured

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
experience transferring to max I figured

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.459 
experience transferring to max I figured
it'd<00:01:31.490> be<00:01:31.700> good<00:01:32.000> to<00:01:32.060> go<00:01:32.329> with<00:01:32.509> this<00:01:32.659> one<00:01:32.719> since

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
it'd be good to go with this one since

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.050 
it'd be good to go with this one since
it's<00:01:33.590> supposed<00:01:33.859> to<00:01:33.920> be<00:01:34.039> pretty<00:01:34.189> easy<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:34.880> so

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
it's supposed to be pretty easy and so

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.069 
it's supposed to be pretty easy and so

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
regular USB or mini USB and then it just

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.960 
regular USB or mini USB and then it just

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.370 
it does have a very high gloss finish on
it<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.790> does<00:03:23.940> get<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.180> lot<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.540> smudges<00:03:25.350> and
