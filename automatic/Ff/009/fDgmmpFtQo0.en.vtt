00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.939
 maria 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.560

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.600
 so quickly that was fine 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.280
 sat head trickle seem like that and that 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.770

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.649
 not how much is also where the bowl 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.840
 actually quite a lot 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.550
 so that is certainly not a fight package 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.559
 center axis and the time for the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.750
