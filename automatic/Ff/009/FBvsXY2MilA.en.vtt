00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hi guys, how are you? I taught you today. 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.420
 attention taken behind curses is not 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:12.030
 because we have cases that we do not 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.969
 You can do that pijo hairstyle there. 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.949
 some of the shows I do I go 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.510
 use the tutorial because I recorded the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.840
 I 'm going to tell 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.550
 but I'm going to use water with a little bit of 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.019
 clean of cantÃ¡ to comb after to abuse 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.660
 elastic and relax the little ones 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.739
 what is to end the learning tires 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.050
 I'll use it better to cut 12 longs than 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.329
 Finally in order to make the freezer I 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.760
 I'll use a little respect for the 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.789
 idea people are not destined to stay 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.879
 Totally not mayor, not good. 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.590
 I'll stretch it because otherwise I'll shoot 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.910
 characteristic of curly hair that 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.879
 can be such a thing more 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.829
 messed up can have three then yes I 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.870
 I do not care that I think 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.600
 traffic is beautiful the same way 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.730
 so if you want to sell like you do, it's just 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.739
 one with me comes 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.500
 so let's get started, guys. 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.030
 hair is on a bad day and 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.070
 in these cases I like to make a 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.000
 hairstyle today in the case is braid 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.520
 embedded 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.890
 Before I start thinking, I 'll get 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.130
 this solution of water with cream of 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.400
 to comb and go is to modify the hair 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.490
 because I do this because the wires can 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.000
 be funny and knows when to 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.939
 handling the braid will get easier 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.729
 so I just like to look at the 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:40.890
 hair knows I live on top of the root and 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.770
 also in the middle and up to the ends of the hair 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.750
 Wet people, I'm going to separate this one. 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.259
 season is in 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.409
 tour in time for another're easy 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.340
 whether there is great here to start 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.880
 to tire 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.100
 from this greater goal I separate three 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.649
 smaller wicks 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.799
 to start braiding from the top of the 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.740
 head are you usually get hold of 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.440
 end of the field and playing through now will 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.910
 pick up point from the left corner of the screen and 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.180
 plays through half the corner from 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.290
 and play to the middle I do it more 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.290
 three four times 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.120
 From there the braid will begin. 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.300
 embedded and I hope I can 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.290
 explain to you is the following I go 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:37.290
 grab a mechinha the O corner there and I 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:41.470
 join with the right mecha is watching 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.300
 isolates the two joints to the middle now 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.700
 I'll show you the wick of the 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.520
 left corner , you see and I'll get it 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.990
 also one lower in the left corner 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:57.760
 Also side two joints and play to 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:00.760
 the medium may be difficult to understand 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.610
 But this is practical practice, it should be 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.470
 Fourth time I do braid 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.110
 There is a day that I do the fastest day. 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.830
 Which takes longer, the hair is tangled. 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.140
 but it's a question of persistence and I'm going 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.500
 do in that braid takes a little bit 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:21.520
 along with a side america throws everything 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:27.700
 by the middle and then will accelerate will 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:29.020
 speeding up the process is good once in 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.060
 when I'm going to look over my hair 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:38.700
 When I'm feeling the wires are 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:41.980
 embarrassed knows when it arrives at the end 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.130
 I finish the braid in the traditional way 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:50.890
 It's even got a tip in the middle. 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:52.360
 take another bridge play in the middle and then I 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.610
 I get an elastic 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.860
 those that do not appear much to know if 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.489
 black but have several choices have 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:06.370
 transparent and colorful 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:08.080
 braid well before braiding 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.230
 But I'll show you more. 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.640
 Go ahead, I'll sort this out. 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.140
 freeze is watching 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.390
 I do not care much about this 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.260
 hair that stays up but not 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:23.169
 just to slow down a bit I'll use 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.940
 spray and then I'll work with the 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.040
 fingers really know and I will play 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.920
 but this will decrease a little bit 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:38.330
 freeze but will not leave strained 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:40.190
 not because that is not my goal and the 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.760
 braid of the ready people you can 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:46.940
 leave it loose're loose hair 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.900
 this way you play there on the 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.090
 heat 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.750
 I like to learn even more than the 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.810
 france winding her inside I go 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.510
 coiling coiling 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.670
 holding together for you and there you 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.880
 when staples Sa may have 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.460
 needed 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:14.240
 I think I used two or three there 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:16.310
 In this tutorial, it's okay, I think. 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:22.610
 is happier fresher for the 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:25.010
 people to face the heat, and the transatlantic 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.990
 Ready, people, look how can you do it? 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.870
 I do not expect you to have any 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.390
 I like it and I hope the curses will try 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.110
 and then tell me if you like it is good 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.110
 A kiss, bye.
