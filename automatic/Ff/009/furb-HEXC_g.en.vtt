00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.529
 Hi, I decided to make a video about 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:09.360
 a camera that ended up good I've already asked 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.639
 this camera is about an alternative 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.490
 to the web but in a sports camera 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.100
 with the century 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.900
 that is not going to be multipurpose because it's not going to 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.110
 be both to record not to us 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.520
 same as to record 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:28.720
 the athlete of more 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:33.730
 like that aquatic and resistant 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:37.390
 it is called that of the brand as the 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:42.899
 sj model how much nor how are you going to love 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.899
 kakÃ¡ for those who want to waterproof 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:53.300
 1008 installed at 36 seconds and at 720 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.809
 60 although there is a dispute there because 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.850
 I think folding the frames like discarding 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.860
 the camera 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.769
 well this would be the camera with the 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:08.630
 waterproof protector placed for 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:10.040
 to be able to wet this would be the camera alone is 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.009
 a little more 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.500
 and dewar of mission that I do but could more 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.960
 stain with the equipment the edges 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.280
 what happens is that I thought I do not know how 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.280
 but but that those hands 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.540
 also how am I seeing here 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.910
 It's very easy to handle, I do not 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.000
 it showed why I still have a lot 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.140
 so that it comes to have a screen of 15 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.170
 inches to see what we are 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.060
 recording here for ok to do all 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.330
 ok functions and this is for your 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.330
 lifetime 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.660
 as you see is hooked to a 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:55.140
 yellow bicycle in a helmet and is the 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.909
 battery that are 900 milliamps 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.409
 I do not think they last, I think it's a 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.510
 hour and a half there will be no giving but good 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.610
 not to not ask for more you can 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.540
 buy if you see the customers that 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.369
 they bought this product too 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.600
 they bought what they bought me in a 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.330
 battery to buy to charge charge 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.010
 is and take the other not good in 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.590
 load what you have to take 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.590
 this part have also been charged more 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.560
 users but what I really like about 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.360
 this camera that bring many accessories 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.030
 because I show you this page now 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.420
 because I bought here as you see 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.440
 this to change 88 euros I think there would be 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.140
 been the typical dollars and here not 99 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.890
 dollars here and here would be $ 92 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.980
 that the change is 75 euros in baku go 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.959
 gogh I really think it's the same but 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.740
 has a seven percent discount 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.570
 now as you bought me 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.090
 It is also available in several 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.770
 colors as you can see has always 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.740
 bought and I think the truth has been 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:05.380
 gray but we have the blue white color 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.780
 pink gray black glitter 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.940
 I also wanted 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.470
 teaches that it was bought that here 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.450
 it is 25 euros 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.970
 as you see it would be 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.400
 122 american dollars that you 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.500
 but remember not why not 29 followed 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.270
 for here they would feel something 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.660
 to be able to choose the color you want 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.230
 although I think there are none of them so 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.980
 less knew not draw the book does not 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.450
 I bought it from here look at the number of 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.019
 units 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:46.049
 he has also gotten a memory 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:55.590
 because it takes to record and the 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:59.670
 helmet accessories 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:06.410
 for bikes and here it is 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:08.730
 all this is a hook other 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.270
 heap in many ways some 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.270
 repeated 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.590
 to put the helmet 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.560
 top of the field commissioned the cable 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.070
 the cloth to clean sensitive for 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.810
 grab and here they have as a level is 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.820
 pretty good this camera is worth no 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:32.300
 as the tastes are clear they are 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.760
 It is much more good such a quality 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.410
 also more quality but there is difference 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.510
 but more difference is still 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.510
 expression us for here 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:49.180
 and others that does put here sj 4000 that goes 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.170
 to get out on the rise because he's looking for her 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.100
 brave I do it but as you are seeing 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.070
 it can be very expensive 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:03.740
 to start is also pretty good 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:07.600
 and also reached and to break install 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:12.190
 the other are very similar as you see 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.190
 well here I do not know how with the pressure 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.389
 but good step to look at it because I'm not going 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.340
 to buy we have come to see the 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:23.060
 alternative 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:27.620
 what else as you see if you put 4000 out 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:32.720
 amazon the level also in the third 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:35.449
 link 65 15 days with free shipping 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.030
 to all parts of the world and if you want 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.160
 well typical joke for them to arrive 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.249
 five days without a tablet to reach the 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.129
 another day they go to European no 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:47.960
 that more than a forum that will have 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:50.210
 what read 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.919
 and I'm going to show you a video that is 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.009
 this man that I want you to see them 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.009
 you 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:01.820
 whole so that I do not seem to 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.820
 I want but that to you 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:07.919
 who records with the uneven she without a vote 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:11.249
 4 me here and then produced after the 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:15.439
 editing I think there's with the computer the 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:19.169
 1080 links that we will not put or 720 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:23.419
 and that something more or less as it records there is no 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.419
 to record here more or less well 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:31.410
 and coordinated there you are seeing 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.680
 it was more or less the same and there is snow and 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:37.130
 otherwise, yes, there is some change 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:42.020
 note the snow a little better the uocra 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:45.479
 and all that not so I see here this 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.560
 remove and the accessories let's look at it 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:50.110
 tomilla that we are 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:54.300
 now nothing else, "he said," we have this 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:58.000
 stick because the truth blogs moving 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.070
 to finish this belt for the waist 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.660
 will be this word head to take with 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:06.460
 the head and is for the chest 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.850
 it's pretty good for what I've 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.800
 seen nothing I hope you eat 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.580
 disinterested this option is a 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.980
 very good alternative of the hoaxes and if 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:21.220
 is that there is one more question in 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:23.770
 the comments if they also commented 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.800
 what can you ask me? 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.810
 that also also tell me if there is 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.259
 bought or not and if you have any then 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:35.430
 as it has continued so we know nothing 

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:35.430
 next audio videos
