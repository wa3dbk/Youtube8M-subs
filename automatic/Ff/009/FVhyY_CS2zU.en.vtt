put the clutch on that easily so one
inch<00:01:33.209> shaft<00:01:33.799> actually<00:01:34.799> no<00:01:35.099> that<00:01:35.130> looks<00:01:35.429> like

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:35.639 
inch shaft actually no that looks like

I think about we should just well bit

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.649 
I think about we should just well bit
the<00:01:48.569> rest<00:01:48.749> of<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:48.989> on<00:01:50.090> hard<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.179> do<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.359> that<00:01:51.509> way

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659
