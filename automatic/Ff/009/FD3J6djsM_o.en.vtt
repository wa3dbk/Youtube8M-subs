00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.760 
foundations on is probably going to be a
Beauty<00:01:44.490> Blender<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:45.109> have<00:01:46.109> tried<00:01:46.319> to<00:01:46.349> use<00:01:46.619> like

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
Beauty Blender I have tried to use like

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.289 
Beauty Blender I have tried to use like
one<00:01:46.919> of<00:01:47.009> these<00:01:47.130> flat<00:01:47.399> brushes<00:01:47.789> to<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.060> buff

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
one of these flat brushes to like buff

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.149 
one of these flat brushes to like buff
it<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.599> and<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.409> doesn't<00:01:49.770> look<00:01:49.829> as<00:01:50.099> good

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
it in and it just doesn't look as good

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.679 
it in and it just doesn't look as good
so<00:01:50.549> we're<00:01:50.639> gonna<00:01:50.759> start<00:01:51.029> off<00:01:51.209> with<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.509> Too

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.659 
so we're gonna start off with the Too
