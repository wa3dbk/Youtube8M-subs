 when my question is that I shot for 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.820
 the good gap was something for the first time 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.980
 that I saw this dance was something that 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.379
 liked it very much because it was something 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.290
 awesome that I saw misfortunes 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.930
 I know how to teach from the 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.210
 beginning and I am enjoying thanks to him 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.160

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.400

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.780
 so much effort and feeling to this 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.920
 urban culture called breakdance 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:06.120
 it is my passion neither strong nor a feeling 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:10.500

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.110

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.730
 in members of the game in my own world 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.459
 where I can be a great leader to be 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.480
 a great professional to be the best in the 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.200

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.140
 the best 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.440
 my goal is to become very big 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.300
 big and I'll represent my country 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.800
 Ecuador 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:37.620
 it's the best and I think I'll dance to where 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.780
 can continue dancing after sentences and 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:49.470
 living residue and you to dance until the 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:51.360
 Death is alive and even death me 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.560
 You can hit and represent your waters and 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.650
 if you ask me what I liked about the king give 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.659
 I mainly like everything but what 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.180
 I'm most struck by the power and 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:06.080
 the frizz 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.080
 this is a gift 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.550
 I do not have and that will take advantage 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.020
 to be a professional like 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.680
 being was in saying the practice is 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.680
 of the teacher 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.340
 and roll over 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.009
 What question is what motivates me? 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.229
 to continue dancing 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:31.139
 the truth that everything started with a 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:33.240
 great expectation I did not know what 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.320
 I was the king but I liked what the 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.020
 dance 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.510
 and so we are motivated to keep dancing is 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.560
 overcome to overcome me and represent in 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.810

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:56.229
 take cool choreography so that 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:06:00.039
 the other spears are inspired and so 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:02.529
 keep dancing only to demonstrate 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:05.939
 what it is to be a record a passion of 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.939
