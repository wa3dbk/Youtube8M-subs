also<00:01:03.270> Toyota<00:01:03.870> technology<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.559> we've

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
also Toyota technology that we've

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.649 
also Toyota technology that we've

created with the aerodynamic fins what
this<00:01:06.840> does<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.350> instead<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.070> car

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
this does is that instead of the car

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.770 
this does is that instead of the car
going<00:01:08.520> against<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.180> wind<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.689> gonna

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
going against the wind it's gonna

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.870 
going against the wind it's gonna
actually<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> wind<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.640> what<00:01:11.760> it

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
actually go with the wind so what it

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.760 
actually go with the wind so what it
does<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.420> brings<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.720> wind<00:01:12.990> cuts<00:01:13.619> in

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
does is that it brings the wind cuts in

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.280 
does is that it brings the wind cuts in
through<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.070> line<00:01:14.340> take<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.090> over<00:01:15.869> here
