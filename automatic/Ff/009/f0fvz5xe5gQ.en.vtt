if<00:02:08.539> you<00:02:08.659> are<00:02:08.750> using<00:02:09.019> the<00:02:09.229> system<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:10.159> get<00:02:10.399> in

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
if you are using the system you get in

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.220 
if you are using the system you get in
you<00:02:10.789> stand<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.180> field<00:02:11.390> called<00:02:11.599> you<00:02:11.870> hummed<00:02:12.049> on

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
you stand a field called you hummed on

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.979 
you stand a field called you hummed on
the<00:02:12.319> baffle<00:02:12.680> up<00:02:12.830> all<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:13.940> do<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.599> pan<00:02:14.810> down

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
the baffle up all you do is the pan down

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.980 
the baffle up all you do is the pan down
here<00:02:15.200> Wiggy<00:02:15.500> is<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:16.450> pull<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.569> piece<00:02:17.810> of

here Wiggy is you pull this piece of

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.960 
here Wiggy is you pull this piece of
velcro<00:02:18.200> apart<00:02:18.680> that's<00:02:19.250> quite<00:02:19.430> nifty<00:02:19.730> in

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
velcro apart that's quite nifty in

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.040 
velcro apart that's quite nifty in
itself<00:02:20.330> when

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
itself when

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.660 
itself when
not<00:02:21.230> being<00:02:21.410> used<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.800> keep<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.100> sealed<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:22.610> it

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
not being used to keep it sealed so it

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.670 
not being used to keep it sealed so it
doesn't<00:02:22.940> stick<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.150> your<00:02:23.330> clothing<00:02:23.590> but<00:02:24.590> when

doesn't stick to your clothing but when

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.280 
doesn't stick to your clothing but when
you're<00:02:24.800> going<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:24.980> use<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.340> undo<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:26.290> take

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
you're going to use it undo that take

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.340 
you're going to use it undo that take
the<00:02:27.440> other<00:02:27.470> side<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:29.450> quite<00:02:29.690> simply<00:02:30.080> stick

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
the other side and quite simply stick

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.920 
the other side and quite simply stick
that<00:02:30.530> on<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.880> now<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.060> battle<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.570> done<00:02:32.630> up

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
that on and now the battle is done up

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.320 
that on and now the battle is done up
once<00:02:33.410> that's<00:02:33.740> over<00:02:33.980> your<00:02:34.370> shoulders<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.090> done

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
once that's over your shoulders and done

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.760 
once that's over your shoulders and done
up<00:02:35.510> there<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.840> draw<00:02:36.140> cord<00:02:36.170> on<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.650> other

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
up there is a draw cord on the other

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.110 
up there is a draw cord on the other
side<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.220> can<00:02:37.340> tighten<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.790> up<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:37.970> little

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
side so you can tighten it up a little

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.350 
side so you can tighten it up a little
bit<00:02:38.470> it's<00:02:39.470> brilliant<00:02:40.040> really<00:02:40.700> raises<00:02:41.270> the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
bit it's brilliant really raises the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.610 
bit it's brilliant really raises the
temperature<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.110> back<00:02:42.320> quite

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
temperature of the back quite

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.640 
temperature of the back quite
considerably<00:02:43.810> so<00:02:44.810> you're<00:02:44.990> there<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.290> go<00:02:45.440> so

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
considerably so you're there you go so

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.820 
considerably so you're there you go so
there's<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.980> system<00:02:46.430> in<00:02:46.610> itself<00:02:47.300> okay<00:02:48.080> we

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
there's the system in itself okay we

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.400 
there's the system in itself okay we
think<00:02:49.070> it's<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.310> fantastic<00:02:49.820> sleeping<00:02:50.720> bag<00:02:50.930> but

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
think it's a fantastic sleeping bag but

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.050 
think it's a fantastic sleeping bag but
what<00:02:51.560> we'll<00:02:51.710> do<00:02:51.860> now<00:02:52.040> is<00:02:52.070> we'll<00:02:52.310> move<00:02:52.460> on<00:02:52.730> to

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
what we'll do now is we'll move on to

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.750

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
not stowed in its compression sack if

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.510 
not stowed in its compression sack if
you<00:03:35.600> keep<00:03:35.810> it<00:03:35.989> in<00:03:36.110> its<00:03:36.200> compression<00:03:36.830> site<00:03:37.070> what

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
you keep it in its compression site what

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.040 
you keep it in its compression site what
will<00:03:37.610> happen<00:03:37.700> is<00:03:37.970> that<00:03:38.000> damned<00:03:38.360> will<00:03:38.570> compress

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
will happen is that damned will compress

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.490 
will happen is that damned will compress
and<00:03:39.350> it<00:03:39.920> will<00:03:40.070> lose<00:03:40.310> its<00:03:40.340> loft<00:03:41.000> so<00:03:41.959> this<00:03:42.320> is<00:03:42.350> the

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
and it will lose its loft so this is the

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.760 
and it will lose its loft so this is the
way<00:03:42.739> to<00:03:42.800> keep<00:03:43.100> it<00:03:43.280> stowed<00:03:44.020> but<00:03:45.020> there<00:03:45.320> is<00:03:45.590> the

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
way to keep it stowed but there is the

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.920 
way to keep it stowed but there is the
bag<00:03:46.010> as<00:03:46.280> it<00:03:46.400> comes<00:03:46.640> to<00:03:46.880> you<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.209> other<00:03:47.810> thing
