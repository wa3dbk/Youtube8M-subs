knees<00:02:10.800> art<00:02:11.459> because<00:02:12.300> both<00:02:12.480> animate<00:02:12.959> show

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
knees art because both animate show

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.640 
knees art because both animate show
a<00:02:13.579> building<00:02:14.579> with<00:02:14.969> cherry<00:02:15.480> blossoms<00:02:16.079> and<00:02:16.260> even

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
a building with cherry blossoms and even

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.339 
a building with cherry blossoms and even
the<00:02:16.769> colors<00:02:17.069> for<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.340> atmosphere<00:02:18.150> were<00:02:18.510> quite

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
the colors for the atmosphere were quite

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.550 
the colors for the atmosphere were quite
similar<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.249> it's<00:02:20.790> just<00:02:20.879> funny<00:02:21.269> because<00:02:21.560> yami

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
similar and it's just funny because yami

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.250 
similar and it's just funny because yami
no<00:02:22.590> matsuei<00:02:22.680> was<00:02:23.430> what<00:02:23.730> five<00:02:24.299> years<00:02:24.329> ago<00:02:25.019> and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
no matsuei was what five years ago and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.589 
no matsuei was what five years ago and
yet<00:02:25.590> they<00:02:25.889> still<00:02:25.950> have<00:02:26.459> that<00:02:26.700> kind<00:02:26.999> of<00:02:27.090> art<00:02:27.329> or

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
yet they still have that kind of art or

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.239 
yet they still have that kind of art or
maybe<00:02:27.900> I'm<00:02:28.049> just<00:02:28.079> too<00:02:28.319> skeptical<00:02:28.859> when<00:02:29.159> it

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:29.249 
maybe I'm just too skeptical when it

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.160 
maybe I'm just too skeptical when it
comes<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.549> art<00:02:29.760> because<00:02:30.209> I've<00:02:30.420> seen<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:30.989> many

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
comes to art because I've seen so many

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.789 
comes to art because I've seen so many
animes<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.219> season<00:02:32.670> with<00:02:33.030> much<00:02:33.930> better<00:02:34.379> art

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
animes the season with much better art

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.300 
animes the season with much better art
than<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:36.239> anime<00:02:36.780> for<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.650> characters<00:02:38.069> there

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
than this anime for the characters there

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.429 
than this anime for the characters there
are<00:02:38.489> some<00:02:38.790> really<00:02:38.939> interesting<00:02:39.439> characters

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
are some really interesting characters

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.699 
are some really interesting characters
all<00:02:40.680> by<00:02:41.040> some<00:02:41.849> are<00:02:42.150> also<00:02:42.629> cliche<00:02:43.200> but<00:02:43.469> I'm

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
all by some are also cliche but I'm

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.020 
all by some are also cliche but I'm
still<00:02:43.919> waiting<00:02:44.249> to<00:02:44.280> see<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.639> character

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
still waiting to see the character

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.000 
still waiting to see the character
developments<00:02:45.689> for<00:02:45.959> each<00:02:46.260> character<00:02:46.500> since

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
developments for each character since

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.740 
developments for each character since
this<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.519> first<00:02:47.669> episode<00:02:48.329> it<00:02:48.569> only

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
this is the first episode it only

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.470 
this is the first episode it only
introduces<00:02:49.409> us<00:02:49.590> again<00:02:50.159> to<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:51.269> main

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
introduces us again to the main

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.349 
introduces us again to the main
characters<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:52.409> I<00:02:52.709> guess<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.730> supporting

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
characters and I guess the supporting

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.809 
characters and I guess the supporting
characters<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:55.230> at<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.620> same<00:02:55.799> time<00:02:55.859> to<00:02:56.669> the

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
characters and at the same time to the

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.030 
characters and at the same time to the
preliminary<00:02:57.000> facts<00:02:57.689> in<00:02:57.900> which<00:02:58.079> this<00:02:58.469> world<00:02:58.799> is

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
preliminary facts in which this world is

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.640 
preliminary facts in which this world is
based<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.459> overall<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.629> enjoyed<00:03:00.659> this<00:03:01.230> anime

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
based on overall I enjoyed this anime

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.839 
based on overall I enjoyed this anime
but<00:03:02.099> am<00:03:02.639> I<00:03:03.449> excited<00:03:03.840> for<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.379> next<00:03:04.500> episode

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849

but am I excited for the next episode
hmm<00:03:05.849> not<00:03:06.209> really<00:03:06.239> it's<00:03:07.199> not<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.590> kind<00:03:07.799> of

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:07.949 
hmm not really it's not that kind of

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:11.270 
hmm not really it's not that kind of
anomie<00:03:08.340> which<00:03:08.719> made<00:03:09.719> me<00:03:09.930> really<00:03:10.409> excited<00:03:10.650> for

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280

anomie which made me really excited for
and<00:03:11.849> I<00:03:12.449> didn't<00:03:12.719> really<00:03:12.840> feel<00:03:12.959> anything

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
and I didn't really feel anything

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.140 
and I didn't really feel anything
special<00:03:13.859> for<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.579> just<00:03:14.609> thought<00:03:14.909> it<00:03:15.060> was

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
special for it I just thought it was

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.939 
special for it I just thought it was
really<00:03:15.209> funny<00:03:15.510> when<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:16.019> was<00:03:16.230> watching<00:03:16.409> it<00:03:16.769> and

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:16.949 
really funny when I was watching it and

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:20.330 
really funny when I was watching it and
that<00:03:17.549> is<00:03:17.729> why<00:03:17.909> i'm<00:03:18.180> giving<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.689> a<00:03:18.840> 7<00:03:19.349> /<00:03:19.620> 10<00:03:19.979> now

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
that is why i'm giving it a 7 / 10 now

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.640 
that is why i'm giving it a 7 / 10 now
could<00:03:20.549> this<00:03:20.639> anime<00:03:21.120> improve<00:03:21.569> of<00:03:21.930> course<00:03:22.379> it

but<00:03:29.699> for<00:03:29.939> my<00:03:30.030> first<00:03:30.239> impression<00:03:30.870> i'm<00:03:31.169> not<00:03:31.590> so

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
but for my first impression i'm not so

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.979 
but for my first impression i'm not so
impressed<00:03:32.340> but<00:03:32.669> at<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:32.939> same<00:03:33.120> time<00:03:33.329> i<00:03:33.540> had<00:03:33.720> fun

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
impressed but at the same time i had fun

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.319 
impressed but at the same time i had fun
watching<00:03:34.229> it<00:03:34.590> now<00:03:34.739> being<00:03:35.099> a<00:03:35.220> Sean<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.699> comedy

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.229 
watching it now being a Sean and comedy
and<00:03:36.769> supernatural<00:03:37.769> anime<00:03:37.979> I<00:03:38.310> do<00:03:38.370> expect<00:03:38.759> a<00:03:39.030> lot

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
and supernatural anime I do expect a lot

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.749 
and supernatural anime I do expect a lot
from<00:03:39.299> this<00:03:39.720> because<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.859> premise<00:03:41.280> has<00:03:41.489> so

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:41.759 
from this because the premise has so

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:44.240 
from this because the premise has so
much<00:03:41.939> potential<00:03:42.449> it<00:03:42.959> can<00:03:43.199> go<00:03:43.409> from<00:03:43.439> numerous

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
much potential it can go from numerous

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.839 
much potential it can go from numerous
to<00:03:44.939> serious<00:03:45.359> so<00:03:45.599> it<00:03:45.689> has<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.900> lot<00:03:46.259> of<00:03:46.290> leeway<00:03:47.069> to
