Hi Guys Jemile of The Cricket School Here

00:00:03.747 --> 00:00:07.770
What we are doing in this video is - we've 
 got a young lad how contacted us on twitter

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.570

00:00:20.709 --> 00:00:25.800
OK Guys - so what i am looking for from my wicket-keepers and 
 i am keeping an eye on are 3 key things 

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:34.030
Head in that i am looking to see my keepers are moving their heads to 
 the line and then adjusting their heads to the length of the ball

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.644
and then adjusting their heads to the length of the ball

00:00:37.814 --> 00:00:44.634
Hands in that i am looking to see that my Keepers 
 are maintaining a nice wide catching area with their hands

00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:51.189
And Feet - in that there Feet are moving together as a unit

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:55.585
and the keeper is staying on the balls of 
 his feet as much as he can

00:00:55.023 --> 00:00:59.374
in order to make Sharp Quick Small Adjustments to the ball

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.337
Ok Firstly in this clip - what we are seeing here - 
 is that our keeper has got a slightly lazy right foot

00:01:05.337 --> 00:01:11.449
In that his left foot is pointing in the right 
 direction towards the bowler &amp;amp; down the wicket

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:14.241
but his right foot is off at a different angle

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:19.450
so the 1st thing we need to do is to get 
 both of those feet aligned up in the same way

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.676
the left foot is correct - we just need to 
 get the right foot pointing in the same direction

00:01:24.676 --> 00:01:31.748
and have the same angle of bend in our legs through both legs

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:42.870
the way in which we do this is pretty simple - just take your time - &amp;amp; make sure before 
 you take a take - that the feeder - or the feeder throws the potential take that 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:02:07.320
In addition to this i'd like to see our keeper bring his 2 feet closer together - 
 i think they are a touch too far apart - 8 inches closer would be good

00:02:07.324 --> 00:02:27.880
Some Keeper have a preference to keep their feet wider - that's ok - there's no set rule for 
 me - as longer as they are catching the ball well there's nothing more important than that

00:02:31.373 --> 00:02:40.160
but in this Keepers instance he needs to bring 
 his feet at least 8 inches closer together

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.800
last thing i want to say is that in 
 the footage we've seen of our keeper

00:02:44.050 --> 00:03:00.340
in the footage we've seen of our keeper he is taking a lot of balls quickly ..however if you 
 want to improve ....you need to slow down the repetition rate to concentrate on getting your alignment right

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:17.170
for wicket keepers for this kind of thing slower is better and check your alignment very carefully 
 - go through ball repetition quite slowly in order to check that you've done everything properly

00:03:21.596 --> 00:03:32.910
