interesting not too easy it's going to

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.120 
interesting not too easy it's going to
be<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.450> bit<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.989> challenge<00:03:13.230> not<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:13.799> much<00:03:13.980> the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
be a bit of a challenge not so much the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.560 
be a bit of a challenge not so much the
championship<00:03:14.610> because<00:03:14.760> there's<00:03:15.000> not<00:03:15.269> many

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
championship because there's not many

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.020 
championship because there's not many
hard<00:03:15.959> opponents<00:03:16.590> but<00:03:17.280> but<00:03:17.640> I'm<00:03:17.790> probably

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
hard opponents but but I'm probably

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.900 
hard opponents but but I'm probably
under<00:03:18.420> estimating<00:03:19.019> it<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:20.160> first<00:03:20.400> game<00:03:20.610> off

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
under estimating it the first game off

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.140 
under estimating it the first game off
is<00:03:21.480> have<00:03:21.930> one<00:03:22.170> cup<00:03:22.470> against<00:03:23.070> Malcolm<00:03:23.430> which

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
is have one cup against Malcolm which

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.500 
is have one cup against Malcolm which
should<00:03:24.780> be<00:03:25.049> a<00:03:25.080> routine<00:03:25.350> victory<00:03:25.799> but<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:27.239> was

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
should be a routine victory but it was

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.600 
should be a routine victory but it was
dragging<00:03:28.230> on<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.320> bit<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.709> nil<00:03:28.860> nil<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.430> then

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
dragging on a bit and nil nil and then

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.630 
dragging on a bit and nil nil and then
I'll<00:03:30.510> get<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.840> board<00:03:30.989> McGoldrick<00:03:31.650> nice<00:03:32.280> run
