00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello and welcome for 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.330
 Windows as you know it was 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.970
 windows media center for a while 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.990
 free to download now you have to 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.849
 pay for it 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.580
 it is not free anymore but there are 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.109
 very good replacement for this we want two 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.289
 Let's start with them today 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.279
 the media portal we are currently at 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.090
 installation i have that 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.800
 downloaded 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.910
 then you will find the link in the video 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.930
 description goes on 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.520
 So let's start with the installation 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.370
 Now you can choose if you like 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.710
 Watching TV or not if they are 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.540
 have no tv card then brings that 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.070
 I do not watch TV 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.760
 Do not watch TV then too 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.829
 further can be either custom 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.710
 or automatically I now make time 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.820
 users then you can here 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.730
 adjustable the whole can be installed 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.719
 then we should install on 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.309
 the whole program 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:03.180
 once downloaded and installed 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:05.119
 instead a small one is alike 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.950
 It can not be too long now 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.110
 they have almost the same here 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.750
 possibilities as under the windows 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.250
 media center that means you can go here 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.159
 play your music you can 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.610
 internet radio so listen in addition 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.659
 you can play your pictures videos 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.729
 and as mentioned you should have a tv card 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.790
 then it is possible also shipments 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.950
 and then take these on their 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.040
 hard disk and either 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.430
 as dvd to burn or even stop 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.930
 to rework once the directx 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.500
 downloaded that he needs for the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:49.350
 graphics card finished the whole package is 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.600
 then software itself is only 24 mb 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.610
 big but it will be the data 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.479
 downloaded as you see here 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.450
 then we will need these files 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.040
 still installed the media portal and 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.540
 the windows firewall is coming 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.630
 Everything else is already figured 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.630

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.750
 The finished but the whole 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.230
 Installed 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.230
 quite quickly 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.720
 next is the media portal 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:18.050
 installed as I said is finally 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.050
 then configure windows firewall 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.970
 that art already installed 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.970
 business media portal 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.950
 we are done when the whole thing something 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.320
 already finished and opened the homepage 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.690
 but we do not want that but we 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:57.960
 want to start is mediaportal be 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:59.520
 talk to either the experts 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:13.980
 use mode or the standard as before 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:16.049
 Internet standard whole with ok 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:26.000
 all can confirm here 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:29.000
 make adjustments we open 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 so 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.929
 with me is at the first installation 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.699
 take the whole course a little 

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:49.519
 longer 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:51.499
 then it starts as you see 

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:57.499
 we can really do everything with it now 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:05:01.069
 make pictures or music settings 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:01.519
 other videos i can do a disc 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:03.289
 play 

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:06.589
 he also downloads himself from internet 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:11.869
 cover to it or the tracks should times 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:14.209
 music is that we have no tears 

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:15.129
 no music means that means we go 

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:17.059
 back again 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.969
 That means I can here for example 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:28.429
 after playing the title and everything around 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:29.719
 not back pictures we can 

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:30.939
 here for example here all 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:33.289
 change settings 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:37.039
 Generally the indicator can not be more 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:43.490
 other set I can her 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:47.360

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.619

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.929
 they can do anything 

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:54.129
