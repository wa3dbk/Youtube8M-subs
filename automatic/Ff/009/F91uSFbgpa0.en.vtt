 If you go with the same pen or something while you go out easily 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:02.190
 I will exchange the hose with and remove this kind of part removed the noise 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.239
 Now the crankcase will be in full view 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.520
 This is a crankcase 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.110
 I'm stopping the basic at 8 b, but I'm sorry for the anchor of this brake 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.580

 At first we remove one piece of honey in the clamp of the brake saying cost 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.150

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.019
 Whether to return ah 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.019
 Let's make sure when you remove it 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.240
 Let's give a live ball if the birds are bad 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.940
 I 'm just playing around 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:55.000
 Here 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:55.000
 If you take off this here and take off like this wire and clean it around 9 u + 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.620
 I think back 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.000
 Oh 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.240
 Once yeah 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.500
 I'm doing 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.480
 Here 17mm 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.530
 This is the was Sadzu 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.170
 Remove the face 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.840
 Next 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.000
 Clutch is 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.450
 Haa 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.450
 You talk 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.920
 Will continue to turn the 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:31.800
 It is lemon that I can choose it and clutch together, and I change it to a new belt from this stretching 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:34.890
 I'd Teru Once Tsuite before that but I am this old belt 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.280
 It may be a bit difficult to understand but the thickness is different already 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.350
 If you do the same belt, the thickness is different 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.630
 appear 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:49.830
 Because it is visible , it is in the range of b what the thickness is different, but this is quite a big difference 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:53.720
 Let's exchange to buy the portion that is thinner than the Well Nde come 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.629
 Furthermore putty is turned over and bought again 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.400
 From the mail 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:03.040
 The other guy who is said to have 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:04.080
 Te immediately Sumarisu and took engine When you purchase Let's exchange with you Qi is in Pashin 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.460
 Are 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.220
 Weight roller school 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.420
 Weight roller enters 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.010
 To check whether Grams or okay it is also not astringent 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.910
 What 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.690
 I am exchanging 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:23.630
 Nde in this Let's Yari make sure there is that has also become a muddy 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.630
 I like this do but I was way you are raised in the clean in this 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.470
 I can see this side 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.470
 Taken from here 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:38.889
 So sure as may work with this starter motor Dane's 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.009
 In was in and Eberuto public 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.920
 It is how to put in, but this is the low price said to be torque cam 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:48.529
 Like this 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:51.230
 I have a feeling but I have no power 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:54.120
 Nde not a Toka special tool 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.470
 I'll go in if I'm sorry 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.130
 Follow 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.130
 If so 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.390
 I'm saving a little time for the capacity of the video 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.390
 The 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.740
 Follow 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:23.240
 I'd Tokoaru be confirmed in addition though is the Toka missing Kaiserslautern, for example, a centrifugal clutch 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:26.210
 There are a lot of things like a spring or a groove with a torque curve 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:30.009
 It runs at your convenience 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:33.550
 In there was rice and exchange in this 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:38.849
 The following is only going to put in the reverse time being 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.849
 There is a procedure up to the removal belt replacement
