as you can see in the top right hand
side<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.080> corner<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.560> listed<00:00:20.100> all<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
side of the corner I listed all the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.830 
side of the corner I listed all the
balance<00:00:20.789> changes<00:00:20.970> like<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.570> know<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.750> actual

balance changes like you know the actual
numbers<00:00:22.320> behind<00:00:22.590> them<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.670> can<00:00:23.760> read<00:00:23.970> that

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
numbers behind them so you can read that

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.310 
numbers behind them so you can read that
at<00:00:24.240> your<00:00:24.330> own<00:00:24.449> leisure<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:24.900> more<00:00:25.140> or<00:00:25.199> less

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
at your own leisure but more or less

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.769 
at your own leisure but more or less
what<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:27.090> flat<00:00:27.330> damage<00:00:27.660> on

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
what it is is the the flat damage on

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.419 
what it is is the the flat damage on
both<00:00:27.930> are<00:00:28.050> normal<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.439> spider<00:00:28.740> form<00:00:29.039> Q<00:00:29.279> is

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
both are normal in spider form Q is

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.639 
both are normal in spider form Q is
lowered<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:31.500> max<00:00:31.859> percent<00:00:32.550> damage<00:00:33.469> the<00:00:34.469> max

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
lowered the max percent damage the max

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.290 
lowered the max percent damage the max
damage<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> percent

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
damage it can do because a percent

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.959 
damage it can do because a percent
damage<00:00:36.390> two<00:00:36.630> monsters<00:00:37.079> has<00:00:37.200> been<00:00:37.380> lowered<00:00:37.969> so

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
damage two monsters has been lowered so

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.720 
damage two monsters has been lowered so
let's<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.540> biggest<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.170> lower<00:00:40.500> her<00:00:40.770> early

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
let's just biggest to lower her early

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.200 
let's just biggest to lower her early
game<00:00:42.469> we<00:00:43.469> call<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.829> objective<00:00:44.700> control<00:00:45.180> I

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
game we call it objective control I

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.889 
game we call it objective control I
suppose<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> jungle<00:00:46.050> control<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:48.750> there's

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
suppose a jungle control and there's

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.779 
suppose a jungle control and there's
actually<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> second<00:00:49.710> component<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
actually a second component to the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.010 
actually a second component to the
changes<00:00:51.660> here<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.910> her<00:00:53.910> normal<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.899> me

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
changes here in that her normal for me

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.549 
changes here in that her normal for me
the<00:00:55.379> cocoon<00:00:55.850> that<00:00:56.960> stun<00:00:57.960> has<00:00:58.199> been<00:00:58.350> nerfed

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
the cocoon that stun has been nerfed

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.500 
the cocoon that stun has been nerfed
early<00:00:58.980> game<00:00:59.160> but<00:00:59.340> buff<00:00:59.489> late<00:00:59.850> games<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.359> guess

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
early game but buff late games I guess

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.000 
early game but buff late games I guess
they<00:01:00.629> wanted<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.960> scale<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> bit<00:01:01.469> better<00:01:01.649> later

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
they wanted to scale a bit better later

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.770 
they wanted to scale a bit better later
but<00:01:02.250> not<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.550> not<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:03.000> good<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.600> sort<00:01:03.750> of

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
but not be not as good with this sort of

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.330 
but not be not as good with this sort of
1.13<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.949> stuns<00:01:05.220> people<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:05.670> 1.5<00:01:06.270> seconds

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
1.13 that stuns people for 1.5 seconds

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.300 
1.13 that stuns people for 1.5 seconds
also<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> repeal<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.090> spider<00:01:09.390> form<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:10.080> hurry

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
also the repeal the spider form of hurry

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.469 
also the repeal the spider form of hurry
that's<00:01:11.310> been<00:01:11.490> changed<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:11.939> she<00:01:12.000> actually<00:01:12.210> has

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
that's been changed so she actually has

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.300 
that's been changed so she actually has
a<00:01:12.510> lower<00:01:12.810> cooldown<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.189> bit

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
a lower cooldown on that so it's a bit

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.030 
a lower cooldown on that so it's a bit
of<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.460> late<00:01:14.640> game<00:01:14.850> buff<00:01:15.060> again<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.570> her<00:01:16.040> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
of a late game buff again for her and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.440 
of a late game buff again for her and
there's<00:01:17.250> also<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.460> riot<00:01:17.700> post<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.150> basically

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
there's also a riot post it basically

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.260 
there's also a riot post it basically
says<00:01:18.689> everything<00:01:19.049> I'm<00:01:19.409> saying<00:01:19.650> here<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.970> makes
