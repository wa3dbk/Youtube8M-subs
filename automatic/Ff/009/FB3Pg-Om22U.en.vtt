00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.100
 all welcome on my channel and 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.170
 today we will do the bow reverse 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.880
 constructions at the end of the video I will explain 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.880
 working principle of this onion 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.730
 but 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.840
 and life 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:38.460
 as he breaks wove this here in moderation 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:40.440
 somewhere from 20 30 meters good brush city 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.260
 first, take a wooden plank 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.560
 15 millimeters thick and 30 wide 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.360
 millimeters and divide it into four parts 2 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.330
 27 centimeters 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.869
 one piece 50 centimeters and another 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.300
 planochka 87 centimeters next step 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.119
 we take two short planochki and in each 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.729
 of them we make three holes from 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.210
 edges you need to enter by 13 millimeters and 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.920
 11 centimeters from one of the edges 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.530
 the next step is to take the average plan and 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.480
 mark the middle and from the center to each 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.880
 side note three and a half 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.310
 centimeter and make a hole there and 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.709
 make two more center holes on 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.650
 around 11 centimeters and more 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.050
 hole near the edge as follows 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.360
 step we need 4 similar video 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.790
 you can get them in the car market 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.280
 each is used to raise glass in 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.260
 machines all we have to do is collect 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.640
 our design but before that I decided 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.640
 paint all the details 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.150
 then take the average length of the bar and 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:57.800
 attach to it long at around 28 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:03:01.390
 centimeters from the edge I will do it with 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.390
 glue and a pair of screws 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.629
 now at the edges of the middle bar fix 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.040
 short planochki it will be the shoulders of the bow 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.959
 did it with a regular bolt 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.969
 I want to note that you need a hole 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.349
 drill so diameter to god 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:22.349
 entered there from there along the thread 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.680
 this same repeat on the other side 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.050
 very important to the shoulders of our bow 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.600
 moving easily and without undue friction 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.210
 the next step is to take our videos and 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.960
 fix them on the average plan points and 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.960
 onion shoulders 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.780
 now we put a string on our design 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.420
 for this we make a couple of holes in 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.300
 average planochka fix the rope there and 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.940
 we pass it through the rollers on the shoulders of the bow 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.590
 now turn our design and on 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:11.440
 long planochka fix steel 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:13.709
 plate with screws and fasten to 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.109
 This plate has a suitable spring 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.970
 then take another piece of rope 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.220
 we fasten it and on the shoulders of the bow we pass 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.700
 her through the rest of the videos and through 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.800
 spring 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.570
 ropes in this design need 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.300
 thereby to pull up 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.530
 stringing the spring was already in 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.200
 tense state 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.360
 further took two toothbrushes and made from 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.640
 them stand for arrows so arrow 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.070
 will fly free from the bow 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.740
 added the handle here in this place and 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.740
 strengthened our design with lightweight springs 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.560
 from the expander let's check now 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.480
 force is the beginning of my bow this principle 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.669
 constructions similar to block 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.800
 sports bow with eccentrics that is 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.200
 when tensioning the string load slowly 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.900
 increases in the middle of the point is the load 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.600
 maximum after passing the middle 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.190
 this load is reduced this allows 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.729
 keep the string tense 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.800
 with minimal effort 13 kilograms 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.250
 the middle point and then as you can see 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.380
 the load is reduced to three kilograms 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.780
 when lowering the string the load was not 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.330
 more than five kilos meaning force 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.910
 shots arrows get only five 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.770
 kilograms and despite that arrows 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.280
 fly out at tremendous speed as you 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.260
 may have noticed when releasing the boom on 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.020
 Russian on her in slowly increases and 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.820
 slowly declining due to which it is not 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.890
 warped and shooting accuracy 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.880
 let's rise now a little 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.880
 we'll shoot 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:17.039
 all at once his goal 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.199
 That's basically all I wanted with you 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.389
 share must put likes 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:24.000
 subscribe to my channel will continue 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:26.270
 many similar interesting videos to new 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.270
 meeting
