 really colors but we do not care 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.170
 if the game is limited to the simplest 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.389
 it nevertheless has a unique charm 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.280
 no other title has managed to match 

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:47.319

 totally concept this is about 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.120
 head in domino on paws on 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.280
 different circuits 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.140
 your goal will be to drop dominoes 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.510
 all along the track avoiding 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.580
 obstacles sometimes twisted once mr 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.410
 domino will have made a tour or several 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.940
 you can trigger the reaction in 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.470
 chain by hitting the first domino 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.270
 posing the game gives pride of place to 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.740
 combos got by triggering 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.940
 special events scattered a little 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.920
 everywhere on the track 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.450
 no time limit only a bad 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.370
 managing your character can you

 conduct a game over indeed you can 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.940
 keep pressing the button 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.160
 to drop the dominoes but the endurance 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.270
 of mr domino will diminish what is 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.980
 will translate to the nut by a 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.810
 darkening of this one once 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.520
 exhausted he will become a domino again 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.080
 what is more normal and therefore does not 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.360
 can make no movement and your 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.650
 party will then be finished the game is not 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.150
 very long but still offers a 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.780
 challenge especially in the 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.970
 last levels 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.860
 you will have to learn the layout and its 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.060
 dangers parker in order to be able to triumph 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.800
 last tests 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.300
 add to that several characters 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.070
 unlockable each having a gameplay 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.110
 different and you'll really have something 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.820
 to do without pretense the game 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.350
 still reveals very addictive and 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.269
 trigger all iphone will make you 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.400
 go through many emotions of the 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.980
 simple laugh has a big dose of what the 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.720
 fuck no one can stop mister domino is 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.000
 a game to book for scorers 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.980
 who breaks with this title of what to occupy 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.410
 a lot of evening before landing a 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.600
 perfect combo and perfect combos you 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.010
 would like also in harmful park 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.450
 the latter being a shoot them up and 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.100
 like any good shoot them up that gets 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.850
 respects the scoring is once again 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.560
 in the spotlight 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.910
 my park bulbs is not a shoot 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.950
 them up ordinary that gets taken to 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.480
 serious like gradius scraps or 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.800
 more recently the donkey patxi for 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.150
 mention only these examples 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.070
 a pool by which is a little in the same 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.840
 mind that the now famous parodius 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.430
 everything is thought to be in total 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.080
 shift with the situation 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.660
 starting with the scenario 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.050
 the environment your weapons but also the 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.300
 enemies 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.350
 indeed without speaking of the scenario you 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.120
 you will find yourself at the controls of a 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.130
 wacky craft capable of firing 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.630
 sweet potatoes that my sense 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.769
 figured out when you get tired of 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.209
 swing potatoes at the 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.470
 face of your enemies you can 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.540
 try one of the other three weapons that 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.919
 are the apple pie the ice cream or the 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.180
 jelly yes yes it's all a menu 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.440
 gastronomic that you can use 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.300
 to defend you 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.530
 as you can see 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.729
 environments have nothing to do with 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.349
 the usual standards of 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.999
 maps the battlefield of the game 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.499
 is not space nor great plains 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:38.900
 or villas protect but a park 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:40.129
 Amusement the latter is diverted 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.499
 by a big bad guy and he passes 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.150
 gradually on the dark side and with 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:46.189
 him all the attractions and scenery 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.479
 that they contain harmful park does 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:49.370
 part of these games that looks like 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.650
 the advent of 3d preferred us 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.150
 reward a 2d treat but the appearance 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.370
 title chart would be nothing without 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.689
 the phenomenal atmosphere that emerges from it 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.409
 only real complaint that one could 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:59.120
 do this 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:01.309
 but he suffers from a little soft passage 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.229
 but the comic and crazy side sweeps 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:04.819
 quickly this feeling as much as 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.169
 following your love for the kind you 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.490
 you will enjoy redoing all 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.379
 levels in search of all 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.029
 wacky details in the decor that you 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.830
 would have passed under the nose a pool park 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:14.990
 is a wonderful funny game sometimes 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.309
 inventive and always fun 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.020
 unfortunately, and you had no doubt 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:19.520
 a little game is only released in Japan 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.499
 and so it's very rare 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.539
 impossible to get hold of 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:24.169
 we but do we ever know if one day you 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.550
 to fall on it 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.409
 you'll know right away that this is a 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.099
 nugget to let pass under no 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.749
 pretext 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.279
 it's over for today and as 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:33.620
 you can imagine it remains very much 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:35.270
 unrecognized or unfairly forgotten titles 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.709
 to dissect on the playstation 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.759
 it will be an opportunity for us 

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:40.159
 find in a future issue 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.479
 dedicated to this one is promised this 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:43.249
 will arrive before liters as much of the 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.419
 machine in the meantime do not forget to 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:45.770
 subscribe to the youtube channel of 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.330

 previous issues 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.870
 for my part I find you in two 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:54.189
 weeks to explore 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.189
 treasures from another console 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.570
 the
