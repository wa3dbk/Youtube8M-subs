00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
to see these guys again if Del Rio wins

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.639 
to see these guys again if Del Rio wins
unless<00:01:51.270> they<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> rematch<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.140> Smackdown

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
unless they do a rematch on Smackdown

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.770 
unless they do a rematch on Smackdown
we'd<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:53.189> them<00:01:53.250> again<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.970> Night<00:01:54.750> of

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780

and<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:59.250> think<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.700> also<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.969> problem<00:02:00.270> that

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
and I think this is also a problem that

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.810 
and I think this is also a problem that
raw<00:02:00.509> faces<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.350> besides<00:02:01.710> Big<00:02:02.520> Show<00:02:02.670> and

Dolph Ziggler cashes in and then we

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.110 
Dolph Ziggler cashes in and then we

the next pay-per-view now that may not

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.860 
the next pay-per-view now that may not
be<00:03:03.380> ideal<00:03:04.210> especially<00:03:05.210> since<00:03:05.330> we<00:03:05.480> just<00:03:05.600> had<00:03:05.840> a

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
be ideal especially since we just had a

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.630 
be ideal especially since we just had a
World<00:03:06.140> Heavyweight<00:03:06.680> title<00:03:06.980> match<00:03:07.250> for<00:03:07.580> a

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
fatal 4-way to pay per views ago but I

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.980 
fatal 4-way to pay per views ago but I
think<00:03:10.850> it<00:03:11.000> would<00:03:11.150> be<00:03:11.300> interesting<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.900> it

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
think it would be interesting and it

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.200 
think it would be interesting and it
would<00:03:12.110> be<00:03:12.230> kind<00:03:12.440> of<00:03:12.500> cool<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.680> see<00:03:13.210> Wade

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
would be kind of cool to see Wade

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.330

Barrett Dolph Ziggler Alberto Del Rio
and<00:03:16.489> Sheamus<00:03:16.850> I<00:03:16.970> think<00:03:17.000> they<00:03:17.270> would<00:03:17.420> all<00:03:17.510> make

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
and Sheamus I think they would all make

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.270 
and Sheamus I think they would all make
a<00:03:17.720> good<00:03:17.959> combination<00:03:18.260> as<00:03:18.620> far<00:03:18.800> as<00:03:18.890> a<00:03:18.920> fatal

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
a good combination as far as a fatal

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.280 
a good combination as far as a fatal
4-way<00:03:19.580> match<00:03:19.730> goes<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.239> I<00:03:20.780> think<00:03:21.050> they<00:03:21.170> would

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
4-way match goes and I think they would

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.020 
4-way match goes and I think they would
put<00:03:21.440> on<00:03:21.530> quite<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.800> show<00:03:21.860> now<00:03:22.580> even<00:03:22.760> if<00:03:22.940> they

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
put on quite a show now even if they

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.210 
put on quite a show now even if they
don't<00:03:23.120> do<00:03:23.300> that<00:03:23.480> they<00:03:23.660> could<00:03:23.810> do<00:03:23.989> you<00:03:24.650> know<00:03:24.770> get

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
don't do that they could do you know get

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.470 
don't do that they could do you know get
Sheamus<00:03:25.670> away<00:03:25.790> from<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.060> title<00:03:26.270> picture
