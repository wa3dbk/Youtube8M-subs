00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
and we had created a pretty big

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.560 
and we had created a pretty big
instability<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.520> region<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:39.150> because

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
instability in the region just because

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.710 
instability in the region just because
of<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.810> war<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.259> we<00:01:40.380> were<00:01:40.500> fighting<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
of this war that we were fighting and

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.090 
of this war that we were fighting and
some<00:01:42.720> other<00:01:42.930> things<00:01:43.140> where<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.500> were<00:01:43.740> giving

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
some other things where we were giving

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.859 
some other things where we were giving
funding<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.820> Lao<00:01:44.939> government<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.689> then

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
funding to the Lao government and then

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.450 
funding to the Lao government and then
we<00:01:46.049> stopped<00:01:46.350> doing<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.799> because<00:01:47.040> they<00:01:47.189> didn't

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
we stopped doing it because they didn't

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.399 
we stopped doing it because they didn't
do<00:01:47.579> political<00:01:48.090> things<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:48.420> wanted<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.229> to

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
stabilize the country even more and this

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.859 
stabilize the country even more and this
is<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> lot<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.790> different<00:01:54.030> factors<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.689> in

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
is a lot of different factors going in

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.740 
is a lot of different factors going in
