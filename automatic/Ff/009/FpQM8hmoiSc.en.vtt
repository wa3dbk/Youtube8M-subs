hey it's Ryan from rinette and today

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.690 
hey it's Ryan from rinette and today
we're<00:00:01.890> going<00:00:01.979> to<00:00:02.070> tell<00:00:02.250> you<00:00:02.399> how<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.580> put

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
we're going to tell you how to put

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.190 
we're going to tell you how to put
together<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.179> new<00:00:03.270> Fertile<00:00:03.780> force<00:00:04.020> of

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
together the new Fertile force of

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.869 
together the new Fertile force of
squeegees<00:00:04.620> these<00:00:05.100> squeegees<00:00:05.430> actually<00:00:05.730> come

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
squeegees these squeegees actually come

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.220 
squeegees these squeegees actually come
unassembled<00:00:06.299> but<00:00:06.600> they're<00:00:06.720> really<00:00:06.960> easy<00:00:07.080> to

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
unassembled but they're really easy to

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.629 
unassembled but they're really easy to
put<00:00:07.379> together<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.919> reason<00:00:08.130> they<00:00:08.340> come<00:00:08.490> and

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
put together the reason they come and

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.250 
put together the reason they come and
assemble<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.240> because<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.719> want<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.050> ability

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
assemble is because you want the ability

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.540 
assemble is because you want the ability
to<00:00:10.469> learn<00:00:10.620> how<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.800> put<00:00:11.010> them<00:00:11.099> together<00:00:11.219> that

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
to learn how to put them together that

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.490 
to learn how to put them together that
way<00:00:11.730> they're<00:00:11.910> expandable<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:13.259> can<00:00:13.380> also

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
way they're expandable you can also

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.919 
way they're expandable you can also
easily<00:00:13.799> swap<00:00:14.429> out<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.880> Brit<00:00:15.150> blade<00:00:15.450> replace

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
easily swap out the Brit blade replace

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.680 
easily swap out the Brit blade replace
blade<00:00:16.320> put<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.920> blade<00:00:17.130> around<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:18.240> basically

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
blade put the blade around so basically

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.210 
blade put the blade around so basically
you're<00:00:18.960> going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.109> get<00:00:19.350> some<00:00:19.529> components<00:00:20.100> with

here<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.219> how<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.730> put<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.059> together<00:00:42.210> that's

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
here on how to put it together that's

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.000 
here on how to put it together that's
what<00:00:43.260> we're<00:00:43.379> going<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.530> cover<00:00:43.680> right<00:00:43.980> here

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
what we're going to cover right here

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.619 
what we're going to cover right here
because<00:00:44.520> people<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:44.969> watching<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.360> video

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
because people like watching a video

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.060 
because people like watching a video
instead<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:45.989> reading<00:00:46.260> instructions<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.860> know<00:00:46.950> I

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
instead of reading instructions I know I

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.940 
instead of reading instructions I know I
do<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:48.329> basically<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:49.020> pretty<00:00:49.260> easy<00:00:49.440> what<00:00:49.739> we

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
do so basically it's pretty easy what we

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.979 
do so basically it's pretty easy what we
want<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.340> do<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.550> why<00:00:50.760> insert<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> blade<00:00:51.629> into

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
want to do is why insert the blade into

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.100 
want to do is why insert the blade into
the<00:00:52.949> finish<00:00:53.399> handle<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.969> do<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.449> we're

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the finish handle and to do so we're

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.689 
the finish handle and to do so we're
going<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.410> insert<00:00:55.739> these<00:00:56.010> nuts<00:00:56.340> now<00:00:56.550> these

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
going to insert these nuts now these

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.410 
going to insert these nuts now these
nuts<00:00:57.030> come<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:59.100> bolt<00:00:59.340> screws<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.090> them

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
nuts come with the bolt screws in them

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.650 
nuts come with the bolt screws in them
so<00:01:01.199> I'm<00:01:01.379> going<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:02.000> first<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.210> take<00:01:03.449> them

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
so I'm going to first of all take them

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.320 
so I'm going to first of all take them
all<00:01:03.780> off<00:01:04.610> which<00:01:05.610> just<00:01:05.850> takes<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.150> couple

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
all off which just takes a couple

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.260 
all off which just takes a couple
minutes<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.790> then<00:01:08.790> I'm<00:01:08.939> going<00:01:09.210> to

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
minutes here and then I'm going to

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.030 
minutes here and then I'm going to
insert<00:01:09.720> these<00:01:10.020> guys<00:01:10.460> into<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:13.470> front<00:01:13.799> side<00:01:14.010> of

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
insert these guys into the front side of

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.260 
insert these guys into the front side of
the<00:01:14.189> plane<00:01:14.369> now<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.549> front<00:01:14.850> side<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the plane now the front side of the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.590 
the plane now the front side of the
blade<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.320> side<00:01:16.860> that's<00:01:17.040> colored<00:01:17.600> right

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
blade is the side that's colored right

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.749 
blade is the side that's colored right
now<00:01:18.780> they're<00:01:19.049> colored<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.590> black<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.580> get

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
now they're colored in black and you get

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.370 
now they're colored in black and you get
four<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.150> these<00:01:21.270> depending<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.049> size<00:01:22.259> of

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
four of these depending on the size of

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.480 
four of these depending on the size of
the<00:01:22.470> blade<00:01:22.680> they<00:01:22.890> actually<00:01:23.159> all<00:01:23.280> come

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the blade they actually all come

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.920 
the blade they actually all come
prepackaged<00:01:24.119> with<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.390> correct<00:01:24.630> amount<00:01:24.869> of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
prepackaged with the correct amount of

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.920 
prepackaged with the correct amount of
nuts<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> correct<00:01:26.220> amount<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.970> size

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.300 

so<00:01:30.930> once<00:01:31.110> we've<00:01:31.230> got<00:01:31.350> those<00:01:31.530> all<00:01:31.800> separated

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
so once we've got those all separated

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.560 
so once we've got those all separated
what<00:01:33.120> we'll<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.360> next<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.320> will<00:01:35.390> put<00:01:36.390> all

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
what we'll do next is we will put all

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.280 
what we'll do next is we will put all
these<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:37.080> one<00:01:38.210> at<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.270> time<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:39.870> you<00:01:39.990> use<00:01:40.050> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
these in one at a time if you use the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.170 
these in one at a time if you use the
edge<00:01:40.410> of<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.620> table<00:01:40.800> makes<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.790> kind<00:01:41.940> of<00:01:42.000> easy

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
edge of a table makes it kind of easy

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.170 
edge of a table makes it kind of easy
because<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.930> basically<00:01:43.070> take<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.180> put

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
because you can basically take that put

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.650 
because you can basically take that put
this<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:46.950> pull<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.430> up<00:01:47.630> slide<00:01:48.630> it

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
this in you know pull it up slide it

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.130 
this in you know pull it up slide it
over<00:01:48.960> put<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.370> pull<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.120> up<00:01:51.270> slide<00:01:52.110> it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
over put this and pull it up slide it

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.620 
over put this and pull it up slide it
over<00:01:52.620> just<00:01:53.340> put<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> glasses<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:54.240> pull<00:01:54.480> it<00:01:54.570> up

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
over just put the glasses and pull it up

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.860 
over just put the glasses and pull it up
slide<00:01:54.900> it<00:01:54.930> over<00:01:55.310> those<00:01:56.310> are<00:01:56.490> all<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.760> now<00:01:56.940> then

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
slide it over those are all in now then

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.969 
slide it over those are all in now then
we'll<00:01:58.050> put<00:01:58.290> these<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.800> do<00:01:59.160> one<00:01:59.430> full<00:01:59.790> turn<00:02:00.090> and

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
we'll put these on do one full turn and

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.320 
we'll put these on do one full turn and
make<00:02:01.979> sure<00:02:02.160> it's<00:02:02.340> square<00:02:04.310> do<00:02:05.310> one<00:02:05.550> full<00:02:05.760> turn

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
make sure it's square do one full turn

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.760 
make sure it's square do one full turn
make<00:02:06.780> sure<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:07.110> squared<00:02:07.440> off<00:02:09.290> do<00:02:10.290> one<00:02:10.530> full

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
make sure it's squared off do one full

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.750 
make sure it's squared off do one full
turn<00:02:10.979> make<00:02:11.370> sure<00:02:11.490> it's<00:02:11.640> square<00:02:11.730> off<00:02:13.760> wonderful

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
turn make sure it's square off wonderful

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.270 
turn make sure it's square off wonderful
turn<00:02:14.940> make<00:02:15.180> sure<00:02:15.300> it's<00:02:15.450> square<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.780> off

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
turn make sure it's square it off

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.230 
turn make sure it's square it off
there's<00:02:17.280> actually<00:02:17.550> two<00:02:17.760> ways<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.060> put<00:02:18.180> this

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
there's actually two ways to put this

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.240 
there's actually two ways to put this
together<00:02:18.390> we<00:02:19.230> think<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.740> this<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:19.920> between

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
together we think that this is between

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.710 
together we think that this is between
this<00:02:20.430> way<00:02:20.640> by<00:02:20.820> far<00:02:21.090> because<00:02:21.270> now<00:02:21.420> all<00:02:21.570> you<00:02:21.690> have

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
this way by far because now all you have

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.890 
this way by far because now all you have
to<00:02:21.959> do<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.350> take<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:24.390> lock<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.780> in

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
to do is you take this you lock it in

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.610 
to do is you take this you lock it in
top<00:02:25.110> up<00:02:25.320> here<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.720> then<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.840> slide<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.530> on

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
top up here and then you slide it on

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.820 
top up here and then you slide it on
slide<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.130> down<00:02:29.220> onto<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.520> bolts<00:02:29.820> just<00:02:30.830> slide

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
slide it down onto the bolts just slide

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:39.180 
slide it down onto the bolts just slide
these<00:02:32.010> on<00:02:32.220> one<00:02:32.430> at<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.610> time

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.950 

and<00:02:39.280> that's<00:02:40.090> how<00:02:40.270> easy<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.600> is<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.810> put

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
and that's how easy it is to put

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.350 
and that's how easy it is to put
together<00:02:41.050> now<00:02:41.470> don't<00:02:42.310> fall<00:02:42.790> out<00:02:42.820> we<00:02:43.210> obviously

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
together now don't fall out we obviously

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.640 
together now don't fall out we obviously
have<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.690> tighten<00:02:43.990> this<00:02:44.110> we're<00:02:44.320> going<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.500> put

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
have to tighten this we're going to put

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.410 
have to tighten this we're going to put
the<00:02:44.740> blade<00:02:45.010> in<00:02:45.040> first<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.540> we'll<00:02:46.660> open<00:02:46.870> up<00:02:48.420> the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
the blade in first so we'll open up the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.340 
the blade in first so we'll open up the
handle<00:02:49.780> as<00:02:49.870> far<00:02:50.050> as<00:02:50.140> it'll<00:02:50.290> go

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
handle as far as it'll go

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.250 
handle as far as it'll go
and<00:02:53.350> that'll<00:02:53.590> allow<00:02:53.620> us<00:02:53.740> to<00:02:53.950> insert<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.400> blade

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
and that'll allow us to insert the blade

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.120 
and that'll allow us to insert the blade
square<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.440> off<00:02:56.530> obviously<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:59.010> then<00:03:00.010> you

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
square it off obviously and then you

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.320 
square it off obviously and then you
want<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.370> tighten<00:03:00.700> them<00:03:00.790> down<00:03:00.820> you<00:03:01.120> do<00:03:01.300> not

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
want to tighten them down you do not

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.790 
want to tighten them down you do not
want<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.870> over<00:03:02.050> tighten<00:03:02.080> them<00:03:02.380> if<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.590> over

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
want to over tighten them if you over

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.710 
want to over tighten them if you over
tighten<00:03:02.980> them<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.880> will<00:03:03.970> actually<00:03:04.150> bow<00:03:04.510> the

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
tighten them it will actually bow the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.000 
tighten them it will actually bow the
aluminum<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.200> little<00:03:05.380> bit<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.680> just<00:03:05.800> want

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
aluminum a little bit so you just want

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.860 
aluminum a little bit so you just want
to<00:03:06.040> tighten<00:03:06.310> them<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:06.580> they're<00:03:06.730> snug

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:18.900 

they'll<00:03:10.870> hold<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.230> quite<00:03:11.650> nicely<00:03:17.910> that'll

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
they'll hold it quite nicely that'll

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.630 
they'll hold it quite nicely that'll
give<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.180> nice<00:03:19.360> straight<00:03:19.930> blade<00:03:20.640> right

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
give you a nice straight blade right

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.850 
give you a nice straight blade right
there<00:03:21.970> now<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.930> way<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.320> squeegee<00:03:23.740> is

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
there now the way the squeegee is

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.080 
there now the way the squeegee is
designed<00:03:24.310> is<00:03:25.320> it<00:03:26.320> actually<00:03:27.280> holds<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.880> blade

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
designed is it actually holds the blade

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.570 
designed is it actually holds the blade
up<00:03:28.360> a<00:03:28.540> little<00:03:28.720> bit<00:03:28.930> so<00:03:29.680> it'll<00:03:29.890> really<00:03:30.070> protect

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
up a little bit so it'll really protect

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.290 
up a little bit so it'll really protect
your<00:03:30.730> blade<00:03:31.620> meaning<00:03:32.620> that<00:03:32.800> most<00:03:33.490> squeegees

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
your blade meaning that most squeegees

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.730 
your blade meaning that most squeegees
even<00:03:34.540> aluminum<00:03:34.840> squeegees<00:03:35.230> your<00:03:35.380> plate<00:03:35.620> is

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
even aluminum squeegees your plate is

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.440 
even aluminum squeegees your plate is
going<00:03:35.830> to<00:03:35.920> be<00:03:36.010> rubbing<00:03:36.250> in<00:03:36.580> here<00:03:36.850> but<00:03:37.330> these

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
going to be rubbing in here but these

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.530 
going to be rubbing in here but these
two<00:03:37.690> nubs<00:03:37.930> is<00:03:38.110> right<00:03:38.260> here<00:03:38.410> protect<00:03:38.830> that<00:03:39.540> so

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
two nubs is right here protect that so

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.700 
two nubs is right here protect that so
that<00:03:40.690> means<00:03:40.870> when<00:03:41.080> we<00:03:41.170> want<00:03:41.320> to<00:03:41.410> switch<00:03:41.590> the

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
that means when we want to switch the

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.860 
that means when we want to switch the
blade<00:03:41.920> around<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:43.060> makes<00:03:43.240> it<00:03:43.360> really<00:03:43.480> easy

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.060 

so<00:03:46.870> when<00:03:46.990> I'm<00:03:47.110> changing<00:03:47.470> out<00:03:47.500> my<00:03:47.709> blade<00:03:47.890> I'm

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
so when I'm changing out my blade I'm

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.550 
so when I'm changing out my blade I'm
going<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.250> lose<00:03:48.400> them<00:03:48.640> up<00:03:48.790> loosen<00:03:49.240> that<00:03:49.560> screws

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
going to lose them up loosen that screws

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.220

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
again is to turn the blade around your

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.880 
again is to turn the blade around your
edge<00:03:57.190> will<00:03:57.700> be<00:03:57.730> extremely<00:03:58.600> sharp<00:03:59.020> still

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
edge will be extremely sharp still

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.910 
edge will be extremely sharp still
because<00:04:00.640> it's<00:04:00.850> not<00:04:01.030> rubbing<00:04:01.390> on<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:01.570> again

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
because it's not rubbing on it again

process

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.700 
process
so<00:04:44.460> now<00:04:44.700> I'm<00:04:45.330> going<00:04:45.600> to<00:04:45.660> loosen<00:04:46.020> these<00:04:46.200> up<00:04:46.260> so<00:04:46.680> I

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
so now I'm going to loosen these up so I

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.950 
so now I'm going to loosen these up so I
can<00:04:46.890> slide<00:04:47.130> them<00:04:47.280> around<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:48.300> obviously<00:04:48.720> take

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
can slide them around and obviously take

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.510 
can slide them around and obviously take
this<00:04:49.110> blade<00:04:49.410> out<00:04:49.680> we<00:04:50.010> don't<00:04:50.100> need<00:04:50.250> anything

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
this blade out we don't need anything

00:04:50.520 --> 00:05:01.100 
this blade out we don't need anything
long<00:04:58.910> so<00:04:59.910> I'll<00:05:00.030> turn<00:05:00.180> this<00:05:00.360> path<00:05:00.600> level<00:05:00.990> once

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
long so I'll turn this path level once

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:18.830 
long so I'll turn this path level once
again<00:05:08.270> screw<00:05:09.270> this<00:05:09.420> thing<00:05:09.480> back<00:05:09.930> in<00:05:10.170> here<00:05:17.840> this

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
again screw this thing back in here this

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.980 
again screw this thing back in here this
again<00:05:19.230> let's<00:05:19.500> put<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:19.710> nuts<00:05:19.920> in<00:05:20.130> here<00:05:20.990> sit

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
again let's put the nuts in here sit

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.770 
again let's put the nuts in here sit
upside<00:05:22.350> down<00:05:22.590> do<00:05:23.040> a<00:05:23.070> Forge<00:05:23.520> one<00:05:24.330> full<00:05:24.540> turn

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
upside down do a Forge one full turn

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
upside down do a Forge one full turn
square<00:05:25.770> it<00:05:26.040> off<00:05:27.560> there<00:05:30.020> we'll<00:05:31.020> turn<00:05:31.260> square<00:05:31.710> it

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
square it off there we'll turn square it

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.560 
square it off there we'll turn square it
off<00:05:32.210> now<00:05:33.210> we<00:05:33.270> can<00:05:33.510> slide<00:05:33.900> this<00:05:34.350> into<00:05:34.770> this<00:05:34.860> end

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
off now we can slide this into this end

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.690 
off now we can slide this into this end
there<00:05:36.570> basically<00:05:36.990> offsetting<00:05:37.770> the<00:05:38.220> hand<00:05:38.520> the

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
there basically offsetting the hand the

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.820 
there basically offsetting the hand the
top<00:05:38.910> and<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.150> bottom<00:05:39.420> of<00:05:39.510> the<00:05:39.630> handle<00:05:40.020> so

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
top and the bottom of the handle so

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.700 
top and the bottom of the handle so
basically<00:05:41.250> we<00:05:41.580> will<00:05:41.640> just<00:05:41.970> take<00:05:42.240> this<00:05:42.710> slide

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
basically we will just take this slide

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.970 
basically we will just take this slide
that<00:05:43.770> in<00:05:44.100> right<00:05:44.280> through<00:05:44.490> there<00:05:45.740> slide<00:05:46.740> that

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
that in right through there slide that

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.760 
that in right through there slide that
in<00:05:47.040> right<00:05:47.400> through<00:05:47.670> there<00:05:48.560> see<00:05:49.560> how<00:05:49.620> that's

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
in right through there see how that's

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.860 
in right through there see how that's
expanding<00:05:50.250> the<00:05:50.340> handle<00:05:50.610> there<00:05:50.790> and<00:05:51.600> then<00:05:51.750> on

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
expanding the handle there and then on

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:58.610 
expanding the handle there and then on
this<00:05:52.050> side<00:05:53.630> take<00:05:54.630> this<00:05:57.170> connect<00:05:58.170> in<00:05:58.410> right

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
this side take this connect in right

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:06.050 
this side take this connect in right
there<00:06:01.550> so<00:06:03.800> now<00:06:04.800> that<00:06:04.860> creates<00:06:05.400> a<00:06:05.700> handle

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
there so now that creates a handle

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.450 
there so now that creates a handle
that's<00:06:06.150> 16<00:06:06.660> inches<00:06:06.930> we<00:06:07.740> could<00:06:07.890> then<00:06:08.070> take<00:06:08.250> our

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
that's 16 inches we could then take our

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:14.750 
that's 16 inches we could then take our
blade<00:06:09.650> insert<00:06:10.650> the<00:06:10.830> blade<00:06:13.520> obviously<00:06:14.520> putting

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
blade insert the blade obviously putting

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.960 
blade insert the blade obviously putting
them<00:06:14.880> together<00:06:15.030> isn't<00:06:15.390> quite<00:06:15.840> as<00:06:16.020> easy<00:06:16.350> as

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
them together isn't quite as easy as

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.940 
them together isn't quite as easy as
just<00:06:17.970> buying<00:06:18.240> a<00:06:18.390> 16<00:06:18.810> inch<00:06:18.960> handle<00:06:19.350> but<00:06:19.560> it<00:06:19.680> does

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
just buying a 16 inch handle but it does

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.920 
just buying a 16 inch handle but it does
give<00:06:20.760> you<00:06:20.850> a<00:06:20.880> lot<00:06:21.090> of<00:06:21.120> flexibility<00:06:21.840> and

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
give you a lot of flexibility and

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.040 
give you a lot of flexibility and
expansion<00:06:23.390> takes<00:06:24.390> it<00:06:24.570> right<00:06:24.660> there<00:06:24.840> and<00:06:24.930> make

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
expansion takes it right there and make

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.520
