00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:09.126
 Right. Come on, the second group singing to save themselves. 

00:00:09.326 --> 00:00:10.889
 It's the "1432"! 

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:22.342
 "1432" - Performance Skyscraper - Demi Lovato 

00:00:39.943 --> 00:00:44.501
 The heavens are crying. I'm watching. 

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:49.105
 Taking the tears in my hands. 

00:00:49.986 --> 00:00:54.569
 Silence sounds like an ending. 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:59.303
 Like we never get a chance. 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:08.640
 Do you have to make me feel like there's nothing left of me? 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.233
 You can take everything I have. 

00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:17.591
 You can break everything that I am. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.903
 as if I were made of glass. 

00:01:22.573 --> 00:01:27.619
 As if I were made of paper. 

00:01:27.814 --> 00:01:32.600
 Go ahead and try to knock me down. 

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:36.584
 I'm going to get up off the floor, 

00:01:36.903 --> 00:01:40.153
 like a skyscraper. 

00:01:41.828 --> 00:01:46.613
 Like a skyscraper. 

00:01:48.765 --> 00:01:51.109
 Go run, run, run. 

00:01:51.353 --> 00:01:53.690
 I'll be fine here, 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.828
 Watching you disappear, yeah. (Seeing you disappear) 

00:01:58.213 --> 00:02:00.684
 Go run, run, run. 

00:02:00.872 --> 00:02:04.214
 Yes, it's a long way to go. 

00:02:04.538 --> 00:02:10.453
 But I'm closer to the clouds up here. 

00:02:11.234 --> 00:02:15.711
 You can take everything I have. 

00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:20.128
 You can break everything that I am. 

00:02:20.334 --> 00:02:24.449
 As if I were made of glass. 

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:28.290
 As if I were made of paper. 

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:35.016
 Go ahead and try to knock me down. 

00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:39.303
 I'm going to get up off the floor, 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.117
 like a skyscraper. 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:57.906
 Ladies, ladies, ladies. 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:00.199
 It's how people talk: 

00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:04.139
 "When things complicate the stronger grow." 

00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:06.459
 And you want to know? you grew up. And I'm proud. 

00:03:07.346 --> 00:03:08.387
 -Thanks. -Thanks. 

00:03:10.652 --> 00:03:13.330
 You really turned me on tonight. 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.113
 I was very suspicious last night, but today, you confessed to me. 

00:03:17.283 --> 00:03:18.538
 -Thank you thank you 

00:03:19.362 --> 00:03:22.275
 I do not know whose song it is. 

00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:27.043
 "No, I do not know. "Okay, you do not know. 

00:03:27.084 --> 00:03:28.109
 Historically, I do not know. 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.257
 But even so, you were better than the original singer. 

00:03:33.452 --> 00:03:34.157
 -Thanks. -Thanks. 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:36.057
 Good work, ladies!
