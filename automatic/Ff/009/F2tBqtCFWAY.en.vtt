00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
the set I'm going to put it down here in

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:39.120 
the set I'm going to put it down here in
the<00:02:30.280> camera<00:02:30.610> one<00:02:30.850> sec<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:35.380> go<00:02:37.920> take<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.010> off

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
the camera one sec you go take it off

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.740 
the camera one sec you go take it off
the<00:02:39.220> tripod

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.100 

ok

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.540 

if<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.410> go<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.680> open<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.070> cockpit<00:02:51.220> quite

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
if you go to open the cockpit quite

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.980 
if you go to open the cockpit quite
carefully<00:02:51.940> because<00:02:52.030> sometimes<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.600> does<00:02:52.720> tend

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
carefully because sometimes it does tend

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:59.210 
carefully because sometimes it does tend
to<00:02:53.050> swing<00:02:53.560> around<00:02:53.680> upside<00:02:54.070> down<00:02:57.030> there<00:02:58.030> we<00:02:58.120> go

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
to swing around upside down there we go

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.560 
to swing around upside down there we go
there's<00:03:00.220> no<00:03:00.370> controls<00:03:00.820> inside<00:03:01.030> there<00:03:01.390> which<00:03:01.480> a

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
there's no controls inside there which a

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.600 
there's no controls inside there which a
bit<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.900> disappointment<00:03:02.170> but<00:03:02.590> that's<00:03:03.460> not

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
bit of a disappointment but that's not

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.310 
bit of a disappointment but that's not
really<00:03:03.880> what<00:03:04.330> you<00:03:04.450> want<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.660> focus<00:03:04.810> on<00:03:05.080> so<00:03:05.290> I

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
really what you want to focus on so I

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.780 
really what you want to focus on so I
Spitler<00:03:05.770> are<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:06.850> in<00:03:07.000> there

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.259 

it's<00:03:13.390> more<00:03:13.750> nicely<00:03:14.739> well<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.819> actually<00:03:15.909> stayed

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
it's more nicely well it actually stayed

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.729 
it's more nicely well it actually stayed
up<00:03:16.420> this<00:03:16.540> time<00:03:16.750> it's<00:03:17.200> good<00:03:18.599> there<00:03:19.599> you<00:03:19.659> go<00:03:19.780> cop

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
up this time it's good there you go cop

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.530 
up this time it's good there you go cop
it's<00:03:20.950> really<00:03:21.219> nice<00:03:21.370> design<00:03:21.879> they<00:03:22.209> finally

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
it's really nice design they finally

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.229 
it's really nice design they finally
sort<00:03:22.840> of<00:03:22.900> perfected<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.530> design<00:03:23.829> of<00:03:23.859> it<00:03:24.239> and

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
sort of perfected the design of it and

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:26.819 
sort of perfected the design of it and
that's<00:03:25.299> when<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.540> pick<00:03:25.689> us<00:03:25.780> up<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.140> wings<00:03:26.319> move

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
that's when I pick us up the wings move

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.449 
that's when I pick us up the wings move
all<00:03:28.500> another<00:03:29.500> cool<00:03:29.709> feature<00:03:29.769> this<00:03:30.189> is<00:03:30.340> that

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
all another cool feature this is that

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.649 
all another cool feature this is that
the<00:03:30.549> wings<00:03:30.760> sort<00:03:31.090> of<00:03:31.180> spin<00:03:31.390> around<00:03:31.510> the

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
the wings sort of spin around the

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.380 
the wings sort of spin around the
cockpit<00:03:32.430> it's<00:03:33.430> on<00:03:33.700> like<00:03:33.879> the<00:03:34.030> Bering

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
cockpit it's on like the Bering

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.149 
cockpit it's on like the Bering
whichever<00:03:34.959> way<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.140> model<00:03:35.439> turns<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:35.799> cop<00:03:35.950> it's

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
whichever way the model turns a cop it's

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.670 
whichever way the model turns a cop it's
always<00:03:36.430> sort<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.629> right<00:03:37.750> way<00:03:37.870> up<00:03:38.019> it's

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
always sort of the right way up it's

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.869 
always sort of the right way up it's
kind<00:03:38.799> of<00:03:38.889> points<00:03:39.220> in<00:03:39.310> space<00:03:39.489> because<00:03:39.609> there's

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
kind of points in space because there's

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.289 
kind of points in space because there's
no<00:03:40.000> set<00:03:40.540> directions<00:03:41.109> in<00:03:41.260> space<00:03:42.030> because<00:03:43.030> I

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
no set directions in space because I

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.399 
no set directions in space because I
just<00:03:43.480> show<00:03:43.569> that<00:03:43.599> spinning<00:03:44.019> it's<00:03:44.200> going<00:03:44.349> to

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
just show that spinning it's going to

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:57.270 
just show that spinning it's going to
here's<00:03:45.159> to<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.370> better<00:03:45.400> angle<00:03:47.010> okay

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.740 

there<00:03:58.280> we<00:03:58.370> go<00:03:58.460> so<00:03:58.670> if<00:03:58.790> I<00:03:58.880> just<00:03:59.120> take<00:03:59.450> that<00:03:59.600> by

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
there we go so if I just take that by

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.730 
there we go so if I just take that by
its<00:03:59.900> head<00:04:00.080> and<00:04:00.200> swing<00:04:00.560> that<00:04:02.020> it's<00:04:03.020> just<00:04:03.230> so

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
its head and swing that it's just so

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.950 
its head and swing that it's just so
cool<00:04:04.010> I<00:04:04.250> mean<00:04:04.400> imagine<00:04:04.850> that<00:04:05.180> flying<00:04:05.450> towards

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
cool I mean imagine that flying towards

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.110 
cool I mean imagine that flying towards
a<00:04:06.080> mothership<00:04:06.860> shooting<00:04:07.520> or<00:04:07.640> something<00:04:07.970> that

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
a mothership shooting or something that

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.480 
a mothership shooting or something that
will<00:04:08.240> be<00:04:08.360> really<00:04:08.780> cool<00:04:10.630> so<00:04:11.630> that<00:04:11.870> is<00:04:12.190> my<00:04:13.190> spew

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
will be really cool so that is my spew

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.780 
will be really cool so that is my spew

good<00:04:33.250> all<00:04:34.250> these<00:04:34.490> wings<00:04:34.730> is<00:04:34.940> best<00:04:35.180> to<00:04:35.300> make

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
good all these wings is best to make

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.060 
good all these wings is best to make
them<00:04:35.600> all<00:04:35.720> at<00:04:35.840> once<00:04:35.870> otherwise<00:04:36.290> is<00:04:36.740> a<00:04:36.770> bit

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
them all at once otherwise is a bit

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.390 
them all at once otherwise is a bit
repetitive<00:04:37.510> then<00:04:38.510> on<00:04:38.690> each<00:04:38.870> wingtip<00:04:39.470> you<00:04:40.220> get

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
repetitive then on each wingtip you get

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.210 
repetitive then on each wingtip you get
fleet<00:04:40.820> farm<00:04:41.030> missile<00:04:41.450> as<00:04:41.720> six<00:04:42.050> of<00:04:42.200> them<00:04:42.320> if<00:04:43.040> I

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
fleet farm missile as six of them if I

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.280 
fleet farm missile as six of them if I
reasonably<00:04:43.670> well<00:04:43.850> I<00:04:44.060> just<00:04:44.120> bring<00:04:45.080> it<00:04:45.170> back

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
reasonably well I just bring it back

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:53.730 
reasonably well I just bring it back
down<00:04:45.440> here<00:04:45.800> again

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.350
