00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 to one of the propellers and a quality that 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.350
 was not a model 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.120
 Did you already see from her wedding that she 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:15.450
 It's new but its a guy it's very bad. 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.789
 but it will be possible to see in the video but if new 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.130
 already has burr so it does not have 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.279
 legal background 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.529
 You 'll see the video here. 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:32.399
 it vibrates so much that it reaches the engine of the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:37.800
 our voice and realize right back but engine 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:48.890
 that you can see the bad quality 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:48.890
 this is an idea the engine was fixed 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.890
 reprobate has lost another again and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:04.680
 I put the second is if this is a copy 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.430
 from the general list of your s 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.470
 this is only minor but it is a copy of the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.610
 generic version 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.530
 it has a bad quality but more 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.960
 acceptable that the first first is 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.369
 horrible served automotive without motor 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.049
 new fixed rate 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.049
 the test is not enough 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.080
 I'm not going to give too much motor here, it's just for 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.290
 a good day so you can see the both of 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.960
 one is of a quality in the 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.610
 performance of the model in this life 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.580
 less than another 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.580
 How did you see it a little earlier? 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.930
 released to the site engine 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:07.540
 now the original of greece 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:07.540
 the veil but you leave the difference is visible 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:16.060
 maybe the video should not be reset 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:16.060
 on the move in question of vibration 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:35.730
 the question is only waiter so 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:39.390
 Okay so it's always hard is more 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.870
 to guide who is starting to 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:47.580
 look for read quite toxic on the internet 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.930
 is always choosing is a good propeller 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.640
 quality and brand name here 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.840
 comments 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.510
 I've always used this brand of ws 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:05.400
 the other two brands there is one in 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:08.090
 I 'm not going to talk here, but it's a 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.110
 brand and another is a generic one of oms 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.090
 leaves a lot to be desired 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:17.910
 so when to buy this process was 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:20.819
 model prime propeller good because for who 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.599
 do not know is that they are starting the 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:27.870
 balancing influences on vibration was 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:30.239
 be with your motor dropping on the wall 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.489
 of fire is he will come back from that 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.639
 Do you want to do not stop and you? 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.420
 will have a headache with him if it is 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.040
 a quality 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:45.000
 not to mention that it will influence the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:47.970
 performance of your model is the 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.940
 time to buy the one always looking for 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.060
 Preferably they quality helix 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.849
 is of good quality to avoid the 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.840
 problems that I told myself to let go 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:03.389
 during flight is to avoid vibration in the series o 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.819
 model and with it has a quality you 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.870
 lose performance above good 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.799
 quality is a tip for anyone who wants 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.079
 start on the next betting videos 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.549
 clearly is more videos building the 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.440
 focus 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:21.090
 I'm going to move on to the installation of 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.000
 area for fire and after linking 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.479
 of the wing and landing gear up to the 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.479
 next videos 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.680
