 hello greet you ronald vÃ¡zquez and in this 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:10.000
 new tutorial I will explain how to create 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.840
 a video using photos and music from 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.630
 Youtube 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.839
 in other words I will teach you to create what 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.960
 which is called a slide show that is to say a 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:22.570
 video using your own photographs and 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.810
 a background music and we will all do it 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.960
 from the same youtube is to say no 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.779
 we will use any editing program all 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.960
 we will do it again from the same youtube 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.810
 well and without further ado we will accede 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.170
 now to the next page and below 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.250
 this video or in the description of the video 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.610
 you will find the link to access 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:49.050
 also to this page well here we are 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.360
 and says your content power 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.329
 and we are going to enter this option that 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.760
 says slide show or 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.760
 click and in presentations 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.239
 slideshow 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.449
 then I will load this window 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.570
 and now we have to upload the 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:12.320
 photographs that we are going to use to create 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.229
 our video then we click on 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.530
 this option that says upload photos and here 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.470
 below asks us to give a name to 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.500
 this album by default shows the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.560
 date then we erase that and we give it 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.760
 the name we want for example I'm going to 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.160
 give it my holiday name 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.530
 then we press this button that 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.890
 says select photos of your team 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.410
 press that button and now I must 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.400
 locate on my hard drive where it 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.140
 find those photographs next 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.320
 selected the photographs that I'm going to 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.230
 use in my slide show then you 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.240
 I suggest pressing the control button of your 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.260
 keyboard to select several 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.150
 photographs at once then you go 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.440
 selecting the photographs that 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.440
 want 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.190
 then the selections and then you do 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.830
 click on the open button 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.950
 and now we wait a few seconds for 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.050
 finish uploading those photographs 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.570
 look here says going up then 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.630
 we wait a few seconds for it to finish 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.250
 upload those photos and right now it's 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.520
 about to finish uploading 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.520
 Photographs 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.070
 and look now the 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.140
 photographs that I have uploaded then yes 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.840
 I wish I can add more photos here in the 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.700
 Top says add more photos or 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.130
 otherwise, you simply press the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.319
 Next button to continue I press 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.310
 following 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:51.069
 and now take me to this part look 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.950
 it is showing the pictures 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.959
 is already being created better said 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.389
 automatically that slide show with the 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.209
 photographs that you have chosen in your 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:03.249
 computer ok but let's perform 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.489
 a small configuration here below 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:09.069
 says slide duration understand it 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.299
 as duration of each photo by default 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.920
 it's three seconds 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:16.319
 I'm going to give you five seconds for example 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.440
 at the same time here on the right where it says 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.720
 transition you must choose a transition 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.440
 the one you like here there are several 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.660
 transitions then it's up to you 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.739
 choose a transition for example I'm going to 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.739
 select dissolve 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.920
 and that will be the transition that will show 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:38.859
 let's say it's the effect that shows 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.079
 in between each photograph is when 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:44.310
 go from one photo to another 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:47.940
 that is called transition to that effect 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.489
 I'm going to pause the video and finally what 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.010
 what we are going to do is add a music 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.920
 background for it youtube gives us choose 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.220
 several audio tracks that we can 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.860
 add to our video is a matter of 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.720
 listen to these audio tracks at the same time 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.019
 also here where it says clues 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.330
 main you can also select 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.510
 the genre of music that pleases you 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.480
 example I'll choose pop I'll choose 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.329
 Pop pop music then also gives you 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.880
 choose those songs then I'm going to 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.800
 select the one you want to make 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.490
 just click on it 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.690
 that way the video will be heard with 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.400
 this background music good in this 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.490
 moment you do not listen to that background music 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.800
 but I am listening to it well but 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.639
 As you have seen it is very easy to create a 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.560
 slide show through youtube then 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.600
 there they appreciate them to all the photographs 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.320
 what I have uploaded then 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.420
 that way you can easily create 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:54.590
 this type of video called is that 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:57.050
 well I'm going to pause the video and now yes 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.690
 Finally, what we are going to do is go up 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.320
 this video that we have created for it 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:07.160
 here is this button that says upload I do 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:10.310
 click on upload and now it takes me to this 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.940
 form in which I can basically 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.130
 change the title of my video by 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.620
 defect says my presentation of 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.870
 slides then I'm going to put you as 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.270
 title my vacation 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.540
 at the same time also here below I can give you 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.930
 a description to my video I delete this 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:32.730
 that text that is displayed by default 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.340
 so here I can place a brief 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:38.790
 description I will put this video 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.340
 corresponds to my vacation is just 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:44.280
 an example later in the other box 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.860
 here where it says labels you can place 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.170
 several labels that you want for your 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.010
 video for example I'm going to place 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:56.610
 enter and I can continue 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:59.220
 adding more labels then now 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:02.160
 it's a matter of waiting for it to end 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.440
 process this video here it says processing 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.640
 21 percent and once it reaches the 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:11.760
 100% this video will be published in our 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.470
 youtube channel but at the same time it's 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.960
 need to press this button that says 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.540
 publish to accept that it is published 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.180
 otherwise it will not be published I click 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.930
 in that button publish 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:27.990
 that way once 100% reaches the 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:31.169
 video will already be published automatically in 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:33.509
 our channel well but if in addition to 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:36.300
 you want to download the video that you have 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:38.419
 you can do it but that's what 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.910
 explained in another tutorial that I created 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:44.759
 over here I will place a link to 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:47.789

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:49.830
 you can learn how to download the video 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:53.460

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:56.490
 simple through this application that 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.530
 offers the same youtube well and with that 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.229
 I have practically reached the end of 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:04.020

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:06.539
