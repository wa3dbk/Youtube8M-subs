true but sitting there thinking that way

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.760 
true but sitting there thinking that way

and then you can see that it does pop up
to<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:23.950> full<00:01:24.130> keyboard<00:01:24.539> numerical<00:01:26.609> they've<00:01:27.609> got

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
to a full keyboard numerical they've got

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.889 
to a full keyboard numerical they've got
gestures<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:29.490> landscape<00:01:30.600> talked<00:01:31.600> about<00:01:31.780> the

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
gestures and landscape talked about the

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.569 
gestures and landscape talked about the
auto<00:01:31.990> correction<00:01:32.469> which<00:01:32.709> I<00:01:32.950> agree<00:01:33.340> works

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
auto correction which I agree works

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.359 
auto correction which I agree works
extremely<00:01:33.999> well<00:01:34.499> I<00:01:35.499> don't<00:01:35.859> typically<00:01:36.249> like

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
extremely well I don't typically like

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.090 
extremely well I don't typically like
auto<00:01:36.789> correction<00:01:37.329> and<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:38.740> is<00:01:38.889> the<00:01:39.009> reason

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
auto correction and this is the reason

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.039 
auto correction and this is the reason
why<00:01:39.369> did<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.819> keyboard<00:01:40.569> in<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.719> first<00:01:40.869> place

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
why did the keyboard in the first place

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.690 
why did the keyboard in the first place
you<00:01:41.439> having<00:01:41.770> all<00:01:41.920> that<00:01:42.159> screen<00:01:42.459> real<00:01:42.609> estate

learn<00:02:40.190> haptic<00:02:41.000> feedback<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.750> then<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.829> know

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
learn haptic feedback and then you know

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.979 
learn haptic feedback and then you know
the<00:02:43.190> cool<00:02:43.730> thing<00:02:43.940> was<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.239> imported<00:02:44.659> a<00:02:44.720> lot<00:02:44.870> of

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
the cool thing was I imported a lot of

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.809 
the cool thing was I imported a lot of
my<00:02:45.110> data<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:45.739> it's<00:02:45.950> picked<00:02:46.340> up<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.579> lot<00:02:46.700> of

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
my data and so it's picked up a lot of

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.150 
my data and so it's picked up a lot of
stuff<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.930> import<00:02:48.230> process<00:02:48.260> actually<00:02:48.799> did

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
stuff so the import process actually did

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.530 
stuff so the import process actually did
work<00:02:50.120> fairly<00:02:50.480> well<00:02:51.370> let's<00:02:52.370> see<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.500> I<00:02:55.540> showed
