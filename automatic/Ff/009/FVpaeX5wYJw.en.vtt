built that from that picked right there
it's<00:01:37.400> supposed<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.640> look<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.860> except<00:01:40.860> any

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it's supposed to look like it except any

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.399 
it's supposed to look like it except any
better<00:01:41.340> wheels<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:43.399> yep<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:45.380> I<00:01:46.380> got

sitting over there over to here over
there<00:01:58.799> too<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.430> there's<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.969> 9<00:02:01.430> 830<00:02:02.430> 9<00:02:03.000> d<00:02:03.329> then

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
there too and there's the 9 830 9 d then

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.219 
there too and there's the 9 830 9 d then
there's<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.170> lone<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.469> turbo<00:02:05.070> 95<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:06.000> there<00:02:06.229> 986

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
there's the lone a turbo 95 in there 986

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.480 
there's the lone a turbo 95 in there 986
in<00:02:07.619> there<00:02:08.599> 1486<00:02:09.599> and

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
in there 1486 and

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.230 
in there 1486 and
the<00:02:10.700> skid<00:02:11.030> loader<00:02:11.210> in<00:02:11.720> there<00:02:11.990> then<00:02:12.470> I<00:02:12.590> built<00:02:13.240> my

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
the skid loader in there then I built my

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.570 
the skid loader in there then I built my
pin<00:02:14.960> and<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:16.100> feed<00:02:16.760> bunks<00:02:17.240> and<00:02:17.590> they're<00:02:18.590> not

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
pin and to feed bunks and they're not

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.640 
pin and to feed bunks and they're not
space<00:02:19.880> them<00:02:20.180> out<00:02:20.330> evenly<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:22.430> could<00:02:22.760> fit<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
space them out evenly so I could fit the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.530 
space them out evenly so I could fit the
tractor<00:02:24.650> in<00:02:25.160> here<00:02:25.520> so<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.940> way<00:02:26.060> i<00:02:26.120> can<00:02:26.180> drive

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
tractor in here so that way i can drive

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.320 
tractor in here so that way i can drive
it<00:02:26.720> down<00:02:27.040> turn<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.250> around<00:02:28.340> draw<00:02:29.060> back<00:02:29.300> the

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
it down turn it around draw back the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.010 
it down turn it around draw back the
other<00:02:29.540> way<00:02:29.750> on<00:02:30.170> both<00:02:30.680> sides<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:32.780> way<00:02:32.990> i

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
other way on both sides so that way i

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.360 
other way on both sides so that way i
can<00:02:33.220> defeat<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:35.470> then<00:02:36.470> i'm<00:02:36.620> going<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:36.890> try

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
can defeat in and then i'm going to try

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.110 
can defeat in and then i'm going to try
to<00:02:37.460> figure<00:02:37.730> out<00:02:37.910> how<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:38.960> do<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.530> stop<00:02:39.800> motion

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120
