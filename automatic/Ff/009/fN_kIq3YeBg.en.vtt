00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 It's okay, my name is Diego Mudros. 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.210
 it's a teach solved 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.139
 I could not start the channel are 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.269
 first to provide accurate then 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.109
 to connect try this on us 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.090
 comments 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.580
 then you have to answer a jumped up and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.260
 many verified that he had question then 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.800
 instead of waiting for you to establish 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.840
 goals 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.000
 I'll invent the novel can. 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.859
 I'll try, I'll try and respond. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.800
 the Ministry already clarifies a lot to 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.690
 from now on because the first 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.239
 You decided to make the channel the idea. 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.059
 first I was going to make some videos sorry 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.520
 simple word and did little to 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.050
 serve as notes and will be 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.640
 short sucks 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.379
 I wanted to have some doubts that when 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.879
 remember the subject and hear what it is 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.770
 very recurrent avoid remembering a 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.570
 thing he had studied previously and 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.690
 not to remember the suffering of the amuplam 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.460
 He listened and said that he was alone. 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.649
 When I started doing it and I already 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.199
 I followed some channels that also have 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.090
 similar format, but rather help 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.640
 anyone else if anyone else needs 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.360
 content and you already had it 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.549
 own 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.590
 so thinkin 'about it but there's still this 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.990
 footprint and I really got carried away 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.090
 I tried my best not to 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.880
 speak a thousand wonders for you but gives 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.710
 I work a lot the way you are then I 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.630
 I hope you enjoy it, because you expect 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.460
 make life easier for you there study 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.479
 I hope you like it then it's a 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.640
 thing you can call a foul 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.740
 credibility of what I am talking about is the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.200
 my father was late and graduating from 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.369
 our current student training 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.500
 still in the 1st cycle 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.960
 in fact I'm a computer 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.700
 Visit another story and I can later 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.680
 make a video can only count this 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.590
 right but not now but of any 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.450
 way I'll always put reference 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.490
 not if I say something that does not 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.350
 end was because I read in the decade between 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.149
 those who are at the end of each life 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.460
 so I 'm not going to go on TV, do not come back 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.880
 to get out of my head and train then I will 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.310
 try to the maximum of reality the content 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.200
 and get as close to the references 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.759
 that it is clear that I will try to give a 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.500
 way of giving presentation 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.289
 make an association to facilitate the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.629
 understanding but always attached to the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.640
 video content and taking advantage of some 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.530
 people will vote but there the note the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.650
 minister through which the physiologist 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.410
 chronicler today, it does not matter which 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.599
 your style for all the video I go 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.079
 put in the end the references that 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.880
 I used doc rivers, the best is to say that 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.769
 Those are the ones I like to study. 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.890
 so if you have access to modern and 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.750
 You want to test you take one look at life 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.400
 Do you like the dynamics in the book now? 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.470
 I'm sure the books I 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.120
 I have a year usually I am a reference 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.590
 it may not be abandoned 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.810
 by your teacher 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.340
 but it sure is one of those that he 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.500
 Can you say that you're going to study the business? 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.310
 can reach is the agreement can not 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.220
 reply 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.720
 and now it gets a little more complicated is 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.470
 a player with more power than my 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.870
 cycle 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.760
 The course is very fast It is very fast 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.099
 I have other projects in order to do 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.970
 and I'll have time to collect Carlos 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.910
 alberto parreira 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.470
 I really stay a lot but I do not have 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.540
 how to respond to launch 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.190
 so if I start choosing which 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.500
 question answered I think my kids 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.690
 so I can answer some 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.209
 comments but the questions I'll ask 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.849
 that you do not pronounce me from you and 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.799
 Go there and ask where you have I go 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.739
 I try to ease but I really do not 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.389
 I have doubts about doubts and I 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.950
 I know that some genes will do more 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.380
 because the government to that question 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.569
 father's company replied that it was very 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.760
 good but will only start to select or 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.700
 accessing typed by which you chose 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.310
 the total number does not respond with the 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.129
 clothes sorry 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.079
 how can g1 appear you speak 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.829
 one thing in the video the teacher spoke 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:53.110
 nothing and there increases per cent and calls 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.450
 He is sexier than he is yours. 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.019
 teacher of credibility to what he 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.150
 speech 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.680
 only that there are some errors sometimes he 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.230
 is a bit outdated and this was 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.480
 a change in a new reference then 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.180
 what I recommend returned in 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.799
 book that I cook you in the books of a 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.500
 today's past seeks to say that 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.019
 where a divergence in the 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.169
 conference where I studied to see where 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:19.209
 It was with trey raise the reference to him 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.799
 and try to be sure that you do not 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.810
 It will come to him who was speaking 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.350
 closing in portugal he said no 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.350
 say something else 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.070
 use rfp gun reference to power 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.380
 discuss it with him and there he goes because 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.419
 including the reference itself may have 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.110
 something wrong and he corrects it 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.960
 you 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.570
 so always the unit opel to the person 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.370
 shpp if you answer something else that 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.590
 he will see to your advantage 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.570
 I'm a people's place, I complain a lot 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.550
 people encourages work but there are lots of 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.130
 people who like to complain and something 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.139
 I've cried and it's several lives the quality 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.510
 soon as it appeared in the same car 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.460
 because because I'm getting ahead 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.729
 some materials some pieces of life 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.070
 and I started doing it by logic and 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:10.240
 for wealth if it is data besides 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:12.250
 dispute sometimes got the cup but now 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.500
 I got a bed that brought the 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.210
 first videos can appear on the street 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.870
 Bad image at the beginning when I go 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.510
 talk but more works now improve 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.949
 the camera and from a video or 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.210
 either you will realize that quality is 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.940
 task you 're watching now 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.680
 may not be so serious but it 's better that 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.460
 the other is not brilliant the team has abandoned 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.520
 a recurring question of snake and 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.540
 When I speak with this fiscal measure 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.360
 now at the beginning 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.790
 at the beginning of the semester and return all 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.160
 time to be able to organize and adjust 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.700
 put every Saturday to launch the 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.770
 video 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.360
 Now when I say all Saturday I 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.390
 can I have it ready and release the 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.670
 midnight but rafael 1159 this 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.250
 mode can only happen this week 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.170
 It's really drawn a lot. 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.330
 I'll send it to social networks. 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.430
 so be sure to keep track do not let 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.380
 to like the page on facebook because 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.630
 she is always putting it when downloading 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.360
 next video and was interviewed and 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:14.590
 I'll be able to launch then the page short 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.250
 and rotary there in the normal standard all 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.930
 Saturday 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.760
 If any unforeseen events happen, 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.390
 fifteen fifteen more I'll try the 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.590
 maximum jetta and always all the beauty 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.140
 of the championship 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.890
 This is the channel I hope you all 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.020
 like 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.360
 I have some plans for other types 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.450
 life I do not start back focusing 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.300
 quite a content aimed at highlighting 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.670
 I've seen what I've studied focusing 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.230
 histology and histology 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.910
 mainly physiology that 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.580
 It is usually what I really like 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.530
 study and is much easier to do 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.690
 some association that is easy to 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.040
 You only then I plan to do more 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.620
 talking about the three types of virus 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.140
 but it stays there at least in this 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.240
 which kind of leader is not 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.340
 It's going to be so, but I'm already here. 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.010
 organized trango straight will power 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.870
 until then people who do not 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.440
 signed up here in the 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.840

 And another thing if you learn some 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:18.310

 Give that white in your shape that is 3 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.910
 2 seconds 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:30.610
 only this helps a lot 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:33.310
 you will is returning the table 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.350

 write on the channel always there 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.300
 liked it 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.919
 for the effective it gives a lot of work 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.289
 then pulls the page on facebook to 

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:44.840
 to know how the next ones will play is
