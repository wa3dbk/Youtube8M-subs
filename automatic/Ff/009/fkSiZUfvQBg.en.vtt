 this and the country's stable future is 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.970
 number associated with nanotechnology she 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.549
 technology come Murmansk 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.839
 domestic product has already passed 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:09.700
 the first special even skeptics were 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.530
 forced to recognize his virtues 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.679
 special report tatyana nesterova a 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.679
 miracles that turns out 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.740
 she recognized 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.310
 if witness experiments on 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.960
 mistakes 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.539
 but specifically on the product 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.089
 optimizers witnessed 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.079
 incident or he himself 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:27.209
 that's nongovernmental 

00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:29.279
 results organizations which 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.269
 during the application of the new product 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.539
 tests have shown that using something 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:35.719
 product triple uses result 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:36.600
 we used 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.910
 reduces exhaust emissions to 42 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.830
 percent sasha to sixty eight 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.740
 ten percent even the experts themselves 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.220
 which creation is this amazing 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.120
 product by product 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.960
 the company are amazed at the results 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.620
 saves fuel goes from five to fifteen 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.120
 percent dependence on 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.680
 vehicle condition 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.370
 as well as saving oil 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.110
 to clearly show that the price 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.410
 on product organizers 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.660
 the experiment was suggested because 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.100
 engine oil from the car 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.519
 the engine that worked 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.580
 optimizers sure that without him she 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.210
 will be able to drive safe and sound 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.250
 tens of hundreds of kilometers by the way those 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.080
 who already use in europe in 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.260
 Germany for example 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.210
 For processing the result Makarov police 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.900
 cars 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.880
 ambulance fire trucks and we 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.370
 interested in people 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.900
 joint venture 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.660
 and here is the reaction to the technical part 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.580
 original product presentation 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.660
 the head of one of the largest 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.560
 London 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.020
 auto enterprises 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.020
 lm 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.210
 hard to imagine but literally through 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.470
 few minutes this machine is processed 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.880
 new data product 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.370
 no oil 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.190
 will be released on the route and we are gypsies 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.150
 while our car or Kaliningrad 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.450
 recall what nanotechnology words 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.200
 she appoints very small 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.860
 nanometers one billionth 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.960
 meters but the processes occurring in 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.360
 areas of the microworld can be controlled 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.860
 creating new materials and 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.670
 tools of all small sizes 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.610
 turning them into robots working by 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.810
 strictly specified program is new 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.899
 the era of economic political 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.890
 human relations can 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.909
 get rid of the dependency resource 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.390
 will acquire a lot of food nanotechnology will 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.489
 used in space 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.880
 health care they like atomic energy 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.669
 may be the greatest good or 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.719
 our nanoproducts experiment 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.479
 comment Andrei Nazarenko he 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:21.969
 is in this car 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.339
 no visible change in the bottom 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:25.239
 pool machine 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.389
 work 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.799
 welcoming as well as intended 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.039
 however, there would be no southern regions 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.279
 then by all canons 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:37.599
 I will bring 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.279
 make your statement 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.209
 system implementation eg cherry 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.129
 engine if on product which 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.610
 turned out to be faster than expected 4 times 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.050
 reduce the coefficient of friction 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.259
 dozens of times 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:51.369
 Ester Dyson convinced us 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:53.019
 need holding now 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.430
 experiment already on 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.380
 but on one or two buses the bus is 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.040
 more powerful engine more 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.640
 small volume so after 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.820
 handling such an engine we would 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.590
 I wanted to get exactly the result 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.410
 increase engine life but the second 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.880
 task is also important 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.330
 get a certain 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.330
 fuel economy with price increase 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.389
 to date 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.789
 so I hope that this experiment is 3 

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:20.209
 will be positive as I said then 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.259
 we are naturally arms but we are in favor 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.259
 to use him 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:28.429
 speaking on science and technology council 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:30.189
 President Vladimir Putin supported 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:32.029
 nanotechnology development 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:33.789
 the last meetings at the wedding 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:35.649
 now employees of science and innovation 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:37.310
 also talked about this March 30 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.010
 to create a central region 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.540
 technologies and 13 areas already have their 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.110
 discoveries of biology of chemistry 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.050
 really need a lot of money but 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.099
 worth it 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.589
 Although Minister Alexander Tkachev 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:48.079
 lead fm
