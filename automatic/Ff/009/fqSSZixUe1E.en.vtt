00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:11.209
 Hello everyone, I will make flowers 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.209
 But from such a fabric 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.510
 such here it is usually given bucha 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.550
 cotton and flower 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.010
 I need to cut off a small strip of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:29.910
 of this fabric and so here's a look 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:32.669
 until a minus is found, well, somewhere so width 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.220
 This strip is approximately three with 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.900
 half a centimeter you will now see 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.989
 how easy and easy to do 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.660
 flower for the base for the bottom of the flower to us 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.090
 need such a circle will beak you need to take 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.210
 their thicker cloth need to take 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.430
 strip and and fold the edges in half 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.430
 stripes but already grease cream and 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.879
 glue 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.620
 like this you need to glue all the whole striped 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.850
 all striped I'm all 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.850
 river taped 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.980
 look kept the middle so full 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:30.570
 Opa pasted and only here the edge I take 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.570
 strip fold it in half so here 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:43.560
 take scissors and cut into stripes not 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:43.560
 until the end of this edge to stay 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.990
 I will chop them up 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.400
 approximately one distance 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.400
 centimeters apart 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.979
 so it was cut if the whole striped take 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:07.700
 I take a circle of such dense fabric 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:13.640
 gun and described there add and 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.640
 I stick our striped here 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.900
 like that neatly in a circle 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.260
 taped my first lap go on 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.610
 second round 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.610
 go down with glue below we smear 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:09.550
 so on a spiral we spin our 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:09.550
 tape glue ends add 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:41.930
 well, I think enough stuff is possible 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.360
 remove the flower like this all the loops here 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.920
 such a flower turns out 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.140
 the only thing missing is the middle 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.140
 tag middle I smear a drop of glue 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.110
 and glue on a flower like this 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.870
 turned out look what he 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.730
 original and interesting for those who are not 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.480
 knows how to sew but wants to do some 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.250
