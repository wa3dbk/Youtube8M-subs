00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
it's here you go to game properties

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.170 
it's here you go to game properties
local<00:00:38.850> files<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.760> open<00:00:42.239> folder<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.879> can

local files and open folder so you can

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.740 
local files and open folder so you can
find<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> game<00:00:46.700> and<00:00:47.700> then<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.000> look<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.450> this

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
file which will be labeled application

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:02.119

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
you go to where you choose the graphic

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.929 
you go to where you choose the graphic
processor<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:12.630> then<00:01:12.869> you'll<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.760> have<00:01:14.760> an

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
processor and then you'll see I have an

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.969 
processor and then you'll see I have an
Nvidia<00:01:15.570> graphic<00:01:15.990> processor<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.740> an

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
Nvidia graphic processor and an

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.160 
Nvidia graphic processor and an
integrated<00:01:17.580> one<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:20.390> people<00:01:21.390> will<00:01:21.869> tell

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
integrated one and the people will tell

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.039 
integrated one and the people will tell
you<00:01:22.200> sometimes<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.310> pick<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:24.659> one

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
you sometimes to pick this one

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.320 
you sometimes to pick this one
just<00:01:25.229> run<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.189> but<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.939> does<00:01:27.299> not

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
just run it like this but that does not

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.330 
just run it like this but that does not
really<00:01:27.810> work<00:01:28.670> what<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.869> go<00:01:31.680> to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
really work what you have to do is go to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.370 
really work what you have to do is go to
the<00:01:32.400> bottom<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.290> can<00:01:34.290> change<00:01:34.650> standard

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
the bottom here you can change standard

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.580 
the bottom here you can change standard
and<00:01:37.380> then<00:01:37.500> let's<00:01:38.310> wait<00:01:38.790> until<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.270> opens<00:01:42.590> this

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
and then let's wait until it opens this

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.859 
and then let's wait until it opens this
will<00:01:43.740> take<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.220> 3d<00:01:44.640> settings<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:47.869> as

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
will take you to the 3d settings and as

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.289 
will take you to the 3d settings and as
you<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.110> see<00:01:49.170> here<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.820> already<00:01:50.820> have<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
you can see here I already have the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.080 
you can see here I already have the
program<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.960> I've<00:01:52.200> set<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.799> my<00:01:53.399> Nvidia

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
program and I've set it to my Nvidia

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.679 
program and I've set it to my Nvidia
graphical<00:01:54.570> processor<00:01:55.280> but<00:01:56.299> most<00:01:57.299> people

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
graphical processor but most people

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.310 
graphical processor but most people
won't<00:01:58.549> find<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> program<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.049> at

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
won't find the program like this at

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.570 
won't find the program like this at
first<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.840> yes<00:02:03.840> go<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:05.210> add

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.430 

and<00:02:11.250> another<00:02:12.250> window<00:02:12.640> shall<00:02:12.849> should<00:02:13.599> pop<00:02:14.260> up

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
and another window shall should pop up

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.910 
and another window shall should pop up
and<00:02:15.870> show<00:02:16.870> your<00:02:17.050> applications<00:02:17.769> that<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.069> have

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
and show your applications that you have

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:32.750 
and show your applications that you have
yes<00:02:20.920> give<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.849> some<00:02:22.000> time<00:02:26.280> see<00:02:27.280> ya<00:02:29.190> Jory<00:02:30.190> slow

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.820 

there<00:02:33.760> we<00:02:33.879> are

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
there we are

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.190 
there we are
no<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.849> problem<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.510> right<00:02:37.810> here<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:38.769> you<00:02:38.830> just

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
no the problem is right here so you just

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.030 
no the problem is right here so you just
mark<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:43.060> go<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.329> an<00:02:43.870> selected<00:02:44.590> program

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
mark it and go to an selected program

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.470 
mark it and go to an selected program
but<00:02:45.370> I<00:02:45.459> am<00:02:46.120> already<00:02:46.569> done<00:02:47.110> so<00:02:48.840> then<00:02:49.840> yes<00:02:50.260> go<00:02:50.530> to

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
but I am already done so then yes go to

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.780 
but I am already done so then yes go to
select<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.660> preferred<00:02:53.200> graphics<00:02:53.950> processor<00:02:54.549> I

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
select a preferred graphics processor I

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.199 
select a preferred graphics processor I
mean<00:02:55.690> she<00:02:55.900> was<00:02:57.629> your<00:02:58.629> high<00:02:58.930> powered<00:02:59.349> processor

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
mean she was your high powered processor

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:07.860 
mean she was your high powered processor
in<00:03:01.209> my<00:03:01.329> case<00:03:01.569> it's<00:03:01.750> only<00:03:01.900> in<00:03:02.319> video<00:03:02.620> 1<00:03:05.549> so<00:03:06.870> that

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
in my case it's only in video 1 so that

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.680 
in my case it's only in video 1 so that
should<00:03:08.290> be<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.530> but<00:03:10.500> for<00:03:11.500> good<00:03:11.680> measure<00:03:11.920> I

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
should be it but for good measure I

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.520 
should be it but for good measure I
recommend<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:16.090> run<00:03:16.329> as<00:03:16.540> administrator<00:03:17.290> as

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
recommend you run as administrator as

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:30.410 
recommend you run as administrator as
well<00:03:22.109> just<00:03:23.109> in<00:03:23.260> case

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:40.090 

see<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:33.060> game<00:03:33.240> is<00:03:33.390> starting

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:51.740 

here<00:03:40.790> comes<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.180> logo

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:59.600 

then<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.440> can<00:03:52.620> press<00:03:52.800> any<00:03:53.160> key<00:03:56.300> and<00:03:57.300> I<00:03:57.420> mean<00:03:58.610> so

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
then I can press any key and I mean so

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.300 
then I can press any key and I mean so
this<00:04:00.330> is<00:04:00.480> basically<00:04:00.930> how<00:04:01.080> I<00:04:01.260> sold<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.890> problem

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
this is basically how I sold the problem

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.700 
this is basically how I sold the problem
