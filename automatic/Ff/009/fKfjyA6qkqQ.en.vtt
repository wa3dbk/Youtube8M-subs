00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
sure oh my gosh I'm so excited I forgot

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.359 
sure oh my gosh I'm so excited I forgot
what<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.070> was<00:00:17.190> going<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.400> say<00:00:17.550> um<00:00:17.820> all<00:00:18.779> right<00:00:20.240> I

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
what I was going to say um all right I

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.939 
what I was going to say um all right I
think<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:24.000> lighting<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.350> little<00:00:25.800> better

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
think the lighting is a little better

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:36.620 
think the lighting is a little better
now<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.519> guess<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:28.160> that's<00:00:29.160> good<00:00:35.570> kneeling<00:00:36.570> on

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
now I guess so that's good kneeling on

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.020 
now I guess so that's good kneeling on
the<00:00:36.690> floor<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.440> really<00:00:37.710> yes<00:00:38.100> here's<00:00:38.910> a
