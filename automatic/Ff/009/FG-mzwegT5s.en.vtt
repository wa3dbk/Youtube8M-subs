00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.229
 the electronic functions of the engine 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.980
 cummins also control when the 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:12.330
 engine brake can be used 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.880
 the use of the engine brake instead of the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.020
 service brake or with it increases the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.510
 braking power 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.720
 it also reduces the brake wear of 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.700
 service in difficult conditions 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.770
 the engine and oil brake and chances 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.250
 that overheated brakes and service 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.900
 is lacking in addition to reducing the cycle 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.420
 of the brake air compressor 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:41.010
 service the engine common i / s x15 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.600
 has a built-in engine brake the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.180
 integrated brake can have a power 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.309
 brake horsepower up to 600 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.170
 compression braking is 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.960
 optional in other models 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.350
 the engines as these are the only ones to 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.760
 offer an integrated engine brake 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.160
 when the driver leaves 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.539
 the accelerator to slow down the wheels 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.460
 continues to run the 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.979
 transmission that forces the pistons of the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.799
 engine to go up and down compressing 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.690
 the air in the cylinders normally 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.180
 compressed air create a strength 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.890
 down on the piston but when he 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.020
 is activated the engine brake and 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.330
 compression opens the exhaust valve 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.440
 just before the piston reaches the top 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.720
 of the compression stroke where the valve 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.720
 absorbs and releases energy accumulate 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:38.550
 the average engine and programmable brake 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.470
 mc eu for example to reduce the use 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.800
 motor expenses while driving in 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.840
 city 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.149
 your park could specify that the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.360
 engine brake can not be engaged in 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.429
 below 56 kilometers per hour 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.409
 so you will not hear the sound of 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.030
 motor brake and respect the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.190
 local regulations on noise 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.560
 another function allows the 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.979
 speed control to activate the brake 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.229
 engine 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.289
 if the driving speed exceeds the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.630
 limit of cruise control by 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.090
 example in a downward slope according to 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.160
 the engine model another function 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.560
 indicates precisely when the brake 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.750
 motor is activated either by removing 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.040
 simply the foot of the accelerator or 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.390
 pressing the service brake 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.709
 turn on the car switch for 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.269
 activate and deactivate the engine brake 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:31.250
 using another to adjust the level 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:33.810
 engine braking to raise or low 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.910
 learn the configuration of your brake 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.910
 engine to find out how it works 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.690
 if it provides some benefits 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.269
 best way to save money 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.160
 fuel and anticipate traffic 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.019
 in front of you and to avoid 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.019
 slowdowns and sudden stops 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.560
 ops 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.750
 kas reduce the deceleration number 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.280
 sudden and the number of times they 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.280
 use the service charge 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.830
 check your knowledge the brakes 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.959
 commons engines can you do 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.269
 save fuel and prevent 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.010
 wear of the service brakes but 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:21.030
 how to save fuel 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:23.010
 braking answer the best way 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.379
 to save fuel during the 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.239
 braking is probably to anticipate the 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.209
 circulation and to avoid 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.360
 slowdowns and sudden stops 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.360
