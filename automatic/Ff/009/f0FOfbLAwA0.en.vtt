00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.139
 friends friends today I'm going to record a 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.490
 video in which to explain how they are made 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.930
 some boiled eggs and supposedly 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.310
 I hope it goes well I will leave 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.310
 all get along 30 days 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.500
 we have to put the glass the water and 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.500
 squirt vinegar 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.480
 pour a handful of salt and put the 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.850
 eggs very carefully with a 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.850
 spoon so they do not hit the 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.250
 background and they break and so with a lot 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.970
 watch out 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:49.510
 they say the gossips and the legends 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.460
 urban areas so the yolks come out all in 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.090
 the center and for example it comes in handy 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.640
 for the issue of making governments or doing 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.820
 skewers with eggs and well let's go to 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.700
 see if it's true 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.030
 then we will check until we see some 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.960
 12 minutes and then we will check to see 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.830
 if it's true 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.830
 good 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.320
 how they have created the perfect games what 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.800
 better to do this so that the 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.800
 shell 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.740
 let's break many places and leave 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.740
 perfectly 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.180
 it is always best to do it under 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.190
 water jet of rich because it always 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.630
 they create much easier but good here not 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.869
 I have a rich 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.400
 then as I am recording I do not want 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.630
 that looks 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:50.289
 bad good let's go for other 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.530
 that is if it is crushed and the shell like 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.509
 You see it breaks into a thousand pieces like that 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.240
 it's easier and now we have to 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.780
 Check if the center has remained 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.140
 bud as well as the propaganda says in its 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.140
 site let's check it right away 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.690
 come the little egg but to you 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.700
 this is fine 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.150
 I do not know what 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.150
 Y 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.020
 and we're going to cut it in half and we're going to 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.020
 see how it has been 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.440
 surprise will be in place 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.480
 I 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.030
 I think I'm going to leave it here so that 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.770
 it looks better and we're going to do it with another 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.620
 stick to see that it is not chance 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.450
 Well, yes, yes, they were pretty much 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:54.060
 in its centered place 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.120
 let's see I'll teach you right now 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.019
 for you to see 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.019
 there you have 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.620
 two perfectly cooked eggs with the 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.060
 central bud and goes with this 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.050
 demonstration that eggs can be 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:15.420
 catch more or less perfect I say goodbye 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.420
 as always until always friends
