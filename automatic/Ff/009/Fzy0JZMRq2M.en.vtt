00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.509
 welcome to my channel I'm run and the day 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.850
 today I want to teach you how to do these 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:20.640
 beautiful badges 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.640
 for our special celebrations 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.190
 applying them first simpler than it is 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.710
 the hat 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.829
 using our gun as always 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.100
 of silicon we are going to stick first this 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.100
 piece 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.300
 let's put in this part of here 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.100
 remember that the molds I am 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.620
 sharing on my facebook and twitter 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.989
 the links to go directly to the molds 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.520
 are here below this video where 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.370
 says information 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.970
 there they just click on the links and 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.350
 they go straight to the molds 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.350
 then we paste this piece 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.380
 we also paste what is the button 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.380
 the hat 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.290
 and finally we hit the star in 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.450
 this part of here 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.230
 you have to give our hat and now you 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.020
 I'm going to explain how the mask is made 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.530
 the mask is what I occupy was a 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.210
 family bandit killed a color that 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.030
 contrasts with the color that we are 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.040
 using in this case I'm using 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.140
 Golden 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.450
 and what I did was help in the east and 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.130
 gera sitting we have occupied them before 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.710
 remember to start get them in 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.530
 any craft store or 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.720
 fabrics or even stores and ccoo in 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.940
 any stationery get all this 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.160
 material in this part of here we place 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.160
 this piece we paste well 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.520
 we cut right here in the middle 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.370
 and I silicone here 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.180
 and we are going to paste now 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.909
 this piece 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:25.100
 and we're going to give him, I'm paying him 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:28.240
 review and we are going to paste now this piece 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:34.610
 the cndh talk about the contour shape 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:38.890
 relative and so easy friends 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.780
 we have left our mask is precious 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.770
 I am leaving you with the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.870
 molds that are distinctive these I'm going 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.620
 to leave the mold in case they dare to 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.940
 make a mask for you to for 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.760
 put it on 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.159
 at the party 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.920
 I can not think of hitting this little star 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:05.450
 here is the color that contrasts very 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.450
 well with our anticipated 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.260
 and we are going to stick on this side 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.290
 and finally we are going to occupy what they are 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:24.600
 the feathers these pearls also the 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.600
 they get in craft stores 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.180
 and what I say we're going to do is going to be apply 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.240
 silicon in the back to go 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.580
 placing the pens 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.360
 as you go see that it 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.110
 see well they are placing the pens in 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.110
 the back 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.750
 our mask and now so that what 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.610
 we can occupy as a distinctive 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.960
 We need to put something from where 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:08.730
 we can hang it here I have a ribbon 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:11.460
 super delgadito of the same color as foami 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.130
 what am I occupying for him 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:17.300
 mask and what I'm going to do is going to be 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.300
 just paste it 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.830
 to be able to place it in the part of 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.880
 back and with a security we will be able to 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.580
 use it 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.730
 so that our friendships our 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.370
 guests place it just when 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.790
 come to the party I really want them 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.610
 explain 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.540
 How do I know what the pantyhose says 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.520
 this is much easier 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.700
 and these are the only pieces that 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.650
 we need 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.000
 the only thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.280
 paste 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.569
 to shiver that cut with the scissors 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:03.129
 increased in golden color 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:09.430
 let's paste here along and apply 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:12.270
 silicon and now we paste this piece 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.270
 well along 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.980
 will cut the works 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.290
 I put here in little hearts when we go to 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.740
 paste in this part of here with the 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.740
 silicone 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:41.879
 pretty with super yellow ribbon 

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:45.050
 delgadito more or less from the middle 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:48.289
 half a centimeter wide more or less 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.240
 I did nice and now what I'm going to do 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.550
 it's going to be sticking 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.790
 this is optional you can to what 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.430
 best 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.530
 leave it like that but I think the little monkey 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.880
 light and a little more and that's how it is 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.610
 how do we already have our three 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.770
 distinctive already ready for the 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.790
 we can occupy in any event that 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:12.750
 we can be 15 years a farewell 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:16.180
 Bachelor of bachelor et cetera 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.070
 we only place also in estella 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.120
 in this ribbon cited by the part of 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:25.830
 back as we did with him 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:27.660
 mask to be able to hang it 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.310
 our guests when they arrive 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.110
 so far I leave this and friends 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.660
 I hope you liked that the 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.800
 put into practice and see you in the 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.800
