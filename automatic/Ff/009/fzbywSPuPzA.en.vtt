00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.450 
we'll finish walking out on them just
going<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.009> take<00:01:49.160> a<00:01:49.190> little<00:01:49.400> bit<00:01:49.490> clean<00:01:50.060> film

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
going to take a little bit clean film

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.310 
going to take a little bit clean film
pop<00:01:52.460> that<00:01:52.700> into<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.150> cling<00:01:53.420> film<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:53.870> it<00:01:54.170> looks

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
pop that into the cling film so it looks

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.510 
pop that into the cling film so it looks
a<00:01:54.380> bit<00:01:54.409> rough<00:01:54.650> of<00:01:54.830> this<00:01:54.980> stage<00:01:55.190> but<00:01:55.370> that's

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
a bit rough of this stage but that's

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.810 
a bit rough of this stage but that's
absolutely<00:01:55.820> faint

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
absolutely faint

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.200 
absolutely faint
then<00:01:58.820> we<00:01:58.909> can<00:01:59.030> just<00:01:59.210> clean<00:01:59.330> fold<00:01:59.600> out<00:01:59.750> nicely

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.390 

so<00:02:02.840> then<00:02:02.990> we<00:02:03.080> can<00:02:03.230> just<00:02:03.440> gently<00:02:03.740> again<00:02:04.160> what

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
so then we can just gently again what

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.400 
so then we can just gently again what
the<00:02:04.670> rest<00:02:04.850> of<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.060> PS<00:02:05.270> tree<00:02:05.450> using<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.200> cling

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
the rest of the PS tree using the cling

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.960 
the rest of the PS tree using the cling
film<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:06.680> we're<00:02:06.860> not<00:02:06.920> adding<00:02:07.100> too<00:02:07.430> much<00:02:07.670> flow

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
film so we're not adding too much flow

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.460 
film so we're not adding too much flow
last<00:02:08.479> thing<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.780> want<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:08.960> do<00:02:09.050> is<00:02:09.140> add<00:02:09.259> too

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
last thing you want to do is add too

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.690 
last thing you want to do is add too
much<00:02:09.590> flour<00:02:09.649> that<00:02:10.100> will<00:02:10.220> completely<00:02:10.550> change

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
much flour that will completely change

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.080 
much flour that will completely change
the<00:02:11.210> texture<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.260> pastry<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.730> pH<00:02:13.940> is

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
the texture of the pastry the pH is

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.060 
the texture of the pastry the pH is
ready<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.420> go<00:02:14.570> because<00:02:15.320> you've<00:02:15.650> been<00:02:15.770> working

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
ready to go because you've been working

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.590 
ready to go because you've been working
the<00:02:16.160> gluten<00:02:16.520> in<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.700> flour<00:02:16.730> we've<00:02:17.210> got<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.390> pop

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
the gluten in the flour we've got to pop

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.060 
the gluten in the flour we've got to pop
that<00:02:17.780> pastry<00:02:18.140> into<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.500> fridge<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.740> both

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
that pastry into the fridge to both

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.310 
that pastry into the fridge to both
chill<00:02:19.490> and<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.060> low<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.420> gluten<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.840> rest<00:02:21.080> and

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
chill and the low the gluten to rest and

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.960 
chill and the low the gluten to rest and
then<00:02:21.709> when<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:22.010> shield<00:02:22.340> probably<00:02:22.730> gives<00:02:22.910> a

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
then when that shield probably gives a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.000 
then when that shield probably gives a
good<00:02:23.209> 15<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.780> 20<00:02:24.020> minutes<00:02:24.290> then<00:02:24.650> we<00:02:24.740> can<00:02:24.890> take

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
good 15 to 20 minutes then we can take

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.680 
good 15 to 20 minutes then we can take
out<00:02:25.220> we<00:02:25.340> can<00:02:25.490> roll<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:29.000> it's<00:02:29.120> been<00:02:29.209> about<00:02:29.300> 20

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
out we can roll so it's been about 20

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.030 
out we can roll so it's been about 20
minutes<00:02:29.930> now<00:02:30.050> my<00:02:30.260> pastry<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.650> nice<00:02:30.830> and

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
minutes now my pastry is nice and

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.460 
minutes now my pastry is nice and
chilled<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.720> we're<00:02:32.870> going<00:02:32.959> to<00:02:33.050> do<00:02:33.110> is<00:02:33.230> take<00:02:33.350> the

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
chilled so we're going to do is take the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.850 
chilled so we're going to do is take the
pastry<00:02:33.800> remove<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.400> cling<00:02:34.610> film<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:36.650> then

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
pastry remove the cling film and then

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.130 
pastry remove the cling film and then
depending<00:02:37.610> on<00:02:37.850> how<00:02:37.970> warm<00:02:38.390> your<00:02:38.600> room<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:38.930> hope

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
depending on how warm your room is hope

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.930 
depending on how warm your room is hope
dry<00:02:39.380> home<00:02:39.560> weight<00:02:40.010> of<00:02:40.220> history<00:02:40.400> as<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.820> can

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
dry home weight of history as you can

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.460 
dry home weight of history as you can
see<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.480> want<00:02:41.630> have<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.780> little<00:02:41.989> late

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
see you want have a little late

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.260 
see you want have a little late
scuttling<00:02:43.070> a<00:02:43.190> float<00:02:43.400> about<00:02:43.580> less<00:02:43.850> than<00:02:43.880> last

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
scuttling a float about less than last

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.699 
scuttling a float about less than last
time<00:02:44.390> when<00:02:44.630> you<00:02:44.690> wanted<00:02:44.840> nicely<00:02:45.200> delicately

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
time when you wanted nicely delicately

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.470 
time when you wanted nicely delicately
as<00:02:45.950> I<00:02:46.310> mentioned<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:46.730> know<00:02:46.820> what<00:02:46.940> it<00:02:47.060> had<00:02:47.209> too

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
as I mentioned you know what it had too

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.000 
as I mentioned you know what it had too
much<00:02:47.600> flow<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.050> change<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.530> texture<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:48.920> the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
much flow to change the texture to the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.640 
much flow to change the texture to the
picture<00:02:49.340> so<00:02:49.820> a<00:02:49.850> very<00:02:50.030> general<00:02:50.540> light<00:02:51.200> dusting

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
picture so a very general light dusting

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.740 
picture so a very general light dusting
all<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:51.890> way<00:02:52.010> across<00:02:52.250> then<00:02:53.239> enter<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.570> middle

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
all the way across then enter the middle

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.660 
all the way across then enter the middle
and<00:02:54.170> again<00:02:54.590> it's<00:02:54.860> very<00:02:54.920> important<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.580> work

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
and again it's very important to work

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.160 
and again it's very important to work
from<00:02:55.850> your<00:02:55.910> pastry<00:02:56.209> when<00:02:56.330> it's<00:02:56.450> cool<00:02:56.720> but

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
from your pastry when it's cool but

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
from your pastry when it's cool but
you're<00:02:57.290> going<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.470> take<00:02:57.680> your<00:02:57.800> rolling<00:02:58.010> pin

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
you're going to take your rolling pin

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.199 
you're going to take your rolling pin
and<00:02:58.400> just<00:02:59.330> very<00:02:59.510> gently<00:03:00.790> start<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.850> work<00:03:02.090> the

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
and just very gently start to work the

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.210 
and just very gently start to work the
piston<00:03:02.570> ok<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.050> tumbling<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.620> all<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:03.980> time

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
piston ok and tumbling it all the time

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.130 
piston ok and tumbling it all the time
and<00:03:04.730> just<00:03:04.760> preparing<00:03:05.360> any<00:03:05.480> clouds<00:03:05.750> as<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.020> go

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
and just preparing any clouds as you go

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.990 
and just preparing any clouds as you go
along<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:06.530> just<00:03:06.980> be<00:03:07.070> nice<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.310> gentle<00:03:07.610> with<00:03:07.970> it

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
along so just be nice and gentle with it

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.690 
along so just be nice and gentle with it
that<00:03:08.690> will<00:03:08.870> avoid<00:03:09.170> any<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:09.920> cracks<00:03:10.190> kind

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
that will avoid any of the cracks kind

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.820 
that will avoid any of the cracks kind
of<00:03:10.760> look<00:03:10.910> I'm<00:03:11.900> going<00:03:12.080> to<00:03:12.170> roll<00:03:12.350> this<00:03:12.380> down

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
of look I'm going to roll this down

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.380 
of look I'm going to roll this down
again<00:03:13.100> with<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.400> touch<00:03:13.580> more<00:03:13.790> flour<00:03:14.090> whatever

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
again with a touch more flour whatever

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.509 
again with a touch more flour whatever
you<00:03:14.480> need<00:03:14.630> it<00:03:14.750> try<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:15.739> use<00:03:15.950> as<00:03:16.100> minimal<00:03:16.459> as

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
you need it try and use as minimal as

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.910 
you need it try and use as minimal as
possible<00:03:16.870> but<00:03:17.870> overall<00:03:18.110> this<00:03:18.320> down<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.799> the

possible but overall this down to the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.449 
possible but overall this down to the
bones

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
bones

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.880
