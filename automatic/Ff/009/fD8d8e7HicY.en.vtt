00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
looked and not worry about a weight

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.230 
looked and not worry about a weight
class<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.450> by<00:01:07.930> USA<00:01:08.410> is<00:01:08.560> I<00:01:08.680> knew<00:01:08.920> if<00:01:09.670> I<00:01:09.850> had

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
class and by USA is I knew if I had

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.570 
class and by USA is I knew if I had
followed<00:01:10.270> my<00:01:10.570> plan<00:01:10.869> that<00:01:11.110> would<00:01:11.170> be<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.649> good

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
followed my plan that would be a good

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.680 
followed my plan that would be a good
heavy<00:01:12.789> weight<00:01:13.030> by<00:01:13.630> usa's<00:01:14.200> but<00:01:14.530> I<00:01:15.690> figured

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
heavy weight by usa's but I figured

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.230 
heavy weight by usa's but I figured
perhaps<00:01:17.110> after<00:01:17.619> talking<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:18.190> a<00:01:18.460> couple<00:01:19.090> of

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
perhaps after talking to a couple of

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.469 
perhaps after talking to a couple of
people<00:01:19.570> that<00:01:19.600> I<00:01:19.780> feel<00:01:20.200> are<00:01:20.229> very<00:01:20.500> wise<00:01:20.710> that

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
people that I feel are very wise that

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.370 
people that I feel are very wise that
maybe<00:01:22.479> I<00:01:22.570> should<00:01:22.780> have<00:01:22.900> been<00:01:22.960> a<00:01:23.020> heavy<00:01:23.200> weight

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
maybe I should have been a heavy weight

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.740 
maybe I should have been a heavy weight

but<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:29.960> got<00:02:30.910> what<00:02:31.910> could<00:02:32.090> only<00:02:32.180> be<00:02:32.330> described

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
but I got what could only be described

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.920 
but I got what could only be described
as<00:02:32.959> chronically<00:02:33.590> bad<00:02:33.770> diarrhea<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:35.600> I<00:02:35.750> went

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
as chronically bad diarrhea and I went

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.020 
as chronically bad diarrhea and I went
to<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.110> bathroom<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.830> would<00:02:37.340> guess<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.670> me<00:02:37.819> at

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
to the bathroom I would guess to me at

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.230 
to the bathroom I would guess to me at
least<00:02:38.240> ten<00:02:38.600> times<00:02:39.640> nothing<00:02:40.640> was<00:02:40.819> staying<00:02:41.090> in

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
least ten times nothing was staying in

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.890 
least ten times nothing was staying in
me<00:02:41.890> I<00:02:42.890> was<00:02:43.580> following<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:44.150> typical<00:02:44.540> product

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
me I was following a typical product

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.330 
me I was following a typical product
protocol<00:02:45.350> for<00:02:45.560> carving<00:02:45.830> up<00:02:45.920> for<00:02:46.130> me<00:02:46.220> that

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
protocol for carving up for me that

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.100 
protocol for carving up for me that
would<00:02:46.400> work<00:02:46.520> very<00:02:46.580> well<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.270> it<00:02:47.750> wasn't

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
would work very well and it wasn't

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.780 
would work very well and it wasn't
working<00:02:48.140> I<00:02:48.680> actually<00:02:49.130> started<00:02:49.459> eating

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
working I actually started eating

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.540 
working I actually started eating
pancakes<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.570> wasn't<00:02:50.930> working<00:02:51.459> anything<00:02:52.459> I

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
pancakes that wasn't working anything I

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.890 
pancakes that wasn't working anything I
ate<00:02:52.700> was<00:02:52.910> coming<00:02:53.240> straight<00:02:53.360> through<00:02:53.660> me<00:02:53.780> in<00:02:53.840> a

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
ate was coming straight through me in a

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.090 
ate was coming straight through me in a
matter<00:02:54.080> of<00:02:54.170> minutes<00:02:54.700> when<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.730> got<00:02:55.940> on<00:02:55.970> stage<00:02:56.150> I

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
matter of minutes when I got on stage I

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.900 
matter of minutes when I got on stage I
was<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.480> pretty<00:02:59.480> conditioned<00:03:00.110> but<00:03:01.010> very<00:03:01.250> flat<00:03:01.610> I

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
was a pretty conditioned but very flat I

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.260 
was a pretty conditioned but very flat I
wasn't<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.220> version<00:03:04.760> of<00:03:04.820> myself<00:03:05.000> that

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
wasn't the the version of myself that

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.020 
wasn't the the version of myself that
should<00:03:05.600> have<00:03:05.690> been<00:03:06.489> interestingly<00:03:07.489> enough

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
should have been interestingly enough

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.120 
should have been interestingly enough
after<00:03:09.580> prejudging<00:03:10.580> I<00:03:10.900> ate<00:03:11.900> three<00:03:12.500> meals<00:03:12.530> in<00:03:13.040> a

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
after prejudging I ate three meals in a

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.090 
after prejudging I ate three meals in a
row<00:03:13.600> spread<00:03:14.600> apart<00:03:14.750> by<00:03:15.140> about<00:03:15.380> 90<00:03:15.709> minutes<00:03:15.890> or

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
row spread apart by about 90 minutes or

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.699 
row spread apart by about 90 minutes or
so<00:03:16.250> of<00:03:16.550> all<00:03:16.790> burgers<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.360> fries<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.900> drank<00:03:18.470> two

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
so of all burgers and fries I drank two

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.699 
so of all burgers and fries I drank two
gatorades<00:03:19.070> I<00:03:19.930> drank<00:03:20.930> tons<00:03:21.350> of<00:03:21.680> diet<00:03:22.250> coke<00:03:22.519> and

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
gatorades I drank tons of diet coke and

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.740 
gatorades I drank tons of diet coke and
and<00:03:24.709> water<00:03:25.220> I<00:03:25.430> find<00:03:25.790> when<00:03:25.880> I<00:03:25.940> drink<00:03:26.180> diet<00:03:26.480> soda

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
and water I find when I drink diet soda

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.840 
and water I find when I drink diet soda
it<00:03:27.410> actually<00:03:27.830> helps<00:03:28.220> me<00:03:28.340> with<00:03:28.489> the<00:03:28.519> rebound

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
it actually helps me with the rebound

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.360 
it actually helps me with the rebound
not<00:03:29.090> being<00:03:29.300> as<00:03:29.420> bad<00:03:29.570> from<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.840> diuretics<00:03:30.410> and

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
not being as bad from the diuretics and

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.720 
not being as bad from the diuretics and
interestingly<00:03:31.910> enough<00:03:32.450> after<00:03:32.930> all<00:03:33.079> that<00:03:33.350> I

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
interestingly enough after all that I

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.210 
interestingly enough after all that I
was<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.760> pound<00:03:35.090> lighter<00:03:35.239> hours<00:03:36.230> later<00:03:36.470> than

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
was a pound lighter hours later than

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.449 
was a pound lighter hours later than
when<00:03:37.370> I<00:03:37.400> had<00:03:37.459> even<00:03:37.549> woken<00:03:37.940> up<00:03:39.190> things<00:03:40.190> still

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
when I had even woken up things still

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.699 
when I had even woken up things still
didn't<00:03:40.610> want<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.820> stay<00:03:41.000> in<00:03:41.030> me<00:03:41.329> I<00:03:41.540> did<00:03:42.320> fill<00:03:42.590> out

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
didn't want to stay in me I did fill out

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.729 
didn't want to stay in me I did fill out
considerably<00:03:43.280> for<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.640> night<00:03:43.820> show<00:03:44.739> but

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
considerably for the night show but

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.420 
considerably for the night show but
still<00:03:46.459> not<00:03:47.030> where<00:03:47.329> I<00:03:47.360> should<00:03:47.630> have<00:03:47.750> been<00:03:47.959> I<00:03:48.769> can

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
still not where I should have been I can

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.180 
still not where I should have been I can
only<00:03:49.519> be<00:03:49.760> mad<00:03:49.940> at<00:03:50.060> myself<00:03:50.180> for<00:03:50.510> this<00:03:50.810> because

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
only be mad at myself for this because

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.190 
only be mad at myself for this because
it<00:03:52.190> was<00:03:52.340> my<00:03:52.519> decision<00:03:52.579> to<00:03:53.030> change<00:03:53.540> my<00:03:53.780> plan<00:03:54.019> and

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
it was my decision to change my plan and

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.500 
it was my decision to change my plan and
then<00:03:54.290> changing<00:03:54.680> again<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:55.970> know<00:03:56.090> you

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
then changing again so you know you

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.910 
then changing again so you know you
could<00:03:56.690> only<00:03:56.840> assume<00:03:56.989> that<00:03:57.230> things<00:03:57.530> would<00:03:57.769> go

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
could only assume that things would go

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.030 
could only assume that things would go
wrong<00:03:57.950> when<00:03:58.459> it<00:03:58.549> did<00:03:58.700> that<00:03:59.799> but<00:04:00.799> most

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
wrong when it did that but most

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.460 
wrong when it did that but most
importantly<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:02.720> reason<00:04:02.989> that<00:04:03.019> I<00:04:03.170> want<00:04:03.380> to

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
importantly the reason that I want to

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.380 
importantly the reason that I want to
make<00:04:03.590> this<00:04:03.620> video<00:04:04.100> is<00:04:04.370> because<00:04:04.519> I'm<00:04:05.090> actually

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
make this video is because I'm actually

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.550 
make this video is because I'm actually
embarrassed<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:09.440> took<00:04:09.560> 18<00:04:10.370> months<00:04:10.400> off

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
embarrassed that I took 18 months off

embarrassed that I took 18 months off
took<00:04:12.560> eight<00:04:12.769> weeks<00:04:13.100> to<00:04:13.310> prep<00:04:13.519> for<00:04:13.579> a<00:04:13.790> show

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000
