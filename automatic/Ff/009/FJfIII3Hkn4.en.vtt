hi I'm Jay McLaughlin and I'm a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.320 
hi I'm Jay McLaughlin and I'm a
photographer<00:00:22.310> good<00:00:23.310> photography<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.210> all

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
photographer good photography is all

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330 
photographer good photography is all
about<00:00:24.509> getting<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.840> best<00:00:24.869> angles<00:00:25.500> we<00:00:26.070> limpa

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
about getting the best angles we limpa

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.670 
about getting the best angles we limpa
spin<00:00:26.550> system<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.150> its<00:00:27.660> wide<00:00:27.960> range<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.320> lenses

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
spin system and its wide range of lenses

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.780 
spin system and its wide range of lenses
the<00:00:29.130> possibilities<00:00:29.789> are<00:00:30.000> endless

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.540 

wide-angle<00:00:35.690> lenses<00:00:36.260> have<00:00:36.890> a<00:00:36.950> much<00:00:37.220> wider

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
wide-angle lenses have a much wider

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.640 
wide-angle lenses have a much wider
field<00:00:38.000> of<00:00:38.120> view<00:00:38.180> so<00:00:39.080> we're<00:00:39.200> using<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:39.440> 12

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
field of view so we're using the 12

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.920 
field of view so we're using the 12
millimeter<00:00:40.220> lens<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:40.640> getting<00:00:41.210> much<00:00:41.600> more<00:00:41.810> of

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
millimeter lens and getting much more of

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:49.170 
millimeter lens and getting much more of
the<00:00:41.990> story

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.810 

by<00:00:50.110> switching<00:00:50.380> to<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:50.620> telephoto<00:00:51.100> lens<00:00:51.460> like

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
by switching to a telephoto lens like

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.570 
by switching to a telephoto lens like
the<00:00:51.910> 75<00:00:52.390> millimeter<00:00:52.810> you<00:00:53.680> can<00:00:53.830> get<00:00:54.010> a<00:00:54.220> much

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
the 75 millimeter you can get a much

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.760 
the 75 millimeter you can get a much
narrower<00:00:54.910> field<00:00:55.300> of<00:00:55.510> view<00:00:55.690> which<00:00:56.470> means<00:00:56.680> you

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
narrower field of view which means you

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:07.850 
narrower field of view which means you
get<00:00:56.860> right<00:00:57.130> to<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.340> heart<00:00:57.520> of<00:00:57.730> yet

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.250 

for<00:01:08.640> more<00:01:08.790> interesting<00:01:09.090> perspective<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:10.140> can

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
for more interesting perspective you can

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.320 
for more interesting perspective you can
use<00:01:10.410> a<00:01:10.440> fisheye<00:01:10.890> converter<00:01:11.280> get<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.910> really

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
use a fisheye converter get a really

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:21.929 
use a fisheye converter get a really
creative<00:01:12.540> effect

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.999 

use<00:01:22.939> a<00:01:22.970> 60<00:01:23.360> millimeter<00:01:23.750> macro<00:01:24.110> for<00:01:24.560> effective

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
use a 60 millimeter macro for effective

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.249 
use a 60 millimeter macro for effective
macro<00:01:25.399> shots<00:01:25.640> for<00:01:26.090> really<00:01:26.420> really<00:01:26.780> extreme

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
macro shots for really really extreme

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:34.399 
macro shots for really really extreme
close-ups

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.130 

use<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.399> 45<00:01:35.789> millimeter<00:01:36.179> lens<00:01:36.420> which<00:01:36.990> has<00:01:37.109> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
use the 45 millimeter lens which has a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.260 
use the 45 millimeter lens which has a
really<00:01:37.499> wide<00:01:37.710> aperture<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.280> really<00:01:38.999> sharp

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
really wide aperture and really sharp

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.880 
really wide aperture and really sharp
optics<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.200> you'll<00:01:40.319> get<00:01:40.469> that<00:01:40.560> great

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
optics and you'll get that great

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:50.330 
optics and you'll get that great
portrait<00:01:41.340> every<00:01:41.579> time

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.830 

when<00:01:51.340> you<00:01:51.430> can't<00:01:51.670> get<00:01:51.790> close<00:01:52.000> enough<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.690> can

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
when you can't get close enough you can

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.990 
when you can't get close enough you can
use<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.080> 75<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.710> 300<00:01:54.159> millimeter<00:01:54.490> zoom<00:01:54.760> and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
use the 75 to 300 millimeter zoom and

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.490 
use the 75 to 300 millimeter zoom and
then<00:01:55.479> you<00:01:55.540> can<00:01:55.659> bring<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.900> action<00:01:56.020> right<00:01:56.350> to

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
then you can bring the action right to

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.650 
then you can bring the action right to
you
