00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
part off and on and it's just so much

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.349 
part off and on and it's just so much
easier<00:03:05.079> this<00:03:05.620> way<00:03:05.829> but<00:03:06.519> it<00:03:06.670> does<00:03:06.849> not<00:03:07.090> affect

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
easier this way but it does not affect

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
everything it's less like the like

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.430 
everything it's less like the like
basically<00:03:18.489> like<00:03:18.849> it's<00:03:19.540> not<00:03:19.840> even<00:03:20.139> like

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
basically like it's not even like

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.819 
basically like it's not even like
there's<00:03:20.650> no<00:03:20.799> even<00:03:21.900> there's<00:03:22.900> no<00:03:23.079> screen<00:03:23.620> cover

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
there's no even there's no screen cover

there's no even there's no screen cover
on<00:03:24.040> there<00:03:24.250> at<00:03:24.370> all<00:03:24.489> so<00:03:25.269> it's<00:03:25.660> really<00:03:25.870> nice<00:03:26.459> and

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
on there at all so it's really nice and

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.699 
on there at all so it's really nice and
as<00:03:27.849> you<00:03:28.239> have<00:03:28.389> here<00:03:28.599> we<00:03:28.900> have<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.139> outer<00:03:29.349> layer

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
as you have here we have the outer layer

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.300 
as you have here we have the outer layer
production<00:03:30.370> which<00:03:30.699> is<00:03:30.849> the<00:03:31.060> silicone<00:03:31.720> skin

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
production which is the silicone skin

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.460 
production which is the silicone skin
allows<00:03:33.310> for<00:03:33.669> a<00:03:33.699> solid<00:03:34.230> handling<00:03:35.230> on<00:03:35.410> your

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
allows for a solid handling on your

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.580 
allows for a solid handling on your
phone<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:37.299> back<00:03:37.569> is<00:03:37.810> um<00:03:39.120> textured<00:03:40.199> as<00:03:41.199> you<00:03:41.410> can

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
phone the back is um textured as you can

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.119 
phone the back is um textured as you can
see<00:03:41.799> here<00:03:44.129> adding<00:03:45.129> a<00:03:46.410> little<00:03:47.410> bit<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.919> a

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
see here adding a little bit of a

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.339 
see here adding a little bit of a
refined<00:03:48.549> look<00:03:48.790> but<00:03:49.299> it<00:03:49.599> definitely<00:03:49.810> does<00:03:50.079> not

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
refined look but it definitely does not

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.039 
refined look but it definitely does not
limit<00:03:50.829> the<00:03:51.040> functionality<00:03:51.419> it<00:03:52.419> also<00:03:52.569> creates

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
limit the functionality it also creates

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.270 
limit the functionality it also creates
a<00:03:53.260> bit<00:03:53.680> of<00:03:53.709> friction<00:03:54.099> on<00:03:55.079> those<00:03:56.079> semi<00:03:56.650> slippery

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
a bit of friction on those semi slippery

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.229 
a bit of friction on those semi slippery
surfaces<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.650> just<00:04:00.370> stick<00:04:00.609> this<00:04:00.819> in<00:04:01.060> right

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
surfaces so just stick this in right

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.210 
surfaces so just stick this in right
here<00:04:03.750> again<00:04:04.750> there's<00:04:05.109> like<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.290> little<00:04:05.620> dip

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
here again there's like a little dip

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.020 
here again there's like a little dip
right<00:04:06.430> here<00:04:06.849> sign<00:04:07.750> it<00:04:07.900> in<00:04:09.359> everything<00:04:10.359> is<00:04:10.569> very

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
right here sign it in everything is very

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.240 
right here sign it in everything is very
form-fitted<00:04:13.290> there<00:04:14.290> will<00:04:14.409> be<00:04:14.500> no<00:04:14.680> onion<00:04:15.099> no

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
form-fitted there will be no onion no

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.330 
form-fitted there will be no onion no
awkward<00:04:15.909> spaces<00:04:16.919> at<00:04:17.919> all

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.750 

it<00:04:21.910> really<00:04:22.120> is<00:04:22.330> like<00:04:22.360> a<00:04:22.510> puzzle<00:04:22.750> piece<00:04:23.139> and<00:04:23.760> you

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
it really is like a puzzle piece and you

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:34.170 
it really is like a puzzle piece and you
just<00:04:24.940> got<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.150> fiddle<00:04:25.720> with<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:25.870> a<00:04:26.050> bit<00:04:32.010> um<00:04:33.180> I

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
just got to fiddle with it a bit um I

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.400 
just got to fiddle with it a bit um I
but<00:04:35.169> everything's<00:04:35.830> really<00:04:36.220> precise<00:04:37.410> the

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
but everything's really precise the

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.770 
but everything's really precise the
cutouts<00:04:38.889> you'll<00:04:39.220> see<00:04:39.430> for<00:04:39.820> your<00:04:40.150> mute<00:04:40.360> button

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
cutouts you'll see for your mute button

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.750 
cutouts you'll see for your mute button
and<00:04:41.550> your<00:04:42.960> headphones<00:04:44.310> also<00:04:45.310> on<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.460> bottom
