forward it a little bit somewhat through
some<00:00:19.170> parts<00:00:19.439> because<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.830> basically<00:00:20.220> lay<00:00:20.699> in

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.910 
as you can see in the title definitely
pretty<00:00:25.800> exciting<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:26.550> since<00:00:26.820> um<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.869> i<00:00:28.410> get<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
pretty exciting but since um I i get the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.640 
pretty exciting but since um I i get the
Moab<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.400> then<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.880> died<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.230> technically

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
Moab and then I died so I technically

Moab and then I died so I technically
don't<00:00:31.830> get<00:00:32.009> any<00:00:32.160> kills<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.790> guys<00:00:32.910> know

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.720 
don't get any kills for you guys know
how<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.360> goes<00:00:33.860> but<00:00:34.860> anyway<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.219> slow<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.610> down

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
how it goes but anyway I slow it down

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.700 
how it goes but anyway I slow it down
and<00:00:36.270> then<00:00:36.660> sometimes<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.170> speeded<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.559> in

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and then sometimes it speeded up in

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.950 
and then sometimes it speeded up in
parts<00:00:38.040> just<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.399> go<00:00:39.030> get<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.540> going<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.840> little

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
parts just to go get it going a little

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.360 
parts just to go get it going a little
bit<00:00:40.110> faster<00:00:40.550> but<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> knife<00:00:42.600> vs.<00:00:43.370> FM

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
bit faster but this is a knife vs. FM

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.729 
bit faster but this is a knife vs. FM
