00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
quite difficult in itself because it

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.099 
quite difficult in itself because it

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.679 
that I seen was in here was worth taking
you<00:01:47.310> can't<00:01:47.490> even<00:01:47.640> get<00:01:47.759> out<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.909> here<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.450> I

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
you can't even get out of here so I

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.600 
you can't even get out of here so I
haven't<00:01:49.259> tried<00:01:49.439> putting<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.829> wooden<00:01:50.100> mask<00:01:50.340> on

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
haven't tried putting the wooden mask on

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.120 
haven't tried putting the wooden mask on
any<00:01:50.970> other<00:01:51.210> place<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.530> went<00:01:53.040> ahead

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
any other place in here but I went ahead

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.310 
any other place in here but I went ahead
and<00:01:53.340> make<00:01:53.430> sure<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.670> take<00:01:53.880> all<00:01:54.060> your<00:01:54.320> your

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
and make sure you take all your your

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.410 
and make sure you take all your your
masks<00:01:55.770> back<00:01:55.979> here<00:01:57.829> there<00:01:58.829> we<00:01:58.979> go<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.420> again

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
masks back here there we go and again

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.330 
masks back here there we go and again
yeah<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.350> where<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.619> actually<00:02:01.860> get<00:02:02.189> it

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
yeah this is where you actually get it

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.120 
yeah this is where you actually get it
and<00:02:03.329> again<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:04.140> say<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.649> hardest<00:02:04.920> one

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and again I I say it's the hardest one

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.490 
and again I I say it's the hardest one
to<00:02:05.159> get<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.640> easy<00:02:06.210> as<00:02:06.360> overall<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:07.140> get<00:02:07.290> but

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
to get it's easy as overall to get but

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.440 
to get it's easy as overall to get but
the<00:02:07.619> hardest<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.220> get<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.940> fact<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.330> you

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
the hardest to get in the fact that you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.300 
the hardest to get in the fact that you
have<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.660> do<00:02:09.780> eight<00:02:10.020> separate<00:02:10.649> quests<00:02:11.129> to
