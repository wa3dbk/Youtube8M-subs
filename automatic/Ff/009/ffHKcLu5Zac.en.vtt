in<00:00:01.610> this<00:00:02.610> video<00:00:02.939> we're<00:00:03.419> going<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.570> discuss

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
in this video we're going to discuss

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.039 
in this video we're going to discuss
similar<00:00:04.470> triangles<00:00:05.810> nice<00:00:06.810> thing<00:00:07.020> about

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
similar triangles nice thing about

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.440 
similar triangles nice thing about
similar<00:00:07.529> triangles<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.760> ratio<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.300> their

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
similar triangles is the ratio of their

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.100 
similar triangles is the ratio of their
sides<00:00:09.840> are<00:00:10.200> congruent<00:00:11.150> what<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.389> means<00:00:12.690> is

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
sides are congruent what that means is

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.829 
sides are congruent what that means is
if<00:00:13.950> we<00:00:14.099> have<00:00:14.219> two<00:00:14.429> similar<00:00:14.910> triangles<00:00:15.240> they

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
if we have two similar triangles they

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.800 
if we have two similar triangles they
don't<00:00:16.020> have<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.230> be<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.470> same<00:00:16.710> size<00:00:17.779> so<00:00:18.779> for

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
don't have to be the same size so for

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.720 
don't have to be the same size so for
instance<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.619> these<00:00:19.830> two<00:00:20.010> triangles<00:00:21.199> side<00:00:22.199> a

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
instance in these two triangles side a

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.359 
instance in these two triangles side a
does<00:00:23.730> not<00:00:23.760> equal<00:00:24.390> side<00:00:24.960> D<00:00:25.289> they<00:00:25.920> are<00:00:26.070> not<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
does not equal side D they are not the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.509 
does not equal side D they are not the
same<00:00:26.550> size<00:00:27.140> but<00:00:28.140> if<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.349> take<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.680> ratio<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.250> two

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
same size but if I take the ratio of two

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.870 
same size but if I take the ratio of two
sides<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:30.240> our<00:00:30.449> smaller<00:00:30.750> triangle<00:00:31.320> say<00:00:31.679> A<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.130> B

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.790 

that<00:00:35.880> will<00:00:36.210> be<00:00:36.390> equal<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.050> ratio<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
that will be equal to the ratio of the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.130 
that will be equal to the ratio of the
corresponding<00:00:38.219> sides<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.960> bigger

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
corresponding sides and the bigger

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.860 
corresponding sides and the bigger
triangle<00:00:41.000> let's<00:00:42.000> talk<00:00:42.210> about<00:00:42.360> what<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.719> mean

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
triangle let's talk about what we mean

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.369 
triangle let's talk about what we mean
by<00:00:42.930> corresponding<00:00:43.890> sides<00:00:44.539> notice<00:00:45.539> where<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.050> is

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
by corresponding sides notice where a is

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.619 
by corresponding sides notice where a is
a<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:49.079> side<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.670> corresponds<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.000> side<00:00:51.270> D

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
a the side a corresponds to the side D

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.740 
a the side a corresponds to the side D
in<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.289> bigger<00:00:52.530> triangle<00:00:53.570> sometimes<00:00:54.570> you'll

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
in the bigger triangle sometimes you'll

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.630 
in the bigger triangle sometimes you'll
see<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.140> notation<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:58.399> corresponds<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.430> D<00:01:01.640> so

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
see this notation a corresponds to D so

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.179 
see this notation a corresponds to D so
that<00:01:02.820> means<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.480> side<00:01:03.930> B<00:01:04.140> corresponds<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.949> e

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
that means and side B corresponds to e

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.679 
that means and side B corresponds to e
so<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.240> over<00:01:06.270> B<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.130> equal<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.790> D

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
so a over B is going to be equal to D

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.050 
so a over B is going to be equal to D
over<00:01:09.720> E<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.979> that's<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.250> nice<00:01:11.400> property<00:01:12.030> of

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
over E and that's a nice property of

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.960 
over E and that's a nice property of
similar<00:01:12.450> triangles<00:01:13.369> there's<00:01:14.369> another<00:01:14.729> way<00:01:14.939> we

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
similar triangles there's another way we

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.050 
similar triangles there's another way we
could<00:01:15.270> set<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.570> our<00:01:15.840> proportion<00:01:16.580> now<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.610> did<00:01:17.909> it

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
could set up our proportion now I did it

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.890 
could set up our proportion now I did it
small<00:01:18.540> triangle<00:01:19.110> equals<00:01:19.740> big<00:01:19.979> triangle<00:01:20.900> but

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
small triangle equals big triangle but

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.560 
small triangle equals big triangle but
it<00:01:22.020> turns<00:01:22.259> out<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.590> could<00:01:22.710> actually<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.570> let's

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
it turns out we could actually do let's

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.469 
it turns out we could actually do let's
say<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.930> wanted<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.229> do<00:01:25.790> side<00:01:26.790> C<00:01:27.210> which

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
say we wanted to do side C which

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.160 
say we wanted to do side C which
corresponds<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.290> side<00:01:28.650> F<00:01:29.720> then<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.869> could<00:01:31.049> look

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
corresponds to side F then I could look

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:39.830 
corresponds to side F then I could look
at<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> ratio<00:01:32.900> of<00:01:33.900> C<00:01:34.320> over<00:01:34.680> F<00:01:36.049> right<00:01:38.840> that'll

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
at the ratio of C over F right that'll

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.690 
at the ratio of C over F right that'll
be<00:01:39.960> equal<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.920> ratio<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.490> other

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
be equal to a ratio of other

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.999 
be equal to a ratio of other
corresponding<00:01:42.479> sides<00:01:42.750> either<00:01:43.320> two<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.770> could

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
corresponding sides either two I could

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.270 
corresponding sides either two I could
do<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.369> over<00:01:45.240> D<00:01:45.450> or<00:01:45.689> B<00:01:46.140> over<00:01:46.470> E<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.210> let's<00:01:48.360> do<00:01:49.280> B

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
do a over D or B over E so let's do B

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
do a over D or B over E so let's do B
over<00:01:50.640> E<00:01:52.579> now<00:01:53.579> here's<00:01:54.360> what's<00:01:54.540> important<00:01:54.990> when

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
over E now here's what's important when

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.190 
over E now here's what's important when
you're<00:01:55.259> setting<00:01:55.619> these<00:01:55.740> up<00:01:56.329> notice<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.960> a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
you're setting these up notice that a

you're setting these up notice that a
over<00:01:58.619> B<00:01:58.890> is<00:02:00.140> part<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.649> same<00:02:02.009> triangle

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
over B is part of the same triangle

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.510 
over B is part of the same triangle
they're<00:02:04.110> both<00:02:04.290> part<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.710> little<00:02:05.009> triangle

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
they're both part of the little triangle

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.490 
they're both part of the little triangle
they're<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> same<00:02:06.000> side<00:02:06.329> D<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.229> E<00:02:07.350> are

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
side setting them up this way notice

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.290 
side setting them up this way notice
that<00:02:12.180> C<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.110> B<00:02:13.430> our<00:02:14.430> part<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.910> little

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
that C and B our part of the little

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.380 
that C and B our part of the little
triangle<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.080> F<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.220> E<00:02:17.520> are<00:02:17.760> part<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.210> big

triangle and F and E are part of the big

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.350 
triangle and F and E are part of the big
triangle<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:19.470> they<00:02:19.590> have<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.860> be<00:02:20.100> matched<00:02:21.060> up

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
triangle so they have to be matched up

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.360 
triangle so they have to be matched up
horizontally<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.800> either<00:02:22.890> have<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.160> match

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
horizontally so you either have to match

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.190 
horizontally so you either have to match
them<00:02:23.520> up<00:02:23.610> vertically<00:02:24.180> or<00:02:24.390> horizontally<00:02:24.420> as

have<00:02:27.870> wanted<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.200> do<00:02:28.470> this<00:02:29.630> why<00:02:30.630> not<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.810> wanted

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
have wanted to do this why not I wanted

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:40.580 
have wanted to do this why not I wanted
to<00:02:31.350> say<00:02:33.530> C<00:02:34.530> over<00:02:35.160> F<00:02:36.470> equals<00:02:37.470> e<00:02:37.740> over<00:02:38.700> B<00:02:39.590> these

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
to say C over F equals e over B these

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.160 
to say C over F equals e over B these
are<00:02:40.860> not<00:02:41.010> part<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.430> same<00:02:41.670> triangle<00:02:42.170> that

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
are not part of the same triangle that

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.860 
are not part of the same triangle that
is<00:02:43.230> not<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.590> true<00:02:43.980> statement<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.760> that's<00:02:45.690> how<00:02:45.780> we

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
is not a true statement so that's how we

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.710 
is not a true statement so that's how we
set<00:02:46.080> up<00:02:46.110> similar<00:02:46.620> triangles<00:02:47.360> now<00:02:48.360> how<00:02:48.510> this

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
set up similar triangles now how this

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.040 
set up similar triangles now how this
works<00:02:49.020> let's<00:02:49.380> give<00:02:50.010> these<00:02:50.160> some<00:02:50.670> sizes<00:02:51.270> let's

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
works let's give these some sizes let's

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.620 
works let's give these some sizes let's
say<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.880> equals<00:02:53.880> two<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:56.220> B<00:02:56.460> equals

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
say that a equals two and that B equals

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:04.280 
say that a equals two and that B equals
three<00:02:58.640> and<00:03:00.470> D<00:03:01.580> equals<00:03:02.580> six<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.510> they<00:03:03.930> want<00:03:04.200> to

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
three and D equals six and they want to

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.400 
three and D equals six and they want to
know<00:03:04.500> what<00:03:05.310> E<00:03:05.490> is<00:03:05.850> equal<00:03:06.210> to<00:03:08.990> this<00:03:09.990> is<00:03:10.200> how<00:03:10.350> we

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
know what E is equal to this is how we

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.610 
know what E is equal to this is how we
would<00:03:10.560> set<00:03:10.830> up<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.400> problem<00:03:12.290> well<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.320> would

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
would set up this problem well I would

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.060 
would set up this problem well I would
take<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.890> ratio<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.340> my<00:03:14.520> sides<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:15.090> over<00:03:15.450> B<00:03:16.070> so

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
take the ratio of my sides a over B so

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.460 
take the ratio of my sides a over B so
two<00:03:17.400> over<00:03:18.030> three<00:03:18.060> equals<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:21.870> set<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.170> up<00:03:22.260> a

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
two over three equals and I set it up a

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.130 
two over three equals and I set it up a
over<00:03:22.770> B<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.430> have<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:23.670> set<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:23.970> up<00:03:24.030> D<00:03:24.390> over<00:03:24.870> E

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
over B so I have to set it up D over E

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.630 
over B so I have to set it up D over E
is<00:03:25.740> equal<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.960> 6<00:03:27.960> over<00:03:28.290> now<00:03:29.130> instead<00:03:29.400> of<00:03:29.460> using

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
is equal to 6 over now instead of using

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.890 
is equal to 6 over now instead of using
question<00:03:30.090> mark<00:03:30.270> how<00:03:30.420> about<00:03:30.450> we<00:03:30.690> use<00:03:30.870> a

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
question mark how about we use a

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.480 
question mark how about we use a
variable<00:03:31.560> say<00:03:32.100> X<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:34.130> we<00:03:35.130> now<00:03:35.280> have<00:03:35.460> a

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
variable say X and we now have a

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.000 
variable say X and we now have a
proportion<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.300> we<00:03:36.420> can<00:03:36.600> solve<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.260> solve

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
proportion that we can solve to solve

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.160 
proportion that we can solve to solve
this<00:03:38.250> proportion<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:39.090> like<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.600> do<00:03:39.750> cross

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
this proportion I like to do cross

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.870 
this proportion I like to do cross
multiplying<00:03:40.920> which<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.340> multiply<00:03:41.820> the

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
multiplying which is multiply the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.490 
multiplying which is multiply the
denominator<00:03:42.630> by<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:43.710> other<00:03:44.070> side<00:03:45.500> that

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
denominator by the other side that

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.100 
denominator by the other side that
leaves<00:03:46.800> me<00:03:47.070> with<00:03:47.100> 2x<00:03:48.290> equals<00:03:49.290> 6<00:03:49.730> times<00:03:50.730> 3<00:03:51.110> which

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
leaves me with 2x equals 6 times 3 which

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.490 
leaves me with 2x equals 6 times 3 which
is<00:03:52.140> 18<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:54.260> can<00:03:55.260> divide<00:03:55.530> both<00:03:55.770> sides<00:03:56.100> by<00:03:56.250> 2<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:57.500> I

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
is 18 I can divide both sides by 2 and I

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.070 
is 18 I can divide both sides by 2 and I
get<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:59.130> that<00:03:59.340> set<00:03:59.670> missing<00:04:00.030> side<00:04:00.270> E<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:01.020> 9

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
get that that set missing side E is 9

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.660 
get that that set missing side E is 9
now<00:04:04.080> let's<00:04:04.380> just<00:04:04.530> take<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:04.920> look<00:04:05.130> at<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.430> set<00:04:05.580> it

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
now let's just take a look at and set it

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.800 
now let's just take a look at and set it
up<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.880> other<00:04:06.000> way<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.270> make<00:04:06.420> sure<00:04:06.570> we<00:04:06.690> get

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
up the other way and make sure we get

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.890 
up the other way and make sure we get
the<00:04:06.960> same<00:04:06.990> thing<00:04:08.030> so<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.060> know<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.300> side<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:09.870> is

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
the same thing so I know that side a is

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.390 
the same thing so I know that side a is
2<00:04:10.350> inside<00:04:10.860> its<00:04:11.070> corresponding<00:04:11.460> side<00:04:11.820> B<00:04:12.600> is<00:04:12.630> 6

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
2 inside its corresponding side B is 6

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.640 
2 inside its corresponding side B is 6
so<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.730> could<00:04:15.240> set<00:04:15.510> that<00:04:15.690> up<00:04:15.750> here<00:04:16.410> I'm<00:04:16.500> going<00:04:16.590> to

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
so I could set that up here I'm going to

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.650 
so I could set that up here I'm going to
put<00:04:16.859> D<00:04:17.190> on<00:04:17.220> top<00:04:17.609> so<00:04:18.000> 6<00:04:18.359> over<00:04:19.549> 2<00:04:20.549> so<00:04:21.060> this<00:04:21.180> is<00:04:21.239> D

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
put D on top so 6 over 2 so this is D

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.879 
put D on top so 6 over 2 so this is D
over<00:04:22.020> E

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
over E

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.200 
over E
let's<00:04:23.490> make<00:04:23.699> a<00:04:23.729> note<00:04:23.969> of<00:04:24.000> that<00:04:24.150> D<00:04:24.479> over<00:04:24.810> e

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
let's make a note of that D over e

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.480 
let's make a note of that D over e
equals<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.810> now<00:04:27.840> he<00:04:28.800> is<00:04:28.919> what<00:04:29.069> I'm<00:04:29.189> looking

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
equals and now he is what I'm looking

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.839 
equals and now he is what I'm looking
for<00:04:29.789> and<00:04:30.000> B<00:04:30.659> I<00:04:30.689> also<00:04:31.080> know<00:04:31.530> II<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.550> B<00:04:32.699> are

is<00:04:58.259> 3<00:05:00.590> ok<00:05:01.909> now<00:05:02.909> we<00:05:03.449> don't<00:05:03.569> need<00:05:03.719> to<00:05:03.840> use<00:05:03.870> cross

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
is 3 ok now we don't need to use cross

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.360 
is 3 ok now we don't need to use cross
multiplying<00:05:04.590> every<00:05:04.860> time<00:05:05.039> I'm<00:05:05.099> gonna<00:05:05.219> show

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
multiplying every time I'm gonna show

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.140 
multiplying every time I'm gonna show
you<00:05:05.430> a<00:05:05.490> little<00:05:05.550> bit<00:05:05.699> different<00:05:06.060> way<00:05:06.120> of

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
you a little bit different way of

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.369 
you a little bit different way of
solving<00:05:06.360> this<00:05:06.740> because<00:05:07.740> I<00:05:07.770> have<00:05:07.949> 6<00:05:08.189> over<00:05:08.310> 2<00:05:08.729> I

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:09.379 
solving this because I have 6 over 2 I

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:13.240 
solving this because I have 6 over 2 I
can<00:05:10.379> 3<00:05:10.590> that<00:05:10.770> is<00:05:10.889> 6<00:05:10.919> divided<00:05:11.490> by<00:05:11.520> 2<00:05:11.610> and<00:05:12.090> I<00:05:12.300> get<00:05:12.360> 3

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
can 3 that is 6 divided by 2 and I get 3

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.830 
can 3 that is 6 divided by 2 and I get 3
equals<00:05:14.250> x<00:05:14.490> over<00:05:15.330> 3<00:05:17.090> now<00:05:18.090> I<00:05:18.120> need<00:05:18.389> to<00:05:18.479> get<00:05:18.569> rid<00:05:18.719> of

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
equals x over 3 now I need to get rid of

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.110 
equals x over 3 now I need to get rid of
this<00:05:18.900> 3<00:05:19.169> in<00:05:19.379> order<00:05:19.529> to<00:05:19.770> solve<00:05:20.009> so<00:05:20.669> one<00:05:20.879> way<00:05:21.029> of

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
this 3 in order to solve so one way of

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.209 
this 3 in order to solve so one way of
doing<00:05:21.270> that<00:05:21.419> is<00:05:21.719> multiply<00:05:22.199> on<00:05:22.349> both<00:05:22.529> sides<00:05:22.860> by

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 
doing that is multiply on both sides by

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:28.550 
doing that is multiply on both sides by
3<00:05:24.590> those<00:05:25.590> cancel<00:05:26.159> and<00:05:26.569> yet<00:05:27.569> once<00:05:27.900> again<00:05:28.080> I<00:05:28.349> get

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
3 those cancel and yet once again I get

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.850 
3 those cancel and yet once again I get
x<00:05:28.919> equals<00:05:29.099> 9<00:05:29.490> or<00:05:29.729> that<00:05:29.849> side<00:05:30.120> a<00:05:30.389> is<00:05:30.659> 9<00:05:30.960> and<00:05:31.650> we

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
x equals 9 or that side a is 9 and we

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.019 
x equals 9 or that side a is 9 and we
looked<00:05:32.009> at<00:05:32.099> a<00:05:32.129> couple<00:05:32.339> different<00:05:32.759> ways<00:05:32.789> of

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.029 
looked at a couple different ways of

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:35.089 
looked at a couple different ways of
setting<00:05:33.180> up<00:05:33.389> our<00:05:33.539> proportion<00:05:33.690> and<00:05:34.229> a<00:05:34.800> couple

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
setting up our proportion and a couple

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:38.870 
setting up our proportion and a couple
different<00:05:35.370> ways<00:05:35.490> of<00:05:35.729> solving<00:05:35.969> our<00:05:36.300> proportion
