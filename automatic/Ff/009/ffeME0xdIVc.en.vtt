00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
that fast it's not like oh I have to get

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.050 
that fast it's not like oh I have to get
it<00:02:27.400> there<00:02:27.489> quick<00:02:27.790> just<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:30.430> have<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.880> do<00:02:30.970> it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
quick enough you know and one thing with

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.460 
quick enough you know and one thing with
the<00:02:33.819> strobe<00:02:34.060> mode<00:02:34.239> is<00:02:34.390> after<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.049> after<00:02:35.380> it

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
the strobe mode is after it after it

the strobe mode is after it after it
goes<00:02:35.590> in<00:02:35.739> a<00:02:35.830> strobe<00:02:36.130> if<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.120> click<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:37.510> hold

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
goes in a strobe if you click and hold

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.000 
goes in a strobe if you click and hold
the<00:02:37.690> tail<00:02:37.930> cap<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.319> goes<00:02:38.470> in<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.680> high-low

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
the tail cap it goes in a high-low

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
anomaly release it goes off this is the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.400 
anomaly release it goes off this is the
exhale<00:02:42.670> 50<00:02:43.060> which<00:02:43.209> is<00:02:43.720> comparable<00:02:44.049> in<00:02:44.319> size<00:02:44.380> to

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
exhale 50 which is comparable in size to

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.190 
exhale 50 which is comparable in size to

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
what the it has had it there's the

Komen<00:02:51.480> LED<00:02:52.650> multicolored<00:02:53.650> light<00:02:53.830> I<00:02:54.010> reviewed

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
Komen LED multicolored light I reviewed

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.630 
Komen LED multicolored light I reviewed
in<00:02:54.549> a<00:02:54.580> previous<00:02:54.790> video<00:02:55.380> this<00:02:56.380> 1d<00:02:56.920> it's<00:02:57.489> a

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
in a previous video this 1d it's a

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.839 
in a previous video this 1d it's a
different<00:02:57.850> style<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.720> opening<00:02:59.140> this<00:02:59.980> one<00:03:00.280> does

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
different style of opening this one does

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.490 
different style of opening this one does
seem<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.120> be<00:03:01.239> brighter<00:03:01.599> well<00:03:02.200> it's<00:03:02.380> not

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
seem to be brighter well it's not

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.580 
seem to be brighter well it's not
focused<00:03:02.980> as<00:03:03.099> well<00:03:03.630> at<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.660> same<00:03:06.870> distance<00:03:09.390> but

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
focused as well at the same distance but

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.280 
focused as well at the same distance but
it's<00:03:11.590> not<00:03:11.859> focused<00:03:12.700> as<00:03:12.880> well<00:03:13.120> as<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:14.109> mag

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
it's not focused as well as the mag

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.800 
it's not focused as well as the mag
light<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:15.820> we'll<00:03:15.940> say<00:03:16.090> how<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.329> do<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:16.690> the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
light is so we'll say how to do it the

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.810 
light is so we'll say how to do it the
mag<00:03:16.959> way<00:03:17.109> more<00:03:17.350> because<00:03:17.769> of<00:03:17.799> that<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.310> do<00:03:18.519> like<00:03:18.790> a

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
mag way more because of that I do like a

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.140 
mag way more because of that I do like a
good<00:03:19.060> focus<00:03:19.510> like<00:03:19.720> this<00:03:20.530> one<00:03:20.709> uses<00:03:20.859> one<00:03:21.160> single

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
good focus like this one uses one single

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.759 
good focus like this one uses one single
I<00:03:22.420> believe<00:03:22.630> it's<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.810> cree<00:03:23.140> LED<00:03:23.410> I<00:03:23.560> forget

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
I believe it's a cree LED I forget

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.160 
I believe it's a cree LED I forget
exactly<00:03:23.859> which<00:03:24.310> one<00:03:24.519> but<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.570> do<00:03:25.690> like<00:03:25.930> it

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
exactly which one but I do like it

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.380 
exactly which one but I do like it
doesn't<00:03:26.410> work<00:03:26.560> very<00:03:26.590> well<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.790> standard

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
doesn't work very well it is standard

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.160 
doesn't work very well it is standard

mag light on focus ability by twisting

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.330 
mag light on focus ability by twisting
this<00:03:32.290> but<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:32.590> got<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.739> be<00:03:32.829> careful<00:03:32.950> not<00:03:33.190> to

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
this but you got to be careful not to

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.840 
this but you got to be careful not to
twist<00:03:33.430> out<00:03:33.730> too<00:03:33.910> far<00:03:34.150> as<00:03:34.420> usual<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.380> bites

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
twist out too far as usual that bites

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.190 
twist out too far as usual that bites
what's<00:03:36.850> what<00:03:37.060> what's<00:03:37.269> what's<00:03:37.720> cool<00:03:37.989> with<00:03:38.079> this

what's what what's what's cool with this

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.330 
what's what what's what's cool with this
when<00:03:38.410> is<00:03:38.500> your<00:03:39.390> serial<00:03:40.390> number<00:03:41.250> it's<00:03:42.250> actually

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
when is your serial number it's actually

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.180 
when is your serial number it's actually
hidden<00:03:42.730> away<00:03:42.880> under<00:03:43.030> there<00:03:43.829> so<00:03:44.829> it<00:03:44.920> might<00:03:45.069> be<00:03:45.100> a

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
hidden away under there so it might be a

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.410 
hidden away under there so it might be a
little<00:03:45.340> hard<00:03:45.549> to<00:03:45.670> see<00:03:45.880> I've<00:03:46.000> got<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.389> covered
