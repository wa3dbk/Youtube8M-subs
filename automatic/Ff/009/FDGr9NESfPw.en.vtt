00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.500
 hi to all his Libyan friends come on 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.090
 my channel today I'm coming back with 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.950
 a new video and it was a video 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.890
 I had proposed a cube subscribers 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.210
 had proposed to me who found that 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.589
 interesting you do it and I you 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.989
 had asked the question empty and yes 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:28.419
 it's my top 5 breach blush for me 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.640
 it's something essential 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.619
 when you make your complexion it's really 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.079
 something that will allow you 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.239
 restore the glory of the league of the 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.969
 brightness of cheerfulness to your face 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.949
 and it's a must when you go 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.359
 makeup is really something 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.949
 very important especially when you are 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.530
 wear makeup complexion submit your background 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.030
 powder complexion and all that bluffing you 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.699
 are obliged to really put some 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.859
 really really and I love it 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.420
 so it's true that I often put back 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.489
 the same because I have my 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.929
 preferences and my habits and everything 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.699
 but I have full full full 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.230
 but I still have my preferences and 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.280
 I managed to make you a top 5 you 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.080
 have said yeah I do not know if 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.000
 a top 10 a top 5 but I managed to 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.580
 please 9.5 so we'll start everything from 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.800
 next I do not know if I wanted but 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.300
 in order or not good I will not you 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.130
 love so much there is not one that I 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.750
 prefers more than others maybe there 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.220
 a 1 would really tell you and we'll 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.410
 start right away with this one 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.840
 nothing clinical chic that I love 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.490
 of shares already its packaging that was 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.730
 superb or so it's true that this is 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.500
 a little bit destroyed gold to read because 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.760
 it was a flower all in relief 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.190
 and here it is a blush actually going 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.960
 have a satin iris side not know 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.030
 use these satin is really very 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.020
 very very subtle and I love his 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.070
 colors there are you going to see there when 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.640
 even a little the same colors that 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.530
 stand out in my top 5 this is between the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.650
 pink and orange 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.000
 this is a pretty hot salmon to his 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.670
 cool not hypra flashy it's still 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.920
 rather discreet 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.509
 this is really a color that I 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.530
 found essential when one has the complexion 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.689
 not too dark white and and that is very 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.119
 very nice for skins for skins 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.459
 this is for those for the shots a little 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.869
 matt also because it's a color 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.560
 hot which is very pretty on the skins 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.230
 mates and so that's my first of the top 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.660
 we follow with one that I love I love 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.700
 i love it i love it is the bella bamba 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.040
 so I hesitated to introduce you because 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.019
 that I believe they do more but good 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.569
 it's part of my top 5 so I'll you 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.550
 present anyway it's a blush of 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.830
 at benefit that looks like this 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.380
 here is a little jean package too much 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.319
 beautiful in cardboard but really beautiful 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.420
 and in fact it's an iridescent bluff and there 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.170
 it's really iridescent it's very very 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.850
 beautiful is a rose a pretty hot pink 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:49.080
 but who is really brilliant who 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.510
 leaves a luminous finish on the cheek 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.549
 is very very very pretty and in fact he is going 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.440
 get a little closer to orgasm from home 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.880
 nars actually me it's a blush that I 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.549
 do not have nars at home when 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.950
 same as I order and it's a 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.540
 blush that goes that everybody loves to 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.359
 at nars orgasm and I find that here 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.130
 do not get bad you have a good dupe 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.600
 in this one so I do not know 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.070
 which it cheaper we would like 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.780
 the profit but cheaper because 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.630
 narrate it's pretty expensive but at 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.030
 this one is very very beautiful these are these 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.980
 two by bram in its shine this side 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.870
 iridescent who is very handsome on the cheek 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.269
 especially when you add a little 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.850
 highlight in addition there is a top of the 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.739
 top and I love this one in thicker 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.840
 that jean here will benefit from 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.329
 too much too good packaging so that's 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.760
 between bluff and leiter there are two 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:40.590
 products in one actually stands as 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.260
 these and I love I love to perform 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.900
 so it's also hyper iridescent 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.450
 metallized afterwards it is very very very 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.940
 beautiful is the extra dimension skin finish 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.579
 and this one is that of a future he 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.840
 is too much so you have here the 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.910
 background is so that I 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.830
 but really bluffing here is a 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.230
 browser anymore to put on top in 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.590
 light but I really use final 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.569
 Too beautiful and beautiful tro tro bo 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.480
 do the swatch he's really great 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.319
 pretty on the cheek and bright he has a little 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.330
 background is still 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.950
 so it's not bad for skins 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.350
 who are happy that they are a little 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.359
 darker than mine here you are 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.359
 really have a very pretty blush that goes 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.190
 you give back a wood had been made 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.050
 really metallic a bit sophisticated 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.930
 who is very pretty I find in a 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.520
 pretty strong makeup for the evening and 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.490
 it's really the perfect blush 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.210
 and here I am there another one of 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.280
 at pie 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.530
 there we go in the low maths both 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.180
 last is the maths it's this one 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.590
 So here in small packaging 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.630
 pie they are really blushes too 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.880
 too beautiful then basically the blushes of 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.060
 at darty are bigger there it was 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.710
 in a kit with a palette of makeup 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.600
 eyelids and that there were four 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.870
 blutch I believe it seems to me and so he 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.039
 there was the format a little smaller 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.000
 so the packaging is just too good 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.490
 magnificent 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.260
 in fact at home they make their packaging 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.690
 exactly the same color as the bluff 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.639
 that the color of blue gold so to 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.780
 every time the shaq bloch you go 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.669
 choose you have the color of the 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.130
 packaging that change and it's too much 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.990
 too nice I think it's a packaging 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.240
 very simple but really very pretty and 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.630
 this is a rose so he can 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.849
 to practice above it takes petulant he 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.830
 can be if you put it in big 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.770
 dose but then still had a 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.349
 little sew them who is very pretty who 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.750
 is a little chopped fresh and it's 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.729
 what I like with the matte blushes ek that 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.940
 is a little cool in fact this is the 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.440
 cool side that it gives a fat blush 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.710
 especially in the shades here are in the 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.599
 clear salmonish pink hues all that 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.550
 it really is on the rise and what I 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:47.220
 I love this effect and that one is 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.780
 perfect for that if you put that if 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.789
 you do not wear too much makeup or 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.710
 that's the way that put it 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.870
 little blue chahed suite it's a little 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.060
 fresh face and I love it 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.870
 is too pretty 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:02.630
 here is called fantastic and obstacles 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.070
 ended up being last and I believe 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.050
 still it's my favorite 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.470
 I tell you about it I talked about it very 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.130
 often you want it but I put it 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.340
 in the top 5 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.560
 it's a blush from the bold and he 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.180
 is too beautiful on the golden dress had him 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.040
 bought on private beauty and it's too 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.810
 pretty so what's cool is my 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.880
 direct it's a magazine actually one is 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.770
 a small magazine combres and there he 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.800
 is called pleasures of autumn fun for 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.240
 death bluff is too good it's like 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.500
 this you always have a small mirror 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.419
 which is very practical even for 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.770
 take it in his bag to take your 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.960
 blush and like that take me your red 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:39.139
 to lipstick remix the two feelings 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.210
 the friendly and it is matte 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.310
 I really like the match blushes I 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.500
 believe that I prefer morning blushes the 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.740
 chianese and yeah you prefer I find 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.780
 it's pretty on the left eardrum mats 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.990
 and that's really all there is to it 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.750
 more beautiful in fact to finalize his 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:59.330
 dyed to restore the radiance of the 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.160
 color to the way makeup and that 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.450
 Well, it's a bit like the first 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.330
 you made it home clinic 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:07.340
 is between the orange sum and the 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.100
 troubles I love he's really very 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.650
 very beautiful the cool if I wear there 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.630
 I put all the time I loved everything 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.070
 time hand me slightly but she 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.210
 is really very very very nice game 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.759
 love it on the a6 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.830
 favorite among favorites I you 

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:25.710
 prompt you can buy on the on the 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:28.889
 site the bold directly and manage in 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:30.780
 France no problem and that's what 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:33.840
 this is my top 5 I hope it will not be 

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:36.270
 more to know but favorite blush and 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.160
