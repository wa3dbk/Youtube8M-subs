emperor<00:01:46.890> props<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.579> mark<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:48.180> in

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
emperor props to mark on that one in

emperor props to mark on that one in
this<00:01:48.600> study<00:01:48.899> researchers<00:01:49.170> took<00:01:49.860> two<00:01:50.220> huge

this study researchers took two huge

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.690 
this study researchers took two huge
groups<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.210> Swedes<00:01:51.540> one<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:52.290> more<00:01:52.439> than

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
groups of Swedes one with more than

groups of Swedes one with more than
61,000<00:01:53.700> women<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.329> other<00:01:54.420> one<00:01:54.630> with<00:01:54.780> more

than 45,000 men and then followed them

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.780 
than 45,000 men and then followed them
for<00:01:57.719> an<00:01:57.840> average<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.229> 20<00:01:58.560> years<00:01:58.860> they<00:01:59.460> wanted

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
for an average of 20 years they wanted

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.490 
for an average of 20 years they wanted
to<00:01:59.880> see<00:02:00.030> if<00:02:00.119> milk<00:02:00.420> intake<00:02:00.810> was<00:02:01.049> related<00:02:01.469> to

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
to see if milk intake was related to

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.069 
to see if milk intake was related to
fractures<00:02:02.189> or<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.729> death<00:02:03.000> cuz<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.630> know<00:02:03.750> milk

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
fractures or to death cuz you know milk

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.330 
fractures or to death cuz you know milk
is<00:02:04.290> awesome<00:02:04.649> for<00:02:04.829> bones

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
is awesome for bones

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.160 
is awesome for bones
except<00:02:06.060> there's<00:02:06.270> pretty<00:02:06.450> much<00:02:06.509> no<00:02:06.780> evidence

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
except there's pretty much no evidence

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.990 
except there's pretty much no evidence
for<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.979> also<00:02:08.129> turns<00:02:08.489> out<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.700> there's

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
for that it also turns out that there's

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.639 
for that it also turns out that there's
a<00:02:09.090> growing<00:02:09.270> concern<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.780> excessive<00:02:10.440> milk

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
a growing concern that excessive milk

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.140 
a growing concern that excessive milk
intake<00:02:11.099> could<00:02:11.310> be<00:02:11.400> related<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.819> bad

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
intake could be related to bad

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.370

comes<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:13.980> what<00:02:14.100> did<00:02:14.190> these<00:02:14.310> researchers<00:02:14.850> find

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
comes so what did these researchers find

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.910 
comes so what did these researchers find
women<00:02:15.600> who<00:02:15.660> had<00:02:15.780> three<00:02:16.080> or<00:02:16.230> more<00:02:16.410> glasses<00:02:16.530> of

women who had three or more glasses of
milk<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.190> day<00:02:17.220> had<00:02:17.580> an<00:02:17.700> increased<00:02:18.420> risk<00:02:18.690> of

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
milk a day had an increased risk of

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
than one glass a day with a hazard ratio

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.980 
than one glass a day with a hazard ratio
of<00:02:22.770> 1.9<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:24.210> heard<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.450> right

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
of 1.9 you heard that right

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.740 
of 1.9 you heard that right
increased<00:02:25.800> risk<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.280> death<00:02:26.550> for<00:02:27.270> every<00:02:27.540> glass

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
increased risk of death for every glass

of milk drunk per day the hazard ratio
of<00:02:30.060> death<00:02:30.300> went<00:02:30.600> up<00:02:30.720> 1.15<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.920> women<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.630> 1.03

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
of death went up 1.15 and women and 1.03

of death went up 1.15 and women and 1.03
and<00:02:33.810> men<00:02:33.990> but<00:02:34.290> what<00:02:34.410> about<00:02:34.620> fractures<00:02:35.130> in<00:02:35.640> men

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
and men but what about fractures in men

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.320 
and men but what about fractures in men
no<00:02:36.630> difference<00:02:37.110> was<00:02:37.320> seen<00:02:37.590> anywhere<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.550> women

no difference was seen anywhere in women
it<00:02:39.630> turns<00:02:39.930> out<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.260> for<00:02:40.410> each<00:02:40.560> glass<00:02:40.860> of<00:02:41.040> milk

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
it turns out that for each glass of milk

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.600 
it turns out that for each glass of milk
drunk<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.670> hazard<00:02:42.060> ratio<00:02:42.240> was<00:02:42.710> 1.09<00:02:43.710> higher

for<00:02:45.480> hip<00:02:45.660> fractures<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.800> was<00:02:46.950> 1.02<00:02:47.670> overall

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
for hip fractures it was 1.02 overall

the<00:02:54.330> best<00:02:54.600> we<00:02:54.840> can<00:02:54.990> say<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.410> milk<00:02:55.800> wasn't

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
the best we can say is that milk wasn't

the best we can say is that milk wasn't

of hip fractures and women oh and it's

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.810

science<00:03:14.610> experts<00:03:15.420> my<00:03:15.690> point<00:03:15.990> is<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
science experts my point is this the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.650 
science experts my point is this the
purported<00:03:17.280> benefits<00:03:17.400> of<00:03:17.880> milk<00:03:18.090> are<00:03:18.210> unproven

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
purported benefits of milk are unproven

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.750 
purported benefits of milk are unproven
there's<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.410> growing<00:03:19.710> body<00:03:19.890> of<00:03:20.190> evidence<00:03:20.460> that

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
there's a growing body of evidence that

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.760 
there's a growing body of evidence that
there's<00:03:21.060> an<00:03:21.180> association<00:03:21.720> between<00:03:22.020> more<00:03:22.500> milk

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
there's an association between more milk

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.500 
there's an association between more milk
consumption<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.580> bad<00:03:23.790> outcomes

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510

why<00:03:25.080> does<00:03:25.320> milk<00:03:25.560> get<00:03:25.710> a<00:03:25.740> pass<00:03:26.040> why<00:03:26.580> do<00:03:26.640> we<00:03:26.820> push

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
why does milk get a pass why do we push

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.180 
why does milk get a pass why do we push
it<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.360> hard<00:03:27.660> finally<00:03:28.260> over<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.710> our<00:03:28.860> friends

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
it so hard finally over to our friends
