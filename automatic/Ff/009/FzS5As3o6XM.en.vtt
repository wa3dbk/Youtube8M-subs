00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:13.640 

I<00:00:04.890> just<00:00:05.609> think<00:00:05.790> that

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.019 

right<00:00:15.029> so<00:00:16.140> we're<00:00:17.140> addressing<00:00:17.610> the<00:00:18.610> question

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
right so we're addressing the question

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.330 
right so we're addressing the question
are<00:00:19.420> TV<00:00:20.140> channels<00:00:20.470> killing<00:00:20.830> your<00:00:20.920> culture

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
are TV channels killing your culture

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.290 
are TV channels killing your culture
today<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.710> how<00:00:24.520> do<00:00:24.579> you<00:00:24.730> guys<00:00:24.849> deal<00:00:25.119> with<00:00:25.150> that

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
today so how do you guys deal with that

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.540 
today so how do you guys deal with that
do<00:00:25.810> you<00:00:25.869> think<00:00:26.079> that<00:00:26.289> TV<00:00:26.619> channels<00:00:27.369> are

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
do you think that TV channels are

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.890 
do you think that TV channels are
killing<00:00:27.910> our<00:00:28.000> culture<00:00:28.329> or<00:00:28.570> are<00:00:28.750> they

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
killing our culture or are they

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.579 
killing our culture or are they
representing<00:00:29.800> them<00:00:29.980> incorrectly<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:31.720> think<00:00:32.500> it

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:32.589 
representing them incorrectly I think it

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:34.410 
representing them incorrectly I think it
would<00:00:32.710> just<00:00:32.739> depend<00:00:33.160> because<00:00:33.640> I<00:00:34.120> think<00:00:34.180> that

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
would just depend because I think that

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.740 
would just depend because I think that
families<00:00:35.110> today<00:00:35.290> are<00:00:35.970> like<00:00:36.970> families<00:00:37.420> used<00:00:37.629> to

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
families today are like families used to

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.200 
families today are like families used to
be<00:00:37.930> they're<00:00:38.320> like<00:00:38.710> messed<00:00:39.010> up<00:00:39.250> and<00:00:39.550> you<00:00:39.940> know

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
be they're like messed up and you know

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.579 
be they're like messed up and you know
and<00:00:40.570> so<00:00:40.720> a<00:00:40.750> lot<00:00:40.960> of<00:00:40.989> bad<00:00:41.199> feel<00:00:41.500> like<00:00:41.589> it's<00:00:41.769> real

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
and so a lot of bad feel like it's real

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:50.930 
and so a lot of bad feel like it's real
but

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.830 

yeah<00:00:51.940> like<00:00:52.210> that's<00:00:52.480> just<00:00:52.720> ridiculous

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.100 

it's<00:00:59.740> different<00:01:01.200> now

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.540 

how<00:01:05.740> society<00:01:06.580> is<00:01:06.610> now<00:01:07.800> teaching<00:01:08.800> the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
how society is now teaching the

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.220 
how society is now teaching the
difference<00:01:09.880> between<00:01:10.000> our<00:01:10.570> generation<00:01:11.020> our

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
difference between our generation our

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.190 
difference between our generation our
generation<00:01:11.260> is<00:01:12.040> that<00:01:12.310> it's<00:01:13.060> based<00:01:13.990> on

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
generation is that it's based on

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.990 
generation is that it's based on
nihilism<00:01:14.830> and<00:01:15.100> Narcis

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.670 

-<00:01:22.720> is<00:01:23.020> it<00:01:24.210> simple<00:01:25.210> this<00:01:25.360> is<00:01:25.420> on<00:01:25.660> reality<00:01:25.930> how<00:01:26.320> it

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
- is it simple this is on reality how it

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.190 
- is it simple this is on reality how it
is<00:01:26.890> now<00:01:27.100> how<00:01:27.520> we<00:01:27.580> were<00:01:27.970> so<00:01:28.150> absorbed<00:01:28.300> with<00:01:28.750> pain

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
is now how we were so absorbed with pain

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.460 
is now how we were so absorbed with pain
which<00:01:29.740> it<00:01:29.920> was<00:01:30.010> something

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.490 

it's<00:01:34.470> also<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:35.010> reflection<00:01:35.720> right<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:37.110> gossip

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
it's also a reflection right like gossip

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.520 
it's also a reflection right like gossip
for<00:01:37.620> as<00:01:37.860> well<00:01:38.040> same<00:01:38.520> thing

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
for as well same thing

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.180 
for as well same thing
materialistic<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:41.040> know<00:01:41.160> I<00:01:42.920> don't<00:01:43.920> know<00:01:44.010> but

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
materialistic you know I don't know but

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.120 
materialistic you know I don't know but
I<00:01:44.280> also<00:01:44.760> think<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.710> like<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:46.980> been

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
I also think that that like it's been

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.620 
I also think that that like it's been
spotlighted<00:01:47.640> more<00:01:47.820> than<00:01:47.940> it<00:01:48.030> ever<00:01:48.150> has<00:01:48.390> been

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
spotlighted more than it ever has been

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.750 
spotlighted more than it ever has been
with<00:01:49.260> reality<00:01:49.740> shows<00:01:49.920> with<00:01:50.220> shows<00:01:50.430> how<00:01:50.700> many

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
with reality shows with shows how many

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.870 
with reality shows with shows how many
 and<00:01:51.810> all<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.950> don't<00:01:53.550> really

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
 and all that but I don't really

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.430 
 and all that but I don't really
think<00:01:54.150> that's<00:01:54.300> how<00:01:54.510> our<00:01:54.690> culture<00:01:55.080> is<00:01:55.170> as<00:01:55.410> a

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
think that's how our culture is as a

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.370 
think that's how our culture is as a
whole<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.100> mean<00:01:56.850> yes<00:01:57.810> where<00:01:58.050> what's<00:01:58.229> your

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
whole I mean yes where what's your

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.920 
whole I mean yes where what's your
allistic<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.190> right<00:01:59.760> you<00:02:00.210> could<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.720> can't

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
allistic but right you could you can't

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.050 
allistic but right you could you can't
generalize<00:02:01.050> everybody<00:02:01.800> into<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.490> I

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
generalize everybody into that and I

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.690 
generalize everybody into that and I
still<00:02:03.360> think<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.630> there<00:02:03.870> are<00:02:03.900> TV<00:02:04.410> shows<00:02:04.619> that

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
still think that there are TV shows that

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.150 
still think that there are TV shows that
do<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> good<00:02:05.940> job<00:02:06.000> representing<00:02:06.740> our<00:02:07.740> culture

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
do a good job representing our culture

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.610 
do a good job representing our culture
today<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.729> actually<00:02:09.360> do<00:02:09.509> do<00:02:09.690> do<00:02:10.459> do<00:02:11.459> what<00:02:11.760> good

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
today and actually do do do do what good

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.460 
today and actually do do do do what good
with<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:14.400> know<00:02:14.520> like<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.690> was<00:02:16.410> thinking

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
with that you know like I was thinking

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.100 
with that you know like I was thinking
of<00:02:17.130> The<00:02:17.700> Cosby<00:02:18.030> Show<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.540> how<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.810> was<00:02:18.900> such

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
of The Cosby Show and how that was such

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.199 
of The Cosby Show and how that was such
a<00:02:19.140> staple<00:02:19.770> for<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.550> time<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.060> like

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
a staple for the time and like

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.570 
a staple for the time and like
representing<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.050> know<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.620> times<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.280> how

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
representing you know the times and how

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.760 
representing you know the times and how
families<00:02:23.940> worked<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.480> kind<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.810> related

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
I'm like I don't know I think the thing

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.660 
I'm like I don't know I think the thing
is<00:02:33.780> Russ<00:02:34.050> real<00:02:34.320> problems<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:34.920> happen<00:02:35.400> I

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
is Russ real problems that happen I

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.140 
is Russ real problems that happen I
think<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.510> they<00:02:37.100> show<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.580> good<00:02:38.940> family

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
think that they show a good family

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.890 
think that they show a good family
dynamic<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.950> think<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.390> lot<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.600> people

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
dynamic and I think that a lot of people

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.770 
dynamic and I think that a lot of people
can<00:02:43.049> relate<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.470> their<00:02:44.430> lives<00:02:44.670> or<00:02:45.120> people

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
can relate it to their lives or people

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.920 
can relate it to their lives or people
they<00:02:45.810> know<00:02:46.049> or<00:02:46.350> friends<00:02:46.920> or<00:02:47.070> whatnot<00:02:47.549> like

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.459 

especially<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:53.159> don't<00:02:53.719> know<00:02:54.719> they're<00:02:54.930> about<00:02:55.019> to

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:55.469 
especially I don't know they're about to

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:58.069 
especially I don't know they're about to
do<00:02:55.590> material<00:02:56.310> stuff<00:02:56.579> I<00:02:56.790> think<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.390> lot<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:57.840> this

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
do material stuff I think a lot of this

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:13.330 
do material stuff I think a lot of this
new<00:02:58.109> money<00:02:58.709> is

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:45.650 

exactly<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:42.890> I<00:03:43.890> also<00:03:44.760> think<00:03:44.910> they<00:03:45.180> put<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.450> tree

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
exactly so I also think they put a tree

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.150 
exactly so I also think they put a tree
