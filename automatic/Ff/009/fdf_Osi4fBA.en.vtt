00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
to do that takes the pressure off to

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.940 
to do that takes the pressure off to
where<00:01:07.030> you<00:01:07.210> can<00:01:07.390> actually<00:01:07.570> move<00:01:07.930> this<00:01:08.200> piece

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
sorry okay now you can see how sticking

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.330 
sorry okay now you can see how sticking
out<00:02:55.209> right<00:02:55.420> here<00:02:56.820> okay<00:02:58.140> this<00:02:59.140> actually<00:02:59.380> should

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
out right here okay this actually should

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.500 
out right here okay this actually should
be<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:04.390> course<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:05.850> had<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:06.910> reach<00:03:07.090> on<00:03:07.269> with<00:03:07.420> my

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
be of course I had to reach on with my

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.660 
be of course I had to reach on with my
other<00:03:07.720> hand<00:03:07.810> before<00:03:08.440> taking<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.489> pressure

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
other hand before taking the pressure

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.090 
other hand before taking the pressure
off<00:03:09.850> but<00:03:10.540> I'm<00:03:11.080> recording<00:03:11.590> with<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.830> other<00:03:11.920> in

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
off but I'm recording with the other in

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.910 
off but I'm recording with the other in
the<00:03:12.220> house<00:03:12.989> what's<00:03:13.989> kind<00:03:14.230> of<00:03:14.290> moving<00:03:14.470> around

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.690 

maybe<00:03:17.920> as<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.160> can<00:03:18.250> see<00:03:18.370> how<00:03:18.430> this<00:03:18.550> is

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
maybe as you can see how this is

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.690 
maybe as you can see how this is
sticking<00:03:19.030> out<00:03:19.150> now<00:03:19.390> I<00:03:19.900> think<00:03:20.860> should<00:03:21.640> be

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
sticking out now I think should be

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.479 
sticking out now I think should be
disengaged

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
disengaged

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.680 
disengaged
so<00:03:24.489> then<00:03:24.670> what<00:03:24.820> I'll<00:03:24.940> do<00:03:25.090> is<00:03:25.120> I'll<00:03:25.420> just<00:03:25.450> take

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
so then what I'll do is I'll just take

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.670 
so then what I'll do is I'll just take
the<00:03:25.810> cable<00:03:26.170> up<00:03:30.989> take<00:03:31.989> some<00:03:32.019> of<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.410> pressure

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
the cable up take some of the pressure

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:44.550 
the cable up take some of the pressure
off<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.160> jack<00:03:42.120> take<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.269> jack<00:03:43.540> down<00:03:43.570> little

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
off the jack take the jack down little

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.010 
off the jack take the jack down little
tyke<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:45.010> fall<00:03:47.310> it's<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.459> quick

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.460 

okay<00:03:53.020> so<00:03:53.080> now<00:03:53.350> it's<00:03:53.470> hanging<00:03:54.900> should<00:03:55.900> be<00:03:56.140> over

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
okay so now it's hanging should be over

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.290 
okay so now it's hanging should be over
come<00:03:56.710> out<00:03:56.920> now<00:03:58.680> since<00:03:59.680> I<00:03:59.860> push<00:04:00.130> that<00:04:00.280> yoke<00:04:00.610> out

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
without the tire pressure on I can lift

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.520 
without the tire pressure on I can lift
it<00:05:22.740> up<00:05:22.890> basically<00:05:23.789> I<00:05:24.270> actually<00:05:25.020> just<00:05:25.320> did<00:05:25.440> it
