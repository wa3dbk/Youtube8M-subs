a<00:01:45.540> nice<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.409> sustain<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> normal<00:01:47.220> team<00:01:47.460> I

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
a nice to sustain a normal team I

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.289 
a nice to sustain a normal team I
bounced<00:01:50.070> back<00:01:50.250> some<00:01:50.460> toxins<00:01:50.820> fights<00:01:51.060> there

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
bounced back some toxins fights there

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.050 
bounced back some toxins fights there
with<00:01:51.479> my<00:01:51.630> zero<00:01:52.159> but<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.189> just<00:01:53.549> was<00:01:53.700> using<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
with my zero but I just was using a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.700 
with my zero but I just was using a
standard<00:01:54.659> normal<00:01:54.899> team<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.140> really<00:01:55.560> wasn't

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
standard normal team I really wasn't

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.609 
standard normal team I really wasn't
trying<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.310> do<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.700> have<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> start<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:57.750> halfway

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
trying to do it have a start but halfway

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.139 
trying to do it have a start but halfway
through<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> battle<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.219> thought<00:01:59.430> maybe<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.939> can

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
through the battle I thought maybe I can

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.550 
through the battle I thought maybe I can
kind<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.540> bait<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.469> guy<00:02:01.710> out<00:02:03.049> here<00:02:04.049> with<00:02:04.290> my
