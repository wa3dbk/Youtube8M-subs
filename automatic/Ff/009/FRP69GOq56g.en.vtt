00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.580
 if someone makes knitwear 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.340
 product for sale process itself 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.650
 manufacturing may not be so important 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.429
 because speed is needed because it is 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.080
 associated with money but if you knit for 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.690
 myself 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.109
 make yourself a beautiful bowl buy 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.480
 good expensive comfortable hooks because 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.849
 what a great pleasure 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.840
 delivers the process itself 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:34.370
 so the first first element of the form 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.620
 which I mastered this berry 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.350
 she is in the description a little 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.649
 it was hard for me at first all this 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.160
 understand but I figured it out and now 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.870
 I want to share with you how I do it 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.690
 failed to connect 4 5 eyelets 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.390
 ring and here in this hole central 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.710
 knit bollards without nakid and knit 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:08.720
 a lot of them until the hole is filled 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:11.299
 so here we end up knitting a berry 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:17.100
 you can leave a small hole 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:22.530
 the middle will be such an open moment from 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:25.229
 we fix and cut we got 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.900
 the berry is here her description of photocopies 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.340
 here she is pretty pretty want 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.350
 you can turn it over to the other side 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.790
 then she's here with the ribs and this one 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.860
 tail will be laid in the process of knitting here 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.680
 Now we have this our little button even 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.829
 somber shuffle 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.720
 so here I am knitting with ordinary 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:54.170
 columns but in the opposite direction 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.240
 if we feel that little bit 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.440
 tightens NATO in one hole 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.960
 double knit 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:08.580
 it has not turned a contraction of cloth 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:13.930
 so here is the make-up our pitch step 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:20.190
 Well, here's the last loop and this thing 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.190
 we finished this
