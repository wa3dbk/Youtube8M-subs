one is clock widget option so you can
actually<00:01:01.649> change<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.489> clock<00:01:02.820> at<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.719> lock

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
actually change the clock at the lock

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.250 
actually change the clock at the lock
screen<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.830> small<00:01:05.299> normal<00:01:06.299> or<00:01:06.689> large<00:01:07.020> size

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
screen to small normal or large size

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.550 
screen to small normal or large size
they're<00:01:07.950> still<00:01:08.159> small<00:01:09.080> take<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> look<00:01:10.290> at<00:01:10.439> it

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
they're still small take a look at it

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.460 
they're still small take a look at it
now<00:01:12.409> this<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.560> small<00:01:13.830> clock<00:01:14.130> right<00:01:14.369> there

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
now this is a small clock right there

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.590 
now this is a small clock right there
okay<00:01:16.470> let's<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:17.430> large<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.360> see<00:01:18.479> the
