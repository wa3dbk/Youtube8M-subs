kinds of targets and you can I mean I
guess<00:00:21.820> you<00:00:22.030> can<00:00:22.210> go<00:00:22.390> behind<00:00:22.570> the<00:00:22.840> target<00:00:23.290> and

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:23.440 
guess you can go behind the target and

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.100 
guess you can go behind the target and
find<00:00:23.710> your<00:00:23.920> arrows<00:00:24.280> and<00:00:24.640> well<00:00:25.420> I'm<00:00:25.570> not<00:00:25.750> into

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
shot up reinhardt because I've been

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.389 
shot up reinhardt because I've been
shooting<00:00:55.420> this<00:00:55.750> target<00:00:56.230> now<00:00:56.440> for<00:00:57.010> going<00:00:57.219> on

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
shooting this target now for going on

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.540 
shooting this target now for going on
eight<00:00:57.579> months<00:00:58.090> and<00:00:58.710> I'll<00:00:59.710> bet<00:01:00.010> you<00:01:00.219> any<00:01:00.430> amount

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
of money that you'd like to wager this

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.920 
of money that you'd like to wager this
time<00:01:03.250> next<00:01:03.489> year<00:01:03.670> I'll<00:01:04.059> be<00:01:04.239> shooting<00:01:04.629> this

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
time next year I'll be shooting this

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.190 
time next year I'll be shooting this
same<00:01:05.229> target<00:01:05.979> and<00:01:06.490> it<00:01:06.670> may<00:01:06.850> look<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.180> little<00:01:07.210> may

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
same target and it may look a little may

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.319 
same target and it may look a little may
look<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.469> little<00:01:08.500> rough<00:01:08.860> but<00:01:09.639> the<00:01:09.789> reason<00:01:10.179> for

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
look a little rough but the reason for

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.510 
look a little rough but the reason for
that<00:01:10.539> is<00:01:11.109> that<00:01:11.139> I've<00:01:12.039> been<00:01:12.280> shooting

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
that is that I've been shooting

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.510 
that is that I've been shooting
broadheads<00:01:13.270> a<00:01:13.630> lot<00:01:14.079> of<00:01:14.259> that<00:01:14.409> time<00:01:14.679> we've<00:01:15.490> been

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
broadheads a lot of that time we've been

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.910 
broadheads a lot of that time we've been
testing<00:01:16.179> the<00:01:16.270> helix<00:01:16.719> so<00:01:17.229> you<00:01:17.319> know<00:01:17.560> how<00:01:17.709> that

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
testing the helix so you know how that

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.629 
testing the helix so you know how that
tears<00:01:18.219> a<00:01:18.340> target<00:01:18.789> up<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:20.229> again<00:01:20.590> you<00:01:21.279> can<00:01:21.459> also

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:21.639 
tears a target up but again you can also

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:24.090 
tears a target up but again you can also
see<00:01:22.119> how<00:01:22.479> far<00:01:22.749> these<00:01:22.929> arrows<00:01:23.350> are<00:01:23.619> sticking

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
see how far these arrows are sticking

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.139 
see how far these arrows are sticking
out<00:01:24.249> and<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.990> know<00:01:26.229> that<00:01:26.770> this<00:01:27.310> target<00:01:27.579> has

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
out and you know that this target has

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.639 
out and you know that this target has
plenty<00:01:29.079> of<00:01:29.380> life<00:01:29.889> left<00:01:30.039> and<00:01:31.259> what<00:01:32.259> makes<00:01:32.499> it

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
plenty of life left and what makes it

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.489 
plenty of life left and what makes it
really<00:01:32.889> neat<00:01:33.219> about<00:01:33.369> this<00:01:33.869> Reinhardt<00:01:34.869> is<00:01:35.049> that

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:35.499 
really neat about this Reinhardt is that

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:38.269 
really neat about this Reinhardt is that
you<00:01:35.740> also<00:01:35.920> can<00:01:36.639> buy<00:01:37.299> these<00:01:37.359> little<00:01:37.840> inserts

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:38.279 
you also can buy these little inserts

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:41.160 
you also can buy these little inserts
now<00:01:39.279> I've<00:01:39.670> heard<00:01:39.909> a<00:01:39.969> lot<00:01:40.090> of<00:01:40.149> people<00:01:40.389> say<00:01:40.840> well

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
now I've heard a lot of people say well

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.190 
now I've heard a lot of people say well
man<00:01:41.409> them<00:01:41.619> targets<00:01:42.039> are<00:01:42.189> expensive<00:01:43.020> well<00:01:44.020> it

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
man them targets are expensive well it

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.379 
man them targets are expensive well it
depends<00:01:44.979> on<00:01:45.130> how<00:01:45.310> you<00:01:45.369> think<00:01:45.490> about<00:01:45.969> it

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:46.389 
depends on how you think about it

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:50.429 
depends on how you think about it
you<00:01:47.200> see<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:49.119> get<00:01:49.299> to<00:01:49.479> where<00:01:49.719> I<00:01:49.749> am<00:01:49.929> right<00:01:50.380> now

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
you see to get to where I am right now

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.319 
you see to get to where I am right now
with<00:01:50.829> this<00:01:50.979> target<00:01:51.520> I<00:01:51.729> would<00:01:52.539> have<00:01:53.169> to<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.619> hat

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
with this target I would have to a hat

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.589 
with this target I would have to a hat
add<00:01:55.329> to<00:01:55.599> a<00:01:55.630> bought<00:01:55.959> actually<00:01:56.969> at<00:01:57.969> least<00:01:58.240> four

00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:58.599 
add to a bought actually at least four

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:02.159 
add to a bought actually at least four
targets<00:01:59.139> of<00:01:59.369> and<00:02:00.369> literally<00:02:00.880> anybody<00:02:01.509> else's

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:02.169 
targets of and literally anybody else's

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:04.919 
targets of and literally anybody else's
of<00:02:02.349> this<00:02:02.950> type<00:02:03.189> of<00:02:03.399> target<00:02:03.789> so<00:02:04.299> that's<00:02:04.749> a

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
of this type of target so that's a

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.059 
of this type of target so that's a
reason<00:02:05.349> that<00:02:05.889> Shirley<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:07.229> use<00:02:08.229> Reinhardt

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
reason that Shirley and I use Reinhardt

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.630 
reason that Shirley and I use Reinhardt
targets<00:02:09.550> on<00:02:09.759> our<00:02:10.420> show
