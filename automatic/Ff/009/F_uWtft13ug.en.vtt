i have is an ivory and i got this I

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.109 
i have is an ivory and i got this I
think<00:00:23.869> like<00:00:24.050> a<00:00:24.079> couple<00:00:24.380> weeks<00:00:24.529> ago<00:00:24.859> if<00:00:25.789> you<00:00:25.939> saw

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
think like a couple weeks ago if you saw

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.509 
think like a couple weeks ago if you saw
my<00:00:26.269> elf<00:00:26.449> haul<00:00:26.689> video<00:00:27.109> yeah<00:00:27.769> I<00:00:27.800> got<00:00:28.099> it<00:00:28.130> in<00:00:28.340> there

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
my elf haul video yeah I got it in there

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.689 
my elf haul video yeah I got it in there
and<00:00:29.080> my<00:00:30.080> original<00:00:30.470> opinion<00:00:30.740> was<00:00:31.189> that<00:00:31.220> it

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
and my original opinion was that it

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.640 
and my original opinion was that it
rubbed<00:00:32.000> on<00:00:32.180> pretty<00:00:32.540> smoothly<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.320> I<00:00:33.470> thought

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
rubbed on pretty smoothly and I thought

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.590 
rubbed on pretty smoothly and I thought
I<00:00:33.680> was<00:00:33.860> really<00:00:34.100> going<00:00:34.220> to<00:00:34.309> like<00:00:34.430> it<00:00:34.489> but<00:00:35.300> um

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
I was really going to like it but um

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.930 
I was really going to like it but um
when<00:00:36.470> I<00:00:36.500> put<00:00:36.680> it<00:00:36.710> on<00:00:36.830> my<00:00:36.890> face<00:00:37.250> it<00:00:37.489> ended<00:00:37.850> up

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
when I put it on my face it ended up

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.970 
when I put it on my face it ended up
just<00:00:38.000> being<00:00:38.440> really<00:00:39.440> greasy<00:00:39.769> and<00:00:41.620> it<00:00:42.620> didn't

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
just being really greasy and it didn't

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.680 
just being really greasy and it didn't
feel<00:00:43.100> like<00:00:43.160> a<00:00:43.280> moisturizer<00:00:43.610> like<00:00:44.270> I<00:00:44.450> didn't

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
feel like a moisturizer like I didn't

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.170 
feel like a moisturizer like I didn't
feel<00:00:44.989> like<00:00:45.230> it<00:00:45.680> was<00:00:45.980> soaking<00:00:46.340> into<00:00:46.579> my<00:00:46.730> skin

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
feel like it was soaking into my skin

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.569 
feel like it was soaking into my skin
and<00:00:47.420> you<00:00:48.020> know<00:00:48.110> really<00:00:48.140> moisturizing<00:00:49.100> it<00:00:49.280> just

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
and you know really moisturizing it just

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.209 
and you know really moisturizing it just
sort<00:00:49.820> of<00:00:49.879> sat<00:00:50.120> on<00:00:50.270> top<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:50.780> it<00:00:51.410> was<00:00:51.530> greasy<00:00:51.800> um

sort of sat on top and it was greasy um

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.420 
sort of sat on top and it was greasy um
the<00:00:53.030> color<00:00:53.270> wasn't<00:00:53.690> bad<00:00:54.020> actually<00:00:54.289> like<00:00:54.890> this

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
the color wasn't bad actually like this

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.069 
the color wasn't bad actually like this
is<00:00:55.640> what<00:00:55.789> it<00:00:55.879> looks<00:00:56.059> like<00:00:56.270> on<00:00:57.170> my<00:00:57.559> hand<00:00:57.890> and

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
is what it looks like on my hand and

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.200 
is what it looks like on my hand and
like<00:01:00.079> I<00:01:00.199> said<00:01:00.260> on<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.829> hand<00:01:01.160> it<00:01:01.430> it<00:01:01.640> rubs<00:01:01.969> them

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
like I said on the hand it it rubs them

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.320 
like I said on the hand it it rubs them
pretty<00:01:02.449> nicely<00:01:02.719> but<00:01:03.710> you<00:01:04.519> can<00:01:04.670> see<00:01:04.910> it's<00:01:05.119> still

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
pretty nicely but you can see it's still

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.300 
pretty nicely but you can see it's still
just<00:01:05.509> sort<00:01:05.780> of<00:01:05.840> greasy<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:06.679> I<00:01:06.920> actually<00:01:07.039> have

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
just sort of greasy and I actually have

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
it on right now but it's under like a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.800 
it on right now but it's under like a
powder<00:01:09.380> so<00:01:09.890> it's<00:01:10.429> not<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:10.789> greasy<00:01:11.210> but<00:01:11.420> when<00:01:11.780> I

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
powder so it's not so greasy but when I

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.390 
powder so it's not so greasy but when I
was<00:01:11.990> putting<00:01:12.170> on<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.440> powder<00:01:12.680> on<00:01:12.920> top<00:01:12.950> of<00:01:13.310> it

it<00:01:14.119> was<00:01:14.270> just<00:01:14.479> like<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.630> brush<00:01:14.990> was<00:01:15.020> sort<00:01:15.439> of

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
it was just like the brush was sort of

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.039 
it was just like the brush was sort of
dragging<00:01:16.189> through<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:16.729> like<00:01:16.970> I<00:01:17.119> really<00:01:17.720> don't

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
though it's only a dollar probably end

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.740

up<00:01:26.990> using<00:01:27.229> again<00:01:27.820> I've<00:01:28.820> tried<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.509> like<00:01:29.720> a

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
up using again I've tried it like a

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.840 
up using again I've tried it like a
couple<00:01:30.140> times<00:01:30.350> just<00:01:30.680> as<00:01:31.100> an<00:01:31.220> eyelid<00:01:31.610> primer

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
couple times just as an eyelid primer

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.730 
couple times just as an eyelid primer
and<00:01:32.270> if<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.479> use<00:01:32.630> just<00:01:32.869> a<00:01:32.930> tiny<00:01:33.170> amount<00:01:33.350> for

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
and if you use just a tiny amount for

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.330 
and if you use just a tiny amount for
that<00:01:33.860> then<00:01:34.159> um<00:01:34.400> it<00:01:35.030> works<00:01:35.270> okay<00:01:35.750> but<00:01:36.500> yeah<00:01:36.979> like

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
that then um it works okay but yeah like

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.830 
that then um it works okay but yeah like
I<00:01:37.430> said<00:01:37.640> I<00:01:37.670> definitely<00:01:38.119> will<00:01:38.390> not<00:01:38.630> be

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
I said I definitely will not be

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.020 
I said I definitely will not be
repurchasing<00:01:39.530> this<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:39.979> I<00:01:40.700> would<00:01:40.880> not

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
repurchasing this and I would not

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.260 
repurchasing this and I would not
recommend<00:01:41.180> it<00:01:41.770> my<00:01:42.770> reading<00:01:43.159> out<00:01:43.340> of<00:01:43.369> 10<00:01:43.850> would

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
recommend it my reading out of 10 would

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.480 
recommend it my reading out of 10 would
probably<00:01:44.869> be<00:01:45.049> like<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:45.530> three<00:01:45.950> or<00:01:46.040> four<00:01:46.280> out<00:01:46.460> of

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
probably be like a three or four out of

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.960 
probably be like a three or four out of
10<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:48.799> know<00:01:48.890> it's<00:01:49.100> not<00:01:49.280> completely<00:01:49.759> useless

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
10 you know it's not completely useless

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.060 
10 you know it's not completely useless
