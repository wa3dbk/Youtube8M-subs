00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.610 
again I'm looking for the rhythm and I
think<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.209> rhythmic<00:02:51.600> thing<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:54.500> happened<00:02:55.500> in

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620

the United States you know because of
the<00:02:58.230> black<00:02:58.440> people<00:02:59.360> we<00:03:00.360> bought<00:03:00.630> over<00:03:00.930> there<00:03:01.200> I

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
the black people we bought over there I

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.330 
the black people we bought over there I
am<00:03:03.209> NOT<00:03:03.390> like<00:03:04.230> when<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.470> got<00:03:04.709> hold<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:04.980> guitars

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.920 
am NOT like when I got hold of guitars
and<00:03:05.670> banjos<00:03:05.850> they<00:03:06.270> were<00:03:06.330> still<00:03:06.630> doing<00:03:06.660> this

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
and banjos they were still doing this

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.170 
and banjos they were still doing this
tribal<00:03:07.470> stuff<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:07.980> that's<00:03:08.880> where<00:03:09.090> the

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
tribal stuff and that's where the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.330 
tribal stuff and that's where the
excitement<00:03:09.510> comes<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.440> me<00:03:10.560> it's<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.920> rhythm<00:03:11.100> I

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
excitement comes to me it's the rhythm I

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.420 
excitement comes to me it's the rhythm I
mean<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.580> first<00:03:11.760> time<00:03:11.850> I<00:03:12.060> heard<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.239> stuff

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
mean the first time I heard that stuff

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.380 
mean the first time I heard that stuff
it<00:03:14.430> was<00:03:14.519> like<00:03:14.790> another<00:03:15.060> world<00:03:15.420> coming<00:03:15.989> through

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
it was like another world coming through

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.870 
it was like another world coming through
like<00:03:18.390> Willie<00:03:18.630> Armstrong<00:03:19.140> said<00:03:19.470> he<00:03:19.610> spent<00:03:20.610> 30

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
like Willie Armstrong said he spent 30

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.830 
like Willie Armstrong said he spent 30
years<00:03:21.230> learning<00:03:22.230> what<00:03:22.440> not<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.830> play<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.850> a

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
years learning what not to play and a

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.740 
years learning what not to play and a
lot<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.739> these<00:03:25.890> notes<00:03:26.190> are<00:03:26.489> superfluous<00:03:27.300> to

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
lot of these notes are superfluous to

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.979 
lot of these notes are superfluous to
the<00:03:28.670> feeling<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:29.940> know<00:03:30.060> if<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.269> can<00:03:30.480> get<00:03:30.750> the

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
the feeling you know if you can get the

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.580 
the feeling you know if you can get the
rhythm<00:03:31.709> again<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:33.260> can't<00:03:34.260> get<00:03:34.380> away<00:03:34.470> from

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
rhythm again I can't get away from

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.960 
rhythm again I can't get away from
telling<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.040> about<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.340> rhythm<00:03:35.519> because

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
telling you about the rhythm because
