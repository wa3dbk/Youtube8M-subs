00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:39.040

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.340
 for that we already have here 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.420
 ours that is called steve also 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.420
 truth how we erase it 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.970
 archive 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.040
 in the facilities that he accepted today 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.470
 once done all that must already be 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.550
 perfection and running 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.550
 we run our launcher 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.960
 if we go 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.460
 this profile is edited because he does not want 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.700
 use this ballet edit profile here 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.740
 let's have the different play the 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.710
 version with these versions up to which 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.860
 we want the 1.7 point 9 in which you bring 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:46.660
 extras and save profile and how you see here 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.660
 It has already saved the life of the game 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.409
 in the project and it's 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.949
 and dad I already have my who is five already 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.949
 they are unpainted 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.879

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.550
 how to put 15 to minecraft 1.7 points 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:09.650

 answer if they have doubts or something and 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:19.729
 the truth is quite easy I do not think 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:23.569
 to make balls of all down then 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.889
 they left a page so they become balls 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.619
 so that it helps them to the page them 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.119
