00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.220
 what are you doing with her now i give 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.750
 to do something charitable 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.410
 to let 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.939
 this thinking has to be learned 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.240
 okay people masks on how we adapt 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.240
 all 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.290
 this world is beautiful but they said 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.059
 for a long time we are supposed to leave the 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.480
 Generation of your daughter is the last 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.309
 Those who survive on the earth are the ones 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.140
 best pilot we ever had 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.199
 go out there and kick them 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.989
 Everyone is ready for ours 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:00.719
 solar system to say goodbye 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.719
 from our galaxy then go 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.840
 we are there 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.640
 we want to get under it quickly or in 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.050
 first line want in one piece 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.050
 hold under 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.240
 we have a mission this mission 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.650
 does not work when people are on 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.920
 the earth is dead until we fulfill it 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.920
 to have 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.509
 they have come so far that everyone 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.539
 human in history but not far 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.539
 enough 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.299
 we make something out of this direction mountains 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.620
 they are not mountains 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.100
 that are 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.660
 I do not have it, you will 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:00.650
 Will you decide? 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.850
 have to be between your kids and those 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.850
 future decide 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.810
 we find a way of mine 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.400
 maybe we can try for too long 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:24.769
 solving one of his theory is that 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.769
 only time and space connects
