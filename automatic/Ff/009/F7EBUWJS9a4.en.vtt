at scene to city high speed railway
station<00:00:15.410> this<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.650> overhead<00:00:17.190> power<00:00:18.119> line

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
station this is the overhead power line

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.380 
station this is the overhead power line
which<00:00:19.650> provides<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.430> power<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> Train

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
