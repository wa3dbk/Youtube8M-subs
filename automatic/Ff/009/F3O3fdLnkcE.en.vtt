Google Mozilla noir and alright why

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.810 
Google Mozilla noir and alright why
because<00:00:30.090> if<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.990> browser's<00:00:31.439> are<00:00:31.470> not<00:00:31.710> any<00:00:32.489> it

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
because if the browser's are not any it

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.220 
because if the browser's are not any it
doesn't<00:00:32.969> matter<00:00:33.180> what<00:00:33.270> browser<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.719> use<00:00:33.780> it
