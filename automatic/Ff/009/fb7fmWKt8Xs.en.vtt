00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.670 
three hundred and sixty seven students
which<00:01:44.909> were<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.329> excited<00:01:45.659> about<00:01:46.049> because<00:01:46.470> back

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
which were so excited about because back

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.100 
which were so excited about because back
when<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.920> program<00:01:47.130> started<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.759> 1999<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:48.960> had

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
when the program started in 1999 we had

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.770 
when the program started in 1999 we had
50<00:01:49.560> available<00:01:50.070> spots<00:01:50.340> for<00:01:50.579> students<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.600> we

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
50 available spots for students so we

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.679 
50 available spots for students so we
have<00:01:51.930> grown<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:53.009> enormously<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.360> we're

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
like switch days if we need to but it's

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.490 
like switch days if we need to but it's
just<00:02:31.370> something<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:31.820> helps<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.660> bring<00:02:33.380> us

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
just something that helps to bring us

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.660 
just something that helps to bring us
closer<00:02:33.740> together<00:02:33.950> because<00:02:34.280> we<00:02:34.340> have<00:02:34.459> more

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
closer together because we have more

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.370 
closer together because we have more
shared<00:02:34.970> experiences<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:35.990> so<00:02:36.140> it's<00:02:36.290> a

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
shared experiences and so it's a

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.420 
shared experiences and so it's a
friendship<00:02:36.709> that<00:02:36.920> will<00:02:37.010> probably<00:02:37.340> continue

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
friendship that will probably continue

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.449 
friendship that will probably continue
along<00:02:38.030> as<00:02:38.270> we<00:02:38.420> go<00:02:38.540> through<00:02:38.750> college<00:02:39.459> former

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
along as we go through college former

of the program you become a better

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.900 
of the program you become a better
rounded<00:02:48.170> person<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.920> guess<00:02:49.430> I'm<00:02:49.610> kind<00:02:49.790> of

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
rounded person I guess I'm kind of

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.370 
rounded person I guess I'm kind of
pulling<00:02:50.300> from<00:02:50.600> things<00:02:50.900> I've<00:02:51.050> learned<00:02:51.080> in

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
pulling from things I've learned in

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.780 
pulling from things I've learned in
class<00:02:51.500> like<00:02:51.830> learning<00:02:52.070> does<00:02:52.340> occur<00:02:52.610> outside

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
class like learning does occur outside

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.370 
class like learning does occur outside

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
know people and through those networks I

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.810 
know people and through those networks I
mean<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.769> actually<00:03:04.040> helps<00:03:04.190> not<00:03:04.310> academically

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
mean it actually helps not academically

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.580 
mean it actually helps not academically
because<00:03:05.180> those<00:03:05.390> students<00:03:05.810> get<00:03:06.200> to<00:03:06.320> know<00:03:06.440> each

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
because those students get to know each

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.380 
because those students get to know each
other<00:03:06.709> through<00:03:07.160> their<00:03:07.250> study<00:03:07.489> groups<00:03:07.820> they
