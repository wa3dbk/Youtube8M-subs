 hello musicophile friends you just have 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.010
 listened to a beautiful piece by larry 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.439
 carlton guitarist often underestimated 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.189
 and a little in the shade 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:13.560
 perhaps by his own desire he was a 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.260
 very prolific guitarist in the studio has 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.299
 played with very big names but live 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.549
 has always exposed a little bit of 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:25.500
 less after making his album from 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:28.260
 soloist in 1978 has been revalued o 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.720
 not a little short, especially with this 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.739
 song that was a bit like his horse 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:39.239
 of battle for so many years has one 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:43.709
 not simple harmonic progression 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:47.549
 the beautiful thing that instead manages to create 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:50.519
 on this accompaniment a very theme 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.730
 very simple very catchy 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.129
 musical I invite you to listen to and to 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.069
 see also thanks to youtube that there 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:02.099
 provides this service for free 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.019
 the many live versions of larry 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.729
 carlton in which precisely to have followed 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.329
 this piece every time in a manner 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:11.669
 different by adding something more 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.340
 always coloring differently 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:15.750
 precisely this beautiful one 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.549
 composition thus demonstrating how much 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.710
 be able himself to improvise e 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.630
 how beautiful it is even to be able to create 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.349
 each time a different version of a 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.320
 good then done the theme then try a 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.010
 put your good improvisation on it 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.870
 fun 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.870
 See you at the next hello
