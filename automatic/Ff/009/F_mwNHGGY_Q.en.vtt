00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
the end and I'll be starting is that is

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.210 
the end and I'll be starting is that is
that<00:00:44.720> a<00:00:44.840> week<00:00:44.990> what<00:00:45.080> we<00:00:45.170> going<00:00:45.470> I<00:00:45.650> mean<00:00:46.190> I

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
that a week what we going I mean I

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.530 
that a week what we going I mean I
suppose<00:00:46.340> we<00:00:46.580> can't<00:00:46.760> really<00:00:47.000> stop<00:00:47.180> it<00:00:47.360> I<00:00:47.390> think

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
suppose we can't really stop it I think

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.250 
suppose we can't really stop it I think
that<00:00:47.630> was<00:00:47.720> a<00:00:47.750> warm-up

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
that was a warm-up

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.840 
that was a warm-up
I<00:00:48.470> think<00:00:48.770> he<00:00:48.860> was<00:00:48.980> just<00:00:49.100> warming<00:00:49.520> up<00:00:49.640> his

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
I think he was just warming up his

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.940 
I think he was just warming up his
jumping<00:00:50.420> legs<00:00:50.630> because<00:00:51.440> we<00:00:51.590> don't<00:00:51.740> even<00:00:51.860> know

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
jumping legs because we don't even know

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.950 
jumping legs because we don't even know
