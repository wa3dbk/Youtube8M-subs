00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.060
HELLO PEOPLE FROM THE NEW GENERATION!

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.220
This time, we´ll show you how to disassemble a dashboard in a Nissan Urvan

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.560
To start; let´s remove four screws we´ll find right here at the bottom

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.980
to be able to remove the covers from the steering wheel

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.940
they are four phillips screws

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.080
well, here we don´t have one

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.000
after removing those four screws

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.020
let´s carefully insert a flat screwdriver

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.560
in this part we can see here

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.860
to be able to remove the upper cover

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.380
you do not need to  leverage it so hard  to be able to remove it

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.180
now remove the lower cover

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.920
and the upper cover

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.920
once we´ve removed both covers

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.820
we´ll remove two screws we´ll find up here

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.760
they´re phillips screws as well

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.620
after you removed the two screws

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.960
let´s pull the cover from the bottom

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.860
pull it towards us

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.700
as you´ve just seen; a bit dusty as well

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.380
and now, if it´s a collective van

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.120
here we have some money (laughing)

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.260
let´s pick up all of the coins

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.660
we´ve collected some money to buy our soda and some pop corns

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.800
now, let´s continue

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.800
we need to remove three more screws we need to unscrew to remove the dashboard

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.260
once we´ve removed the screws; we´re going to be able to remove the dashboard

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.580
and unplug the harnesses it has at the back

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.980
remove it and clean your hands if it´s as dusty as the one I´m removing

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.620
and in this way you´ll have removed the dashboard

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.340
now one more thing

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.780
the screws you have in the covers from the steering wheel

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.020
they are different

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.740
these are the screws from the covers of the steering wheel

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.780
and the flat head screws are the ones that hold the dashboard

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.040
you need to be careful since you try to insert these screws in the covers from the steering wheel

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.500
they are going to get stucked

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.800
and it´ll be difficult to remove them

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.460
Well, that´s it. We hope we have helped you

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.360
