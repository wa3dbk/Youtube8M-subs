00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.860 
sounds like and then second one and this
is<00:02:30.040> based<00:02:30.250> on<00:02:30.459> an<00:02:30.790> idea<00:02:31.000> which<00:02:31.360> i<00:02:31.510> like<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.750> call

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
is based on an idea which i like to call

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.600 
is based on an idea which i like to call
me<00:02:32.230> rod<00:02:32.380> octaves<00:02:33.010> which<00:02:33.310> sounds<00:02:33.580> very

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
me rod octaves which sounds very

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.900 
me rod octaves which sounds very
complicated<00:02:33.940> all<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.140> means<00:02:35.170> is<00:02:35.739> that<00:02:36.340> we're

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
complicated all it means is that we're

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.320 
complicated all it means is that we're
going<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.180> take<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.690> 1<00:02:38.380> 2<00:02:38.590> 3<00:02:38.620> 4<00:02:39.010> 5<00:02:39.220> 6<00:02:39.250> 7<00:02:39.580> 8<00:02:39.820> 9<00:02:39.850> 10<00:02:40.060> 11

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
going to take a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.720 
going to take a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12<00:02:40.720> notes<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.560> then<00:02:41.709> just<00:02:42.070> play<00:02:42.280> them<00:02:42.489> an

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
12 notes and then just play them an

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.350 
12 notes and then just play them an
octave<00:02:43.360> higher<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.760> let<00:02:45.880> me<00:02:45.910> give<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.209> the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
octave higher so let me give you the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.440 
octave higher so let me give you the
precise<00:02:46.840> verbal<00:02:47.350> tab<00:02:47.590> for<00:02:47.890> each<00:02:48.010> mirror<00:02:48.880> dr.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
precise verbal tab for each mirror dr.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.470 
precise verbal tab for each mirror dr.
here's<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.840> first<00:02:50.019> one<00:02:50.170> it's<00:02:50.500> Louie<00:02:50.890> one<00:02:51.700> then

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
here's the first one it's Louie one then

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:02.699 
here's the first one it's Louie one then
35<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:54.480> 135<00:02:55.480> d<00:02:56.110> 2<00:02:57.010> 35<00:02:57.640> and<00:02:57.940> g<00:02:58.180> 2<00:02:58.390> 35<00:03:01.500> that's<00:03:02.500> our

35 a 135 d 2 35 and g 2 35 that's our

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.229 
35 a 135 d 2 35 and g 2 35 that's our
first<00:03:02.860> octave<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.430> here's<00:03:03.670> a<00:03:03.760> second<00:03:04.060> doctor

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
first octave and here's a second doctor

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.440 
first octave and here's a second doctor
on<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:05.049> D<00:03:05.200> string<00:03:05.549> D<00:03:06.549> 3<00:03:07.299> 5<00:03:07.780> 7<00:03:08.140> g<00:03:08.709> 3<00:03:09.250> 5<00:03:09.519> 7<00:03:09.820> and<00:03:10.390> then

how neurons you'll find you'll rush the
hammer<00:03:51.630> or<00:03:51.840> not<00:03:51.990> sound<00:03:52.230> like<00:03:52.260> Billa<00:03:52.650> Billa

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
hammer or not sound like Billa Billa

hammer or not sound like Billa Billa
Billa<00:03:53.370> Billa<00:03:53.820> Billa<00:03:54.240> so<00:03:54.960> be<00:03:55.080> very<00:03:55.200> careful<00:03:55.440> not

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
Billa Billa Billa so be very careful not

Billa Billa Billa so be very careful not
to<00:03:55.920> do<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.220> also<00:03:56.790> don't<00:03:57.660> pick<00:03:57.900> too<00:03:58.080> hard<00:03:58.530> and

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
to do that also don't pick too hard and

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.100 
to do that also don't pick too hard and
try<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.430> make<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.970> notes<00:04:00.570> that<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:00.870> hammer

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
try and make the notes that you hammer

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.260 
try and make the notes that you hammer
on<00:04:01.350> roughly<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.250> same<00:04:02.400> volume<00:04:02.700> as<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.120> notes

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
on roughly the same volume as the notes

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.540 
on roughly the same volume as the notes
that<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:03.570> Peck<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.440> all<00:04:04.620> sounds<00:04:05.010> pretty<00:04:05.070> much

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
that you Peck so all sounds pretty much

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.090 
that you Peck so all sounds pretty much
of<00:04:05.760> one<00:04:06.330> dynamic<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:07.440> that's<00:04:07.560> something<00:04:07.710> to<00:04:07.920> be

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
of one dynamic so that's something to be

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.150 
of one dynamic so that's something to be
mindful<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.320> other<00:04:10.560> thing<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.890> point

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
mindful of and the other thing to point

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.740 
mindful of and the other thing to point
out<00:04:11.460> is<00:04:11.520> really<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.910> fingering<00:04:12.390> who

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
out is really the fingering who

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.270 
out is really the fingering who
obviously<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.230> very<00:04:13.410> beginning<00:04:13.830> it's<00:04:13.980> quite

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
obviously the very beginning it's quite

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.640 
obviously the very beginning it's quite
a<00:04:14.310> wide<00:04:14.760> stretch<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:16.050> again<00:04:16.290> you're<00:04:16.530> not

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
a wide stretch and again you're not

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.350 
a wide stretch and again you're not
familiar<00:04:16.800> with<00:04:17.220> this<00:04:17.310> sort<00:04:17.580> of<00:04:17.640> expansion

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:18.360 
familiar with this sort of expansion

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.270 
familiar with this sort of expansion
I'll<00:04:18.480> probably<00:04:18.690> feel<00:04:18.900> quite<00:04:19.200> uncomfortable

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
I'll probably feel quite uncomfortable

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.620 
I'll probably feel quite uncomfortable
but<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.400> way<00:04:20.520> I'm<00:04:20.610> fingering<00:04:21.030> that<00:04:21.060> is<00:04:21.330> finger

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
but the way I'm fingering that is finger

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.690 
but the way I'm fingering that is finger
one<00:04:21.930> then<00:04:22.260> finger<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.710> them<00:04:22.920> finger<00:04:23.160> for<00:04:23.430> and

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
one then finger to them finger for and

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.100 
one then finger to them finger for and
then<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.330> same<00:04:24.600> on<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:25.230> a<00:04:25.260> string<00:04:25.640> 124<00:04:26.640> I<00:04:27.110> call

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
then the same on the a string 124 I call

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.840 
then the same on the a string 124 I call
