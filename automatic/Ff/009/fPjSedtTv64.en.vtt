we're<00:00:03.000> getting<00:00:03.300> ready<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.719> thyroid<00:00:04.259> scan<00:00:04.649> on

00:00:05.179 --> 00:00:05.189 
we're getting ready to a thyroid scan on

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:08.810 
we're getting ready to a thyroid scan on
red<00:00:05.580> who's<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.120> hyper<00:00:06.390> thyroid<00:00:06.750> cat<00:00:07.490> to<00:00:08.490> do<00:00:08.639> this

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
red who's a hyper thyroid cat to do this

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.890 
red who's a hyper thyroid cat to do this
we<00:00:09.090> use<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.750> gamma<00:00:10.589> camera<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.790> right<00:00:12.570> here

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
we use a gamma camera this right here

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.749 
we use a gamma camera this right here
we're<00:00:13.110> going<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.410> put<00:00:13.679> him<00:00:13.830> on<00:00:14.039> top<00:00:14.339> of<00:00:14.610> what's

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
we're going to put him on top of what's

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.510 
we're going to put him on top of what's
called<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.059> collimator<00:00:16.039> normally<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:17.160> people

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
called the collimator normally in people

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.250 
called the collimator normally in people
this<00:00:17.670> would<00:00:17.880> be<00:00:17.970> flipped<00:00:18.330> around<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.020> big

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
this would be flipped around in this big

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.650 
this would be flipped around in this big
machine<00:00:19.440> would<00:00:19.860> come<00:00:20.010> down<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.460> on<00:00:21.000> your<00:00:21.420> neck

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
when you're lying on your back cats

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.430

don't<00:00:23.850> like<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.360> lie<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.570> their<00:00:24.750> back<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.260> we

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 
don't like to lie on their back so we

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.710 
don't like to lie on their back so we
flip<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:25.980> around<00:00:26.160> we're<00:00:27.060> gonna<00:00:27.180> put<00:00:27.540> right

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
flip this around we're gonna put right

on<00:00:27.900> top<00:00:28.200> of<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.530> collimator<00:00:29.100> to<00:00:29.730> make<00:00:29.850> it<00:00:29.970> a

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
on top of this collimator to make it a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.290 
on top of this collimator to make it a
little<00:00:30.120> more<00:00:30.240> comfortable<00:00:30.750> put<00:00:31.530> a<00:00:31.560> towel<00:00:31.920> down

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300

dr. Richie is going to bring red over

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:39.819 
dr. Richie is going to bring red over
and<00:00:36.710> all<00:00:37.710> he<00:00:37.890> has<00:00:38.039> to<00:00:38.070> do<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.579> kind<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.940> relax

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.680 
and all he has to do is kind of relax
just<00:00:40.829> kind<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.190> sit<00:00:41.370> comfortably<00:00:41.940> about<00:00:42.449> like

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
just kind of sit comfortably about like

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.410 
just kind of sit comfortably about like
that<00:00:42.989> that's<00:00:43.469> all<00:00:43.649> he<00:00:43.800> has<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.949> do<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:45.269> we

that that's all he has to do and as we

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.720 
that that's all he has to do and as we
do<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:45.929> we<00:00:46.260> injected<00:00:46.890> him<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.159> we

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
do this we we injected him with we

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.340 
do this we we injected him with we
injected<00:00:48.179> right<00:00:48.329> with<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.600> radioactive<00:00:49.170> dye

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
injected right with the radioactive dye

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.139 
injected right with the radioactive dye
about<00:00:50.159> an<00:00:50.249> hour<00:00:50.489> ago

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
about an hour ago

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.509 
about an hour ago
so<00:00:51.300> now<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.839> radioactivity<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.920> gone<00:00:53.100> into

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
so now this radioactivity is gone into

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.029 
so now this radioactivity is gone into
the<00:00:53.640> thyroid<00:00:54.059> gland<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:55.140> can<00:00:55.319> look<00:00:55.499> over<00:00:55.649> here

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
the thyroid gland we can look over here

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.569 
the thyroid gland we can look over here
at<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.609> computer<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.690> see<00:00:57.929> the

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
at the computer and you can see the

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.579 
at the computer and you can see the
thyroid<00:00:59.579> tumor<00:01:00.089> is<00:01:00.359> being<00:01:00.659> taken<00:01:01.170> up<00:01:01.319> by<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
thyroid tumor is being taken up by the

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.119 
thyroid tumor is being taken up by the
little<00:01:01.979> white<00:01:02.159> spots<00:01:02.519> there<00:01:02.819> and<00:01:03.739> we<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.949> also

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
little white spots there and we can also

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.889 
little white spots there and we can also
go<00:01:05.580> over<00:01:05.610> here<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.509> the<00:01:06.630> main<00:01:06.810> computer<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:08.899> if

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
go over here to the main computer and if

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.020 
go over here to the main computer and if
you<00:01:10.079> look<00:01:10.320> at<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> screen<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.579> computer

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
you look at the screen on the computer

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.209 
you look at the screen on the computer
you<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.659> tumor<00:01:13.229> coming<00:01:13.770> up<00:01:13.890> here

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
you can see the tumor coming up here

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.399 
you can see the tumor coming up here
also<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.450> I'm<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.689> going<00:01:15.899> to<00:01:15.930> press<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
also so I'm just going to press the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.899 
also so I'm just going to press the
start<00:01:16.770> button<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.640> collect<00:01:19.399> 250,000<00:01:20.399> counts

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
start button we collect 250,000 counts

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.120 
start button we collect 250,000 counts
that<00:01:21.630> sounds<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.289> lot<00:01:22.469> of<00:01:22.500> cows<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.039> we

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
that sounds like a lot of cows but we

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.950 
that sounds like a lot of cows but we
can<00:01:23.250> get<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.579> in<00:01:23.850> less<00:01:24.149> than<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.479> minute<00:01:24.659> in

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
can get that in less than a minute in

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.289 
can get that in less than a minute in
most<00:01:25.079> cattle<00:01:25.469> so<00:01:25.560> I'm<00:01:25.619> gonna<00:01:25.710> start<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.310> during

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
most cattle so I'm gonna start it during

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
very large thyroid tumor and going back

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.410 
very large thyroid tumor and going back
and<00:01:58.740> forth<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.820> looks<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.179> it's

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
and forth it looks like it's

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.440 
and forth it looks like it's
predominantly<00:02:01.109> on<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.289> left<00:02:01.770> side<00:02:02.390> this<00:02:03.390> is

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
predominantly on the left side this is

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.450 
predominantly on the left side this is
taken<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.740> right<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.249> is

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
taken so this is the right and this is

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.160 
taken so this is the right and this is
the<00:02:05.490> left<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.090> probably<00:02:06.390> predominantly

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
the left so it's probably predominantly

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.059 
the left so it's probably predominantly
left-sided

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.129
