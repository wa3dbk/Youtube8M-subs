00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
when it gets hot like that it tends to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.109 
when it gets hot like that it tends to
get<00:01:31.350> close<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.590> exploding<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.369> falling<00:01:32.970> out

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
get close to exploding so falling out

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.620 
get close to exploding so falling out
here<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.450> big<00:01:33.659> by<00:01:33.840> boom<00:01:34.280> alright<00:01:35.280> uh<00:01:35.630> show

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
here it's big by boom alright uh show

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.660 
here it's big by boom alright uh show
you<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.750> little<00:01:36.869> something<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:37.290> let<00:01:38.070> me<00:01:38.220> get

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
you a little something here let me get

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.910 
you a little something here let me get
to<00:01:38.790> one<00:01:38.909> side<00:01:39.150> alright<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.439> one<00:01:40.650> side

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
to one side alright so this is one side

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.170 
to one side alright so this is one side
it's<00:01:41.130> basically<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.520> giant<00:01:41.790> underground

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
it's basically a giant underground

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.399 
it's basically a giant underground
sphere<00:01:42.780> okay<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.369> when<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.549> fall<00:01:44.729> down<00:01:44.759> you

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
sphere okay so when you fall down you

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.840 
sphere okay so when you fall down you
can't<00:01:46.409> see<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.799> other<00:01:46.829> side<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.700> other

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
can't see the other side like the other

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.340 
can't see the other side like the other
end<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.450> I'm<00:01:48.570> swimming<00:01:48.780> towards<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.140> right<00:01:49.259> now

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
end so I'm swimming towards it right now

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.889 
end so I'm swimming towards it right now
and<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.530> still<00:01:49.590> can't<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.189> um<00:01:50.600> you<00:01:51.600> kinda

and I still can't see it um you kinda
can<00:01:52.079> but<00:01:52.320> ok<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.680> now<00:01:52.890> it's<00:01:53.009> coming<00:01:53.189> into<00:01:53.399> view

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
can but ok so now it's coming into view

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.770

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.710 
Craft lots of stuff you can do and
that's<00:02:25.550> why<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:25.760> oil<00:02:26.120> is<00:02:26.180> here<00:02:26.510> and

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
that's why this oil is here and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.270 
that's why this oil is here and
obviously<00:02:27.380> there's<00:02:27.769> a<00:02:27.800> lot<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:27.950> squid<00:02:28.160> down

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
obviously there's a lot of squid down

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
obviously there's a lot of squid down
here<00:02:28.459> having<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.700> party<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:31.790> Charlie<00:02:32.090> really

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
do that um and it kind of makes sense

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.460
