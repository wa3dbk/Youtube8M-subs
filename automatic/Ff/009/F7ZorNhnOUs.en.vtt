 hello of the very palermitan recipe la 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.500
 tile is called tile because 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.570
 it is made in big Italy comes 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.299
 then sold in the shape of a tile then 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.460
 type a nice square Our everyone 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.250
 the ingredients but I don't give the doses because 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.670
 The you find beautiful ready there in the box 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.750
 info with the replied procedure 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.330
 the only ingredient in ours is 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.179
 this is sesame that in parma yes 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.890
 call cimino this eto'o state not 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.840
 monster because I wanted to say now to bowls 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.510
 know that there is but it is used right at 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.300
 I got it at the bakery 100 grams 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.340
 70 euros while at the supermarket a lot 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.290
 the less I sell a lot more I wanted 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.719
 give this hint to the videos 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.940
 recipes divided into two parts in the first 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.860
 our part how to make the dough for the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.079
 Sicilian rotisseries so I know 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.110
 just that in the future I will have to do a thousand 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.399
 refer to this video at 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.129
 second part I show how 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.020
 assemble the tile in the part 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.809
 the Sicilian rotisseries of the dough 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.060
 this recipe was given me a mess 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.890
 long ago went to the fifth immediately 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.720
 name I can forget it from a boy 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.000
 than working in a pizzeria 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.640
 I must say that it works like I like it 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.549
 recipe because it has round numbers 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.130
 so it is not difficult to halve how 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.380
 as a quantity 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.890
 nothing we start with the recipe I hope 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.200
 then you may be interested in this 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.820
 video recipe is necessary from the flour of 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.100
 lard sugar, warm water and yeast 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.450
 of course salt is good start 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.390
 quite simple actually 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.490
 obviously I will be the planetary towards the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.220
 flour in the planetary bowl e 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.560
 I only add the lard I leave 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.909
 knead for a few seconds in 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.920
 so that the lard begins to 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.290
 incorporated into certain flour not 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.950
 single 100 percent good then with 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.399
 an inhuman force broken the yeast 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.759
 in the warm water and stir it is yes 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.680
 that the yeast begins to activate a 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.390
 this water with yeasts add a 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.260
 some of the sugar which will then go to 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.250
 put in 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.690
 vast forgiveness I raise it 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.580
 sugar I let rest for a few 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.410
 a couple of minutes the sugar you give me 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.450
 advanced towards the planetary with 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.640
 flour and lard and I do to 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.710
 knead another little bit all this 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.600
 of course you can do this by hand 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.840
 point slowly add little to 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:35.100
 once yeast water and sugar 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.900
 I let the dough knead and I repeat 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.390
 the operation until the water with 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.270
 the yeast is finished by hand this 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.340
 operation is very feasible to say 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.770
 but the planetary one is sincere 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.360
 niene is much much more comfortable as you can 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.130
 see I did the operation again because 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.290
 I'm too professional and so is it 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.640
 rifaro was put two steps then plan 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.460
 floor until the water with the 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.020
 yeast and sugar will be finished 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.959
 at the last only to the last I add two 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.110
 beautiful bellis spoons special drops 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.350
 to the dough it is left to knead by the 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.340
 maximum planetary speed for at least 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.459
 four minutes 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.050
 yes yes if you knead by hand it does the same 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.350
 but of the dough vigorously 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:20.100
 the mixture of mines very soft and 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.650
 smooth I cover with a wet tea towel e 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.380
 leave to avoid at least two hours in 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.680
 a beautiful place galluccio balduccio for 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.510
 the carroccio must be wet for 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.550
 let us make brassy frogs decisions from the king 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:37.830
 salami ham there and hostel 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.900
 galbanino instead of mozzarella 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.260
 I prefer Galbanino of course 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.420
 peeled tomato is of oregano before 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.500
 I make the tomato shake with 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.620
 a thread of oil a little bit of commitments 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.980
 ayo pinch of salt and sugar while 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.690
 tightens the galbanino affection sauce a 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.330
 maybe quite thin slices 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.590
 less thin the leavened dough is to say the least 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.269
 little perfect 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.769
 meanwhile it is certainly not used 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.040
 he will have to cut the Galbanino but that's fine 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.079
 I divide it into two 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.450
 in two parts per blow good but does not have 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:14.359
 importance as you see is very much 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:19.070
 soft part I keep it and work 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:20.900
 only half of my dough continue 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.000
 to rise the stand a little with the 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.520
 rolling pin because I care that it is 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.800
 quite thin since in the oven 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.650
 the booth will continue to be avoided 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.500
 on the baking sheet is how you see the edges must 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.919
 get out a little from the edge of the 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.900
 pan then I put the first layer of 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.240
 ham to cover the entire pan 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.460
 I continue with the salami to cover 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.490
 the whole pan right without without 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.160
 shame the sausages and cut them into 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.210
 strips or if you wanted not to 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.620
 same thing 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.410
 obviously continues that layer of 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.979
 galbanino is last 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.650
 I put the tomato as restricted 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.630
 you see it is very very narrow a beautiful one 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.759
 sprinkle with oregano as if not there 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:08.000
 it was tomorrow and we proceed with the 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:11.150
 closing I put the second part of the 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.320
 pasta spread obviously pleasing advanced a 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:18.949
 nice bit and covers all the stuffing 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.919
 as you can see, I'm desperately looking for 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:24.380
 put the hidden flaps that's why with 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:28.580
 the edges that come out of the pan 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:31.460
 I'll go and close as I'm doing 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.470
 people mind seeing little tiron and close 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.810
 then just press lightly with 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.580
 fingertips spending at this point 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.710
 with the red of the place a goccino of 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.270
 milk all my beauty 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.240
 tile is as if there were no one 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.010
 tomorrow he fills it with sesame or cornflakes 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.620
 because they are from Palermo and I say cimino 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:54.080
 obviously everything is in 240 degrees 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:57.669
 for 40 minutes it is the tile still not 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.229
 on the morning I am almost ready 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.810
 laying here to cool I'll do it 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:06.169
 they cooled off some more time 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.470
 ok this is a tile here is the pasta 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:11.090
 who advanced I did these where there is 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.350
 of the emmental of his name that was 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.970
 advanced 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.000
 the one with the bijoux I just hope yes 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.760
 they are a little broken this is the scene of the 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.440
 table at the pre mystery salon 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.860
 I hope I enjoyed it and to 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.860
 next
