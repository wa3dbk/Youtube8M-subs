00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello together because the film factory 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.940
 Houses is pan in the day and that's why 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.589
 I thought so for this occasion 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.970
 I present you the first part again 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.190
 of the tribute of panem deadly 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.170
 play before the second part 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.330
 we will soon get to know the cinemas 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.150
 The story is summarized in a nutshell 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.520
 Again, that the usa is not anymore 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.710
 the usa but are after war and 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.510
 Natural disasters have become panic 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.060
 that there are twelve districts divided 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.890
 and the government is organizing each one 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.929
 year the hunger games are like that 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.660
 gladiators fight where out of all twelve 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.579
 districts of panem a boy and a 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.559
 Girls have to compete in this case 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.899
 logs but knows after their 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.239
 younger sister has been selected 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.430
 voluntarily and must then together with 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.489
 Peter represented their district 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.960
 Unfortunately, only one can win the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.469
 others will all play in the games 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.110
 died 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.000
 and if then the love plays along 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.699
 the whole thing will of course be even more perfidious 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.649
 how the whole looks like you can see here 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.870
 I have what is supposed to be right now 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.219
 A sports temple industry as long as you can 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.710
 There's nothing wrong with that 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.840
 happen promised 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.280
 and of course decided 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.480
 eat 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.750
 when 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.750
 the 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.590
 I mean it because I love you 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.780
 are stronger than these 54 but only go 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:31.250
 one in 1000 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:32.810
 for the two winning sister said 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.430
 Did you volunteer to harvest? 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.229
 Reported what I would try 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.840
 to win for them and also the 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.280
 i try to wonder all the time 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.100
 how heel can not show me 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.530
 I have to die, I will still 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.150
 I say I can not 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.830
 make you think so 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.420
 the movie is based on the first part 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.830
 a very successful book series 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.720
 but I have to do that before I go now 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.300
 Ever say that I'm the one 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.610
 books have not read and therefore the 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.200
 film me as a pure work completely 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.570
 I have to enthuse and that's what I think 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.670
 is filming without books quite without 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.369
 prior knowledge possible and should even 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.750
 that's why italia come to the cinema i have to 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.520
 say I think the basic 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.320
 history very interesting and that 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.280
 I mean in the sense of that but tastes 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.290
 to be interesting 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.959
 I think it's really extraordinary 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.060
 how to make it into a popcorn movie 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.380
 but a very very critical media 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.690
 note to bring in 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.610
 because there is a tv show here 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.800
 these gladiators are playing hunger 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.840
 games take place on television and 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.430
 Everyone knows if nobody would look 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.170
 then it will not be this game either 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.520
 give more and thus would have the whole 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.100
 sorry too, an end 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.300
 However, they all look and there can 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.430
 you really think about it 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.890
 we talk about partially 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.989
 upset what's going on tv when it's on 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.520
 nobody would look it would be too 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.100
 no longer be produced 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.739
 but also how much one 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.989
 government acts and at the same time 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.060
 also the media landscape like these 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.190
 I think that's also possible in my hand 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.959
 very successful what is behind it 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.730
 in addition, I think so too 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.739
 really impressive how to do it 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.100
 has two different worlds to create 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.470
 These districts are reminiscent of the best 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.880
 even almost our kz and that scenes 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.769
 I mean now in a positive sense 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.150
 from the devil itself, this is a kz is 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.860
 but from the equipment forth 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.360
 that reminds me very much 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.640
 when I'm filming from the 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.830
 see world war II and I go too 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.690
 assuming that the company is a 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.870
 had similar intentions and at the same time 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.440
 next to it is the world where the rich are well 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.239
 extremely colorful everything extremely oversubscribed 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.920
 So it's clearer for everyone 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.049
 What's the matter, I think so too 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.660
 good that these two worlds are clearly separated 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.730
 which I will criticize a bit 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.260
 is that the film is very slow 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.120
 Of course, everything has to come in first 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.250
 but are told the exciting 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.810
 Elements are just finding their way far into the future 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.730
 second half instead of there I would have found 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.010
 you can ripen a bit the whole 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.630
 can imagine better here too 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.520
 become 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.020
 some things form a feeling 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.490
 a little bit ahead of the others 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.140
 I do not know how it works 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.460
 but book was that you can in the movie 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.320
 somehow make a bit better 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.390
 because I have visual means 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.330
 have the acting performance so 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.920
 Reason solid is with such a film 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.840
 is not absolutely necessary that 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.370
 the strongest possible 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.080
 character actor have thereby are the 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.310
 actors all very well known 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.080
 jennifer lawrence the here with her 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.970
 I already knew breakthrough 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.250
 from movies like winter's bone or too 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.110
 other works that I also liked very much 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.030
 There is not much to do here as well 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.890
 like josh hutcherson but both 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.140
 of course, through this movie with right 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.910
 I recommend you big with josh 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.350
 hutcherson also likes to bridge 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.940
 I only recently had a therapy animal 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.320
 or for kids are all discussed 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.110
 right stanley tucci is also there 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.340
 Thursday celebrate Liam Hemsworth Woody 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.080
 I always like harrelson 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.310
 is very kravitz rally while the 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.510
 musician also has his second here 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.550
 occurs after precious 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.310
 So all is good cast now 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.110
 really not so much to do 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.440
 but everything on average good 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.540
 level 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.100
 In addition, you can also do something 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.780
 Others say that one for one 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.490
 Big production is not always the absolute 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.800
 needs gigantic visual effects 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.630
 if he plays all the games as well 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.370
 Forest related events take place 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.250
 It just a good piece of wood to take 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:11.190
 I really like the second half, too 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.630
 you just see that just at the ball 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.700
 pretty much we're talking about that here 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.310
 Extremely many people perish if only 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.360
 A survival at 24 is noticeable 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.130
 but that's it on the 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.680
 family audience goal 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.320
 I am honest I am vintage 780 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.770
 I would like to have him the fsk 16 version 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.150
 seen 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.620
 not because i like it when people 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.480
 but because I'm there 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.370
 all this pain and all the pain 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.590
 can find even better or 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.570
 understand can mean I would have it 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.400
 happy to have been darker than it is here 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.380
 as pure family entertainment 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.090
 or that it is also the 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.430
 it is younger to feel addressed 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.770
 but a thoroughly successful work and 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.330
 Gets 8 out of 10 points from me 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.040
 I think it's very good, I know that 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.090
 template just does not know now not 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.530
 while we can still a bit in 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.260
 discussing the comments is for me 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.850
 but a great topic which was very good 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.680
 is implemented a bit difficult 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.630
 out of gear and has become all 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.310
 is the strongest performance 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.760
 but that on a very good level 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.770
 and that's why I have it 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.660
 of 10 points and I'm looking forward to 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.400
 the second part that was my review too 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.170
 want the tribute of panem from you 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.790
 I now know you could book 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.650
 how did you find them then? 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.330
 filming or you have the book first 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.040
 after that read or you only know the 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.480
 movie and how do you like writing 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.230
 let's just drop it all over 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.640
 to discuss 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.380
 because especially in book filming there 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.700
 always have something to discuss as well 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.450
 I'm still a win game, too 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.800
 panem day 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.170
 I can not come without me 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.360
 once t shirts to the film as well 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.680
 so barner then also the book 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.210
 if you have not read that yet 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.560
 that reading will follow or give away 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.470
 I definitely wanted that too 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.300
 it and the Districts of India 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.250
 the first part of you today 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.170
 you have imagined you can 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.700
 then look again at home as well 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.530
 that also contains a cinema voucher 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.360
 really something fine I have three times 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.010
 So I have the packages three times and 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.140
 as the main prize also a signed 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.880
 movie poster there have among others
