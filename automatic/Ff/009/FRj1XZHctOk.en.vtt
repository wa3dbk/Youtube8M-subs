00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.720
 very good 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.490
 the buttermilk or buttermilk is a 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.770
 ingredient that we usually find in 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.080
 many American recipes of biscuits and 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.150
 cupcakes serves to give more 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.180
 fluffiness and improve the taste of 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.520
 our elaborations the buttermilk is 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.190
 an acid product that is obtained at 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.440
 treat skimmed or semi- skimmed milk 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.829
 with a culture that produces an acid 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.110
 lactic was originally obtained at 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.930
 beat the cream to transform it into 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.300
 butter hence its name and although 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.850
 it is becoming easier to find it in 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.350
 some supermarkets is very simple and 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.960
 economic do it at home we need 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.260
 250 milliliters of semi-skimmed milk and 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.559
 skimmed milk and 20 milliliters of juice 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.559
 lemon 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.660
 all we have to do is 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.660
 mix milk 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.650
 with lemon juice 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.299
 and let it stand for ten minutes 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.299
 room temperature 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.090
 after resting the milk seems that 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.400
 It has been cut and it is a bit more 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.280
 tense as if it were yogurt but not so 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.119
 thick 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.350
 you see and we have it ready to use 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.210
 before using it we remove it a little 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.070
 can be stored in the fridge for a few days 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.960
 but you 've already seen that with the easy 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.060
 what to do is not worth doing 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.610
 amount to have it saved 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.800

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.230
