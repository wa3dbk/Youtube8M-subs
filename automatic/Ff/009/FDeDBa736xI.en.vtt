00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
he might be in halo 5 and much more so

he might be in halo 5 and much more so
on<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.710> theory<00:00:13.920> it's<00:00:14.160> mostly<00:00:14.519> developed<00:00:14.820> by

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
on this theory it's mostly developed by

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
would she be on the ark or what's left

would she be on the ark or what's left
of<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.750> well<00:00:55.199> firstly<00:00:55.710> how<00:00:56.160> would<00:00:56.399> he<00:00:56.520> find<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
of it well firstly how would he find it

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.569 
of it well firstly how would he find it
or<00:00:57.270> even<00:00:57.570> men<00:00:57.750> can't<00:00:58.079> bias<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.859> Janus<00:00:59.370> key

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
or even men can't bias the Janus key

including<00:01:04.350> mendicant<00:01:05.070> bias<00:01:05.840> alright<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.110> you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
including mendicant bias alright so you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.109 
including mendicant bias alright so you
may<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.380> thinking<00:01:07.770> was<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.549> meant<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.760> combines

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
may be thinking was it meant a combines

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
doesn't really mean that he's dead so

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.710 
doesn't really mean that he's dead so
let's<00:01:13.740> see<00:01:14.010> about<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.549> whys<00:01:14.790> what's<00:01:15.360> house

him against the creators Walt

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.179 
him against the creators Walt
specifically<00:01:27.960> was<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.170> timeless<00:01:28.590> one<00:01:28.799> that

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
specifically was a timeless one that

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.319 
specifically was a timeless one that
made<00:01:29.400> him<00:01:29.520> change<00:01:29.700> his<00:01:29.909> mind

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
made him change his mind

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.420 
made him change his mind
eventually<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.170> timeless<00:01:31.560> one<00:01:31.619> persuaded

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
eventually the timeless one persuaded

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.490 
eventually the timeless one persuaded
mendicant<00:01:32.820> bias<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.360> betray<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.930> foreigners

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
mendicant bias to betray the foreigners

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.960 
mendicant bias to betray the foreigners
so<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> where<00:01:35.340> things<00:01:35.520> get<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.820> little

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
so this is where things get a little

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.850 
so this is where things get a little
tricky<00:01:36.299> I'm<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.930> little<00:01:37.229> bit<00:01:37.350> confused<00:01:37.740> about

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
tricky I'm a little bit confused about

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.890 
tricky I'm a little bit confused about
the<00:01:38.070> whole<00:01:38.250> ordeal<00:01:38.460> myself<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.479> try<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.720> pay

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
the whole ordeal myself just try to pay

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.780 
the whole ordeal myself just try to pay
attention<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.799> mendicant<00:01:41.220> bias<00:01:41.340> was

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
attention but mendicant bias was

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.670 
attention but mendicant bias was
eventually<00:01:42.090> defeated<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.930> scattered<00:01:43.380> around

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
eventually defeated and scattered around

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.679 
eventually defeated and scattered around
one<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.549> pieces<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:45.119> covenant<00:01:45.360> found

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
only a part made it to the ark however

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.130 
only a part made it to the ark however

however<00:02:41.099> if<00:02:41.370> played<00:02:41.639> backwards<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.269> can

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
however if played backwards you can

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.629 
however if played backwards you can

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
really just hear as a voice he is also

really just hear as a voice he is also
heard<00:02:44.909> in<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.209> Halo<00:02:45.419> 2<00:02:45.569> soundtrack<00:02:46.109> the<00:02:46.319> one

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
heard in the Halo 2 soundtrack the one

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.979 
heard in the Halo 2 soundtrack the one
named<00:02:46.739> mausoleum<00:02:47.430> suit<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.969> played<00:02:48.450> backwards

so<00:02:49.169> you<00:02:49.230> can<00:02:49.379> hear<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.590> voice<00:02:49.799> once<00:02:50.159> again<00:02:50.489> it's

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
so you can hear a voice once again it's

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.550 
so you can hear a voice once again it's

the foreigners their true enemy now that

the foreigners their true enemy now that
seems<00:06:10.160> a<00:06:10.340> bit<00:06:10.520> far-fetched<00:06:10.660> way<00:06:11.660> out<00:06:11.900> there

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139 
seems a bit far-fetched way out there

responding to flood to kill the Didact
is<00:06:14.330> a<00:06:14.389> bit<00:06:14.780> of<00:06:14.960> an<00:06:15.110> overkill<00:06:15.740> so<00:06:16.280> it<00:06:16.370> seems<00:06:16.580> much

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
is a bit of an overkill so it seems much

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
know where mendicant bias stands but

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.640 
know where mendicant bias stands but
last<00:06:31.639> time<00:06:31.849> we<00:06:32.000> heard<00:06:32.240> at<00:06:32.539> least<00:06:32.659> in<00:06:32.840> 803<00:06:33.110> as
