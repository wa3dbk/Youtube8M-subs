number<00:02:03.640> four<00:02:03.820> you<00:02:04.479> can<00:02:04.630> use<00:02:04.810> them<00:02:04.929> as<00:02:05.109> a<00:02:05.140> bridge

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
number four you can use them as a bridge

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.309 
number four you can use them as a bridge
if<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.579> get<00:02:06.789> to<00:02:06.999> some<00:02:07.539> rats<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:08.019> are<00:02:08.080> going

across the opposite way or just a big

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.780 
across the opposite way or just a big
washout<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.830> can<00:02:12.010> put<00:02:12.190> them<00:02:12.310> across<00:02:12.519> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
washout you can put them across the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.970 
washout you can put them across the
washout<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.900> then<00:02:14.379> just<00:02:14.620> drive<00:02:14.860> straight

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
washout and then just drive straight

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.860 
washout and then just drive straight
over<00:02:15.280> now<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.760> need<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.030> stack<00:02:16.299> in<00:02:16.480> probably

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
over now you need to stack in probably

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.320 
over now you need to stack in probably
three<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.530> four<00:02:17.739> high<00:02:18.180> depending<00:02:19.180> on<00:02:19.269> the

three to four high depending on the
width<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.230> hole<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.739> how<00:02:21.160> much<00:02:21.400> you're<00:02:22.060> on

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
width of the hole and how much you're on

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:22.890 
width of the hole and how much you're on
the<00:02:22.390> edges

the edges

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.660 
the edges
the<00:02:23.230> more<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.530> stack<00:02:23.769> on<00:02:23.920> top<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.310> stronger

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
the more you stack on top the stronger

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.850 
the more you stack on top the stronger
they<00:02:24.790> are<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.569> less<00:02:25.720> they'll<00:02:25.959> flex<00:02:26.260> you

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
they are and the less they'll flex you

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.979 
they are and the less they'll flex you
if<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.700> put<00:02:27.879> one<00:02:28.090> day<00:02:28.299> it<00:02:28.720> will<00:02:28.810> just

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
if you put one day it will just

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.320 
if you put one day it will just
completely<00:02:29.470> flex<00:02:29.799> out<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:30.280> possibly<00:02:30.700> pop<00:02:31.120> out

and this is where you really need a

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.210 
and this is where you really need a
decent<00:02:34.330> set<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.870> matchbox<00:02:35.650> treads<00:02:36.010> or

that the beach was getting narrow it was
too<00:03:12.190> late<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:12.640> what<00:03:13.150> I<00:03:13.180> did<00:03:13.300> was<00:03:13.599> I<00:03:13.630> only<00:03:13.900> had<00:03:14.050> to

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
like one set of max Jackson so two

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.620 
like one set of max Jackson so two
boards<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.410> what<00:03:18.040> I<00:03:18.069> did<00:03:18.280> was<00:03:18.459> I<00:03:18.670> use<00:03:18.940> I<00:03:19.239> used

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
boards and what I did was I use I used

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.600 
boards and what I did was I use I used
them<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.840> reverse<00:03:20.260> up<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.590> bank<00:03:20.800> as<00:03:21.040> far<00:03:21.430> as<00:03:21.519> I

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
them to reverse up the bank as far as I

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.759 
them to reverse up the bank as far as I
could<00:03:21.760> up<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.060> June<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.690> then<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.410> put<00:03:23.590> them<00:03:23.650> on

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
could up to June and then I put them on

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.890 
could up to June and then I put them on
the<00:03:23.980> front<00:03:24.160> tires<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.880> same<00:03:25.120> way<00:03:25.299> that<00:03:25.750> the

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
the front tires the same way that the

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.570 
the front tires the same way that the
tires<00:03:26.140> are<00:03:26.230> turn<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.739> we<00:03:26.980> just<00:03:27.130> repeated<00:03:27.459> this

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
tires are turn and we just repeated this

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.670 
tires are turn and we just repeated this
process<00:03:27.670> until<00:03:28.330> I<00:03:28.540> turned<00:03:28.930> around<00:03:29.110> and<00:03:29.440> could

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
process until I turned around and could

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.800 
process until I turned around and could
eventually<00:03:30.160> just<00:03:30.610> drive<00:03:30.850> out<00:03:31.060> of<00:03:31.090> there<00:03:31.360> so

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
eventually just drive out of there so

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.480 
eventually just drive out of there so
that's<00:03:31.959> a<00:03:32.049> handy<00:03:32.319> one<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.620> know

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.440 

number<00:03:36.910> six<00:03:37.180> is<00:03:37.500> Hill<00:03:38.500> traction<00:03:39.250> aids<00:03:39.520> so<00:03:40.180> if

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
number six is Hill traction aids so if

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.730 
number six is Hill traction aids so if
there's<00:03:40.600> a<00:03:40.660> hill<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:40.960> you<00:03:41.230> just<00:03:41.410> can't<00:03:41.620> make

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
there's a hill that you just can't make

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.430 
there's a hill that you just can't make
it<00:03:41.800> up<00:03:42.040> wherever<00:03:42.220> it's<00:03:42.430> mud<00:03:42.670> or<00:03:43.000> sand<00:03:43.440> so

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
it up wherever it's mud or sand so

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.890

there's<00:03:44.680> some<00:03:44.860> big<00:03:45.070> divots<00:03:45.820> or<00:03:46.030> washouts<00:03:46.690> or

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
there's some big divots or washouts or

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.170 
there's some big divots or washouts or
something<00:03:47.200> coming<00:03:47.410> across<00:03:47.700> fro<00:03:48.700> those<00:03:48.880> tracks

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
something coming across fro those tracks

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.760 
something coming across fro those tracks
down<00:03:49.360> drop<00:03:49.780> them<00:03:49.870> down<00:03:49.990> we<00:03:50.230> start<00:03:50.560> lose

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
down drop them down we start lose

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.920 
down drop them down we start lose
momentum<00:03:51.040> and<00:03:51.550> it<00:03:52.000> not<00:03:52.330> only<00:03:52.570> able<00:03:52.660> to<00:03:52.750> pick

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
momentum and it not only able to pick

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.960 
momentum and it not only able to pick
you<00:03:53.020> up<00:03:53.050> by<00:03:53.380> an<00:03:53.680> inch<00:03:53.890> or<00:03:54.010> two<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:54.640> all<00:03:54.850> the

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
you up by an inch or two you all the

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.760 
you up by an inch or two you all the
sudden<00:03:55.240> have<00:03:55.390> all<00:03:55.690> this<00:03:55.840> grip<00:03:56.140> and<00:03:56.350> you<00:03:56.650> would

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
sudden have all this grip and you would

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.500 
sudden have all this grip and you would
just<00:03:56.890> keep<00:03:57.070> going<00:03:57.130> so<00:03:57.760> it's<00:03:58.000> an<00:03:58.090> excellent<00:03:58.330> way

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
just keep going so it's an excellent way

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.540 
just keep going so it's an excellent way
to<00:03:58.600> get<00:03:58.990> up<00:03:59.170> that<00:03:59.320> hill<00:03:59.620> that<00:03:59.830> you<00:04:00.100> just<00:04:00.370> can't

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
to get up that hill that you just can't

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.750 
to get up that hill that you just can't
get<00:04:00.730> up

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.140 

number<00:04:04.760> seven<00:04:05.120> road<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.260> track<00:04:06.830> building<00:04:07.280> so

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
number seven road and track building so

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.660 
number seven road and track building so
basically<00:04:09.020> pretty<00:04:09.260> similar<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.830> the<00:04:10.190> ramp<00:04:10.430> and

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
basically pretty similar to the ramp and

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.750 
basically pretty similar to the ramp and
the<00:04:10.850> bridge<00:04:11.090> but<00:04:11.630> this<00:04:11.780> is<00:04:11.930> more<00:04:12.200> like<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.980> get

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
the bridge but this is more like you get

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.390 
the bridge but this is more like you get
to<00:04:13.880> this<00:04:14.030> rough<00:04:14.270> section<00:04:15.050> is<00:04:15.440> all<00:04:15.830> uneven

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
to this rough section is all uneven

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.300 
to this rough section is all uneven
rocks<00:04:16.880> and<00:04:17.090> stuff<00:04:17.239> around<00:04:17.570> you<00:04:18.350> can<00:04:18.650> use<00:04:19.100> the

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
rocks and stuff around you can use the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.400 
rocks and stuff around you can use the
match<00:04:19.489> tracks<00:04:19.820> on<00:04:20.090> top<00:04:20.390> of<00:04:20.780> that<00:04:20.900> all<00:04:21.200> your

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
match tracks on top of that all your

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.710 
match tracks on top of that all your
recovery<00:04:21.860> boards<00:04:22.160> you<00:04:22.820> can<00:04:23.000> use<00:04:23.270> them<00:04:23.480> as<00:04:23.660> a

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
recovery boards you can use them as a

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.430 
recovery boards you can use them as a
tool<00:04:24.380> with<00:04:25.010> packing<00:04:25.790> rocks<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.300> Timbers<00:04:26.960> so

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
tool with packing rocks and Timbers so

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.830 
tool with packing rocks and Timbers so
just<00:04:28.010> keep<00:04:28.460> that<00:04:28.580> in<00:04:28.640> mind<00:04:28.730> as<00:04:29.030> well<00:04:29.210> it's<00:04:29.690> an

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
just keep that in mind as well it's an

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.980 
just keep that in mind as well it's an
excellent<00:04:30.020> traction<00:04:30.590> aid

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.370 

number<00:04:34.990> eight<00:04:35.170> is<00:04:35.640> winch<00:04:36.640> traction<00:04:37.420> assist<00:04:37.870> so

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
number eight is winch traction assist so

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.530 
number eight is winch traction assist so
it<00:04:38.680> adds<00:04:38.890> direction<00:04:39.610> to<00:04:39.910> when<00:04:40.090> your<00:04:40.210> winching

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
it adds direction to when your winching

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.020 
it adds direction to when your winching
so<00:04:41.050> say<00:04:41.260> you're<00:04:41.470> winching<00:04:41.830> someone<00:04:42.250> who's<00:04:42.760> on

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
so say you're winching someone who's on

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.780 
so say you're winching someone who's on
an<00:04:43.180> angle<00:04:43.570> on<00:04:43.780> a<00:04:44.170> sand<00:04:44.710> sort<00:04:45.160> of<00:04:45.280> Bank

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
an angle on a sand sort of Bank

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.520 
an angle on a sand sort of Bank
embankment<00:04:46.660> or<00:04:46.780> even<00:04:47.170> mud

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
embankment or even mud

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.960 
embankment or even mud
like<00:04:47.710> a<00:04:47.740> muddy<00:04:48.010> Hill<00:04:48.160> you're<00:04:48.400> trying<00:04:48.670> to<00:04:48.760> get

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
like a muddy Hill you're trying to get

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.630 
like a muddy Hill you're trying to get
them<00:04:49.090> up<00:04:49.270> or<00:04:49.570> get<00:04:49.990> them<00:04:50.110> straight<00:04:50.470> Frodo's<00:04:51.340> max

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
them up or get them straight Frodo's max

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.490 
them up or get them straight Frodo's max
tracks<00:04:51.910> under<00:04:52.330> whichever<00:04:52.930> wheels<00:04:53.200> are

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
tracks under whichever wheels are

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.560 
tracks under whichever wheels are
sliding<00:04:53.800> away<00:04:54.040> it's<00:04:54.730> usually<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.360> rear

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
sliding away it's usually the rear

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.150 
sliding away it's usually the rear
because<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:55.930> rear<00:04:56.110> is<00:04:56.200> usually<00:04:56.560> heavier<00:04:56.860> so

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
because the rear is usually heavier so

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.990 
because the rear is usually heavier so
in<00:04:57.850> our<00:04:58.060> cases<00:04:58.630> as<00:04:59.310> Tobin's<00:05:00.310> case<00:05:00.520> here<00:05:00.820> when

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
in our cases as Tobin's case here when

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.870 
in our cases as Tobin's case here when
he<00:05:01.150> was<00:05:01.270> getting<00:05:01.720> winched<00:05:02.110> out<00:05:02.290> of<00:05:02.500> this<00:05:02.920> bog

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
he was getting winched out of this bog

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.900 
he was getting winched out of this bog
hole<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.990> two<00:05:05.200> options<00:05:05.620> we<00:05:05.740> had<00:05:05.920> we<00:05:06.850> were

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
hole the two options we had we were

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.460 
hole the two options we had we were
winching<00:05:07.270> him<00:05:07.420> back<00:05:07.630> we<00:05:08.020> didn't<00:05:08.200> have<00:05:08.320> much

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
winching him back we didn't have much

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.380 
winching him back we didn't have much
room<00:05:08.710> so<00:05:09.100> we<00:05:09.220> had<00:05:09.340> to<00:05:09.460> use<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:09.760> max<00:05:09.940> tracks<00:05:10.210> to

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
room so we had to use the max tracks to

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.450 
room so we had to use the max tracks to
get<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.140> direction<00:05:11.410> right<00:05:11.650> otherwise<00:05:12.130> he<00:05:12.370> was

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
get the direction right otherwise he was

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.120 
get the direction right otherwise he was
just<00:05:12.610> going<00:05:12.730> to<00:05:12.760> keep<00:05:12.970> going<00:05:13.180> into<00:05:13.600> the<00:05:13.720> swamp

mates if they got the same traps six
high<00:05:24.960> drive<00:05:25.710> up<00:05:26.040> on<00:05:26.250> top<00:05:26.430> of<00:05:26.550> that<00:05:26.670> and<00:05:26.910> you

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
high drive up on top of that and you

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.480 
high drive up on top of that and you
have<00:05:27.930> lifted<00:05:28.140> the<00:05:28.440> vehicle<00:05:28.830> off<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.070> ground

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
have lifted the vehicle off the ground

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.280 
have lifted the vehicle off the ground
so<00:05:30.090> now<00:05:30.240> you<00:05:30.300> can<00:05:30.480> get<00:05:30.630> underneath<00:05:30.960> it<00:05:31.230> and

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
so now you can get underneath it and

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.500 
so now you can get underneath it and
work<00:05:32.130> on<00:05:32.370> whatever<00:05:32.610> you<00:05:32.850> need<00:05:33.000> to<00:05:33.120> work<00:05:33.270> on

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
work on whatever you need to work on

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.780 
work on whatever you need to work on
it's<00:05:33.960> a<00:05:34.080> pretty<00:05:34.260> handy<00:05:34.530> trick<00:05:34.920> I<00:05:35.100> understand

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
it's a pretty handy trick I understand

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.610 
it's a pretty handy trick I understand
you<00:05:35.910> can<00:05:36.060> just<00:05:36.210> you<00:05:36.720> know<00:05:36.780> throw<00:05:37.320> your<00:05:37.470> wheel

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
you can just you know throw your wheel
