him<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:54.030> get<00:02:54.329> some<00:02:54.480> case<00:02:54.689> studies<00:02:54.719> and

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
him to get some case studies and

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.229 
him to get some case studies and
animation<00:02:55.889> studies<00:02:56.219> on<00:02:56.609> how<00:02:56.760> we<00:02:56.819> would<00:02:57.030> want

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
animation studies on how we would want

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.379 
animation studies on how we would want
these<00:02:57.810> aliens<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.409> move<00:02:59.099> around<00:02:59.219> to<00:02:59.639> turn<00:02:59.909> to

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
these aliens to move around to turn to

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.209 
these aliens to move around to turn to
breathe<00:03:00.719> just<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.379> get<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> good<00:03:01.950> feeling

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:02.219 
breathe just to get a good feeling

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:03.740 
breathe just to get a good feeling
working<00:03:02.609> with<00:03:02.760> someone<00:03:03.209> who<00:03:03.389> has<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.510> lot<00:03:03.719> of

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
working with someone who has a lot of

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.149 
working with someone who has a lot of
experience<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.409> that<00:03:04.500> was<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:04.829> very<00:03:04.980> good

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
experience and that was a very good

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.390 
experience and that was a very good
thing<00:03:05.430> definitely<00:03:06.169> to<00:03:07.169> me<00:03:07.439> it<00:03:07.769> feels<00:03:08.069> as

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
thing definitely to me it feels as

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.539 
thing definitely to me it feels as
though<00:03:08.609> it's<00:03:08.639> puppeteering<00:03:09.599> this<00:03:10.200> body<00:03:10.919> it

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
though it's puppeteering this body it

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.119 
though it's puppeteering this body it
sort<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.180> leads<00:03:12.480> with<00:03:13.079> brain<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.769> the

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
sort of leads with brain and the

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.080 
sort of leads with brain and the
mechanics<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.849> the<00:03:15.000> body<00:03:15.209> follows<00:03:15.810> I

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
mechanics of the body follows I

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.580 
mechanics of the body follows I
instantly<00:03:18.090> thought<00:03:18.449> well<00:03:19.079> if<00:03:19.319> they're

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
instantly thought well if they're

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.670 
instantly thought well if they're
kanekalon<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.459> bottom<00:03:20.879> and<00:03:21.480> organic<00:03:22.409> on<00:03:22.560> the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
kanekalon the bottom and organic on the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.770 
kanekalon the bottom and organic on the
top<00:03:22.919> then<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.730> would<00:03:23.819> be<00:03:23.849> nice<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.419> sort<00:03:24.659> of

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
top then it would be nice to sort of

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.649 
top then it would be nice to sort of
have<00:03:25.310> falsely<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.669> we've<00:03:26.909> worked<00:03:27.000> with<00:03:27.359> in

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
have falsely that we've worked with in

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.210 
have falsely that we've worked with in
the<00:03:27.810> motion<00:03:27.959> capture<00:03:28.469> lawyer

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.770 

we<00:03:33.220> thought<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.460> work<00:03:33.610> very<00:03:34.060> intensely<00:03:34.390> doing

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
we thought to work very intensely doing

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.980 
we thought to work very intensely doing
a<00:03:34.840> lot<00:03:34.960> of<00:03:35.020> emission<00:03:35.770> tests<00:03:36.490> and<00:03:36.700> studies<00:03:37.390> on

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
a lot of emission tests and studies on

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.930 
a lot of emission tests and studies on
how<00:03:38.200> we<00:03:38.260> would<00:03:38.560> want<00:03:38.770> these<00:03:39.040> these<00:03:39.400> characters

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
how we would want these these characters

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.100 
how we would want these these characters
to<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:41.020> walk<00:03:41.200> around<00:03:41.560> talk<00:03:42.160> act<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.630> not<00:03:43.900> look

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
to to walk around talk act and not look

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.930 
to to walk around talk act and not look
like<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.320> man<00:03:44.560> in<00:03:44.710> a<00:03:44.770> suit<00:03:44.980> but<00:03:45.220> actually<00:03:45.790> also

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
like a man in a suit but actually also

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.640 
like a man in a suit but actually also
have<00:03:46.060> character<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:46.810> personality<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.530> look

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
have character and personality and look

00:03:47.650 --> 00:04:01.309 
have character and personality and look
out<00:03:47.860> of<00:03:48.070> this<00:03:48.160> world<00:03:48.340> basically

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.160 

all<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.099> aliens<00:04:02.459> are<00:04:02.579> hand<00:04:02.999> key<00:04:03.239> animation

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
all the aliens are hand key animation

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.259 
all the aliens are hand key animation
that's<00:04:04.530> all<00:04:04.650> done<00:04:05.099> by<00:04:05.280> hand<00:04:05.310> or<00:04:05.670> aliens<00:04:06.120> have

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
that's all done by hand or aliens have

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.110 
that's all done by hand or aliens have
three<00:04:06.870> legged<00:04:07.079> joints<00:04:07.560> like<00:04:07.920> a<00:04:07.980> horse's<00:04:08.310> legs

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
three legged joints like a horse's legs

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.030 
three legged joints like a horse's legs
and<00:04:09.389> it<00:04:09.989> would<00:04:10.109> have<00:04:10.200> been<00:04:10.290> quite<00:04:10.650> quite

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
and it would have been quite quite

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.759 
and it would have been quite quite
difficult<00:04:11.219> to<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:12.209> actually<00:04:12.329> mocap<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.200> you

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
difficult to to actually mocap and you

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.649 
difficult to to actually mocap and you
know<00:04:13.889> as<00:04:13.920> an<00:04:14.129> animated<00:04:14.519> like<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.939> to<00:04:15.510> be<00:04:15.629> able

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
know as an animated like to to be able

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.629 
know as an animated like to to be able
to<00:04:15.870> get<00:04:16.259> down<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:16.739> dirty<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.100> put<00:04:17.310> your<00:04:17.459> hands

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
to get down and dirty and put your hands

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.729 
to get down and dirty and put your hands
in<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:18.090> work<00:04:18.329> and<00:04:18.570> an<00:04:19.079> enemy<00:04:19.380> by<00:04:19.530> hand

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
in the work and an enemy by hand

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.159 
in the work and an enemy by hand
actually<00:04:20.190> if<00:04:20.459> possible<00:04:21.269> so<00:04:21.419> we've<00:04:21.900> done<00:04:22.079> that

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
actually if possible so we've done that

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.020 
actually if possible so we've done that
with<00:04:22.320> all<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.470> aliens<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.220> human<00:04:23.639> characters

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
with all the aliens the human characters

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.600 
with all the aliens the human characters
it's<00:04:24.509> a<00:04:24.599> mixture<00:04:24.870> between<00:04:24.960> mocap<00:04:25.889> data<00:04:25.919> and

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
it's a mixture between mocap data and

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.029 
it's a mixture between mocap data and
hanky<00:04:27.210> damnation<00:04:27.570> but<00:04:28.500> yeah<00:04:28.650> it's<00:04:28.800> been<00:04:28.860> a<00:04:28.919> lot

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
hanky damnation but yeah it's been a lot

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.920 
hanky damnation but yeah it's been a lot
of<00:04:29.099> fun<00:04:29.310> because<00:04:29.520> we've<00:04:29.849> got<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:30.270> be<00:04:30.389> able<00:04:30.419> to

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
of fun because we've got to be able to

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.560 
of fun because we've got to be able to
explore<00:04:31.289> a<00:04:31.889> lot<00:04:32.190> of<00:04:32.280> different<00:04:32.550> areas<00:04:32.759> by<00:04:33.330> hand

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
explore a lot of different areas by hand

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:40.980 
explore a lot of different areas by hand
key<00:04:33.750> animating<00:04:34.259> these<00:04:34.560> aliens

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:51.909 

ah

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.790 

we<00:04:52.919> worked<00:04:53.160> with<00:04:53.370> an<00:04:54.120> external<00:04:54.600> studio<00:04:55.110> using

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
we worked with an external studio using

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.080 
we worked with an external studio using
a<00:04:56.070> facial<00:04:56.850> motion<00:04:57.360> capture<00:04:57.870> technology<00:04:58.440> which

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
a facial motion capture technology which

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.820 
a facial motion capture technology which
captures<00:05:00.090> every<00:05:00.630> muscle<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.199> joint<00:05:01.380> without

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
captures every muscle and joint without

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.920 
captures every muscle and joint without
needing<00:05:02.340> to<00:05:02.370> actually<00:05:02.790> put<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.090> motion

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
needing to actually put the motion

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.110 
needing to actually put the motion
capture<00:05:04.229> reflectors<00:05:04.740> on<00:05:04.889> the<00:05:04.979> face<00:05:05.190> actually

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
capture reflectors on the face actually

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.240 
capture reflectors on the face actually
just<00:05:06.270> by<00:05:06.479> recording<00:05:06.930> video<00:05:07.260> the<00:05:07.650> technology

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
just by recording video the technology

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.640 
just by recording video the technology
basically<00:05:08.430> uses<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.510> camera<00:05:09.840> footage<00:05:10.229> the

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
basically uses the camera footage the

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.550 
basically uses the camera footage the
video<00:05:10.889> footage<00:05:11.130> to<00:05:12.000> control<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:13.260> exact

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
video footage to control the exact

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.350 
video footage to control the exact
movement<00:05:13.949> of<00:05:14.010> every<00:05:14.160> muscle<00:05:14.520> and<00:05:14.880> joint<00:05:15.090> in

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
movement of every muscle and joint in

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.810 
movement of every muscle and joint in
the<00:05:15.570> face<00:05:15.780> which<00:05:16.530> then<00:05:16.740> gets<00:05:17.040> interpolated

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
the face which then gets interpolated

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.150 

the<00:05:53.000> funny<00:05:53.330> thing<00:05:53.389> is<00:05:53.540> that<00:05:53.660> no<00:05:54.260> crisis<00:05:55.040> is

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
the funny thing is that no crisis is

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.100 
the funny thing is that no crisis is
always<00:05:55.400> a<00:05:55.430> graphic<00:05:55.910> faby<00:05:56.150> that<00:05:56.510> you<00:05:56.810> have<00:05:56.990> to

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
always a graphic faby that you have to

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.780 
always a graphic faby that you have to
follow<00:05:57.139> up<00:05:57.470> on<00:05:57.620> sound<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:58.160> research<00:05:58.550> phase

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
follow up on sound the research phase

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.980 
follow up on sound the research phase
was<00:05:59.060> of<00:05:59.180> course<00:05:59.330> we<00:05:59.510> were<00:05:59.630> looking<00:05:59.930> at

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
was of course we were looking at

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.960 
was of course we were looking at
everything<00:06:00.290> which<00:06:01.010> was<00:06:01.220> done<00:06:01.430> out<00:06:01.580> there<00:06:01.610> you

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
everything which was done out there you

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.060 
everything which was done out there you
know<00:06:02.090> from<00:06:02.270> from<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:02.900> aliens<00:06:03.230> 12<00:06:03.680> district

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
know from from the aliens 12 district

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.710 
know from from the aliens 12 district
nine<00:06:04.250> the<00:06:04.550> biggest<00:06:04.790> challenge<00:06:05.240> was<00:06:05.389> to<00:06:05.450> not

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
nine the biggest challenge was to not

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.240 
nine the biggest challenge was to not
redo<00:06:06.050> something<00:06:06.320> which<00:06:06.590> has<00:06:06.740> already<00:06:06.980> been

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
redo something which has already been

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.830 
redo something which has already been
done<00:06:07.430> because<00:06:07.820> it's<00:06:08.000> so<00:06:08.120> easy<00:06:08.300> that<00:06:08.419> you<00:06:08.660> kind

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
done because it's so easy that you kind

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.960 
done because it's so easy that you kind
of<00:06:08.900> fall<00:06:09.110> into<00:06:09.410> the<00:06:09.560> thing<00:06:10.490> like<00:06:10.639> oh<00:06:10.760> we<00:06:10.880> had

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
of fall into the thing like oh we had

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.720 
of fall into the thing like oh we had
this<00:06:11.270> sounds<00:06:11.780> like<00:06:11.930> this<00:06:12.650> time<00:06:12.860> we<00:06:13.250> went<00:06:13.580> out

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
this sounds like this time we went out

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.460 
this sounds like this time we went out
and<00:06:13.970> recorded<00:06:14.090> a<00:06:14.450> lot<00:06:14.570> of<00:06:14.660> stuff<00:06:14.840> ourselves<00:06:15.050> so

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
and recorded a lot of stuff ourselves so

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.830 
and recorded a lot of stuff ourselves so
we<00:06:15.500> went<00:06:15.650> for<00:06:15.889> shooting<00:06:16.280> actually<00:06:17.150> real<00:06:17.570> guns

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
we went for shooting actually real guns

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.740 
we went for shooting actually real guns
in<00:06:18.340> the<00:06:19.340> desert<00:06:19.760> and<00:06:19.970> really<00:06:20.330> made<00:06:20.479> our<00:06:20.600> own

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
in the desert and really made our own

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.570 
in the desert and really made our own
recordings<00:06:21.350> and<00:06:21.560> on<00:06:21.710> working<00:06:22.040> so<00:06:22.280> much<00:06:22.430> from

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
recordings and on working so much from

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.210 
recordings and on working so much from
library<00:06:22.970> and<00:06:23.180> an<00:06:24.169> S<00:06:24.290> Christian<00:06:24.680> said<00:06:24.860> like<00:06:25.070> I

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
library and an S Christian said like I

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.710 
library and an S Christian said like I
think<00:06:25.430> also<00:06:25.850> the<00:06:26.030> big<00:06:26.150> difference<00:06:26.479> it's<00:06:26.660> like

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
think also the big difference it's like

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.629 
think also the big difference it's like
the<00:06:26.930> more<00:06:27.260> cinematic<00:06:27.710> moments<00:06:28.220> we<00:06:28.340> have<00:06:28.460> now

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 
the more cinematic moments we have now

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.020 
the more cinematic moments we have now
in<00:06:28.790> the<00:06:28.820> crysis<00:06:29.210> 2<00:06:29.389> which<00:06:29.810> gives<00:06:30.080> us<00:06:30.440> more

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
in the crysis 2 which gives us more

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.159 
in the crysis 2 which gives us more
possibilities<00:06:32.030> also<00:06:32.360> to<00:06:32.479> talk<00:06:32.690> a<00:06:32.720> little<00:06:32.960> bit

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
possibilities also to talk a little bit

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:55.760 
possibilities also to talk a little bit
more<00:06:33.320> audio<00:06:33.950> stuff

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.350 

now<00:06:56.770> it<00:06:57.009> kinda<00:06:57.580> in<00:06:57.669> the<00:06:57.759> direction<00:06:57.970> of<00:06:58.180> like

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
now it kinda in the direction of like

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.870 
now it kinda in the direction of like
energetic<00:06:59.050> sounds<00:06:59.680> which<00:07:00.070> are<00:07:00.340> a<00:07:00.580> lot<00:07:00.850> of

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 
energetic sounds which are a lot of

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.760 
energetic sounds which are a lot of
based<00:07:01.180> on<00:07:01.449> actually<00:07:01.900> instruments<00:07:02.350> or<00:07:02.500> use<00:07:02.740> a

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:02.770 
based on actually instruments or use a

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.700 
based on actually instruments or use a
lot<00:07:02.949> of<00:07:03.039> guitar<00:07:03.370> and<00:07:03.610> bases<00:07:04.060> and<00:07:04.419> can<00:07:04.990> distort

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 
lot of guitar and bases and can distort

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.010 
lot of guitar and bases and can distort
the<00:07:06.340> stuff<00:07:06.580> in<00:07:06.759> the<00:07:06.850> end<00:07:06.970> and<00:07:07.240> heavenly

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
the stuff in the end and heavenly

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.600 
the stuff in the end and heavenly
processing<00:07:08.530> it<00:07:08.650> of<00:07:08.770> course<00:07:08.919> sounds<00:07:09.430> a<00:07:09.460> little

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610 
processing it of course sounds a little

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:10.830 
processing it of course sounds a little
bit<00:07:09.699> like<00:07:09.850> you<00:07:10.030> know<00:07:10.120> like<00:07:10.150> colors<00:07:10.660> is

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 
bit like you know like colors is

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.990 
bit like you know like colors is
something<00:07:11.199> some<00:07:11.919> people<00:07:12.130> prefer<00:07:12.220> blue<00:07:12.639> some

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 
something some people prefer blue some

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.200 
something some people prefer blue some
people<00:07:13.360> read<00:07:13.570> in<00:07:14.530> the<00:07:14.680> end<00:07:14.800> does<00:07:15.190> it<00:07:15.310> work<00:07:15.550> or

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.210 
people read in the end does it work or

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.330 
people read in the end does it work or
not<00:07:16.270> and<00:07:16.660> then<00:07:16.720> the<00:07:16.930> rest<00:07:17.080> is<00:07:17.199> taste<00:07:17.440> so<00:07:18.160> far

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:18.340 
not and then the rest is taste so far

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.499 
not and then the rest is taste so far
think<00:07:18.550> we're<00:07:18.639> on<00:07:18.699> a<00:07:18.759> pretty<00:07:18.880> good<00:07:19.120> track<00:07:19.270> to
