yes<00:00:01.850> tutorial<00:00:02.850> I'm<00:00:03.000> using<00:00:03.030> some<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:03.840> the

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
yes tutorial I'm using some of the

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.670 
yes tutorial I'm using some of the
Windows<00:00:04.500> networking<00:00:05.490> command<00:00:06.029> line<00:00:06.240> tools

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
Windows networking command line tools

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.860 
Windows networking command line tools
for<00:00:07.680> troubleshooting<00:00:08.040> or<00:00:08.870> information

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
for troubleshooting or information

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.940 
for troubleshooting or information
gathering<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.530> stuff<00:00:10.679> like<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:11.420> very<00:00:12.420> basic

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
gathering and stuff like that very basic

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.169 
gathering and stuff like that very basic
I'm<00:00:13.950> gonna<00:00:14.130> be<00:00:14.250> doing<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.549> couple<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.089> these

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
I'm gonna be doing a couple of these

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.900 
I'm gonna be doing a couple of these
videos<00:00:15.719> going<00:00:16.710> from<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.070> real<00:00:17.220> basics<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
videos going from the real basics to

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.300 
videos going from the real basics to
some<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.210> more<00:00:18.359> advanced<00:00:19.100> commands<00:00:20.100> that

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
some of the more advanced commands that

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.090 
some of the more advanced commands that
you<00:00:20.520> can<00:00:20.550> use<00:00:21.439> so<00:00:22.439> first<00:00:22.680> we'll<00:00:22.800> start<00:00:22.830> out

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
you can use so first we'll start out

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.340 
you can use so first we'll start out
with<00:00:23.130> ping<00:00:23.550> most<00:00:24.210> people<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:24.779> used<00:00:25.140> this

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
with ping most people have used this

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.939 
with ping most people have used this
utility<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.939> very<00:00:27.300> simple<00:00:27.960> basically<00:00:28.890> you

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
utility it's very simple basically you

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.800 
utility it's very simple basically you
can<00:00:29.039> open<00:00:29.279> up<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.490> command<00:00:29.820> line<00:00:30.060> type<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.510> CMD

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
can open up a command line type in CMD

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.470 
can open up a command line type in CMD
you'll<00:00:31.529> get<00:00:31.710> you'll<00:00:32.669> get<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.850> new<00:00:33.000> shell<00:00:33.270> and

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
you'll get you'll get a new shell and

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.729 
you'll get you'll get a new shell and
everything<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.940> with<00:00:35.940> ping

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
everything like that so with ping

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.180 
everything like that so with ping
basically<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:39.059> ping<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.680> website<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.980> can

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
basically you can ping a website you can

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.529 
basically you can ping a website you can
ping<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.610> host<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.309> replies<00:00:44.730> obviously

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
ping a host and if it replies obviously

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.840 
ping a host and if it replies obviously
it's<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.500> running<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.730> can

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
it's it's up and running so as you can

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.979 
it's it's up and running so as you can
see<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.170> pain<00:00:49.469> Google<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.840> we'll<00:00:51.840> get

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
see we can pain Google and we'll get

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.150 
see we can pain Google and we'll get
replies<00:00:53.390> so<00:00:54.390> we<00:00:54.449> see<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.890> breaking<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.010> down

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
replies so we see that breaking it down

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.580 
replies so we see that breaking it down
here<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.610> pinging<00:00:57.270> google.com<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.410> does

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
here it's pinging google.com so it does

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.390 
here it's pinging google.com so it does
a<00:00:58.620> dns<00:00:59.250> resolution<00:00:59.690> 274<00:01:00.690> dot<00:01:00.899> 125<00:01:01.530> 70<00:01:02.870> 3.99<00:01:04.400> and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
a dns resolution 274 dot 125 70 3.99 and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.120 
a dns resolution 274 dot 125 70 3.99 and
sends<00:01:06.299> out<00:01:06.390> 4<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.689> we<00:01:06.930> get<00:01:07.110> replies<00:01:07.470> back<00:01:07.830> from

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
sends out 4 and we get replies back from

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.740 
sends out 4 and we get replies back from
both<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.820> at<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> bottom<00:01:09.210> there's<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.720> little

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
both so at the bottom there's a little

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.190 
both so at the bottom there's a little
bit<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.350> summary<00:01:10.890> right<00:01:11.189> here<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:12.240> sent<00:01:12.510> 4<00:01:12.810> we

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
bit of a summary right here we sent 4 we

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.469 
bit of a summary right here we sent 4 we
received<00:01:13.619> 4<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.250> lost<00:01:14.520> none<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.210> there's<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
received 4 and we lost none so there's a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.690 
received 4 and we lost none so there's a
zero<00:01:15.869> percent<00:01:16.049> packet<00:01:16.710> loss<00:01:18.290> so<00:01:19.700> basically

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
zero percent packet loss so basically

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.039 
zero percent packet loss so basically
you<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:20.939> use<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.540> measure<00:01:23.720> how<00:01:24.720> long<00:01:24.900> it

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
you can use this to measure how long it

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.960 
you can use this to measure how long it
takes<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.320> get<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> response<00:01:25.710> which<00:01:26.580> will

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
takes to get a response which will

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.230 
takes to get a response which will
determine<00:01:27.659> latency<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:29.610> things<00:01:29.850> like<00:01:30.000> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
determine latency and things like that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.390 
determine latency and things like that
if<00:01:30.689> you're<00:01:30.900> getting<00:01:31.140> drop<00:01:31.380> packets<00:01:31.979> there

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
if you're getting drop packets there

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.149 
if you're getting drop packets there
might<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.670> some<00:01:32.909> inconsistency<00:01:33.750> or<00:01:34.100> way<00:01:35.100> too

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
might be some inconsistency or way too

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.310 
might be some inconsistency or way too
much<00:01:35.549> latency<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.360> where<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.689> actually<00:01:36.720> never

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
much latency to where you actually never

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.850 
much latency to where you actually never
get<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.130> actually<00:01:38.520> drops<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:39.860> another

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
get it and it actually drops out another

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.560 
get it and it actually drops out another
tool<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.579> trace<00:01:42.390> routes<00:01:42.810> one's<00:01:43.200> very<00:01:43.409> simple

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
tool is trace routes one's very simple

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.039 
tool is trace routes one's very simple
it's<00:01:45.570> trace<00:01:46.320> RT<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.310> Windows<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.329> Linux<00:01:48.540> it's

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
it's trace RT in Windows and Linux it's

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.149 
it's trace RT in Windows and Linux it's
actually<00:01:49.590> spelled<00:01:49.979> out<00:01:50.189> trace<00:01:50.640> route<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.920> we

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
actually spelled out trace route so we

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.649 
actually spelled out trace route so we
can<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.490> same<00:01:53.759> thing<00:01:54.060> here<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.420> Google

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
can do the same thing here to Google

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.200 
can do the same thing here to Google
what<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.950> do<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.340> uses<00:01:56.670> ICMP

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
what this is going to do this uses ICMP

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.090 
what this is going to do this uses ICMP
as<00:01:57.719> well<00:01:58.110> as<00:01:59.070> ping<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.180> will<00:02:00.829> trace<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
as well as ping and it will trace the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.490 
as well as ping and it will trace the
hops<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.939> these<00:02:03.210> are<00:02:03.360> all<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.630> routing<00:02:03.990> hops

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
hops and these are all the routing hops

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.630 
hops and these are all the routing hops
out<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.399> google.com<00:02:06.829> so<00:02:07.829> you'll<00:02:07.979> see<00:02:08.160> my<00:02:08.340> first

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
out to google.com so you'll see my first

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.630 
out to google.com so you'll see my first

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:33.310 

and<00:02:26.660> we're<00:02:26.780> gonna<00:02:26.870> let<00:02:27.110> this<00:02:27.290> finish<00:02:27.560> here<00:02:32.320> now

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
and we're gonna let this finish here now

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.800 
and we're gonna let this finish here now
just<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.680> note<00:02:33.709> each<00:02:34.160> one<00:02:34.459> of<00:02:34.580> these<00:02:34.760> hops<00:02:35.360> is

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
just a note each one of these hops is

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.020 
just a note each one of these hops is
actually<00:02:36.410> going<00:02:36.620> through<00:02:36.770> a<00:02:37.130> router<00:02:37.700> and

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
actually going through a router and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:03:03.850 
actually going through a router and
going<00:02:38.810> down<00:02:38.990> a<00:02:39.050> specific<00:02:39.410> route

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.650 

okay<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:04.920> there<00:03:05.250> we<00:03:05.310> go<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.090> finished<00:03:06.480> and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
okay so there we go so it finished and

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.920 
okay so there we go so it finished and
basically<00:03:07.640> you'll<00:03:08.640> see<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.850> count<00:03:09.240> over<00:03:09.510> here

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
basically you'll see a count over here

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.400 
basically you'll see a count over here
on<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.140> far<00:03:10.380> left<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:11.570> there's<00:03:12.570> 15<00:03:13.140> at<00:03:13.290> the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
on the far left and there's 15 at the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.460 
on the far left and there's 15 at the
bottom<00:03:13.800> so<00:03:14.310> there's<00:03:14.490> 15<00:03:16.400> routers<00:03:17.400> if<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.910> will

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
bottom so there's 15 routers if you will

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.910 
bottom so there's 15 routers if you will
between<00:03:19.850> my<00:03:20.870> hosts<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.280> google.com<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:25.380> then

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
between my hosts and google.com and then

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.370 
between my hosts and google.com and then
you<00:03:26.100> can<00:03:26.280> see<00:03:26.520> exactly<00:03:26.600> where<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.960> goes<00:03:27.990> from

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
you can see exactly where it goes from

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.680 
you can see exactly where it goes from
here<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.490> there<00:03:29.790> now

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
here to there now

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.290 
here to there now
firewalls<00:03:31.110> that<00:03:31.350> block<00:03:31.740> ICMP<00:03:32.520> you<00:03:33.150> will

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
firewalls that block ICMP you will

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.990 
firewalls that block ICMP you will
actually<00:03:33.510> get<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.530> timeout<00:03:35.330> for<00:03:36.680> so<00:03:37.680> say<00:03:37.890> if<00:03:38.040> if

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
actually get a timeout for so say if if

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.100 
actually get a timeout for so say if if
my<00:03:39.060> firewall<00:03:39.690> here<00:03:40.080> was<00:03:40.470> blocking<00:03:41.150> ICMP<00:03:42.150> the

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
my firewall here was blocking ICMP the

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.130 
my firewall here was blocking ICMP the
number<00:03:43.440> two<00:03:43.970> would<00:03:44.970> be<00:03:45.150> just<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.540> timeout<00:03:45.840> you

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
number two would be just a timeout you

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.780 
number two would be just a timeout you
wouldn't<00:03:46.410> actually<00:03:46.530> see<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.100> address<00:03:47.280> so

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
wouldn't actually see the address so

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.230 
wouldn't actually see the address so
this<00:03:47.910> is<00:03:48.060> another<00:03:48.630> form<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:49.020> the<00:03:49.380> securing<00:03:50.240> you

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
this is another form of the securing you

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.300 
this is another form of the securing you
know<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.510> hiding<00:03:51.900> basically<00:03:52.740> you<00:03:52.920> can<00:03:53.130> block

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
know and hiding basically you can block

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.230 
know and hiding basically you can block
ICMP<00:03:53.970> requests<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:55.220> it<00:03:56.220> will<00:03:56.370> not<00:03:56.550> reply<00:03:56.970> back

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
ICMP requests and it will not reply back

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.500 
ICMP requests and it will not reply back
to<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:58.410> hosts<00:03:58.710> that<00:03:58.950> ran<00:03:59.160> trace<00:03:59.430> route<00:03:59.640> same

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
to the hosts that ran trace route same

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.630 
to the hosts that ran trace route same
with<00:04:00.690> pink<00:04:00.930> same<00:04:01.500> thing<00:04:01.740> so<00:04:02.070> basically<00:04:02.280> you

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
with pink same thing so basically you

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.120 
with pink same thing so basically you
see<00:04:02.910> 1<00:04:03.690> through<00:04:03.840> 15<00:04:03.990> and<00:04:04.470> all<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.680> hops<00:04:04.890> that

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
see 1 through 15 and all the hops that

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.480 
see 1 through 15 and all the hops that
it<00:04:05.250> takes<00:04:05.430> this<00:04:06.180> tool<00:04:06.390> is<00:04:06.570> good<00:04:06.950> for<00:04:07.950> tracking

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
it takes this tool is good for tracking

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.980 
it takes this tool is good for tracking
down<00:04:08.670> route<00:04:09.740> issues<00:04:10.740> so<00:04:11.630> you<00:04:12.630> know<00:04:12.720> if<00:04:12.840> you're

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
down route issues so you know if you're

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.830 
down route issues so you know if you're
not<00:04:13.020> sure<00:04:13.440> if<00:04:14.150> you're<00:04:15.150> not<00:04:15.300> able<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.570> connect

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
not sure if you're not able to connect

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.599 
not sure if you're not able to connect
to<00:04:15.900> something<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:16.620> maybe<00:04:17.190> it's<00:04:17.340> using

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
to something and maybe it's using

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.880 
to something and maybe it's using
dynamic<00:04:17.790> routing<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.989> can<00:04:19.200> run<00:04:19.410> this<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.859> see

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
dynamic routing you can run this and see

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.620 
dynamic routing you can run this and see
which<00:04:20.220> route<00:04:20.430> it's<00:04:20.640> actually<00:04:21.000> taking<00:04:21.480> it's

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
which route it's actually taking it's

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.600 
which route it's actually taking it's
good<00:04:21.840> way<00:04:22.020> to<00:04:22.080> troubleshoot<00:04:22.650> networking

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
good way to troubleshoot networking

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.410 
good way to troubleshoot networking
issues<00:04:25.130> another<00:04:26.130> thing<00:04:26.340> I'll<00:04:26.490> go<00:04:26.670> over<00:04:26.790> here

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
issues another thing I'll go over here

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:36.320 
issues another thing I'll go over here
is<00:04:28.350> net<00:04:29.280> stat<00:04:31.670> and<00:04:34.040> basically<00:04:35.060> they'll<00:04:36.060> show

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
is net stat and basically they'll show

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.410 
is net stat and basically they'll show
network<00:04:36.960> statistics<00:04:37.730> connections<00:04:38.730> current

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
network statistics connections current

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.880 
network statistics connections current
connections<00:04:39.810> listening<00:04:40.200> connections<00:04:40.620> stuff

like<00:04:41.070> that<00:04:44.180> one<00:04:45.180> of<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.390> more<00:04:45.720> helpful<00:04:46.200> ones

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
like that one of the more helpful ones

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.240 
like that one of the more helpful ones
is<00:04:46.770> net<00:04:47.280> stat<00:04:47.580> space<00:04:48.150> minus<00:04:48.660> RN<00:04:49.290> this<00:04:49.860> shows<00:04:50.100> us

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
is net stat space minus RN this shows us

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.720 
is net stat space minus RN this shows us
our<00:04:50.430> current<00:04:50.760> routing<00:04:51.450> table<00:04:52.640> you<00:04:53.640> know

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
our current routing table you know

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.660 
our current routing table you know
listed<00:04:54.150> top<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.510> bottom<00:04:54.660> here<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:55.410> you<00:04:56.220> can<00:04:56.430> see

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
listed top to bottom here so you can see

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.900 
listed top to bottom here so you can see
our<00:04:57.000> default<00:04:57.840> gateway<00:04:58.590> is<00:04:58.700> normally<00:04:59.700> at<00:04:59.790> the

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
our default gateway is normally at the

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.570 
our default gateway is normally at the
top<00:05:00.120> for<00:05:00.420> Windows<00:05:01.160> usually<00:05:02.160> at<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.370> bottom

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
top for Windows usually at the bottom

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.520 
top for Windows usually at the bottom
for<00:05:03.030> Linux<00:05:03.510> or<00:05:03.690> UNIX<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:07.050> if<00:05:07.230> you're<00:05:07.410> not

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
for Linux or UNIX and if you're not

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.710 
for Linux or UNIX and if you're not
familiar<00:05:07.710> with<00:05:08.040> this<00:05:08.430> I<00:05:08.910> may<00:05:09.450> do<00:05:09.510> another

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
familiar with this I may do another

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.170 
familiar with this I may do another
video<00:05:10.170> describing<00:05:11.010> that<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.520> routing<00:05:11.700> table

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
video describing that the routing table

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.210 
video describing that the routing table
but<00:05:12.390> there's<00:05:12.600> a<00:05:12.690> lot<00:05:13.110> of<00:05:13.140> information<00:05:13.560> I'll

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
but there's a lot of information I'll

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.980 
but there's a lot of information I'll
post<00:05:14.490> some<00:05:14.669> links<00:05:14.880> in<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.330> district

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
post some links in the district

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.960 
post some links in the district
on<00:05:16.470> understanding<00:05:17.190> routing<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:17.699> routing

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
on understanding routing and routing

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.029 
on understanding routing and routing
tables<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:18.539> stuff<00:05:18.690> like<00:05:18.810> that<00:05:19.020> but<00:05:19.919> basically

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
tables and stuff like that but basically

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:21.800 
tables and stuff like that but basically
the<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.789> mainland<00:05:21.120> that<00:05:21.150> you<00:05:21.360> need<00:05:21.509> to<00:05:21.600> know

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
the the mainland that you need to know

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.920 
the the mainland that you need to know
from<00:05:22.410> just<00:05:22.710> a<00:05:22.979> regular<00:05:23.370> users<00:05:23.789> perspective<00:05:24.750> is

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
from just a regular users perspective is

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.180 
from just a regular users perspective is
the<00:05:25.139> default<00:05:25.650> gateway<00:05:26.330> basically<00:05:27.330> says

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
the default gateway basically says

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.930 
the default gateway basically says
0.0.0.0<00:05:29.270> so<00:05:30.270> that's<00:05:30.419> anything<00:05:31.729> send<00:05:32.729> it<00:05:32.849> to

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
0.0.0.0 so that's anything send it to

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.370 
0.0.0.0 so that's anything send it to
this<00:05:33.060> gateway<00:05:33.360> which<00:05:33.780> is<00:05:33.930> the<00:05:34.050> upstream

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
this gateway which is the upstream

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.029 
this gateway which is the upstream
firewall<00:05:35.990> so<00:05:36.990> that's<00:05:37.139> some<00:05:37.620> of<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.710> useful

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
firewall so that's some of the useful

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:38.559 
firewall so that's some of the useful
