00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
of green acid green I guess you could

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.950 
of green acid green I guess you could
say<00:00:31.980> looks<00:00:32.759> like<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.969> metallic<00:00:33.300> green<00:00:33.780> it's

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
say looks like a metallic green it's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.889 
say looks like a metallic green it's
really<00:00:34.050> unique<00:00:35.239> simply<00:00:36.239> because<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.600> has<00:00:36.750> this

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
really unique simply because it has this

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.590 
really unique simply because it has this
metallic<00:00:37.260> kind<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.860> tinge<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.760> but<00:00:39.570> I

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
metallic kind of tinge to it but I

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.479 
metallic kind of tinge to it but I
really<00:00:39.989> do<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.260> how<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.469> looks<00:00:40.710> I've<00:00:41.190> already

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
100 and what makes it unique is that it

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
is a very high quality thin synthetic

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.390 
is a very high quality thin synthetic
material<00:01:02.609> but<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.390> not<00:01:03.570> exactly<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.379> an<00:01:04.860> ultra

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
material but it's not exactly a an ultra

lightweight<00:01:05.640> shoe<00:01:06.119> which<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.960> somewhat

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
lightweight shoe which is somewhat

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.719 
lightweight shoe which is somewhat
unusual<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.860> don't<00:01:08.010> really<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.490> too

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
unusual you don't really see this too

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.640 
unusual you don't really see this too
often<00:01:08.909> whenever<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.540> see<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> thin<00:01:10.049> synthetic

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
often whenever you see a thin synthetic

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.910 
often whenever you see a thin synthetic
it<00:01:11.159> generally<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> light<00:01:12.450> weight<00:01:12.920> basically

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
it generally is a light weight basically

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920 
it generally is a light weight basically
speed<00:01:14.310> boot<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.880> while<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.420> technically

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
speed boot and while this is technically

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.700 
speed boot and while this is technically
considered<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.560> speed<00:01:16.860> boot<00:01:17.990> it's<00:01:18.990> not<00:01:19.229> exactly

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
considered a speed boot it's not exactly

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.170 
considered a speed boot it's not exactly
super<00:01:20.130> lightweight<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.460> believe<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.850> weighs<00:01:21.000> in

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
super lightweight I believe it weighs in

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.420 
super lightweight I believe it weighs in
at<00:01:21.299> about<00:01:21.420> 9<00:01:21.750> ounces<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.040> not<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.189> heavy

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
at about 9 ounces so it's not a heavy

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.340 
at about 9 ounces so it's not a heavy
shoe<00:01:23.549> by<00:01:23.880> any<00:01:24.030> means<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:24.479> still<00:01:24.570> below

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
shoe by any means it's still below

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.380 
shoe by any means it's still below
average<00:01:25.530> as<00:01:26.070> far<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.340> weight<00:01:26.490> goes<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.270> it's

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
average as far as weight goes but it's

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.030 
average as far as weight goes but it's
not<00:01:27.479> ultra<00:01:27.840> lightweight<00:01:28.080> which<00:01:28.770> kind<00:01:28.979> of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
not ultra lightweight which kind of

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.649 
not ultra lightweight which kind of
confused<00:01:29.460> me<00:01:29.549> until<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.909> actually<00:01:30.119> wore<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
confused me until I actually wore the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.080 
confused me until I actually wore the
shoe<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.650> really<00:01:31.950> makes<00:01:32.280> for<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.520> solid

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
shoe and it really makes for a solid

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.260 
shoe and it really makes for a solid
feel<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:35.280> synthetic<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:36.060> so

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
feel and the synthetic is just so

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.060 
feel and the synthetic is just so
high-quality<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> fit<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.409> really<00:01:37.799> good

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
high-quality and the fit is really good

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.429 
high-quality and the fit is really good
as<00:01:38.220> well<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.390> also<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.630> really<00:01:40.049> great<00:01:40.170> shoe

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
as well this is also a really great shoe

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.350 
as well this is also a really great shoe
to<00:01:40.560> use<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.920> turf<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.150> synthetic

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
to use on turf you can see the synthetic

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.170 
to use on turf you can see the synthetic
here<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.409> thin<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.950> has<00:01:44.100> some<00:01:44.399> slight

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
here it's thin but it has some slight

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.600 
here it's thin but it has some slight
pad<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> slightly<00:01:46.409> padded<00:01:46.799> quality<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
pad it like a slightly padded quality to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.580 
pad it like a slightly padded quality to
it<00:01:47.869> early<00:01:48.869> high<00:01:48.990> quality<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.350> get<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
it early high quality you get the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.889 
it early high quality you get the
central<00:01:49.950> lacing<00:01:50.340> system<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.720> pretty

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
central lacing system and it's pretty

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.179 
central lacing system and it's pretty
clean<00:01:52.200> there's<00:01:52.409> really<00:01:52.530> nothing<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
clean there's really nothing on the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.270 
clean there's really nothing on the
upper<00:01:53.430> at<00:01:53.610> all<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:54.770> really<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:55.890> how<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.070> shoe

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
upper at all I really like how the shoe

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.920 
upper at all I really like how the shoe
looks<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.700> well<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.090> really<00:01:57.299> sharp<00:01:57.630> looking

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
looks as well it's really sharp looking

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.840 
looks as well it's really sharp looking
shoe<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.170> think<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:59.219> then<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.460> course<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.759> get

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
shoe I think and then of course you get

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.469 
shoe I think and then of course you get
the<00:02:00.090> lotto<00:02:00.329> reactive<00:02:00.990> arc<00:02:01.170> soleplate<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
the lotto reactive arc soleplate and the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.350 
the lotto reactive arc soleplate and the
standard<00:02:03.899> lotto<00:02:04.110> stud<00:02:04.469> pattern<00:02:05.360> basically

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
standard lotto stud pattern basically

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.270 
standard lotto stud pattern basically
how<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.659> reactive<00:02:07.079> arc<00:02:07.229> soleplate<00:02:07.560> goes<00:02:07.829> is

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
how the reactive arc soleplate goes is

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.529 
how the reactive arc soleplate goes is
basically<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.729> soleplate<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.270> shaped

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
basically the soleplate is shaped

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.140 
basically the soleplate is shaped
basically<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.739> arc<00:02:10.979> like<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.030> when

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
basically on this arc like this so when

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.820 
basically on this arc like this so when
you<00:02:12.239> stop<00:02:12.420> down<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.780> flattens<00:02:13.200> out

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
you stop down it flattens out

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.350 
you stop down it flattens out
and<00:02:13.950> then<00:02:14.190> when<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.400> basically<00:02:14.850> release

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
and then when you basically release

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.000 
and then when you basically release
pressure<00:02:15.630> from<00:02:15.960> it<00:02:16.080> it's<00:02:16.260> supposed<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.680> react

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
pressure from it it's supposed to react

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.800 
pressure from it it's supposed to react
and<00:02:17.580> kind<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.820> push<00:02:17.940> your<00:02:18.090> foot<00:02:18.180> back<00:02:18.390> up<00:02:18.420> kind

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
and kind of push your foot back up kind

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.650 
and kind of push your foot back up kind
of<00:02:18.870> making<00:02:19.140> like<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.350> first<00:02:19.650> springy<00:02:19.980> effect

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
of making like a first springy effect

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.050 
of making like a first springy effect
while<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.870> might<00:02:22.340> mmm<00:02:23.340> that's<00:02:23.730> going<00:02:24.000> a

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
while that might mmm that's going a

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.550 
while that might mmm that's going a
little<00:02:24.090> bit<00:02:24.390> crazy<00:02:24.450> as<00:02:24.990> far<00:02:25.140> as<00:02:25.230> saying<00:02:25.440> that

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
little bit crazy as far as saying that

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.590 
little bit crazy as far as saying that
it<00:02:25.650> works<00:02:25.890> really<00:02:26.010> well<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.580> can<00:02:27.210> say<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.480> this

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
it works really well I can say that this

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.940 
it works really well I can say that this
is<00:02:27.720> probably<00:02:27.780> one<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.200> my<00:02:28.350> favorite<00:02:28.770> slow

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
is probably one of my favorite slow
