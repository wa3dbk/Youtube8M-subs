00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.860
 more our 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.860
 cholera is something very traditional in the 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.870
 plains for the same trilogy that 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.230
 way that man is the bull and the 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.470
 horse my name is ariel july days 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:47.190
 professional 30 years ago 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.740
 the sleeve is understood as 300 meters 150 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.080
 meters the first zone 100 meters the 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.850
 second and another 50 that are those of the 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.470
 area of the protection we call 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.090
 that is already bull you can not touch 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.390
 after he has already passed this 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.390
 ground 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.440
 150 the first one here has 100 run 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.080
 in the second to make the two 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.700
 scored the back is managed 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.560
 for some jeans that are the ones 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.990
 they organize the cattle they receive them in the 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.600
 back when already made the 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.550
 waves and wait for the cattle to arrive 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.620
 to lock him in the pens for 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.150
 when the whole round passes back and 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.310
 upload it to any queue And now 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.060
 Some bull these here are not going away 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.579
 to put no bull but those who go 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.149
 those who will be ready to go out to the 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.009
 chore 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.390
 one always waits at the door of the arena 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.130
 that we call have the exit where 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.720
 the bulls come out there one is always 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.090
 pending in the pure gateway 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.560
 where the bull comes out you treat it 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.170
 grab as soon as possible by the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.090
 tail there is a mate or marine d'or that 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.429
 one always has to be the one that always 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.220
 they accompany him all the poles then he 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.990
 try to avoid that the bull or 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.939
 go sideways so that for 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.130
 and aligns the bull run right and 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.409
 can organize one and make one the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.509
 chores that one has always expected from a 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.220
 horse that have very good phenotype is 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.679
 a horse that is a chestnut 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.080
 thick that any bull can knock down 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.500
 that is fast that has a lot of force in 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.599
 the loin one grabs the bull by the wick 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.519
 with what we call the bull goes on the 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.620
 race the bull that more violent goes that 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.019
 bull is the one who can give the most 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.630
 which one waits because because at the moment 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.000
 I hope the bull goes so light that 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.470
 can not be sustained if the horse has 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 good strength what we talk about the loin 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.390
 then the bull is going to end 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.650
 about their wolves more easily the bull 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.319
 you can talk 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.079
 Sometimes one first and one second 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.610
 in first figure the bell and the 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.890
 bell or there the side 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.900
 the bull gets up and then and runs and 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.510
 is the other opportunity for a cole 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.250
 It's already good luck that you have to 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.260
 reach the whole in some way already if 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.260
 he did not reach it and he loses one his job 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.640
 to other llaneros we do not breathe 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.490
 the trajectory of the old ones of our 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.360
 grandparents of our parents was already what 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.360
 we have in the blood
