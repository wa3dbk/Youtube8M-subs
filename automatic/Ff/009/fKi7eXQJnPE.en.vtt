00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
thought I liked the color and I never

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.030

really<00:03:27.730> wore<00:03:27.910> this<00:03:28.060> shirt<00:03:28.530> very<00:03:29.530> much<00:03:29.739> lately

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
the top part and it just kind of depends

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.650 
the top part and it just kind of depends
what<00:03:36.190> kind<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.489> style<00:03:36.700> shirt<00:03:37.090> you'd<00:03:37.239> like<00:03:37.480> if
