ya think except what days you can't
remote<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> q10<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.760> you

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
remote it but the q10 you can and you

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.959 
remote it but the q10 you can and you
have<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:52.199> same<00:00:53.070> gestures<00:00:53.430> apply<00:00:53.699> you

dual-core and this is 1.2 okay just the
same<00:01:07.530> chipset<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.250> clock<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.610> slowly

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
same chipset but this clock it's slowly

720 motion sounds wheels okay calcd oh
we<00:01:15.659> call<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> q10<00:01:16.259> its<00:01:16.470> armor<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:19.020> it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
we call the q10 its armor and it's it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.950 
we call the q10 its armor and it's it
two<00:01:19.799> gig<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.430> ram<00:01:20.610> still<00:01:21.090> too<00:01:21.390> geeky<00:01:21.630> rounds

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
two gig of ram still too geeky rounds

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.140 
two gig of ram still too geeky rounds
yes<00:01:22.140> okay<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> main<00:01:23.729> difference<00:01:24.030> between

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
yes okay so the main difference between

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.090 
yes okay so the main difference between
this<00:01:24.450> obviously<00:01:24.750> ability<00:01:25.560> generally<00:01:25.950> like

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
this obviously ability generally like

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.950 
this obviously ability generally like
this<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.490> lot<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:26.880> not<00:01:27.150> quite<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.659> premium

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
this is a lot it's not quite as premium

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.359 
this is a lot it's not quite as premium
as<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.799> q10<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:30.590> it's<00:01:31.590> got<00:01:31.799> slightly<00:01:32.009> slower

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
as the q10 and it's got slightly slower

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.859 
as the q10 and it's got slightly slower
processor<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.119> know<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.479> there's<00:01:33.689> been<00:01:33.810> no

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
processor I know but there's been no

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.109 
processor I know but there's been no
magic<00:01:34.290> with<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.439> price<00:01:34.740> yeah<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:36.000> I'm

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
magic with the price yeah but I'm

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.179 
magic with the price yeah but I'm
assuming<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> slot<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.290> sort<00:01:38.159> of

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
assuming it's going to slot in sort of

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.270 
assuming it's going to slot in sort of
significantly<00:01:38.729> lower<00:01:38.909> than<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.720> don't<00:01:40.619> price

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
significantly lower than I don't price

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.490 
significantly lower than I don't price
why<00:01:41.460> don't<00:01:41.700> know<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.689> well<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.229> device

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
why don't know this is well this device

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.010 
why don't know this is well this device
is<00:01:43.909> targeted<00:01:44.909> towards<00:01:45.030> emerging<00:01:45.479> wickets
