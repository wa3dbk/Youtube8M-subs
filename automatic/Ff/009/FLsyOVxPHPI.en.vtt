kept<00:01:48.159> Hill<00:01:48.310> runners<00:01:48.579> hat<00:01:48.729> just<00:01:49.029> because<00:01:49.209> you

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
kept Hill runners hat just because you

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.819 
kept Hill runners hat just because you
know<00:01:49.600> your<00:01:49.749> shields<00:01:50.049> going<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.229> go<00:01:50.349> down<00:01:50.560> and

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
know your shields going to go down and

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.589 
know your shields going to go down and
get<00:01:51.189> in<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.399> sprint<00:01:51.759> make<00:01:52.090> sure<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.359> get<00:01:52.450> out

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:52.599 
get in that sprint make sure you get out

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:55.349 
get in that sprint make sure you get out
of<00:01:52.719> there<00:01:53.039> blood<00:01:54.039> to<00:01:54.159> salt<00:01:54.429> is<00:01:54.729> great<00:01:55.029> for<00:01:55.270> this

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
of there blood to salt is great for this

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:56.849 
of there blood to salt is great for this
because<00:01:55.659> you're<00:01:56.139> going<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:56.319> be<00:01:56.409> killing<00:01:56.709> all

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
because you're going to be killing all

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.099 
because you're going to be killing all
those<00:01:56.950> zombies<00:01:57.189> so<00:01:57.639> 40%<00:01:58.599> of<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:58.719> time<00:01:58.840> you<00:01:58.990> get

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
those zombies so 40% of the time you get

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:02.399 
those zombies so 40% of the time you get
a<00:01:59.139> chance<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.469> get<00:01:59.590> back<00:01:59.709> salt<00:02:00.929> with<00:02:01.929> overkill

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
a chance to get back salt with overkill

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.929 
a chance to get back salt with overkill
I<00:02:02.649> mean<00:02:02.799> there<00:02:02.979> warn't<00:02:03.249> I<00:02:03.340> didn't<00:02:03.609> have<00:02:03.729> any

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
I mean there warn't I didn't have any

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.669 
I mean there warn't I didn't have any
other<00:02:04.119> little<00:02:04.659> choices<00:02:04.810> here<00:02:05.200> but<00:02:05.229> I<00:02:05.469> stuck

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
other little choices here but I stuck

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.409 
other little choices here but I stuck
with<00:02:05.740> overkill<00:02:06.219> just<00:02:06.459> because<00:02:06.639> you<00:02:06.909> know<00:02:06.999> as

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:07.419 
with overkill just because you know as

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:08.940 
with overkill just because you know as
we're<00:02:07.630> killing<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.929> zombies<00:02:07.959> that<00:02:08.560> damage<00:02:08.860> is

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
we're killing the zombies that damage is

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.280 
we're killing the zombies that damage is
going<00:02:09.039> to<00:02:09.130> stun<00:02:09.280> her<00:02:09.490> and<00:02:09.759> then<00:02:10.539> what<00:02:11.170> really

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
going to stun her and then what really

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.870 
going to stun her and then what really
makes<00:02:11.590> this<00:02:11.740> work<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.160> putting<00:02:12.430> down<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:12.640> ghost

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
makes this work is putting down a ghost

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.790 
makes this work is putting down a ghost
posse<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.540> basically<00:02:14.319> we're<00:02:14.530> going<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.680> be

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
posse and basically we're going to be

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.149 
posse and basically we're going to be
making<00:02:15.069> bigger<00:02:15.730> traps<00:02:16.120> with<00:02:16.930> Devils<00:02:17.620> kiss<00:02:17.829> and

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
making bigger traps with Devils kiss and

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.860 
making bigger traps with Devils kiss and
then<00:02:18.640> when<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:18.909> explodes<00:02:19.390> that'll<00:02:19.689> usually

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
then when that explodes that'll usually

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.250 
then when that explodes that'll usually
take<00:02:20.470> care<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.680> nuking<00:02:20.950> awful

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
take care of nuking awful

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.589 
take care of nuking awful
zombies<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:22.040> obviously<00:02:23.000> there's<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.360> chance

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
zombies so obviously there's a chance

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.990 
zombies so obviously there's a chance
they're<00:02:23.840> going<00:02:23.989> to<00:02:24.049> rise<00:02:24.560> up<00:02:24.799> UN<00:02:25.610> start

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
they're going to rise up UN start

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.520 
they're going to rise up UN start
shooting<00:02:26.329> at<00:02:26.450> her<00:02:26.599> and<00:02:26.989> then<00:02:27.079> of<00:02:27.170> course<00:02:27.379> at

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
shooting at her and then of course at

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.539 
shooting at her and then of course at
blood<00:02:27.709> assaults<00:02:28.129> we're<00:02:28.250> going<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.430> be<00:02:28.489> getting

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
blood assaults we're going to be getting

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.100 
blood assaults we're going to be getting
back<00:02:28.849> salt<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:29.329> that<00:02:29.450> we<00:02:29.540> can<00:02:29.689> continually

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
back salt so that we can continually

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.759 
back salt so that we can continually
cast<00:02:30.439> this<00:02:30.709> so<00:02:31.670> that<00:02:32.480> pretty<00:02:32.750> much<00:02:32.840> handles

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
cast this so that pretty much handles

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.470 
cast this so that pretty much handles
all<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.069> her<00:02:34.310> little<00:02:34.489> zombie<00:02:34.790> friends<00:02:35.209> just

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
all of her little zombie friends just

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.809 
all of her little zombie friends just
completely<00:02:35.959> on<00:02:36.079> its<00:02:36.319> own<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:37.040> then<00:02:37.519> aside

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
completely on its own and then aside

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.119 
completely on its own and then aside
from<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.000> it's<00:02:38.360> just<00:02:38.540> up<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:39.260> you

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
from that it's just up to you to you

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.350 
from that it's just up to you to you
know<00:02:40.190> every<00:02:40.430> time<00:02:40.579> she's<00:02:40.760> summoning<00:02:41.120> just

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
know every time she's summoning just

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.569 
know every time she's summoning just
drill<00:02:41.599> her<00:02:41.690> face<00:02:41.870> full<00:02:42.049> of<00:02:42.110> bullets<00:02:42.489> so<00:02:43.489> in

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
drill her face full of bullets so in

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.399 
drill her face full of bullets so in
terms<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.030> most<00:02:44.629> efficient<00:02:45.110> way<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.200> do

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
terms of the most efficient way to do

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.729 
terms of the most efficient way to do
this<00:02:45.590> what<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.489> found<00:02:47.180> worked<00:02:47.450> was<00:02:47.750> right<00:02:48.560> as

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
this what I found worked was right as

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.160 
this what I found worked was right as
she<00:02:49.030> begins<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.299> summon<00:02:50.629> up<00:02:50.720> for<00:02:50.900> group<00:02:51.019> of

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
she begins to summon up for group of

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.289 
she begins to summon up for group of
zombies<00:02:51.319> you<00:02:52.250> know<00:02:52.370> you're<00:02:52.549> going<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:52.909> gonna

zombies you know you're going to gonna

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.670 
zombies you know you're going to gonna
prime<00:02:53.540> your<00:02:53.690> bigger<00:02:53.870> trap<00:02:54.140> up<00:02:54.379> and<00:02:54.590> you're

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
prime your bigger trap up and you're

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.140 
prime your bigger trap up and you're
going<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:54.859> toss<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.069> like<00:02:55.609> pretty<00:02:56.000> much

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
going to toss that like pretty much

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.880 
going to toss that like pretty much

they're<00:03:39.770> not<00:03:39.860> all<00:03:40.100> one<00:03:40.310> rotation<00:03:40.610> so<00:03:41.050> it'll

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
they're not all one rotation so it'll

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.870 
they're not all one rotation so it'll
fix<00:03:42.470> around<00:03:42.620> five<00:03:42.920> minutes<00:03:43.130> but<00:03:43.580> you<00:03:43.610> got<00:03:43.790> to

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
fix around five minutes but you got to

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.420 
fix around five minutes but you got to
get<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.120> where<00:03:44.270> she's<00:03:45.230> you<00:03:45.709> know<00:03:45.800> staying<00:03:46.160> and

relatively on one place and continuing
to<00:03:48.769> raise<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:49.069> same<00:03:49.280> group<00:03:49.489> that<00:03:49.670> you<00:03:49.760> can

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940
