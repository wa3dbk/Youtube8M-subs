00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.890
 Some things at e3 2013 have us 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.049
 also a bit sad or 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.280
 disappointed and they are coming in now 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.559
 this video among others 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.510
 killer instinct the return of the 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.330
 legendary beat em ups comes exclusively 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.669
 for xbox one looks very well behaved 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.400
 Jerky but pretty much in the current 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.410
 version and what is very strange it is 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.060
 Although free but with a fighter 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.980
 and you have to buy more than the other 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.990
 dlc is so pass season and that sounded 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.919
 after rip-off sentences much better 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.340
 looks tearful 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.050
 from the frankfurter guys at crytek 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.940
 an impressive demo technology would like 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.820
 I say because I see a game here 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.680
 not yet the thing is very much based 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.030
 on quicktime events and how some 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.350
 people have noticed at the fair 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.770
 floor you do not even have to touch the keys 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.420
 to press 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.700
 the battles are practically automatic 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.040
 and that's me somewhere 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.900
 maybe far too dull maybe heard 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.490
 that to this new television streaming 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.530
 technology of the xbox compared but 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.840
 I like the scenario I have to do that 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.860
 already has something 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.900
 You can say something better because 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.670
 you think it was I played 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.170
 and that is the work one did not 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.929
 times as bad the racing game to start 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.700
 Unfortunately, ps 40 is currently seeing it in the 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.689
 playable version not so rudimentary 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.090
 like here in trader the 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.229
 edge shadows the shadows flicker 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.270
 details popping pure 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.219
 However, it was also the button on 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.499
 the screen alpha gameplay pre alpha 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.119
 gameplay 35 percent ready so hope 

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:29.149
 we're talking about the graphit tuning 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.399
 effortless provide otherwise continues saw namely 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.729
 otherwise something to the right or left 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.729
 past 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.160
 I was so happy and trials 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.100
 for all sorts of boxes and stuff and so 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.720
 then the new part is as much a part 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.940
 with stunts and stuff like that 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.770
 and I have to honestly say that 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.260
 Sounds like a lot of improvement to me 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.880
 great gameplay and I hope you can 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.170
 that can somehow turn off and that 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.729
 you do not do that much but that 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.130
 must make stuff but like the 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.720
 predecessors hard-hitting quite simply 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.540
 about as obstacles as always in English 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.520
 says drive and not more yours 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.850
 words thorsten in upper soft auditory there 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.850
 I am full 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.660
 more cool cool music cool generals 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.050
 and it should be command conquer or 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.180
 which unfortunately only in the game was synonymous 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.349
 at the really lousy e3 presentation 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.760
 there you were just in one 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.380
 ready-made game thrown 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.470
 there are orders to the game 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.390
 says not good at all you could 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.709
 with several fractions one complete 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.650
 play that was all so awful 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.480
 complicated and confusing that in the 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.170
 15 minutes just not fun fun 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.090
 arose 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.670
 then let's just hope it's on 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.840
 our stupidity lay on the e3 and 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.459
 not at the game itself that is so 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.420
 disappointing all went to really 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.850
 this is a bad presentation 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.830
 because it was just such a case 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.010
 where you are really happy as one 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.910
 schnitzel trailer over yes because namely 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.680
 still no other version than that 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.560
 mobile phone and iphone and so version of 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.750
 plants vs zombies 2 is announced and 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.730
 if there is nothing more so for pc mac 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.870
 and for all sorts of things that exist 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.640
 I get angry 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.470
 I also do not want free to play 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.000
 Plants vs Zombies in free to play game 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.709
 either a very long time or very much 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.150
 invest a healthy amount of money 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.709
 counted medium and I just want 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.780
 only my 20 corners or ten for that 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.290
 pay and have fun with it but not 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.360
 that yes 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.379
 By the way, mallorca has it as usual 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.019
 difficult to say why we like that 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.910
 Classify disappointment you just have to 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.459
 It sure is a cool game 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.190
 but for a long time so synonymous ne 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.019
 has emotionally plays to 300 times has 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.360
 The graphic has also been filled out 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.400
 300 years did not change that's it 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.049
 so not a bit poor but one 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.360
 bit difficult in this day and age for 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.680
 the roma can float it cook and on 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.510
 driving the wall long at the ceiling and 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.920
 under water so a bit 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.120
 But innovation is always practical 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.260
 Can you say for years 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.920
 Nineteen is always doing nintendo 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.269
 the same game and computer is the new one 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.920
 big will certainly be a solid game 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.360
 and remain very loyal to the series 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.400
 but in comparison to the many 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.959
 others shoot partly dramatically 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.840
 look better and sometimes dramatic 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.370
 innovative are the game 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.590
 stale than ever despite improved 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.190
 grafik engine yes there must be something else 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.200
 because otherwise it will be difficult against 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.690
 battlefield 4 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.350
 and generally difficult because you 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.210
 can not do the same stuff a thousand times 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.710
 out shape no matter how great looks like 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.210
 Geiler staged it I think 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.560
 will she still sell it? 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.610
 Millions of times and I said that 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.250
 entrain more players 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.539
 for you and the dog it has a dog 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.880
 which shooter does I have another dog? 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.990
 Please note the dog 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.849
 century german shepherd dog on 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.240
 The end I bet is as the 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.240
 German sheepdog
