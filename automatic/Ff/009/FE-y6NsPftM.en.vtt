about it let's get started the whole

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.140 
about it let's get started the whole
reason<00:00:26.160> we're<00:00:26.279> doing<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.910> create

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
reason we're doing this is to create

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.150 
reason we're doing this is to create
research<00:00:27.449> specimens<00:00:28.080> for<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> museum<00:00:28.920> that

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
research specimens for the museum that

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.040 
research specimens for the museum that
will<00:00:29.310> eventually<00:00:29.760> look<00:00:29.939> like<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.900> is

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
will eventually look like this this is

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.389 
will eventually look like this this is
what<00:00:31.170> we're<00:00:31.320> aiming<00:00:31.470> for<00:00:31.650> right<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> nice<00:00:32.189> nice

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
what we're aiming for right a nice nice

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.819 
what we're aiming for right a nice nice
steady<00:00:32.610> skin<00:00:32.850> just<00:00:33.180> look<00:00:33.450> sorry<00:00:33.840> bizarre<00:00:34.260> but

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
steady skin just look sorry bizarre but

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.470 
steady skin just look sorry bizarre but
there's<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.190> lot<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.520> stages<00:00:35.910> involved<00:00:36.180> in

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
there's a lot of stages involved in

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.990 
there's a lot of stages involved in
getting<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.110> sample<00:00:37.469> prepared<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.579> let's

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
getting this sample prepared so let's

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.220 
getting this sample prepared so let's
start<00:00:39.210> from<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> beginning<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.840> first<00:00:39.870> stage

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
start from the beginning the first stage

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.630 
start from the beginning the first stage
when<00:00:40.440> you're<00:00:40.530> making<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.829> museum<00:00:41.100> specimen<00:00:41.190> is

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
when you're making a museum specimen is

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.490 
when you're making a museum specimen is
the<00:00:41.790> data<00:00:42.000> stage<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.809> need<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.079> know<00:00:43.200> where

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the data stage you need to know where

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.139 
the data stage you need to know where
the<00:00:43.649> animal<00:00:43.950> came<00:00:44.100> from<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.489> don't<00:00:44.730> suppose<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
the animal came from I don't suppose the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.180 
the animal came from I don't suppose the
gas<00:00:45.300> station<00:00:45.750> sells<00:00:46.020> ice<00:00:46.230> do<00:00:46.559> they<00:00:46.710> yeah

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
gas station sells ice do they yeah

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.799 
gas station sells ice do they yeah
you've<00:00:47.489> got<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.760> figure<00:00:48.000> out<00:00:48.030> what<00:00:48.270> species<00:00:48.510> it

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
you've got to figure out what species it

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.049 
you've got to figure out what species it
is<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.379> these<00:00:49.590> are<00:00:49.800> both<00:00:49.950> fox<00:00:50.399> squirrels<00:00:50.820> take

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
is so these are both fox squirrels take

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.490 
is so these are both fox squirrels take
the<00:00:51.180> measurements<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.140> got<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.350> write

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the measurements and you got to write

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.990 
the measurements and you got to write
all<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.770> down<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.129> piece<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.340> paper<00:00:53.399> from

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
all this down on a piece of paper from

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.939 
all this down on a piece of paper from
there<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.539> got<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.780> cut<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> hole<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.770> belly

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
there you got to cut a hole in the belly

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:56.840 
there you got to cut a hole in the belly
right<00:00:56.460> here

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
right here

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.340 
right here
just<00:00:57.090> enough<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.600> can<00:00:57.750> get<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.050> skin

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
just enough that you can get the skin

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.049 
just enough that you can get the skin
and<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.680> start<00:00:58.920> pulling<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.370> off<00:00:59.489> usually

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and you can start pulling it off usually

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.880 
and you can start pulling it off usually
if<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.390> pinch<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.960> make<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> small

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
if you pinch it up you make like a small

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.240 
if you pinch it up you make like a small
cut<00:01:02.100> sideways<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.059> then<00:01:03.210> cut<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> side<00:01:04.320> so

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
cut sideways and then cut up the side so

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.940 
cut sideways and then cut up the side so
we're<00:01:05.460> making<00:01:05.640> our<00:01:05.909> initial<00:01:06.330> incision

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
we're making our initial incision

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.340 
we're making our initial incision
apparently<00:01:07.950> from<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.310> around<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.510> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
apparently from like around here to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.320 
apparently from like around here to
around<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.790> we're<00:01:11.909> gonna<00:01:12.000> turn<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
around here then we're gonna turn the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.179 
around here then we're gonna turn the
squirrel<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:14.600> then<00:01:15.600> start<00:01:16.320> turning<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
squirrel and then start turning the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.890 
squirrel and then start turning the
squirrel<00:01:17.490> inside<00:01:17.759> out<00:01:18.150> through<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.570> well

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
squirrel inside out through that well

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.840 
squirrel inside out through that well
let's<00:01:19.200> say<00:01:19.320> slippery<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:20.250> everything's

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
let's say slippery in here everything's

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.730 
let's say slippery in here everything's
kind<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.119> wet<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.720> kind<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.020> gooey<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
kind of wet in this kind of gooey so the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
kind of wet in this kind of gooey so the
cornmeal<00:01:23.130> creates<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.790> more<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.180> traction

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
cornmeal creates like more of a traction

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.120 
cornmeal creates like more of a traction
you<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.320> pretty<00:01:25.530> good<00:01:25.680> job<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.890> that

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
you have a pretty good job on that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.980 
you have a pretty good job on that
flying<00:01:26.400> squirrel<00:01:26.790> there<00:01:27.060> yeah<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.330> are<00:01:27.689> he's

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
flying squirrel there yeah you are he's

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.960 
flying squirrel there yeah you are he's
moving<00:01:28.350> pretty<00:01:28.380> quick<00:01:28.860> that's<00:01:29.310> now<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.820> this

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
moving pretty quick that's now is this

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.149 
moving pretty quick that's now is this
what<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> taxidermist<00:01:31.049> does<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.770> they<00:01:31.920> make<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
what a taxidermist does to they make a

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.770 
what a taxidermist does to they make a
little<00:01:32.369> tiny<00:01:32.640> hole<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:33.360> they<00:01:33.509> try<00:01:33.720> to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
little tiny hole and then they try to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.990 
little tiny hole and then they try to
pull<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.799> inside<00:01:34.920> out<00:01:35.250> or<00:01:35.430> they<00:01:35.520> make<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> bigger

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
a penis bone and that's what we're

a penis bone and that's what we're

with its skeleton that we want to

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.420 
with its skeleton that we want to

with<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:04.180> genitalia<00:02:04.630> but<00:02:04.930> in<00:02:05.200> some<00:02:05.440> ways<00:02:05.619> you

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
with the genitalia but in some ways you

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.680 
with the genitalia but in some ways you
have<00:02:05.830> this<00:02:06.130> external<00:02:06.970> feature<00:02:07.180> that<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:07.570> have

have this external feature that you have

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.300 
have this external feature that you have
to<00:02:07.810> get<00:02:07.930> around<00:02:08.140> but<00:02:08.289> once<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:08.560> get<00:02:08.679> inside

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310

I<00:02:09.340> think<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.179> male<00:02:10.360> reproductive<00:02:10.539> system<00:02:10.990> is

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
I think the male reproductive system is

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.670 
I think the male reproductive system is
a<00:02:11.440> bit<00:02:11.650> easier<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:12.040> really<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.840> interpret<00:02:14.440> and

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
a bit easier to really to interpret and

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.949 
a bit easier to really to interpret and
the<00:02:14.800> re<00:02:15.340> cutting<00:02:15.580> around<00:02:15.730> reasons<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.870> things

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
the re cutting around reasons and things

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.320 
the re cutting around reasons and things
like<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.260> in<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.500> show<00:02:17.700> all<00:02:18.700> around<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.209> go

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
like that in the show all around you go

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.030 
like that in the show all around you go
through<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.720> leg<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:20.440> get<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.680> other<00:02:20.830> leg

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
through the leg you get the other leg

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.770 
through the leg you get the other leg
out<00:02:21.220> I'm<00:02:21.730> pretty<00:02:21.910> proud<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.209> myself<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.600> I'm

side<00:03:21.160> in<00:03:21.400> so<00:03:21.670> that<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:21.880> now<00:03:22.060> can<00:03:22.120> see<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:22.810> fur

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
side in so that you now can see the fur

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.720 
side in so that you now can see the fur
the<00:03:22.989> animal<00:03:23.410> on<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.530> outside<00:03:23.890> cotton<00:03:24.610> on<00:03:24.700> the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
inside you sew up the holes on the belly

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.190 
inside you sew up the holes on the belly
in<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.220> mouth<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:28.060> put<00:03:28.269> little<00:03:28.480> rods<00:03:28.810> on

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200

the legs to keep the legs and the tail

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.270 
the legs to keep the legs and the tail
straight<00:03:30.940> stainless<00:03:31.390> steel<00:03:31.570> wire<00:03:31.780> we've

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
straight stainless steel wire we've

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.850 
straight stainless steel wire we've
threaded<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.630> up<00:03:34.630> above<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.230> cotton<00:03:35.680> and

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
threaded that up above the cotton and

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.770 
threaded that up above the cotton and
all<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.220> way<00:03:36.310> into<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.700> hand<00:03:36.940> so<00:03:37.360> we<00:03:37.480> sort<00:03:37.720> of

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
all the way into the hand so we sort of

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.810 
all the way into the hand so we sort of
have<00:03:37.959> like<00:03:37.989> it's<00:03:38.769> like<00:03:38.920> up<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.160> take<00:03:39.310> a<00:03:39.340> little

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
have like it's like up to take a little

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.430 
have like it's like up to take a little
puppet<00:03:40.239> bone<00:03:40.390> there<00:03:40.780> we<00:03:41.049> can<00:03:41.170> move<00:03:41.290> them

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
puppet bone there we can move them

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.710 
puppet bone there we can move them
around<00:03:41.500> with<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.100> step<00:03:42.670> where<00:03:43.060> your<00:03:43.329> animal

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
around with the step where your animal

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.910 
around with the step where your animal
might<00:03:43.870> look<00:03:44.019> really<00:03:44.320> good<00:03:44.440> or<00:03:44.590> really<00:03:44.620> bad

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
might look really good or really bad

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.039 
might look really good or really bad
depending<00:03:45.430> on<00:03:45.579> getting<00:03:46.269> that<00:03:46.360> stuffing<00:03:46.870> right

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
depending on getting that stuffing right

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.440 
depending on getting that stuffing right
this<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.650> where<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:48.489> experts<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.150> guys<00:03:49.299> that

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
this is where the experts the guys that

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.390 
this is where the experts the guys that
do<00:03:49.570> a<00:03:49.600> lot<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.290> are<00:03:50.620> really<00:03:50.650> really<00:03:51.190> good

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
do a lot of it are really really good

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.650 
do a lot of it are really really good
and<00:03:51.640> they<00:03:51.700> can<00:03:51.730> do<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.090> really<00:03:52.209> good<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.510> first

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
and they can do it really good the first

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.039 
and they can do it really good the first
time<00:03:52.810> very<00:03:53.769> difficult<00:03:54.430> so<00:03:55.120> we<00:03:55.329> just<00:03:55.510> went<00:03:55.750> and

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
time very difficult so we just went and

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.170 
time very difficult so we just went and
took<00:03:56.320> this<00:03:56.560> specimen<00:03:57.010> over<00:03:57.220> to<00:03:57.459> blow<00:03:57.700> some<00:03:57.970> air

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
took this specimen over to blow some air

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.660 
took this specimen over to blow some air
on<00:03:58.209> it

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
on it

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.520 
on it
and<00:03:58.760> add<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:59.000> little<00:03:59.240> additional<00:03:59.750> drying<00:04:00.110> agent

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
and add a little additional drying agent

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.680 
and add a little additional drying agent
so<00:04:01.010> what<00:04:01.190> we<00:04:01.340> ended<00:04:01.670> up<00:04:01.790> doing<00:04:01.849> is<00:04:02.300> getting<00:04:02.540> the

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
so what we ended up doing is getting the

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.870 
so what we ended up doing is getting the
air<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:03.140> kind<00:04:03.349> of<00:04:03.380> go<00:04:03.560> backwards<00:04:03.950> against<00:04:04.790> the

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
air to kind of go backwards against the

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.089 
air to kind of go backwards against the
green<00:04:05.060> of<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.300> hair<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:05.989> it<00:04:06.110> actually<00:04:06.590> dries

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
green of the hair and it actually dries

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.339 
green of the hair and it actually dries
the<00:04:07.370> skin<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:08.150> actually<00:04:08.660> fluffs<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.080> hair<00:04:09.230> up

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
the skin and actually fluffs the hair up

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.380 
the skin and actually fluffs the hair up
so<00:04:09.650> now<00:04:09.890> we<00:04:09.950> can<00:04:10.220> go<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.430> brush<00:04:10.640> back<00:04:10.880> over<00:04:11.270> it

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
so now we can go and brush back over it

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.990 
so now we can go and brush back over it
and<00:04:12.140> it<00:04:12.260> makes<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.650> skin<00:04:13.040> really<00:04:13.400> nice<00:04:13.730> and

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
and it makes the skin really nice and

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.150 
and it makes the skin really nice and
bright<00:04:14.209> but<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.840> big<00:04:15.020> thing<00:04:15.050> is<00:04:15.290> we<00:04:15.800> don't

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
bright but the big thing is we don't

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.150 
bright but the big thing is we don't
have<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.459> little<00:04:16.790> added<00:04:17.209> moisture<00:04:17.359> at<00:04:17.780> Greece

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
have a little added moisture at Greece

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.430 
have a little added moisture at Greece
when<00:04:19.160> we<00:04:19.280> have<00:04:19.549> it<00:04:19.700> in<00:04:19.790> a<00:04:19.880> collection<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:21.139> ears

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
when we have it in a collection the ears

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.409 
when we have it in a collection the ears
are<00:04:21.799> a<00:04:21.829> big<00:04:22.070> thing<00:04:22.310> if<00:04:22.430> I<00:04:22.520> let<00:04:22.730> this<00:04:22.880> out<00:04:23.090> it's

take some samples that they need to do

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.820 
take some samples that they need to do
tests<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.510> basically<00:04:50.930> use<00:04:51.229> this<00:04:51.410> animal<00:04:51.740> like

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
tests and basically use this animal like

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.190 
tests and basically use this animal like
a<00:04:51.860> time<00:04:52.160> machine<00:04:52.310> see<00:04:53.120> what<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.870> world<00:04:54.050> was

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
a time machine see what the world was

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.420 
a time machine see what the world was
like<00:04:54.260> in<00:04:54.620> 2014

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
like in 2014

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.600
