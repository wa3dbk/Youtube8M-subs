00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.610
 the rose is one of my favorite flowers 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.369
 for its simplicity and elegance is 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.420
 fantastic in a cupcake and very elegant 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.970
 on a wedding cake 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.700
 to do it is very simple just 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.460
 we should look at a natural rose and 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.900
 follow the movement of its petals 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.140
 among the materials that we need 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.930
 are a set of cutters in the shape of 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.150
 pink a bobbin stake that is going to 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.879
 allow to make the contours of the rose 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.520
 with movement and the paste or rubber 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.220
 model first we must choose the color 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.110
 of our rose so we're going to dye 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.490
 the modeling mass that comes in color 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.580
 White 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.010
 with a color food coloring 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.200
 of our preference be careful 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.430
 add the tone since most of the 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.220
 flowers are very soft 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.930
 we can go uniting tones on everything and 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.470
 make the center of the flower be 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.540
 dark and from grave to clear 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.480
 we stretch a roll to do the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.190
 center of the flower and we sharpen its edges 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.590
 so that it has the delicate finish of the 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.840
 pink 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.960
 then we roll it up and we have already achieved 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.680
 center 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.680
 Thank you 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.600
 then we will take into account the 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.270
 amount of petals that we are going to 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.650
 need and we're going to cut it with the 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.320
 cutters help 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.880
 always fine-tuning the edges that are going to 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.880
 give the movement to the flower 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.720
 in each of these lines we are going 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.120
 putting together and we can help with paper 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.550
 aluminum to achieve that the petals are 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.500
 keep in the place we want before 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.230
 to dry 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.570
 once finished our flower we can 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.440
 Apply loose colors to give it a 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.440
 more natural finish
