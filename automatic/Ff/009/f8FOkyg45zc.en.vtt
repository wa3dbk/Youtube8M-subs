00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
in the Detroit area so I came and I

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
now I think I made a good decision

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.180 
now I think I made a good decision
because<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> clinical<00:00:49.680> training

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.650 
because I think the clinical training
that<00:00:50.460> I've<00:00:50.579> received<00:00:50.730> over<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.510> really

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.660 
know I don't know anything and in this
program<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.570> think<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.930> was<00:01:13.110> very

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
program here I think I was very

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.219 
program here I think I was very
supported<00:01:14.670> by<00:01:14.820> my<00:01:15.030> senior<00:01:15.390> fellow<00:01:15.630> supported

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229

by the staff who are really very

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.880 
by the staff who are really very
approachable<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> very<00:01:19.530> strong

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
approachable we have a very strong

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.770 
approachable we have a very strong
didactic<00:01:20.520> schedule<00:01:20.939> over<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> think

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
didactic schedule over here and I think

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.810 
didactic schedule over here and I think
that<00:01:21.960> really<00:01:22.229> helps<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.220> daily<00:01:23.610> lectures

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
that really helps the daily lectures

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.149 
that really helps the daily lectures
that<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.780> helps<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.200> your<00:01:25.530> learning<00:01:25.979> and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
that really helps with your learning and

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.039 
that really helps with your learning and
I<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:26.729> by<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.119> end<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.450> your<00:01:27.570> first<00:01:27.869> year

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
I think by the end of your first year

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.520 
I think by the end of your first year
you<00:01:28.770> feel<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.250> whole<00:01:29.549> lot<00:01:29.759> more<00:01:30.509> confident<00:01:31.290> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
you feel a whole lot more confident and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.230 
you feel a whole lot more confident and
as<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> second<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.670> authority<00:01:33.030> or<00:01:33.119> your

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
as a second and authority or your

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.840 
as a second and authority or your
schedules<00:01:33.720> much<00:01:34.530> easier<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.549> little

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
schedules much easier you have a little

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.550 
schedules much easier you have a little
more<00:01:36.030> control<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.900> you're<00:01:37.049> doing<00:01:37.170> less

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
more control on it you're doing less

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.480 
more control on it you're doing less
call<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.880> yeah<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> think<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:40.979> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
call and so yeah I think that we have a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.969 
call and so yeah I think that we have a
lot<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.150> time<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.540> spend<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:43.200> my<00:01:43.560> younger

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
lot of time to spend with my younger

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.380 
lot of time to spend with my younger
kids<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.549> spend<00:01:45.360> with<00:01:45.479> family<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.899> think<00:01:46.229> you

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
kids and spend with family I think you

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.030

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
in our fellowship as compared to what my

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.300 
in our fellowship as compared to what my

friends talked about and other

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.130 
friends talked about and other
fellowships<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.750> level<00:01:58.049> of

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
fellowships is that the level of

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.980 
fellowships is that the level of
camaraderie<00:01:58.439> here<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.280> really<00:01:59.430> high<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.030> we

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
camaraderie here is really high and we

camaraderie here is really high and we
are
