00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.090 
difficult Austin
I think<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.210> Americans<00:02:44.720> this<00:02:44.900> time<00:02:45.170> will<00:02:45.920> not

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
I think the Americans this time will not

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.260 
I think the Americans this time will not
be<00:02:46.160> lets<00:02:46.970> say<00:02:48.130> rookie<00:02:49.130> method<00:02:49.490> sa<00:02:49.820> as<00:02:50.030> in<00:02:50.180> the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
be lets say rookie method sa as in the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.790 
be lets say rookie method sa as in the
last<00:02:50.420> world<00:02:50.750> championship<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:51.350> think<00:02:51.740> they

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
last world championship I think they

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.250 
last world championship I think they
will<00:02:51.980> be<00:02:52.100> ready<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.490> win<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:52.910> I<00:02:53.480> think<00:02:54.170> they

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
will be ready to win and I think they

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.930 
will be ready to win and I think they
would<00:02:54.410> be<00:02:54.530> more<00:02:54.770> prepared<00:02:54.950> as<00:02:55.520> for<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.850> other

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
would be more prepared as for the other

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.100 
would be more prepared as for the other
teams<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.300> think<00:02:56.330> they<00:02:56.570> will<00:02:56.720> play<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.930> the

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
teams I think they will play to the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.110 
teams I think they will play to the
second<00:02:57.440> place<00:02:57.590> is<00:02:57.770> upon<00:02:58.130> us<00:02:58.160> that's<00:02:58.910> great
