military system what exactly does this

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.470 
military system what exactly does this
mean<00:00:24.070> what<00:00:25.070> distinguishes<00:00:25.489> it<00:00:26.000> from<00:00:26.029> the

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
mean what distinguishes it from the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.519 
mean what distinguishes it from the
previous<00:00:26.960> game<00:00:27.279> 1701<00:00:28.279> ad<00:00:28.989> we<00:00:29.989> asked<00:00:30.199> Dirk

previous game 1701 ad we asked Dirk

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.589 
previous game 1701 ad we asked Dirk
regard<00:00:30.980> to<00:00:31.220> answer<00:00:31.640> this<00:00:31.849> interesting

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
regard to answer this interesting

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.369 
regard to answer this interesting
question<00:00:33.699> in<00:00:34.699> the<00:00:35.090> previous<00:00:35.329> owner<00:00:35.629> games<00:00:35.930> the

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
question in the previous owner games the

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.250 
question in the previous owner games the
player<00:00:36.500> was<00:00:37.370> commanding<00:00:38.300> single<00:00:38.720> units<00:00:39.050> but

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
player was commanding single units but

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.069 
player was commanding single units but
that<00:00:39.739> was<00:00:39.920> a<00:00:39.949> problem<00:00:40.309> because<00:00:41.000> I<00:00:41.480> know<00:00:41.629> is<00:00:41.809> a

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
that was a problem because I know is a

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.069 
that was a problem because I know is a
building<00:00:42.589> game<00:00:43.010> so<00:00:43.699> the<00:00:44.120> units<00:00:44.390> got<00:00:44.570> lost<00:00:44.809> you

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
building game so the units got lost you

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.380 
building game so the units got lost you
could<00:00:45.500> not<00:00:45.649> find<00:00:45.920> them<00:00:46.159> it<00:00:46.489> was<00:00:46.670> to<00:00:46.850> tactical

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
could not find them it was to tactical

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.630 
could not find them it was to tactical
so<00:00:47.659> this<00:00:47.870> time<00:00:48.079> we<00:00:48.470> choose<00:00:49.010> a<00:00:49.280> more<00:00:49.460> strategic

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
so this time we choose a more strategic

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.320 
so this time we choose a more strategic
approach<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:51.320> player<00:00:51.530> builds

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
approach the player builds

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
approach the player builds
infrastructure<00:00:53.409> and<00:00:54.820> encampments<00:00:55.820> and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
infrastructure and encampments and

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.549 
infrastructure and encampments and
cannon<00:00:57.350> positions<00:00:57.769> and<00:00:57.920> stuff<00:00:58.009> like<00:00:58.250> that

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
cannon positions and stuff like that

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.679 
cannon positions and stuff like that
okay<00:01:00.559> but<00:01:01.070> which<00:01:01.369> tactical<00:01:02.000> options<00:01:02.180> does

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:02.689 
okay but which tactical options does

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:04.630 
okay but which tactical options does
this<00:01:02.960> military<00:01:03.409> system<00:01:03.920> provide<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.430> player

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
this military system provide the player

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.910 
this military system provide the player
with<00:01:04.970> which<00:01:05.570> units<00:01:06.020> does<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.380> player<00:01:06.590> have

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
with which units does the player have

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.530 
with which units does the player have
and<00:01:07.220> what<00:01:07.549> role<00:01:07.759> do<00:01:07.939> they<00:01:07.970> play<00:01:08.090> in<00:01:08.450> the

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
and what role do they play in the

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.109 
and what role do they play in the
battles<00:01:08.930> digging<00:01:09.740> deeper<00:01:09.770> Dirk<00:01:10.520> we<00:01:10.759> got<00:01:10.939> as

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
battles digging deeper Dirk we got as

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.060 
battles digging deeper Dirk we got as
the<00:01:11.180> facts<00:01:12.670> so<00:01:13.689> the<00:01:14.689> most<00:01:15.020> refugee<00:01:15.500> approaches

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
the facts so the most refugee approaches

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.420 
the facts so the most refugee approaches
that<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.400> player<00:01:16.610> is<00:01:17.270> able<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:18.020> build

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
that the player is able to build

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.179 
that the player is able to build
military<00:01:19.430> structures<00:01:20.420> like<00:01:21.079> encampments<00:01:22.009> and

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
military structures like encampments and

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.730 
military structures like encampments and
then<00:01:22.670> he<00:01:23.000> can<00:01:23.150> give<00:01:23.390> them<00:01:23.689> those<00:01:24.200> encampment

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
then he can give them those encampment

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.349 
then he can give them those encampment
strategic<00:01:25.159> orders<00:01:25.520> like<00:01:26.170> attack<00:01:27.170> opponents

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
strategic orders like attack opponents

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:33.520 
strategic orders like attack opponents
break<00:01:29.359> down<00:01:29.630> walls<00:01:30.700> defend<00:01:31.700> yourself<00:01:32.469> go<00:01:33.469> to

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
break down walls defend yourself go to

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.379 
break down walls defend yourself go to
another<00:01:33.710> place<00:01:34.039> and<00:01:34.609> stuff<00:01:34.819> like<00:01:34.969> that<00:01:35.030> so

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:35.389 
another place and stuff like that so

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:39.789 
another place and stuff like that so
it's<00:01:35.869> more<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.079> strategic<00:01:37.240> level<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.719> not<00:01:39.590> so

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
it's more a strategic level and not so

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.700 
it's more a strategic level and not so
much<00:01:39.829> technical<00:01:40.310> autos<00:01:40.759> for<00:01:41.350> single<00:01:42.350> units

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
much technical autos for single units

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.440 
much technical autos for single units
because<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.460> size<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.939> game<00:01:44.090> is<00:01:44.240> bigger

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
because the size of the game is bigger

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.050 
because the size of the game is bigger
and<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.530> scope<00:01:45.799> of<00:01:46.039> the<00:01:46.369> player<00:01:46.579> has<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:46.880> be

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
and so the scope of the player has to be

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.109 
and so the scope of the player has to be
bigger<00:01:47.299> too<00:01:47.859> now<00:01:48.859> we<00:01:48.920> know<00:01:49.369> what<00:01:49.549> we<00:01:49.700> need<00:01:49.880> to

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
bigger too now we know what we need to

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.209 
bigger too now we know what we need to
do<00:01:50.299> with<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:50.659> enemy<00:01:50.840> attacks<00:01:51.409> but<00:01:51.950> how<00:01:52.159> can

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
do with the enemy attacks but how can

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.209 
do with the enemy attacks but how can
you<00:01:52.490> protect<00:01:52.700> your<00:01:53.060> city<00:01:53.359> from<00:01:53.630> invaders

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
you protect your city from invaders

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.090 
you protect your city from invaders
