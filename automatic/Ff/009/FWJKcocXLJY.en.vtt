00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.930
 this is the pro installation of weapons 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.930
 2011 the operatives of 64 and 7 32 bits 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.470
 as you can see today we are going to start with 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.430
 The installation of 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:19.430
 the foundation that gave its main headquarters 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.770
 which is relieved 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.240
 green then we will install with 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.530
 right behind the shakhtar that was 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.530
 stored inside your folder 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.200
 we started that they grab that you can the 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.200
 installation 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.130
 and we started to try the next one we accept 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.090
 the installation license 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.950
 we give next again and we really go 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.950
 to install impact 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.520
 there we let the process of 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.230
 installation happen in the status was already 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.739
 definitive when the 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.739
 installation 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.309
 must take into account the installation of 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.020
 truth is that just like there we left 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.970
 effectively disconnected from interest 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.550
 ends, we are going to finish 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.090
 after finishing the foundation we are going to 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.159
 install the gear base then in 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.439
 this one of the imas let's double click 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.610
 and we started to see that normal installation 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.310
 like any other pack 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.940
 unless some patience as the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.180
 software for being quite big is going to 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.230
 take a significant time in 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.130
 boost the installation within 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.130
 our laptop 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.250
 just let the next accept 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.370
 license the software 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.020
 let's say next again 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.420
 here we must select all the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.130
 extensions that we are going to use or 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.470
 simply is to use only 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.820
 the basis of the best in this case I'm going to 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.560
 select the entire license of 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.720
 remember that this process of 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.350
 installation will have all the 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.140
 licenses running and they will be 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.300
 viable to use in the cracking process 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.690
 So, all license, I'm going to 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.069
 use those that will need nothing 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.530
 more but since the selection of all 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.430
 to verify that the installation 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.440
 it really works with all 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.150
 parameters then it starts to do 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.150
 the installation really 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.439
 good finished the installation really 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.299
 we will select all formats 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.670
 that are going to be read by the software 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.739
 it is here we select all since what 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.960
 I'm going to need everyone to subtract serian 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.720
 of 1 1 now let's install a text 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.720
 what is a kind of patch service pack 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.400
 for nose for the main software 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.590
 with an update that came out 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.590
 after the first package 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.720
 we hope you unpack the package 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.290
 and the installation process begins 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.780
 normal as the previous steps 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.730
 so 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:38.080
 we're just going to give it next 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.720
 next tells us to be the aggregate 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.680
 we accept the license next again and 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.680
 we install the package 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.090
 it will validate the normal installation as 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.129
 can be and end let's say there's 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.069
 finished the installation and now if 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:14.680
 we started with the cracking process 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.039
 then we are going to open two windows one 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.870
 with the crack installer and another where 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.240
 we are going to deposit then between the 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.370
 pascual crack we have the folder that 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.039
 call truth of this we are going to hit on 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.590
 the root of green cee and we are going to tell you 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:32.070
 that combines one folder with the other 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.250
 we give that since all the files 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.380
 common are replaced ok then 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:43.229
 we have replaced the first step now 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.229
 the second step is within the folder 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.740
 license pads we have 16 win win 32 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.960
 then within windows 22 release 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.510
 let's open files erdas point age 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.550
 with notepad with not pad 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.460
 world for the software that you 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.020
 point wish to edit then 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.220
 where was the name going to place the 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.540
 name of our pc which 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.160
 we find in the properties of 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.620
 team then as I indicated it 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:13.160
 equipment properties and fears appear 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:16.010
 Jota Calvache and a half floor 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.370
 written and save the file and the 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:22.310
 selection irons or all this 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:26.289
 own and I'll place that 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:29.110
 x86 country program really follow 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:32.210
 license bean 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.620
 win32 release and I'm going to stick it there I'm going to 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.350
 replace all files that are 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.550
 common within each of the two 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.610
 places where I'm moving the 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.690
 information 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.460
 perfectly has already installed and now 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.650
 we will run the license m3 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.050
 point of thundering goats that we replace 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.340
 this license appears now let's 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.620
 create the service configuration 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.300
 many of us can not have the license 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.830
 loaded between them in the service name 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.500
 we can place the name but here 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.420
 we will now load the executable would 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.670
 no problem before is where 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:05.990
 we had replace the files we're going to 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:08.240
 fall file in byn win32 gray the mgr 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.039
 from the ex point and that is 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.229
 about where you are going to make the license 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.120
 then we are going to add the file of 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.500
 license is not a point diction point 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.419
 we change the file type 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.970
 we select and we have to create a 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:23.090
 file point log then achieves with 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.130
 amber notebook the extension and you 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.229
 changed the extension of txt blog now 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.930
 no problem we remove 6 the wakeboard 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:31.910
 check and check to start at 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.130
 principle we keep the services and in 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.680
 start stop release read start server 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.479
 there will start loading the license of 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.949
 working after having loaded 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:43.930
 license and operation we are going to 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:46.750
 start progressing variations start you're 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.650
 the snr license and we will execute as 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.780
 administrator 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:54.680
 the license manager Green 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:58.729
 2011 then there it will take a little bit in 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.199
 start and we have not closed the lr of 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:02.479
 point says we've had 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:04.330
 previously elements then 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:06.189
 elements 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.819
 the characteristics does not appreciate a 

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:11.020
 ip address that would be the server 

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:13.840
 fictitious intel let's copy that and 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:17.050
 let's write the port that appears 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.340
 then we give ok and start to 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.319
 start the service through is 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.830
 Haitian and that agreement that we have 

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:25.599
 configured then there we can already 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.830
 say that the service has been 

00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:30.009
 configured has not been any 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:34.030
 inconvenient and we're going to start the base 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:39.090
 main of bards and machine and as 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:42.000
 they can see the installation in the past 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:44.160
 boots perfectly and works with 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.270
 all the extensions that we tested it on 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.270
 a few previous steps 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.990
 and there we have gas installed and more 

00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:00.150
 2011 with all the functionalities of 

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:03.349
 the extensions does not present any 

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.349
 conflict with aries
