00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:05.109

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.919
 Morente we warned the others last time Goth 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:13.619
 + there and have already given ready opponents I have time once existed 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.289
 Found settlements and I'll read now that's ten pages long 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.749
 is and still sides with actually times 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.300
 Percentage point who wants to hear that 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.849
 December not 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.900
 I'll really just read this book in this part and then right after that 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.489
 to do on average and 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.500
 in the next part crowds or further that does not want to hear the 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.560
 May be the next few days from Gian 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.130
 when he is already up 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.640
 the white narratives of the blessed all Alex yes I have to but mine 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.640
 Narrator's voice setting RM 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.550
 Andras same US fund so great 7 and the Scripps 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.840
 the boy was so mad she saw 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.490
 around the individual eggs Mienenspiel small number of scripts in a deep 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.800
 shaft 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.330
 he began throwing stones at her and chuckled maliciously as she did so 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.820
 Startled apart, one cancer struck his head into the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.820
 Squire praise and so she begged him 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.310
 please have mercy 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.409
 the little boy because what is for you only sport is for us and stays 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.740
 Todd 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.300
 and so from Sutter 7 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.070
 that is a mere amusement 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.430
 that others are in agony 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.799
 the parable of First acts like and the contentious beasts 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.820
 One thing seems clear and a calf Guti stalked on it in a year before and 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.820
 The other one promptly pulled lakes out of the dirt 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.480
 you are warmly experiencing the creature 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.950
 said the Schalke in part well 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.130
 No 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.390
 so the ugliest life of the creature blows 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.720
 since the illness occurs write 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.120
 because both were convinced 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.790
 he is beautiful even among others from the bottom deeply ugly 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.470
 then it came clear how to fill the way these ways is to draw their quarrel 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.519
 you are both the ugliest living creature and 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:14.329
 and I will 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:18.739
 Do not take a pleasant stay here by expensive indecent squabbling 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.719
 let spoil 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:24.230
 So he distributed at the mighty blows 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.410
 the director and missed and 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.970
 made her quarrel his hands and chin months of his way 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.929
 and so this is true for her way 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:35.479
 the ugliness not only in appearance 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.479
 but also by finding him 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.479
 wod weak 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.279
 dpa on the floor 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:48.340
 what are the stories Walter Alter but I stand I know already 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.760
 here for example last year but I'm very proud of 000 last year is there 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.499
 it in a mountain and 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:55.909
 Aroha sometimes but off and the percent 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.119
 Striker Raul Bobadilla but the MacBook flows APA per year 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.599
 I noticed that the 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.200
 So goes on and the high-tech and the Call Guti 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.249
 it is said that the handlebar cooks well in a still and puddle kicks 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:14.249
 immediately jump out again to protect yourself from harm 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.930
 but if he can stand well in a pool and a magician very gradually 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.059
 Gradually, its temperature increases to the boiling point 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:26.809
 Whittaker Group who stay in place until cooked 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:31.149
 this shows us that we have not only driven obvious 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:32.560
 have to be vigilant 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.569
 but also the fine gradations opposite 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.659
 the one harmless is action to danger 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:42.469
 the dubious healer 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.519
 Once upon a time there was a small van NEK 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.130
 who came out of his gate and announced to the whole world 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.060
 rather 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.939
 a powerful and scholar Heller 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.050
 a master of the whole as Amy under tears ca 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.929
 we have no illnesses to cure 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:04:01.649
 Christie Weg observed the in listening to his boasting and asks in Bern 

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:05.549
 how did you pretend to heal others of all illnesses 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:06.199
 can 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.999
 if he does not even tell yourselves of EUR on the knowledgeable arrogance and stupidity 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.609
 Can share 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.229
 Neumann 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:17.590
 why the clever crabs 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.859
 the TuRa were so tormented by other creatures 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.859
 that they did not know where to look anymore 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.090
 as soon as they even one single animal late that approached them 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.199
 they panicked in panic 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.010
 One day they saw a pack roaming around listening round 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.030
 and ran in desperate panic towards more determined rather 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.360
 to drown himself 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.360
 to continue to live in this unpleasant state of anxiety 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.180
 as they approached the shoreline 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.740
 for a colony of mud crawling in turn scared by the 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.870
 was almost NGO and threw himself into the water 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.360
 Weidig said Aigner coach 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.249
 Things are not as bad as they seem 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:01.619
 because there is always someone who is worse off than you 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.590
 Zoe 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.419
 last story 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.860
 the wounded match 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.110
 a wonderfull match 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.029
 why the ticket sale 100 percent 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:15.000
 teasing 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.030
 did not settle into any I suppose that it is not difficult or MAK Med 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.229
 they may be back with you 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.699
 with approximately 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.909
 a bewildered bond he says 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.729
 I just had wonderful 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.550
 puzzled by 11 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.699
 a hawk Steinfeld an injured match 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.780
 lay down in a quiet corner of his photo space 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:42.769
 Senna's fallen companion names came in large numbers to follow his 

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:45.360
 To inquire about health status 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.360
 However, this did not stop each one of them from being here 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.830
 to serve the match spread photo 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.569
 so that the net strong and not at his wounds but at the greed and 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.300
 Negligence of his former friends 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.160
 and so is the thoughtless fellow on more harm than help 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:03.309
 can bring 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:04.879
 so we have 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:05.699
 this 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.699
 read meaningless book 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.970
 Percent I make a cut and see you in the next games we play 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.120
 continue until rushes
