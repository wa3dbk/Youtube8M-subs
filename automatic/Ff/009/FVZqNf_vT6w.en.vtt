okay it's pretty simple - all you do is
that<00:05:08.240> the<00:05:08.360> other<00:05:08.600> wave<00:05:09.200> move<00:05:09.680> one<00:05:10.070> except<00:05:10.910> this

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
that the other wave move one except this

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:18.820 
that the other wave move one except this
with<00:05:11.360> one<00:05:11.570> hand<00:05:11.600> so<00:05:12.170> you<00:05:12.290> go<00:05:12.470> 1<00:05:13.510> 2<00:05:14.510> 3<00:05:15.370> 4<00:05:17.710> it's<00:05:18.710> the
