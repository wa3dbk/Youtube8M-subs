was<00:03:57.769> my<00:03:57.890> first<00:03:58.099> attacking<00:03:58.939> game<00:03:59.120> on<00:03:59.360> this<00:03:59.569> map

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
was my first attacking game on this map

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.050 
was my first attacking game on this map
so<00:04:00.110> not<00:04:00.799> a<00:04:00.829> hum<00:04:00.980> %<00:04:01.250> sure<00:04:01.310> where<00:04:01.610> everything<00:04:01.879> is

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
so not a hum % sure where everything is

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.910 
so not a hum % sure where everything is
but<00:04:02.269> getting<00:04:02.599> used<00:04:02.750> to<00:04:02.810> it<00:04:02.930> anyway<00:04:03.560> back<00:04:03.769> to

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
but getting used to it anyway back to

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.589 
but getting used to it anyway back to
the<00:04:04.010> gun<00:04:04.159> it's<00:04:04.459> it<00:04:04.849> isn't<00:04:04.970> medium-range<00:04:05.390> like

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
the gun it's it isn't medium-range like

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.449 
the gun it's it isn't medium-range like
I<00:04:05.689> said<00:04:05.930> it<00:04:06.110> will<00:04:06.439> get<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.650> job<00:04:06.829> done<00:04:06.890> at<00:04:07.400> all

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
I said it will get the job done at all

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.850 
I said it will get the job done at all
distances<00:04:07.760> it's<00:04:08.629> not<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.810> limited<00:04:09.500> like<00:04:09.680> some

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
distances it's not a limited like some

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.259 
distances it's not a limited like some
guns<00:04:10.069> or<00:04:10.220> you<00:04:10.310> know<00:04:10.430> a<00:04:10.459> lot<00:04:10.670> better<00:04:10.790> shorter

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
guns or you know a lot better shorter

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.789 
guns or you know a lot better shorter
long-range<00:04:11.900> so<00:04:12.409> one<00:04:12.500> good<00:04:12.650> thing<00:04:12.680> about

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
long-range so one good thing about

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.500 
long-range so one good thing about
medium-range<00:04:13.340> guns<00:04:13.610> is<00:04:13.819> they<00:04:13.970> thrive<00:04:14.299> in

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
medium-range guns is they thrive in

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.870 
medium-range guns is they thrive in
medium<00:04:14.780> range<00:04:15.019> but<00:04:15.260> they<00:04:15.439> can<00:04:15.620> work<00:04:15.829> it<00:04:16.070> short

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
medium range but they can work it short

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.879 
medium range but they can work it short
and<00:04:17.030> long<00:04:17.180> ranges<00:04:17.570> so<00:04:17.810> that's<00:04:18.410> kind<00:04:18.560> of<00:04:18.590> my<00:04:18.709> gun

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
and long ranges so that's kind of my gun

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.740 
and long ranges so that's kind of my gun
of<00:04:18.979> choice<00:04:19.009> I<00:04:19.579> like<00:04:20.060> to<00:04:20.209> have<00:04:20.329> a<00:04:20.359> gun<00:04:20.539> that's

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
of choice I like to have a gun that's

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.749 
of choice I like to have a gun that's
all<00:04:21.320> around<00:04:21.680> good<00:04:21.979> and<00:04:22.220> not<00:04:22.340> just<00:04:22.550> good<00:04:22.729> for

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:22.759 
all around good and not just good for

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.670 
all around good and not just good for
one<00:04:23.240> certain<00:04:23.539> thing<00:04:23.570> unless<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:24.080> wanna<00:04:24.560> run

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
one certain thing unless you wanna run

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.310 
one certain thing unless you wanna run
something<00:04:24.800> like<00:04:24.889> a<00:04:24.979> shotgun<00:04:25.539> it's<00:04:26.539> got<00:04:26.660> a<00:04:26.690> 650

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
something like a shotgun it's got a 650

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.800 
something like a shotgun it's got a 650
rounds<00:04:28.130> per<00:04:28.370> minute<00:04:28.460> fire<00:04:28.850> rate<00:04:29.150> that's

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
rounds per minute fire rate that's

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.350 
rounds per minute fire rate that's
that's<00:04:30.169> not<00:04:30.320> real<00:04:30.770> fast<00:04:31.160> that's<00:04:31.490> bout<00:04:32.030> I<00:04:32.210> think

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
that's not real fast that's bout I think

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.150 
that's not real fast that's bout I think
it's<00:04:32.449> about<00:04:32.510> in<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.690> middle<00:04:32.870> as<00:04:33.530> far<00:04:33.800> as<00:04:33.949> all

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
it's about in the middle as far as all

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.000 
it's about in the middle as far as all
the<00:04:34.280> guns<00:04:34.490> in<00:04:34.699> battlefield<00:04:35.120> 3<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.810> don't<00:04:36.800> think

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
the guns in battlefield 3 I don't think

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.469 
the guns in battlefield 3 I don't think
I<00:04:37.580> think<00:04:37.789> that<00:04:37.910> that's<00:04:37.970> about<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.300> middle

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
I think that that's about the middle

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.170 
I think that that's about the middle
it's<00:04:38.720> nothing<00:04:39.440> compared<00:04:39.770> to<00:04:39.919> the<00:04:40.160> famas<00:04:40.940> which

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
it's nothing compared to the famas which

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.750 
it's nothing compared to the famas which
I<00:04:41.270> posted<00:04:41.720> in<00:04:41.870> a<00:04:41.990> previous<00:04:42.410> video<00:04:42.710> famas<00:04:43.580> has

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
I posted in a previous video famas has

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.790 
I posted in a previous video famas has
got<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:43.910> 900<00:04:44.660> rounds<00:04:44.990> per<00:04:45.199> minute<00:04:45.260> fire<00:04:45.590> rate

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.950 
got a 900 rounds per minute fire rate
and<00:04:45.949> that<00:04:46.010> thing<00:04:46.280> just<00:04:46.460> go<00:04:47.270> stirs<00:04:47.510> bullets

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
and that thing just go stirs bullets

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.960 
and that thing just go stirs bullets
extremely<00:04:48.770> fast<00:04:49.010> which<00:04:49.250> is<00:04:49.280> it's<00:04:49.639> funny<00:04:49.849> you

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
extremely fast which is it's funny you

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.159 
extremely fast which is it's funny you
know<00:04:50.030> fun<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.330> play<00:04:50.449> with<00:04:50.510> the<00:04:50.599> drill<00:04:50.780> powerful

but it also burns through your boat so
quick<00:04:53.240> that<00:04:53.479> you<00:04:54.080> got<00:04:54.199> to<00:04:54.289> reload<00:04:54.650> sometimes

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
quick that you got to reload sometimes

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.779 
quick that you got to reload sometimes
before<00:04:56.060> you<00:04:56.449> may<00:04:56.599> have<00:04:56.720> doubted<00:04:56.840> enemy<00:04:57.320> so<00:04:57.789> one

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
before you may have doubted enemy so one

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.159 
before you may have doubted enemy so one
reason<00:04:59.030> i<00:04:59.060> like<00:04:59.210> this<00:04:59.360> gun<00:04:59.539> is<00:04:59.570> it<00:04:59.840> does<00:04:59.960> have<00:05:00.139> a

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
reason i like this gun is it does have a

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:01.480 
reason i like this gun is it does have a
lot<00:05:00.380> of<00:05:00.410> bullets<00:05:00.710> in<00:05:00.800> the<00:05:00.860> clip<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.280> rounds

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
lot of bullets in the clip the rounds

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.219 
lot of bullets in the clip the rounds
per<00:05:01.580> minute<00:05:01.669> is<00:05:01.940> fast<00:05:02.690> enough<00:05:02.840> to<00:05:03.020> get<00:05:03.110> the<00:05:03.199> job

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
per minute is fast enough to get the job

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.379 
per minute is fast enough to get the job
done<00:05:03.470> but<00:05:04.310> you<00:05:04.460> won't<00:05:04.639> burn<00:05:04.849> through<00:05:05.090> bullets

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
done but you won't burn through bullets
