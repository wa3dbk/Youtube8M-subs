all um but with the front shuv it's a
little<00:02:06.540> bit<00:02:06.659> different<00:02:07.079> anyways<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:08.189> kind<00:02:08.519> of

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.929 
little bit different anyways you kind of
have<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.819> pop<00:02:09.239> more<00:02:09.509> straight<00:02:10.049> down<00:02:10.939> recently

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:11.939 
have to pop more straight down recently

I've been working on doing pop shuvit
that<00:02:18.060> go<00:02:18.209> forward<00:02:18.900> like<00:02:19.590> putting<00:02:20.280> myself<00:02:20.459> in

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
that go forward like putting myself in

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.460 
that go forward like putting myself in
front<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.269> crack<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:21.870> doing<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.260> pop

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
front of a crack and doing a pop

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.500 
front of a crack and doing a pop
shove-it<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.459> even<00:02:23.760> though<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:24.060> board<00:02:24.329> is

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
shove-it that even though the board is

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.600 
shove-it that even though the board is
it<00:02:24.840> would<00:02:25.200> normally<00:02:25.439> go<00:02:25.860> behind<00:02:26.310> me<00:02:26.489> it

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
it would normally go behind me it

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.880 
it would normally go behind me it
actually<00:02:26.760> goes<00:02:27.120> forward<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.959> actually<00:02:28.349> jumps

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
actually goes forward and actually jumps

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.339 
actually goes forward and actually jumps
over<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.519> crack<00:02:29.849> I'll<00:02:30.840> have<00:02:31.049> to<00:02:31.170> demonstrate

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
over the crack I'll have to demonstrate

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.380 
over the crack I'll have to demonstrate
that<00:02:31.860> sometime<00:02:32.370> maybe<00:02:32.640> I'll<00:02:32.790> make<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:33.000> full

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
that sometime maybe I'll make a full

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.710 
that sometime maybe I'll make a full
video<00:02:33.810> on<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.290> but<00:02:34.920> anyways<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.970> way<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.209> do

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
video on it but anyways the way to do

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.960 
video on it but anyways the way to do
this<00:02:36.989> is<00:02:37.290> actually<00:02:38.099> it's<00:02:38.280> all<00:02:38.459> in<00:02:38.610> your<00:02:38.640> back

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
foot and it's a way that you pop

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.410 
foot and it's a way that you pop
straight<00:02:42.120> down<00:02:42.690> um<00:02:43.549> you<00:02:44.549> like<00:02:45.030> look<00:02:45.180> at<00:02:45.299> my

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
only on the board practiced popping

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.890 
only on the board practiced popping

nudging forward slightly and once you
get<00:03:13.139> that<00:03:13.319> down<00:03:13.379> you<00:03:13.620> want<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.069> practice<00:03:14.250> like

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
get that down you want to practice like

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.149 
get that down you want to practice like
having<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.900> board<00:03:16.260> land<00:03:16.650> in<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:16.950> same

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
having the board land in the same

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.360 
having the board land in the same
position<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.790> started<00:03:18.450> like<00:03:19.109> right<00:03:19.769> where

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
position you started like right where

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.189 
position you started like right where
you<00:03:20.549> where<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.060> started<00:03:21.569> it<00:03:21.750> popped<00:03:22.019> up

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
you where you started it popped up

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:23.869 
you where you started it popped up
straight<00:03:22.560> up<00:03:22.709> into<00:03:22.889> the<00:03:22.980> air<00:03:23.099> did<00:03:23.699> the

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
straight up into the air did the

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.970 
straight up into the air did the
frontside<00:03:24.239> trivet<00:03:24.540> rotation<00:03:25.049> and<00:03:25.260> landed

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
frontside trivet rotation and landed

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.640 
frontside trivet rotation and landed
straight<00:03:26.190> down<00:03:26.519> that's<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.750> best<00:03:28.049> way<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.379> do

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
straight down that's the best way to do

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.930 
straight down that's the best way to do
it<00:03:28.829> and<00:03:28.859> it's<00:03:29.069> the<00:03:29.190> best<00:03:29.340> way<00:03:29.549> to<00:03:29.609> do<00:03:29.819> it

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
it and it's the best way to do it

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.129 
it and it's the best way to do it
because<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:31.169> don't<00:03:31.410> have<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.859> like<00:03:32.780> try<00:03:33.780> and

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
because you don't have to like try and

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.470 
because you don't have to like try and
compensate<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.220> figure<00:03:35.639> out<00:03:35.699> where<00:03:36.180> the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
compensate and figure out where the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.509 
compensate and figure out where the
board<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:36.930> going<00:03:37.109> to<00:03:37.470> go<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:37.980> then<00:03:38.099> try<00:03:38.370> and

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
board is going to go and then try and

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.479 
board is going to go and then try and
jump<00:03:38.819> and<00:03:38.940> land<00:03:39.150> on<00:03:39.359> it<00:03:39.569> you<00:03:40.290> are<00:03:40.650> just<00:03:40.980> in<00:03:41.129> one

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
jump and land on it you are just in one

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.339 
jump and land on it you are just in one
hundred<00:03:41.790> percent<00:03:41.819> full<00:03:42.510> control<00:03:42.959> of<00:03:43.109> the

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
hundred percent full control of the

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.589 
hundred percent full control of the
board<00:03:43.620> it's<00:03:44.340> right<00:03:44.760> underneath<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.449> the

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
board it's right underneath you the

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.900 
board it's right underneath you the
whole<00:03:45.840> time<00:03:46.139> and<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:47.160> greatest<00:03:47.519> part<00:03:47.699> is<00:03:47.819> you

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
whole time and the greatest part is you

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.339 
whole time and the greatest part is you
can<00:03:47.940> actually<00:03:48.090> just<00:03:48.480> leave<00:03:48.750> your<00:03:48.930> front<00:03:49.290> foot

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
can actually just leave your front foot

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.250 
can actually just leave your front foot
on<00:03:49.620> right<00:03:49.980> there<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:51.060> as<00:03:51.209> soon<00:03:51.359> as<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:51.599> pop<00:03:51.870> and

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
on right there so as soon as you pop and

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.349 
on right there so as soon as you pop and
spin<00:03:52.859> it<00:03:53.010> around<00:03:53.099> your<00:03:53.609> front<00:03:53.790> foot<00:03:53.940> is<00:03:54.120> on

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
spin it around your front foot is on

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.990 
spin it around your front foot is on
there<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.690> whole<00:03:54.900> time<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:56.340> just<00:03:56.370> comes

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
there the whole time and it just comes

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.640 
there the whole time and it just comes
around<00:03:57.359> and<00:03:57.540> then<00:03:57.690> you<00:03:57.810> just<00:03:58.019> put<00:03:58.260> your<00:03:58.349> front

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
around and then you just put your front

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.949 
around and then you just put your front
foot<00:03:58.709> down<00:03:59.129> and<00:03:59.489> then<00:03:59.970> put<00:04:00.389> your<00:04:00.419> back<00:04:00.720> foot

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
foot down and then put your back foot

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.220 
foot down and then put your back foot
down<00:04:01.169> land<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.859> roll<00:04:02.010> away<00:04:02.239> so<00:04:03.239> that's

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
down land and roll away so that's

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.559 
down land and roll away so that's
basically<00:04:04.440> how<00:04:05.190> I<00:04:05.459> do<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:06.030> full<00:04:06.329> trick

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
basically how I do the full trick

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.059 
basically how I do the full trick
another<00:04:09.569> practice<00:04:10.049> step<00:04:10.260> that<00:04:10.409> you<00:04:10.500> can<00:04:10.709> do<00:04:10.859> is

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
another practice step that you can do is

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.949 
another practice step that you can do is
you<00:04:11.340> can<00:04:11.370> actually<00:04:11.699> stand<00:04:12.239> on<00:04:12.389> the<00:04:12.479> board<00:04:12.720> and

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
you can actually stand on the board and

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.189 
you can actually stand on the board and
then<00:04:13.829> do<00:04:14.159> the<00:04:14.430> frontside<00:04:14.849> shove<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.329> purposely

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
then do the frontside shove it purposely

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.740 
then do the frontside shove it purposely
step<00:04:16.620> off<00:04:16.859> with<00:04:17.099> your<00:04:17.250> back<00:04:17.489> foot<00:04:17.849> and<00:04:18.120> leave

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
step off with your back foot and leave

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.140 
step off with your back foot and leave
your<00:04:18.900> front<00:04:19.169> foot<00:04:19.260> on<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.620> whole<00:04:19.829> time<00:04:20.220> so

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
your front foot on the whole time so

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.000 
your front foot on the whole time so
your<00:04:21.570> back<00:04:21.780> foot<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.409> want<00:04:22.440> to<00:04:22.680> pop<00:04:22.860> it

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
your back foot you want to pop it

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.350 
your back foot you want to pop it
straight<00:04:23.039> down<00:04:23.490> so<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.969> board<00:04:24.150> goes

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
straight down so the board goes

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.779 
straight down so the board goes
literally<00:04:25.349> straight<00:04:25.919> down<00:04:26.190> right<00:04:26.460> underneath

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
literally straight down right underneath

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.339 
literally straight down right underneath
you<00:04:27.120> you<00:04:27.270> want<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.510> almost<00:04:27.750> make<00:04:27.990> it<00:04:28.050> land

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
you you want to almost make it land

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:28.910 
you you want to almost make it land
while

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
foot on the whole time this is a point

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.310 
foot on the whole time this is a point
of<00:04:43.620> control<00:04:44.250> your<00:04:45.120> front<00:04:45.450> foot<00:04:45.510> is<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:46.110> foot

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
that's going to stay close to the board

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.240 
that's going to stay close to the board
and<00:04:48.240> it's<00:04:48.510> actually<00:04:48.690> going<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.230> ensure<00:04:49.890> that

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
and it's actually going to ensure that

Julian right there he pops it straight

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.060 
Julian right there he pops it straight
down<00:05:05.790> it<00:05:06.600> goes<00:05:06.810> up<00:05:06.870> into<00:05:07.290> the<00:05:07.440> air<00:05:07.470> it's<00:05:07.800> right

down it goes up into the air it's right

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.370 
down it goes up into the air it's right
underneath<00:05:08.370> him<00:05:08.640> the<00:05:08.760> whole<00:05:09.000> time<00:05:09.330> notice<00:05:10.230> it

doesn't go behind him it pops straight

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.080 
doesn't go behind him it pops straight
up<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.200> then<00:05:13.290> it's<00:05:13.440> right<00:05:13.770> underneath<00:05:14.130> him<00:05:14.430> so
