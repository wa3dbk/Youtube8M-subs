it<00:00:53.960> at<00:00:54.230> a<00:00:54.280> fairly<00:00:55.280> large<00:00:55.760> long<00:00:56.720> angle<00:00:57.710> like

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
it at a fairly large long angle like

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.509 
it at a fairly large long angle like
that<00:00:58.340> okay<00:01:00.370> see<00:01:01.370> it<00:01:01.460> was<00:01:01.610> it<00:01:01.970> was<00:01:02.120> pretty<00:01:02.300> dull

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
that okay see it was it was pretty dull

I<00:01:04.549> need<00:01:05.299> it<00:01:05.420> to<00:01:05.540> lengthen<00:01:06.079> the<00:01:06.290> lead<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.950> so

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
I need it to lengthen the lead to so

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.130 
I need it to lengthen the lead to so
it's<00:01:07.970> probably<00:01:08.210> anything<00:01:08.600> there<00:01:08.810> once<00:01:09.050> it

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
it's probably anything there once it

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.200 
it's probably anything there once it
gets<00:01:09.290> that<00:01:09.409> stubby<00:01:09.920> it's<00:01:10.040> hard<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:10.460> make<00:01:11.180> a

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
gets that stubby it's hard to make a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.630 
gets that stubby it's hard to make a
mark<00:01:11.720> that's<00:01:12.500> nice<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.400> then<00:01:14.830> you<00:01:15.830> know<00:01:15.950> you

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
mark that's nice and then you know you

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.070 
mark that's nice and then you know you
got<00:01:16.790> to<00:01:16.880> get<00:01:16.940> some<00:01:17.150> of<00:01:17.240> that<00:01:17.270> wood<00:01:17.630> off<00:01:17.870> in

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
got to get some of that wood off in

got to get some of that wood off in
there<00:01:18.640> I'm<00:01:19.640> gonna<00:01:19.820> be<00:01:19.909> careful<00:01:20.180> not<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.630> chunk

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
there I'm gonna be careful not to chunk

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.149 
there I'm gonna be careful not to chunk
into<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.440> lead<00:01:21.710> too<00:01:22.100> much<00:01:23.740> cuz<00:01:24.740> then<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:24.979> take

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
into the lead too much cuz then you take

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.960 
into the lead too much cuz then you take
big<00:01:25.370> chunks<00:01:25.700> out<00:01:26.000> of<00:01:26.180> it<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:28.310> once<00:01:28.549> you<00:01:28.640> get<00:01:28.790> it

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
big chunks out of it so once you get it

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.359 
big chunks out of it so once you get it

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
it so sharp that it kind of comes to

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.640 
it so sharp that it kind of comes to
nothing<00:02:22.330> because<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:22.810> don't<00:02:23.019> have<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.170> tendency

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
maybe the first couple marks will take a

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.620 
maybe the first couple marks will take a
little<00:02:30.340> bit<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.820> get<00:02:30.970> just<00:02:33.060> blended<00:02:34.060> in

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
little bit to get just blended in

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.979 
little bit to get just blended in
but<00:02:34.870> there<00:02:35.350> you<00:02:35.440> go<00:02:36.269> how<00:02:37.269> you<00:02:37.330> do<00:02:37.540> that

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
but there you go how you do that

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.020
