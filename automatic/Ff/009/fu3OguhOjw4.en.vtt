ok<00:00:10.050> well<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:11.269> what's<00:00:12.269> different<00:00:12.660> from<00:00:12.690> bf3<00:00:13.290> is

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
ok well the what's different from bf3 is

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.379 
ok well the what's different from bf3 is
that<00:00:13.799> we<00:00:14.040> don't<00:00:14.160> have<00:00:14.370> any<00:00:14.549> faction<00:00:14.940> specific

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
that we don't have any faction specific

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.050 
that we don't have any faction specific
weapons<00:00:15.719> we<00:00:15.929> have<00:00:16.190> weapons<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.340> belong<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.820> a

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
weapons we have weapons that belong to a

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.390 
weapons we have weapons that belong to a
certain<00:00:18.539> faction<00:00:18.930> but<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:19.890> try<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.160> balance

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
certain faction but we try to balance

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.220 
certain faction but we try to balance
them<00:00:20.730> out<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.210> it's<00:00:22.130> you<00:00:23.130> know<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:24.080> we<00:00:25.080> have

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
them out so it's you know it's a we have

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.230 
them out so it's you know it's a we have
all<00:00:25.439> factions<00:00:25.769> can<00:00:25.949> use<00:00:26.130> all<00:00:26.340> weapons<00:00:27.000> of

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
all factions can use all weapons of

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.730 
all factions can use all weapons of
course<00:00:27.689> all<00:00:27.869> factions<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.380> different

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
course all factions have different

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.400 
course all factions have different
vehicles<00:00:29.130> but<00:00:29.340> those<00:00:29.519> are<00:00:29.730> balanced<00:00:30.410> more

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
vehicles but those are balanced more

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.830 
vehicles but those are balanced more
between<00:00:32.279> them<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.120> there<00:00:33.510> shouldn't<00:00:33.719> be

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
between them so that there shouldn't be

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.780 
between them so that there shouldn't be
any<00:00:34.140> difference<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.770> gameplay<00:00:35.130> like<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
any difference in gameplay like the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.000 
any difference in gameplay like the
Chinese<00:00:35.969> army<00:00:36.750> shouldn't<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.620> able<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.890> win

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010

us another example of a map or something

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.469 
us another example of a map or something
that<00:01:16.470> really<00:01:16.590> kind<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.520> exemplifies<00:01:17.759> what<00:01:18.150> you

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
that really kind of exemplifies what you

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.640 
that really kind of exemplifies what you
can<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.750> next<00:01:19.049> gen<00:01:19.759> I<00:01:20.960> think<00:01:21.960> all<00:01:22.170> maps<00:01:22.470> due

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
can do on next gen I think all maps due

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.640 
can do on next gen I think all maps due
to<00:01:22.920> some<00:01:23.100> extent<00:01:23.460> they<00:01:24.030> are<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.780> different

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
to some extent they are so different

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.160 
to some extent they are so different
that<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.369> think<00:01:27.030> siege<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.630> Shanghai<00:01:27.930> for

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
that I I think siege of Shanghai for

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.810 
that I I think siege of Shanghai for
example<00:01:28.560> that's<00:01:28.770> about<00:01:29.009> scope<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.579> have<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
example that's about scope we have the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.270 
example that's about scope we have the
skyscraper<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.600> big<00:01:30.840> destruction<00:01:31.380> type

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
skyscraper like big destruction type

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.429 
skyscraper like big destruction type
stuff<00:01:32.540> paracel<00:01:33.540> storm<00:01:33.570> where<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.079> showcase

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
stuff paracel storm where we showcase

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.249 
stuff paracel storm where we showcase
the<00:01:34.619> waves<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> weather<00:01:35.460> changes<00:01:36.259> it's

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the waves and the weather changes it's

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.039 
the waves and the weather changes it's
just<00:01:37.530> all<00:01:38.280> maps<00:01:38.759> have<00:01:39.030> something<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.780> them

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
just all maps have something in them

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.920 
just all maps have something in them
that's<00:01:40.880> let's<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.119> know<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:42.540> couldn't<00:01:42.780> do

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
that's let's just know we couldn't do

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.580 
that's let's just know we couldn't do
that<00:01:42.960> before<00:01:43.229> because<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.790> so

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
that before because it's it's just so

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.440 
that before because it's it's just so
complex<00:01:46.590> flood<00:01:47.579> zone<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:48.000> example<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
complex flood zone for example is a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.649 
complex flood zone for example is a
perfect<00:01:48.840> example<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:50.280> style<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:51.450> how

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
perfect example of the style of like how

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.440 
perfect example of the style of like how
much<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.280> how<00:01:53.280> much<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:53.850> changes

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
much of that how much of that changes

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.420 
much of that how much of that changes
the<00:01:54.600> world<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.110> how<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:55.829> need<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.070> plan<00:01:56.369> for

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
the world and how we need to plan for

how<00:02:55.980> we<00:02:56.040> ended<00:02:56.160> up<00:02:56.430> with<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.090> 10<00:02:57.720> maps<00:02:57.959> that

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
how we ended up with so the 10 maps that

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.170 
how we ended up with so the 10 maps that
are<00:02:58.200> in<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.620> game<00:02:58.769> which<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.819> think<00:03:00.060> are

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
are in the game which I think are

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.759 
are in the game which I think are
dramatically<00:03:00.810> very<00:03:01.080> different<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.560> play

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
dramatically very different and play

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.390 
dramatically very different and play
very<00:03:02.280> differently<00:03:03.530> really<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:05.280> you

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
about the realism in the game when it

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.610 
about the realism in the game when it
comes<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.610> weapons<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.299> vehicles<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:13.470> how

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
comes to weapons and vehicles and how

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.310 
comes to weapons and vehicles and how
that<00:03:13.680> plays<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.100> role<00:03:14.400> in<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.910> experience<00:03:15.540> okay

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
that plays a role in the experience okay

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.259 
that plays a role in the experience okay
I<00:03:16.350> don't<00:03:16.560> want<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:17.100> didn't<00:03:17.820> come<00:03:17.970> from<00:03:18.180> a

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
I don't want to I didn't come from a

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.180 
I don't want to I didn't come from a
military<00:03:18.390> background<00:03:18.720> more<00:03:19.410> than<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:20.070> do

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
military background more than just do

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.060 
military background more than just do
like<00:03:21.060> light<00:03:21.540> service<00:03:22.019> in<00:03:22.200> Sweden<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:22.890> it's

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
like light service in Sweden so it's

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.849 
like light service in Sweden so it's
yeah<00:03:23.610> but<00:03:25.100> I<00:03:26.100> think<00:03:26.850> we<00:03:27.780> don't<00:03:27.930> want<00:03:28.260> realism

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
yeah but I think we don't want realism

yeah but I think we don't want realism
really<00:03:29.310> we<00:03:29.489> want<00:03:29.609> a<00:03:29.760> fun<00:03:29.910> game<00:03:30.150> but<00:03:30.359> we<00:03:30.840> want

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
polished most fun I think for us it's

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.540 
polished most fun I think for us it's
the<00:04:06.720> all-out<00:04:07.080> warfare<00:04:07.440> it's<00:04:07.890> our<00:04:08.130> big<00:04:08.340> thing

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
the all-out warfare it's our big thing

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.310 
the all-out warfare it's our big thing
and<00:04:08.700> that's<00:04:08.880> what<00:04:09.180> we<00:04:09.330> continue<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:09.900> push<00:04:10.080> I

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
and that's what we continue to push I

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.360 
and that's what we continue to push I
don't<00:04:10.530> think<00:04:11.300> you<00:04:12.300> can't<00:04:12.570> do<00:04:12.870> what<00:04:13.530> we<00:04:13.680> what<00:04:14.340> we

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
don't think you can't do what we what we

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.120 
don't think you can't do what we what we
offer<00:04:14.880> in<00:04:15.240> any<00:04:15.630> other<00:04:15.840> game<00:04:16.050> so<00:04:16.860> it's<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.100> huge

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
offer in any other game so it's a huge

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.450 
offer in any other game so it's a huge
deal<00:04:17.489> for<00:04:17.550> us<00:04:17.820> I<00:04:18.000> think<00:04:18.030> it's<00:04:18.300> a<00:04:18.450> game

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:19.460 
deal for us I think it's a game

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.030 
deal for us I think it's a game
differentiator<00:04:20.460> if<00:04:20.700> you<00:04:20.850> will<00:04:21.320> so<00:04:22.320> no<00:04:22.890> one

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
differentiator if you will so no one

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.100 
differentiator if you will so no one
else<00:04:23.070> is<00:04:23.310> really<00:04:23.670> trying<00:04:24.000> to<00:04:24.150> do<00:04:24.360> it<00:04:24.480> I<00:04:24.690> think

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
else is really trying to do it I think

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.530 
else is really trying to do it I think
you<00:04:25.710> have<00:04:25.860> ARMA<00:04:26.310> which<00:04:26.490> is<00:04:26.670> more<00:04:27.030> simulator

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
you have ARMA which is more simulator

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.920 
you have ARMA which is more simulator
type<00:04:27.990> of<00:04:28.110> stuff<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.710> then<00:04:29.330> us

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
type of stuff and then us

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.249 
type of stuff and then us
I<00:04:32.080> think<00:04:32.710> that<00:04:33.669> we<00:04:33.940> offer<00:04:34.090> grand<00:04:34.930> scale

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
I think that we offer grand scale

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.760 
I think that we offer grand scale
warfare<00:04:35.979> with<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:37.060> lot<00:04:37.300> of<00:04:37.330> players<00:04:37.600> no<00:04:38.590> other

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
warfare with a lot of players no other

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.210 
warfare with a lot of players no other
game<00:04:39.070> does<00:04:39.370> that<00:04:39.550> with<00:04:39.820> vehicle<00:04:40.270> system<00:04:40.570> and

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
game does that with vehicle system and

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.620 
game does that with vehicle system and
we<00:04:42.220> just<00:04:42.490> keep<00:04:42.610> pushing<00:04:42.820> what<00:04:43.120> we're<00:04:43.240> best<00:04:43.360> ups

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
we just keep pushing what we're best ups

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.050 
we just keep pushing what we're best ups
and<00:04:43.870> adding<00:04:44.740> things<00:04:44.979> like<00:04:45.100> LEvolution<00:04:45.820> like<00:04:46.030> a

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
and adding things like LEvolution like a

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.060 
and adding things like LEvolution like a
commander<00:04:46.630> like<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:47.229> Naval<00:04:47.500> Warfare<00:04:47.680> then<00:04:48.039> I

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
commander like the Naval Warfare then I

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.840 
commander like the Naval Warfare then I
talked<00:04:48.310> about<00:04:48.520> try<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.060> improve<00:04:49.330> on<00:04:49.660> ourselves
