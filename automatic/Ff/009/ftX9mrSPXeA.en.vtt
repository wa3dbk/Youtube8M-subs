00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.220
 so here's a common problem if I 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.849
 am going to do now I'm going to reignite 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:13.110
 my brain and you see that the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.969
 flashing flashes multiple times it's 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.010
 because their obvious assets 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.140
 now what am I going to do I'm going 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.990
 fill the tank which you will see 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.029
 that the problem still persists 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.289
 to say is that the device considers that 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.750
 the tank is empty 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.230
 so here it goes by that a few 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.230
 seconds 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.020
 now here is the tank is 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.670
 half filled 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:53.090
 here i'm going to put in his place because 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.090
 it will give 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.989
 I put them here in its place to fill it 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:04.440
 yet the flashing clean urd 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.890
 always and considers that the tank 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:13.710
 is obvious we problem is that he 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.630
 there is a hymn pretty much here that does not move 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.580
 not so he's stuck 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.340
 what to do is unlock it 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.030
 and how to do it in it being you 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.899
 take a magnet you try to 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.910
 unlock so you take a magnet there 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.900
 you put it right where you see 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.690
 the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.860
 black so you have to try to do it 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.750
 climb a little bit if not just that's what 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.450
 that he wants to do just that we could have 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:49.080
 here for example it's going to go up 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:58.070
 now it's done because here I 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:58.070
 am going to try that's the problem is gone 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.000
 here is now a works well with 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.000
 begins to heat
