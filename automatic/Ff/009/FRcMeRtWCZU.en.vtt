in<00:00:00.210> front<00:00:00.450> of<00:00:00.570> us<00:00:00.690> now<00:00:00.870> is<00:00:01.079> my<00:00:02.070> potential<00:00:02.520> race

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
in front of us now is my potential race

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.480 
in front of us now is my potential race
car<00:00:03.300> for<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:03.659> Indy<00:00:03.929> World<00:00:04.110> Series<00:00:04.380> if<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.370> can

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
car for the Indy World Series if I can

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.480 
car for the Indy World Series if I can
just<00:00:05.609> walk<00:00:05.790> around<00:00:06.029> it<00:00:06.710> I'll<00:00:07.710> point<00:00:08.010> out<00:00:08.220> some

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
just walk around it I'll point out some

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.890 
just walk around it I'll point out some
fundamental<00:00:09.120> differences<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.719> we<00:00:09.870> have

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
fundamental differences that we have

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.379 
fundamental differences that we have
from<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.380> Formula<00:00:10.740> One<00:00:10.769> car<00:00:11.130> straight<00:00:12.090> away<00:00:12.360> I

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
from a Formula One car straight away I

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.910 
from a Formula One car straight away I
think<00:00:12.719> what<00:00:12.840> we'd<00:00:12.960> like<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.230> do<00:00:13.349> start<00:00:13.679> in<00:00:13.860> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
think what we'd like to do start in the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.079 
think what we'd like to do start in the
middle<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.309> car<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.700> then<00:00:14.790> we'll<00:00:14.910> move

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
middle of the car and then we'll move

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.080 
middle of the car and then we'll move
forward<00:00:15.360> as<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.470> can<00:00:16.590> see<00:00:16.830> here<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:17.970> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
forward as you can see here this is the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.330 
forward as you can see here this is the
main<00:00:18.300> refueling<00:00:20.900> tank<00:00:21.900> which<00:00:22.189> depresses<00:00:23.189> in

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
main refueling tank which depresses in

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.240 
main refueling tank which depresses in
there<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.580> got<00:00:23.970> enough<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.330> strength<00:00:25.099> and<00:00:26.099> they

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
there I got enough of strength and they

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.330 
there I got enough of strength and they
basically<00:00:26.640> put<00:00:26.910> 28<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:28.019> 38<00:00:28.590> gallons<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.189> fuel

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
basically put 28 to 38 gallons of fuel

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.009 
basically put 28 to 38 gallons of fuel
in<00:00:29.580> there<00:00:29.730> depending<00:00:30.179> when<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.449> pit<00:00:30.630> stop<00:00:30.900> of

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
in there depending when you pit stop of

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.860 
in there depending when you pit stop of
course<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.740> it's<00:00:31.890> all<00:00:32.040> gravity<00:00:32.309> fed<00:00:32.870> through

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
course and it's all gravity fed through

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.200 
course and it's all gravity fed through
here<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.500> have<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> breather<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.090> other

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
here you have a breather on the other

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.600 
here you have a breather on the other
side<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.260> an<00:00:37.469> important<00:00:37.890> part<00:00:38.129> here<00:00:38.399> this

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
side this is an important part here this

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.819 
side this is an important part here this
is<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.910> air<00:00:39.030> jack<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.629> obviously<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.590> plugs

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
is the air jack and obviously it plugs

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.830 
is the air jack and obviously it plugs
in<00:00:41.040> here<00:00:41.070> lifts<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.000> car<00:00:42.210> up<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.660> we'll<00:00:42.750> be

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
in here lifts the car up and we'll be

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.600 
in here lifts the car up and we'll be
very<00:00:42.870> careful<00:00:43.290> get<00:00:43.710> your<00:00:43.860> feet<00:00:44.070> out<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.430> way

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
very careful get your feet out the way

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.729 
very careful get your feet out the way
normally<00:00:45.300> when<00:00:45.450> we're<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> pits<00:00:46.020> Kenny

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
normally when we're in the pits Kenny

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.920 
normally when we're in the pits Kenny
who<00:00:46.920> does<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.370> will<00:00:47.850> actually<00:00:48.000> say<00:00:48.329> coming

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
who does it will actually say coming

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.389 
who does it will actually say coming
down<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.649> got<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.860> make<00:00:50.010> sure<00:00:50.160> you're<00:00:50.340> out

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
down and you got to make sure you're out

down and you got to make sure you're out
the<00:00:50.520> way<00:00:50.670> mainly<00:00:51.390> because<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.870> car<00:00:52.140> is

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the way mainly because this car is

incredible head race rest which is very
very<00:01:16.770> firm<00:01:17.009> indeed<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.549> fuel

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
very firm indeed and then this fuel

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.340 
very firm indeed and then this fuel

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.219 
meter here is very very important I'm
just<00:01:22.560> about<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.920> zero<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.460> for<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.880> you've<00:01:24.060> got

just about to zero it for you you've got
44.9<00:01:25.229> there<00:01:25.560> now<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.729> zero<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.210> every

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
44.9 there now and you zero it every

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.210 
44.9 there now and you zero it every
time<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.110> come<00:01:28.259> into<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.590> pit<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:29.070> to

time you come into the pit you have to

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.580 
time you come into the pit you have to
zero<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.909> then<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> actual

it back very difficult to do it when the

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.690 
it back very difficult to do it when the
car<00:03:25.170> standing<00:03:25.709> still<00:03:25.980> especially<00:03:26.280> when<00:03:26.550> it's

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
car standing still especially when it's

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.390 
car standing still especially when it's
all<00:03:26.820> pre-loaded<00:03:27.540> so<00:03:28.500> but<00:03:28.860> those<00:03:29.010> are<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.220> two

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
all pre-loaded so but those are the two

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.830 
all pre-loaded so but those are the two
roll<00:03:29.610> bars<00:03:29.880> which<00:03:30.150> can<00:03:30.330> alter<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.660> settings

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
roll bars which can alter the settings

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.440 
roll bars which can alter the settings
of<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.320> car<00:03:31.530> well<00:03:32.459> along<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.030> front<00:03:33.239> what<00:03:33.420> I

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
of the car well along the front what I

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.420 
of the car well along the front what I
would<00:03:33.570> like<00:03:33.690> to<00:03:33.870> show<00:03:34.050> you<00:03:34.110> is<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.040> suspension

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
would like to show you is the suspension

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.340 
would like to show you is the suspension
the<00:03:36.209> one<00:03:36.390> thing<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:36.959> can<00:03:37.110> see

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
the one thing that you can see

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.320 
the one thing that you can see
especially<00:03:37.620> on<00:03:38.010> an<00:03:38.130> oval<00:03:38.489> is<00:03:38.670> how<00:03:38.850> strong

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
especially on an oval is how strong

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.570 
especially on an oval is how strong
everything<00:03:40.080> is<00:03:40.350> everything<00:03:41.070> is<00:03:41.250> very<00:03:41.459> very

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
everything is everything is very very

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.370 
everything is everything is very very
solid<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.270> of<00:03:42.360> course<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.690> has<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:43.020> be<00:03:43.170> because

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
solid and of course it has to be because

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.020 
solid and of course it has to be because
of<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.830> g-force<00:03:44.280> that<00:03:44.550> you're<00:03:44.700> actually

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
of the g-force that you're actually

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.250 
of the g-force that you're actually
pulling<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:47.489> Lola<00:03:47.850> car<00:03:48.060> especially<00:03:48.360> is<00:03:48.959> I

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
pulling the Lola car especially is I

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.990 
pulling the Lola car especially is I
think<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:50.040> has<00:03:50.190> been<00:03:50.400> for<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:50.640> last<00:03:50.790> couple

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
think and has been for the last couple

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.970 
think and has been for the last couple
of<00:03:51.209> years<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.600> best<00:03:51.630> car<00:03:52.020> to<00:03:52.200> have<00:03:52.380> in<00:03:52.530> IndyCar

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
of years the best car to have in IndyCar

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.340 
of years the best car to have in IndyCar
racing<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.670> I'm<00:03:54.030> very<00:03:54.420> very<00:03:54.570> comfortable<00:03:54.840> to

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
racing and I'm very very comfortable to

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.920 
racing and I'm very very comfortable to
be<00:03:55.440> driving<00:03:55.860> this<00:03:55.950> Lola<00:03:56.400> this<00:03:56.520> year<00:03:56.930> just

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
be driving this Lola this year just

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.570 
be driving this Lola this year just
moving<00:03:58.350> around<00:03:58.560> there<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.160> front<00:03:59.400> the

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
moving around there to the front the

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.470 
moving around there to the front the
other<00:03:59.700> fundamental<00:04:00.090> things<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.690> we<00:04:00.900> have<00:04:01.140> is

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
other fundamental things that we have is

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.750 
other fundamental things that we have is
the<00:04:03.480> front<00:04:03.750> wing<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.709> we<00:04:05.459> have<00:04:05.610> the

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
the front wing and we have the

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.699 
the front wing and we have the
availability<00:04:06.720> that<00:04:06.959> when<00:04:07.110> we<00:04:07.230> make<00:04:07.380> a<00:04:07.410> pit

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
availability that when we make a pit

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.890 
availability that when we make a pit
stop<00:04:07.739> we<00:04:08.730> can<00:04:08.880> actually<00:04:09.239> adjust<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.720> front

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
stop we can actually adjust the front

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.800 
stop we can actually adjust the front
wing<00:04:10.430> so<00:04:11.430> if<00:04:11.550> we<00:04:11.670> have<00:04:11.790> an<00:04:11.910> understeering<00:04:12.390> car

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
wing so if we have an understeering car

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.350 
wing so if we have an understeering car
on<00:04:13.019> over<00:04:13.320> steering<00:04:13.590> car<00:04:13.920> aerodynamically<00:04:14.360> we

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
on over steering car aerodynamically we

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.070 
on over steering car aerodynamically we
have<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:16.400> pitch<00:04:17.400> away<00:04:17.580> the<00:04:17.850> facility<00:04:18.390> to

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
have the pitch away the facility to

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.130 
have the pitch away the facility to
either<00:04:19.410> turn<00:04:19.799> this<00:04:20.010> in<00:04:20.250> or<00:04:20.790> turn<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.299> out<00:04:21.480> if

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
either turn this in or turn it out if

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.930 
either turn this in or turn it out if
we've<00:04:22.470> got<00:04:22.650> too<00:04:22.860> much<00:04:23.010> oversteer<00:04:23.460> then

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
we've got too much oversteer then

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.820 
we've got too much oversteer then
obviously<00:04:24.090> we'll<00:04:24.539> lower<00:04:24.780> this<00:04:25.020> wing<00:04:25.289> just<00:04:25.650> a

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
obviously we'll lower this wing just a

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.800 
obviously we'll lower this wing just a
little<00:04:26.100> bit

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
little bit

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.080 
little bit
two<00:04:26.900> turns<00:04:27.230> and<00:04:28.010> equally<00:04:28.400> if<00:04:28.550> we've<00:04:28.730> got<00:04:28.880> too

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
two turns and equally if we've got too

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.000 
two turns and equally if we've got too
much<00:04:29.270> understeer<00:04:29.990> then<00:04:30.470> we'll<00:04:30.650> bring<00:04:30.830> this

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
much understeer then we'll bring this

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.980 
much understeer then we'll bring this
flap<00:04:31.220> up<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.790> give<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.360> car<00:04:32.510> a<00:04:32.570> little<00:04:32.750> bit

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
flap up and give the car a little bit

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.420 
flap up and give the car a little bit
more<00:04:33.200> downforce<00:04:33.680> at<00:04:33.950> the<00:04:34.040> front

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
more downforce at the front

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.629 
more downforce at the front
okay<00:04:34.730> moving<00:04:35.210> back<00:04:35.389> now<00:04:36.190> towards<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:37.250> second

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
okay moving back now towards the second

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.820 
okay moving back now towards the second
half<00:04:37.850> of<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.180> car<00:04:38.440> there's<00:04:39.440> some<00:04:39.620> quite

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
half of the car there's some quite

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.400 
half of the car there's some quite
significant<00:04:40.520> differences<00:04:41.350> straightaway<00:04:42.350> you

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
significant differences straightaway you

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.320 
significant differences straightaway you
say<00:04:42.740> well<00:04:42.950> what<00:04:43.400> on<00:04:43.550> earth<00:04:43.700> is<00:04:43.910> this<00:04:44.060> thing

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
say well what on earth is this thing

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.150 
say well what on earth is this thing
here<00:04:44.570> well<00:04:45.260> this<00:04:45.440> thing<00:04:45.680> can<00:04:45.980> make<00:04:46.130> a

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
here well this thing can make a

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.830 
here well this thing can make a
difference<00:04:46.610> of<00:04:46.760> your<00:04:46.880> winning<00:04:47.210> or<00:04:47.360> losing<00:04:47.540> a

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
difference of your winning or losing a

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.740 
difference of your winning or losing a
race<00:04:48.020> this<00:04:48.980> is<00:04:49.160> the<00:04:49.340> blow-off<00:04:49.550> valve<00:04:49.970> this<00:04:50.690> is

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
race this is the blow-off valve this is

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.540 
race this is the blow-off valve this is
the<00:04:50.930> valve<00:04:51.050> that<00:04:51.410> regulates<00:04:51.889> the<00:04:52.010> boost<00:04:52.310> for

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
the valve that regulates the boost for

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.210 
the valve that regulates the boost for
the<00:04:52.610> engine<00:04:53.000> I<00:04:53.470> mean<00:04:54.470> obviously<00:04:54.710> it<00:04:55.100> goes

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
the engine I mean obviously it goes

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.830 
the engine I mean obviously it goes
without<00:04:55.370> saying<00:04:55.550> that<00:04:55.910> the<00:04:56.150> single<00:04:56.690> biggest

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
without saying that the single biggest

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.080 
without saying that the single biggest
difference<00:04:57.380> between<00:04:57.730> Formula<00:04:58.730> one<00:04:58.880> engine

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
difference between Formula one engine

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.110 
difference between Formula one engine
wise<00:04:59.450> and<00:05:00.050> IndyCar<00:05:01.010> is<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:01.580> engine<00:05:01.940> which<00:05:02.090> is

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
wise and IndyCar is the engine which is

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.620 
wise and IndyCar is the engine which is
turbocharged<00:05:03.250> this<00:05:04.250> develops<00:05:04.729> probably<00:05:05.300> a

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
turbocharged this develops probably a

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.330 
turbocharged this develops probably a
little<00:05:05.900> bit<00:05:06.020> more<00:05:06.200> power<00:05:06.470> than<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.830> aspirated

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
little bit more power than the aspirated

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.400 
little bit more power than the aspirated
engine<00:05:07.729> and<00:05:07.910> certainly<00:05:08.870> a<00:05:08.930> little<00:05:09.139> bit<00:05:09.229> more

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
engine and certainly a little bit more

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.000 
engine and certainly a little bit more
torque

torque

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.090 
torque
you<00:05:10.430> don't<00:05:10.669> feel<00:05:10.970> it<00:05:11.320> too<00:05:12.320> much<00:05:12.470> more<00:05:12.740> because

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
you don't feel it too much more because

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.800 
you don't feel it too much more because
of<00:05:13.130> the<00:05:13.310> weight<00:05:13.490> of<00:05:13.669> the<00:05:13.760> car<00:05:13.970> on<00:05:14.240> acceleration

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
of the weight of the car on acceleration

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.710 
of the weight of the car on acceleration
the<00:05:15.139> acceleration<00:05:16.000> moving<00:05:17.000> on<00:05:17.150> here<00:05:17.389> we<00:05:17.419> have

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
the acceleration moving on here we have

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.230 
the acceleration moving on here we have
the<00:05:17.810> turbocharger<00:05:18.680> house<00:05:18.919> just<00:05:19.370> in<00:05:19.490> here<00:05:19.669> we

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
the turbocharger house just in here we

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.060 
the turbocharger house just in here we
have<00:05:20.360> the<00:05:20.479> wastegate<00:05:20.810> system<00:05:21.440> and<00:05:21.830> you

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
have the wastegate system and you

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.040 
have the wastegate system and you
probably<00:05:22.280> say<00:05:22.639> well<00:05:22.880> why<00:05:23.300> is<00:05:23.360> all<00:05:23.630> the<00:05:23.780> exhaust

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
probably say well why is all the exhaust

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.980 
probably say well why is all the exhaust
in<00:05:24.440> enclosed<00:05:25.130> here<00:05:25.460> and<00:05:25.729> we<00:05:26.360> have<00:05:26.479> air<00:05:26.690> blowing

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
in enclosed here and we have air blowing

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.260 
in enclosed here and we have air blowing
in<00:05:27.260> here<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:27.650> out<00:05:27.770> through<00:05:28.610> the<00:05:28.639> back<00:05:29.000> end

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
in here and out through the back end

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.409 
in here and out through the back end
basically<00:05:30.229> we<00:05:31.220> try<00:05:31.430> and<00:05:31.610> protect<00:05:31.940> everything

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
basically we try and protect everything

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.270 
basically we try and protect everything
within<00:05:32.600> the<00:05:32.810> car<00:05:33.020> because<00:05:33.410> this<00:05:33.590> can<00:05:33.830> get<00:05:33.979> well

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
within the car because this can get well

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.180 
within the car because this can get well
over<00:05:34.580> a<00:05:34.640> thousand<00:05:35.120> degrees<00:05:35.270> C<00:05:35.810> so<00:05:36.470> they<00:05:36.680> house

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
over a thousand degrees C so they house

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.610 
over a thousand degrees C so they house
it<00:05:37.520> and<00:05:38.240> the<00:05:38.450> most<00:05:38.630> important<00:05:39.200> thing<00:05:39.350> on<00:05:39.440> one

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
it and the most important thing on one

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.650 
it and the most important thing on one
of<00:05:39.650> these<00:05:39.830> cars<00:05:40.130> especially<00:05:40.430> on<00:05:40.910> an<00:05:41.030> oval<00:05:41.390> if

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
of these cars especially on an oval if

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.980 
of these cars especially on an oval if
one<00:05:42.110> of<00:05:42.260> these<00:05:42.350> pipes<00:05:42.770> come<00:05:43.160> off<00:05:43.310> or<00:05:44.240> just<00:05:44.720> leak

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
one of these pipes come off or just leak

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.770 
one of these pipes come off or just leak
that<00:05:45.740> can<00:05:46.010> cause<00:05:46.220> a<00:05:46.250> major<00:05:46.729> major<00:05:47.120> accident

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
that can cause a major major accident

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.110 
that can cause a major major accident
moving<00:05:48.650> to<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:48.860> back<00:05:49.010> of<00:05:49.190> the<00:05:49.250> car<00:05:49.490> completely

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
moving to the back of the car completely

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.409 
moving to the back of the car completely
now<00:05:50.330> you<00:05:51.289> can<00:05:51.470> see<00:05:51.650> the<00:05:51.830> major<00:05:52.010> difference

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
now you can see the major difference

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.260 
now you can see the major difference
between<00:05:53.419> an<00:05:53.840> f1<00:05:54.229> and<00:05:54.470> IndyCar<00:05:54.919> is<00:05:55.190> that<00:05:56.120> the

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
between an f1 and IndyCar is that the

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.850 
between an f1 and IndyCar is that the
underneath<00:05:56.510> of<00:05:56.810> the<00:05:56.900> car<00:05:57.110> finishes<00:05:57.680> at<00:05:57.830> the

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860

underneath of the car the reason for
that<00:06:22.610> is<00:06:22.970> that<00:06:23.180> in<00:06:23.389> a<00:06:23.450> Formula<00:06:23.810> One<00:06:23.960> car<00:06:24.200> it's<00:06:24.410> a

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
that is that in a Formula One car it's a

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.100 
that is that in a Formula One car it's a
completely<00:06:24.830> flat<00:06:25.039> bottomed<00:06:25.490> car<00:06:25.820> now<00:06:26.720> you

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
completely flat bottomed car now you

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.540 
completely flat bottomed car now you
know<00:06:27.350> Indy<00:06:27.680> casters

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
know Indy casters

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.520 
know Indy casters
the<00:06:29.030> cars<00:06:29.270> are<00:06:29.570> allowed<00:06:29.840> to<00:06:30.050> have<00:06:30.139> an<00:06:30.260> under

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
the cars are allowed to have an under

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.350 
the cars are allowed to have an under
wing<00:06:30.710> and<00:06:31.190> that's<00:06:31.460> how<00:06:31.580> we<00:06:31.639> generate<00:06:32.210> the

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
wing and that's how we generate the

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.960 
wing and that's how we generate the
downforce<00:06:32.900> so<00:06:33.680> that's<00:06:33.889> going<00:06:34.160> back<00:06:34.340> to<00:06:34.610> if<00:06:34.849> you

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
downforce so that's going back to if you

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.600 
downforce so that's going back to if you

accident already I mean if you can see
the<00:06:54.360> whole<00:06:54.539> thing<00:06:54.839> is<00:06:54.989> tilted<00:06:55.499> if<00:06:55.619> I<00:06:55.709> just<00:06:55.949> move

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:56.099 
the whole thing is tilted if I just move

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:58.279 
the whole thing is tilted if I just move
out<00:06:56.279> the<00:06:56.429> way<00:06:56.459> here<00:06:56.849> can<00:06:57.330> you<00:06:57.419> see<00:06:57.659> the<00:06:58.080> whole

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.289 
out the way here can you see the whole

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:01.519 
out the way here can you see the whole
thing<00:06:58.559> is<00:06:58.709> preloaded<00:06:59.279> to<00:06:59.580> the<00:06:59.699> left<00:06:59.909> and<00:07:00.529> that

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:01.529 
thing is preloaded to the left and that

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:03.439 
thing is preloaded to the left and that
makes<00:07:01.769> it<00:07:01.889> difficult<00:07:01.949> for<00:07:02.550> two<00:07:02.669> reasons<00:07:03.149> one

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:03.449 
makes it difficult for two reasons one

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:06.229 
makes it difficult for two reasons one
the<00:07:03.869> cars<00:07:04.139> always<00:07:04.469> turning<00:07:05.159> left<00:07:05.610> which<00:07:05.879> going

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:06.239 
the cars always turning left which going

00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:08.179 
the cars always turning left which going
into<00:07:06.509> their<00:07:06.659> fan<00:07:06.929> turns<00:07:07.259> is<00:07:07.529> sort<00:07:07.919> of<00:07:08.009> fairly

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:08.189 
into their fan turns is sort of fairly

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:10.279 
into their fan turns is sort of fairly
important<00:07:08.789> but<00:07:09.300> the<00:07:09.360> problem<00:07:09.719> is<00:07:09.839> as<00:07:09.989> you<00:07:10.110> come

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:10.289 
important but the problem is as you come

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:12.529 
important but the problem is as you come
out<00:07:10.409> the<00:07:10.589> turn<00:07:10.830> to<00:07:11.519> go<00:07:11.669> straight<00:07:12.059> you<00:07:12.330> must

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:12.539 
out the turn to go straight you must

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:15.049 
out the turn to go straight you must
exert<00:07:12.719> a<00:07:13.169> lot<00:07:13.409> of<00:07:13.469> force<00:07:13.619> in<00:07:14.159> the<00:07:14.729> opposite

00:07:15.049 --> 00:07:15.059 
exert a lot of force in the opposite

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:16.730 
exert a lot of force in the opposite
direction<00:07:15.209> to<00:07:15.719> keep<00:07:15.869> the<00:07:16.019> car<00:07:16.199> going<00:07:16.229> in<00:07:16.649> a

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 
direction to keep the car going in a

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.189 
direction to keep the car going in a
straight<00:07:16.800> line<00:07:17.300> the<00:07:18.300> other<00:07:18.389> important<00:07:18.959> thing

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 
straight line the other important thing

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:21.350 
straight line the other important thing
is<00:07:19.229> how<00:07:19.589> much<00:07:19.800> you<00:07:19.949> preload<00:07:20.459> the<00:07:20.699> left<00:07:20.909> side<00:07:21.119> to

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 
is how much you preload the left side to

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.719 
is how much you preload the left side to
the<00:07:21.419> right<00:07:21.659> side<00:07:21.740> the<00:07:22.740> springs<00:07:23.129> you<00:07:23.249> carry<00:07:23.550> on

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:23.729 
the right side the springs you carry on

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:26.149 
the right side the springs you carry on
the<00:07:23.849> right<00:07:24.029> side<00:07:24.330> to<00:07:24.539> the<00:07:24.569> left<00:07:24.689> also<00:07:25.110> and<00:07:25.589> the

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:26.159 
the right side to the left also and the

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:27.649 
the right side to the left also and the
cameras<00:07:26.610> that<00:07:26.789> are<00:07:26.849> on<00:07:27.059> the<00:07:27.179> car

00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:27.659 
cameras that are on the car

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:31.579 
cameras that are on the car
it<00:07:27.990> is<00:07:28.199> quite<00:07:28.439> phenomenal<00:07:28.679> it<00:07:29.129> really<00:07:29.459> is
