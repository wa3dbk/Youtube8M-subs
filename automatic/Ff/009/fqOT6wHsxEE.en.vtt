00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.650
 lower limit which is possible 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.750
 let's not better the situation in schools 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.709

 addition to everything assigned to the middle 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.319
 December bidding for fuel supply not 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.840
 took place therefore the boiler took 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.030
 decision to come austerity mode 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.340
 today works on residual fuel oil 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.829
 to somehow fix the situation yet 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.079
 December 18 Savinsky administration 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:07.549
 6 s were allocated from the regional budget 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.319
 half a million rubles for the purchase 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.329
 fuel oil however 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.670
 having money on hand local officials 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.370
 almost a month can provide a boiler room 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.349
 fuel and still looking for a supplier 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.930
 I thought that this moment is in 600 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.910
 tons 500 with pennies we will lead in the very 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.669
 but again this will allow 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.109
 quite simply 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:30.049
 stretch time to Michael not 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:33.079
 baggage bought that amount of ram so which 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.150
 was allowed to raise the temperature and in 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.280

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.870

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.940
 suppliers not yet on 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.400
 just ask to be honest on 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.709
 there is no money for us today 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.220
 consideration of the issue of prompt shipment 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.739
 fuel oil 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.420
 but at the moment I have so far 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.730
 information is not positive and 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.349
 negative residents of the village too 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:07.909
 hope that the frosts will recede 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:12.099
