to<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:09.959> today<00:00:10.320> about

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.320 

tire<00:00:13.800> sizes<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.760> first<00:00:14.970> one<00:00:15.060> we're<00:00:15.150> going<00:00:15.270> to

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
tire sizes the first one we're going to

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.030 
tire sizes the first one we're going to
talk<00:00:15.480> about<00:00:15.510> is<00:00:15.930> gonna<00:00:16.320> be<00:00:16.410> bolt<00:00:16.710> pattern

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
talk about is gonna be bolt pattern

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.590 
talk about is gonna be bolt pattern
there's<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.580> few<00:00:17.760> things<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.030> determine

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
there's a few things that determine

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.940 
there's a few things that determine
whether<00:00:18.840> or<00:00:18.930> not<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.260> wheel<00:00:19.380> fits<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> car

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
whether or not the wheel fits on a car

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.950 
whether or not the wheel fits on a car
how<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.280> fits<00:00:20.460> on<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.640> car<00:00:20.790> etc<00:00:20.850> first<00:00:21.690> one<00:00:21.869> is

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
how it fits on the car etc first one is

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.150 
how it fits on the car etc first one is
bolt<00:00:22.140> pattern<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.590> said<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:22.980> we're<00:00:23.070> gonna

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
bolt pattern as I said so we're gonna

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.950 
bolt pattern as I said so we're gonna
look<00:00:23.310> at<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.520> wheel<00:00:23.670> right<00:00:23.700> here<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.270> look

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
look at this wheel right here and look

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.600 
look at this wheel right here and look
right<00:00:25.470> here<00:00:25.680> right<00:00:26.040> where<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.189> bolt<00:00:26.400> holes

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
right here right where the bolt holes

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.550 
right here right where the bolt holes
are<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:27.360> particular<00:00:27.810> wheel<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.320> lot<00:00:28.529> of

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
are this particular wheel and a lot of

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.190 
are this particular wheel and a lot of
other<00:00:28.770> vowels<00:00:29.160> use<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> 5<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:29.760> 108<00:00:30.570> bolt<00:00:30.870> pattern

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
other vowels use a 5 on 108 bolt pattern

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
other vowels use a 5 on 108 bolt pattern
and<00:00:31.470> that's<00:00:31.590> how<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.770> bolt<00:00:31.890> patterns<00:00:32.160> are

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
and that's how the bolt patterns are

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.350 
and that's how the bolt patterns are
going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.400> be<00:00:32.489> when<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.730> hear<00:00:32.850> maybe<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> 1

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
going to be when you hear maybe a 1

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.180 
going to be when you hear maybe a 1
number<00:00:33.720> and<00:00:33.870> then<00:00:34.200> another<00:00:34.410> number<00:00:34.650> the<00:00:34.950> first

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
number and then another number the first

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.650 
number and then another number the first
number<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.730> how<00:00:36.000> many<00:00:36.059> bolts

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
number is going to be how many bolts

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.689 
number is going to be how many bolts
hold<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.170> wheel<00:00:37.410> onto<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> hub<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.160> this

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
hold that wheel onto the hub in this

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.670 
hold that wheel onto the hub in this
case<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> 5<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.390> 108<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.050> means<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.590> there

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
case on a 5 on 108 it means that there

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.130 
case on a 5 on 108 it means that there
are<00:00:40.770> 5<00:00:41.040> 1<00:00:41.730> 2<00:00:42.480> 3<00:00:43.199> 4<00:00:43.830> 5<00:00:44.190> now<00:00:44.730> 108<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.720> second<00:00:46.020> one

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
are 5 1 2 3 4 5 now 108 the second one

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.050 
are 5 1 2 3 4 5 now 108 the second one
is<00:00:46.290> actually<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.829> diameter<00:00:47.040> of<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.700> circle

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
is actually the diameter of the circle

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.729 
is actually the diameter of the circle
in<00:00:48.210> millimeters<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.810> that<00:00:49.050> bolt<00:00:49.260> pattern<00:00:49.500> sits

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
in millimeters of that bolt pattern sits

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.549 
in millimeters of that bolt pattern sits
on<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.399> if<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.610> imagine<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.940> circle<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.450> this<00:00:51.720> 5

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
on so if we imagine a circle like this 5

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.100 
on so if we imagine a circle like this 5
1<00:00:52.739> 108<00:00:53.280> means<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.670> there's<00:00:53.820> 5<00:00:54.239> bolt<00:00:54.930> holes

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
1 108 means that there's 5 bolt holes

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.260 
1 108 means that there's 5 bolt holes
around<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> outside<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.370> circle<00:00:56.970> that's<00:00:57.059> a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
around the outside on a circle that's a

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.610 
around the outside on a circle that's a
hundred<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.750> eight<00:00:57.870> millimeters<00:00:58.440> in

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
hundred and eight millimeters in

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.709 
hundred and eight millimeters in
diameter<00:00:58.950> now<00:00:59.910> if<00:01:00.059> you're<00:01:00.210> used<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.480> American

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
diameter now if you're used to American

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.209 
diameter now if you're used to American
car<00:01:01.050> terms<00:01:01.230> you'll<00:01:01.440> hear<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.800> as<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.190> a

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
car terms you'll hear this as like a

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.729 
car terms you'll hear this as like a
five<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.180> four<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.600> quarter<00:01:03.960> or<00:01:04.080> different

five on four and a quarter or different

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.290 
five on four and a quarter or different
numbers<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.070> exact<00:01:05.700> same<00:01:05.910> thing<00:01:05.970> is

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
numbers like that exact same thing is

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.030 
numbers like that exact same thing is
just<00:01:06.509> a<00:01:06.540> metric<00:01:06.810> versus<00:01:07.140> standard<00:01:07.470> first

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
just a metric versus standard first

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.410 
just a metric versus standard first
number<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.340> always<00:01:08.550> the<00:01:08.670> number<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.090> bullets

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
number is always the number of bullets

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.030 
number is always the number of bullets
the<00:01:09.570> second<00:01:09.869> one<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.410> diameter<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the second one is the diameter of the

the second one is the diameter of the
circle<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.460> those<00:01:11.610> bolts<00:01:11.940> bolt<00:01:12.210> onto<00:01:12.950> next

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950

time<00:01:14.039> we're<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.310> talk<00:01:14.430> about<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.759> offset

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
time we're going to talk about is offset

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.969 
time we're going to talk about is offset
sometimes<00:01:15.899> called<00:01:16.080> back<00:01:16.320> spacing<00:01:16.649> in<00:01:16.920> the

sometimes called back spacing in the
mobile<00:01:17.550> world<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.790> always<00:01:18.000> talk<00:01:18.119> about<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.390> as

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
mobile world we always talk about it as

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.450 
mobile world we always talk about it as
offset<00:01:18.600> now<00:01:19.470> offset<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:19.979> simply<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
offset now offset is simply just a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.300 
offset now offset is simply just a
matter<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:21.260> where<00:01:22.260> the<00:01:22.409> wheel<00:01:22.590> ends<00:01:22.979> up<00:01:23.070> being

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
matter of where the wheel ends up being

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.430 
matter of where the wheel ends up being
on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.820> hub<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.360> relation<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> centerline

on the hub in relation to the centerline
of<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.590> wheel<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.159> now<00:01:26.340> when<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.490> say<00:01:26.700> high<00:01:26.880> by

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
of the wheel and now when I say high by

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.179 
of the wheel and now when I say high by
me<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> actual<00:01:27.750> surface<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.619> car<00:01:28.799> on

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
me in the actual surface on the car on

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.920 
me in the actual surface on the car on
the<00:01:29.549> spindle<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.030> hub<00:01:30.210> where<00:01:30.630> your<00:01:30.780> wheel

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
the spindle of the hub where your wheel

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.780 
the spindle of the hub where your wheel
bolts<00:01:31.380> onto<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.920> that's<00:01:32.070> your<00:01:32.159> fixed<00:01:32.460> point<00:01:32.700> on

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
bolts onto so that's your fixed point on

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.230 
bolts onto so that's your fixed point on
the<00:01:32.880> car

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the car

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.480 
the car
now<00:01:33.720> again<00:01:33.960> offsets<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.500> going<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.770> be<00:01:34.920> just

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
now again offsets to going to be just

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.340 
now again offsets to going to be just
how<00:01:35.549> far<00:01:35.850> off<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.210> center<00:01:36.570> line<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.170> wheel

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
how far off that center line the wheel

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.560 
how far off that center line the wheel
ends<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.740> being<00:01:38.010> where<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> hub<00:01:38.760> is<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.180> where

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
ends up being where the hub is and where

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.420 
ends up being where the hub is and where
it<00:01:39.659> meets<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.500> if<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> wheel<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.369> has

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
it meets so if you have a wheel that has

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.910 
it meets so if you have a wheel that has
say<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> 25<00:01:42.630> millimeter<00:01:42.960> offset<00:01:43.530> which<00:01:43.770> is

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
say a 25 millimeter offset which is

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.890 
say a 25 millimeter offset which is
pretty<00:01:44.159> common<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.580> older<00:01:44.790> Volvo's<00:01:45.299> like<00:01:45.450> 247

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
pretty common on older Volvo's like 247

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.260 
pretty common on older Volvo's like 247
49<00:01:46.439> 40s<00:01:46.890> those<00:01:47.490> ones<00:01:47.759> are<00:01:47.909> gonna<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.210> about

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
49 40s those ones are gonna have about

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.120 
49 40s those ones are gonna have about
25<00:01:48.750> mil<00:01:48.960> offset<00:01:49.290> which<00:01:49.470> just<00:01:49.710> means<00:01:49.890> that

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
25 mil offset which just means that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.100 
25 mil offset which just means that
where<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> hub<00:01:51.000> ends<00:01:51.270> up<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.540> relation<00:01:51.900> to<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
where the hub ends up in relation to the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.870 
where the hub ends up in relation to the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
central line of the wheel is going to be

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.539 
central line of the wheel is going to be
25<00:01:54.810> millimeters<00:01:55.259> off<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.619> now<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.430> have

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
25 millimeters off that now if you have

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.569 
25 millimeters off that now if you have
a<00:01:56.579> newer<00:01:56.939> model<00:01:57.509> Volvo<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.140> an<00:01:58.259> 850<00:01:58.710> or<00:01:58.979> v70

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
a newer model Volvo like an 850 or v70

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.819 
a newer model Volvo like an 850 or v70
those<00:02:00.060> are<00:02:00.270> going<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> higher<00:02:01.170> offset

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
those are going to have a higher offset

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.370 
those are going to have a higher offset
somewhere<00:02:02.520> around<00:02:02.610> 38<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.479> 45<00:02:03.840> depending<00:02:04.290> on

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
somewhere around 38 to 45 depending on

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.440 
somewhere around 38 to 45 depending on
the<00:02:04.470> model<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.850> same<00:02:06.060> terms<00:02:06.329> that

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
the model now in the same terms that

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.180 
the model now in the same terms that
just<00:02:06.750> means<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.170> from<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.860> center<00:02:08.160> line

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
just means that from that center line

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.310 
just means that from that center line
instead<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.670> being<00:02:08.820> 25<00:02:09.299> millimeters<00:02:09.869> off<00:02:10.049> that

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
instead of being 25 millimeters off that

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.280 
instead of being 25 millimeters off that
it's<00:02:10.769> going<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.160> be<00:02:11.310> 40<00:02:12.269> or<00:02:12.299> 38<00:02:12.900> or<00:02:13.049> whatever

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
it's going to be 40 or 38 or whatever

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.690 
it's going to be 40 or 38 or whatever
that<00:02:13.380> number<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.680> off<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.370> it's<00:02:14.519> going<00:02:14.640> to

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
that number is off that so it's going to

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.030 
that number is off that so it's going to
effectively<00:02:15.000> change<00:02:15.540> where<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.440> hub<00:02:16.650> mating

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
effectively change where the hub mating

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.319 
effectively change where the hub mating
surface<00:02:17.370> ends<00:02:17.670> up<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:17.880> relation<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.269> the

and what it is let's talk real briefly

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.670 
and what it is let's talk real briefly
about<00:02:33.090> why<00:02:33.660> those<00:02:33.840> changeover<00:02:34.470> different

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
about why those changeover different

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.470 
about why those changeover different
Volvo<00:02:34.950> models<00:02:35.069> now<00:02:35.700> if<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.910> think<00:02:36.090> about<00:02:36.239> some

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
Volvo models now if you think about some

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.880 
Volvo models now if you think about some
of<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.629> earlier<00:02:36.900> ones<00:02:37.110> like<00:02:37.260> we<00:02:37.290> mentioned<00:02:37.560> -

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
of the earlier ones like we mentioned -

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.600 
of the earlier ones like we mentioned -
47<00:02:38.459> 49<00:02:38.879> 40<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.349> 25<00:02:40.980> mil<00:02:41.190> offset<00:02:41.519> as

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
47 49 40 the have that 25 mil offset as

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.100 
47 49 40 the have that 25 mil offset as
I<00:02:41.700> discussed<00:02:42.060> now<00:02:42.540> those<00:02:42.690> cars<00:02:42.930> were

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
I discussed now those cars were

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.570 
I discussed now those cars were
rear-wheel<00:02:43.620> drive<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.250> they<00:02:44.370> didn't<00:02:44.519> have

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
rear-wheel drive so they didn't have

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.729 
rear-wheel drive so they didn't have
Drive<00:02:44.940> axles<00:02:45.180> going<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.690> front<00:02:45.900> wheels<00:02:46.140> so

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
Drive axles going to the front wheels so

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:47.839 
Drive axles going to the front wheels so
it's<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.950> whole<00:02:47.069> different<00:02:47.370> story<00:02:47.519> on<00:02:47.640> how<00:02:47.760> they

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
it's a whole different story on how they

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.339 
it's a whole different story on how they
set<00:02:48.030> up<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.209> suspension<00:02:48.720> now<00:02:49.080> when<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.290> get

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
set up the suspension now when you get

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.839 
set up the suspension now when you get
into<00:02:49.560> some<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.860> newer<00:02:50.040> models<00:02:50.130> when<00:02:50.550> Volvo

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
into some of the newer models when Volvo

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.309 
into some of the newer models when Volvo
flipped<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.300> motor<00:02:51.480> or<00:02:51.690> turned<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.050> 90

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
flipped the motor or turned it 90

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.479 
flipped the motor or turned it 90

have a lot more stuff that has to fit up
there<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:59.160> have<00:02:59.310> brakes<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.730> have<00:02:59.819> to<00:02:59.910> fit

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
there you have brakes that have to fit

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.640 
there you have brakes that have to fit
up<00:03:00.150> there<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:00.660> have<00:03:00.780> drive<00:03:01.110> lines<00:03:01.319> need<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.560> go

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
up there you have drive lines need to go

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.559 
up there you have drive lines need to go
up<00:03:01.739> there<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.400> as<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.880> result<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.299> that<00:03:03.390> the

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
up there so as a result of that the

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.199 
up there so as a result of that the
offset<00:03:03.989> got<00:03:04.200> higher<00:03:04.799> meaning<00:03:05.579> that<00:03:05.849> the

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
offset got higher meaning that the

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.120 
offset got higher meaning that the
centre<00:03:06.690> line<00:03:06.840> was<00:03:07.049> different<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.950> little

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
centre line was different and a little

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.770 
centre line was different and a little
bit<00:03:08.250> further<00:03:08.489> off<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.090> center<00:03:09.329> face<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.690> the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
bit further off the center face of the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.300 
bit further off the center face of the
wheel<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.230> that's<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.650> compensate<00:03:11.069> for<00:03:11.190> some

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
wheel and that's to compensate for some

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.270 
wheel and that's to compensate for some
of<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.459> extra<00:03:11.790> stuff<00:03:11.849> that's<00:03:12.420> just<00:03:12.510> in<00:03:12.780> there

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
of that extra stuff that's just in there

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.080 
of that extra stuff that's just in there
the<00:03:14.280> last<00:03:14.370> thing<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:14.610> want<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.819> talk<00:03:14.940> about

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
the last thing I want to talk about

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.789 
the last thing I want to talk about
four-wheel<00:03:15.750> sizing<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.410> how<00:03:16.470> they<00:03:16.590> fit<00:03:16.680> on

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
four-wheel sizing and how they fit on

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.920 
four-wheel sizing and how they fit on
the<00:03:16.860> car<00:03:17.010> is<00:03:17.130> going<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.370> be<00:03:17.430> hub<00:03:17.790> bore<00:03:18.120> now<00:03:18.750> as

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
the car is going to be hub bore now as

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.120 
the car is going to be hub bore now as
we<00:03:19.049> talked<00:03:19.230> about<00:03:19.349> before<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.769> hub<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.099> the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
we talked about before the hub is the

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.289 
we talked about before the hub is the
piece<00:03:20.370> on<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.579> car<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.910> wheel<00:03:21.030> bolts

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
piece on the car that the wheel bolts

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.650 
piece on the car that the wheel bolts

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
onto and the hub bore is going to be

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.240 
onto and the hub bore is going to be
specifically<00:03:25.079> this<00:03:25.560> little<00:03:25.890> section<00:03:26.220> right

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
specifically this little section right

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.120 
specifically this little section right
here<00:03:26.610> on<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.819> center<00:03:27.180> now<00:03:27.810> Volvo<00:03:28.709> uses<00:03:29.010> on

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
here on the center now Volvo uses on

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.430 
here on the center now Volvo uses on
most<00:03:29.340> their<00:03:29.489> cars<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.760> 65.1<00:03:30.630> hub<00:03:30.810> bore<00:03:30.989> some<00:03:31.380> of

most their cars a 65.1 hub bore some of

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.319 
most their cars a 65.1 hub bore some of
them<00:03:31.530> use<00:03:31.620> 63<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.670> exact<00:03:32.970> numbers<00:03:33.209> being

them use 63 the exact numbers being

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:34.940 
them use 63 the exact numbers being
irrelevant<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.900> idea<00:03:34.170> there<00:03:34.410> is<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.620> at<00:03:34.829> the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
irrelevant the idea there is that at the

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.650 
irrelevant the idea there is that at the
end<00:03:35.100> of<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.459> hub<00:03:35.819> where<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.090> wheel<00:03:36.209> bolts<00:03:36.540> on

end of the hub where the wheel bolts on
there's<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.930> little<00:03:37.109> lip<00:03:37.260> that<00:03:37.440> comes<00:03:37.650> off<00:03:37.799> of

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
there's a little lip that comes off of

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.860 
there's a little lip that comes off of
it<00:03:38.010> sticks<00:03:38.340> off<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.120> reason<00:03:39.269> Volvo<00:03:39.660> did

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
it sticks off and the reason Volvo did

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.090 
it sticks off and the reason Volvo did
that<00:03:40.019> and<00:03:40.170> why<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.290> reason<00:03:40.530> why<00:03:40.650> most<00:03:40.799> car

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
that and why the reason why most car

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.770 
that and why the reason why most car
manufacturers<00:03:41.670> do<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.000> is<00:03:42.180> so<00:03:42.600> that<00:03:42.750> that

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
manufacturers do that is so that that

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.410 
manufacturers do that is so that that
piece<00:03:43.200> can<00:03:43.470> be<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.829> positive<00:03:44.310> fit<00:03:44.880> directly

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
piece can be a positive fit directly

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.690 
piece can be a positive fit directly
into<00:03:45.630> this<00:03:46.019> hub<00:03:46.319> bore<00:03:46.530> on<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.859> wheel<00:03:47.040> so<00:03:47.609> it

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
into this hub bore on the wheel so it

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.670 
into this hub bore on the wheel so it
Nestle's<00:03:48.120> nice<00:03:48.329> and<00:03:48.569> tight<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.350> function

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
Nestle's nice and tight and the function

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.949 
Nestle's nice and tight and the function
of<00:03:49.799> that<00:03:49.829> is<00:03:50.160> for<00:03:50.639> it<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.940> Center<00:03:51.840> it

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
of that is for it to Center it

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.199 
of that is for it to Center it
beautifully<00:03:52.560> right<00:03:52.980> on<00:03:53.130> there<00:03:53.340> evenly<00:03:54.000> so

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
beautifully right on there evenly so

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.220 
beautifully right on there evenly so
that<00:03:54.329> when<00:03:54.420> you're<00:03:54.540> tightening<00:03:54.750> your<00:03:55.049> lug

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
that when you're tightening your lug

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.479 
that when you're tightening your lug
nuts<00:03:55.260> it's<00:03:55.590> less<00:03:55.799> likely<00:03:56.069> to<00:03:56.130> get<00:03:56.280> off<00:03:56.459> a

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
nuts it's less likely to get off a

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:57.830 
nuts it's less likely to get off a
little<00:03:56.609> bit<00:03:56.880> less<00:03:57.120> likely<00:03:57.329> to<00:03:57.480> cause<00:03:57.630> wheel

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
little bit less likely to cause wheel

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.900 
little bit less likely to cause wheel
wobble<00:03:58.109> it's<00:03:58.739> just<00:03:58.980> there<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.280> simply<00:03:59.549> Center

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
wobble it's just there to simply Center

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.670 
wobble it's just there to simply Center
things<00:04:00.060> but<00:04:00.690> how<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:01.019> translates<00:04:01.440> if<00:04:01.560> you're

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
things but how that translates if you're

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.860 
things but how that translates if you're
talking<00:04:01.829> about<00:04:02.010> fitting<00:04:02.400> wheels<00:04:02.670> is<00:04:02.910> that<00:04:03.660> if

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
talking about fitting wheels is that if

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.150 
talking about fitting wheels is that if
you<00:04:03.989> have<00:04:04.170> something<00:04:04.410> that<00:04:04.500> has<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.709> hub<00:04:04.980> bore

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
you have something that has a hub bore

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.250 
you have something that has a hub bore
and<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.340> wheel<00:04:05.459> say<00:04:05.639> that's<00:04:05.850> too<00:04:06.030> small<00:04:06.299> it<00:04:06.810> just

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
and a wheel say that's too small it just

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.050 
and a wheel say that's too small it just
might<00:04:07.410> not<00:04:07.440> fit<00:04:07.799> if<00:04:08.040> on<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.639> other<00:04:08.760> hand<00:04:08.970> you

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
might not fit if on the other hand you

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.849 
might not fit if on the other hand you
have<00:04:09.090> one<00:04:09.329> too<00:04:09.480> big<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.530> have<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.769> do

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
have one too big you have to do

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.680 
have one too big you have to do
something<00:04:11.160> like<00:04:11.280> run<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.519> hub<00:04:11.849> centric<00:04:12.180> spacer

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
something like run a hub centric spacer

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.210 
something like run a hub centric spacer
and<00:04:12.810> that's<00:04:13.260> a<00:04:13.349> real<00:04:13.470> common<00:04:13.709> practice<00:04:14.099> as

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
and that's a real common practice as

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.800 
and that's a real common practice as
well<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:14.549> again<00:04:14.639> that's<00:04:14.970> just<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.329> push<00:04:15.630> in

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
well and again that's just to push in

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.719 
well and again that's just to push in
there<00:04:15.959> so<00:04:16.200> that<00:04:16.349> it<00:04:16.440> makes<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:16.799> Junction

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
there so that it makes that Junction

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.729 
there so that it makes that Junction
nice<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.299> perfect<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:18.810> even<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.320> Center<00:04:19.650> the

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
nice and perfect and even to Center the

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.850 
nice and perfect and even to Center the
wheel<00:04:19.889> while<00:04:20.099> you<00:04:20.220> bolt<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.549> down<00:04:21.680> so<00:04:22.680> now<00:04:22.710> that

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
wheel while you bolt it down so now that

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.260 
wheel while you bolt it down so now that
we've<00:04:22.979> talked<00:04:23.130> about<00:04:23.190> wheel<00:04:23.610> terms<00:04:23.910> in<00:04:24.090> wheel

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
we've talked about wheel terms in wheel

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.300 
we've talked about wheel terms in wheel
sizing<00:04:24.690> let's<00:04:24.840> talk<00:04:25.020> about<00:04:25.169> tires<00:04:25.770> it's<00:04:26.250> a

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
sizing let's talk about tires it's a

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.469 
sizing let's talk about tires it's a
little<00:04:26.460> more<00:04:26.550> confusing<00:04:26.910> subject<00:04:27.150> for<00:04:27.389> a<00:04:27.450> lot

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
little more confusing subject for a lot

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:28.460 
little more confusing subject for a lot
of<00:04:27.570> people<00:04:27.840> but<00:04:27.990> let's<00:04:28.139> make<00:04:28.289> it<00:04:28.349> a<00:04:28.440> little

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
of people but let's make it a little

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.290 
of people but let's make it a little
more<00:04:28.650> clear<00:04:28.979> these<00:04:29.520> get<00:04:29.700> a<00:04:29.729> little<00:04:29.970> confusing

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
more clear these get a little confusing

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
more clear these get a little confusing
because<00:04:30.479> of<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.780> fact<00:04:30.960> that<00:04:31.020> there's<00:04:31.200> always

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
because of the fact that there's always

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.629 
because of the fact that there's always
going<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.530> be<00:04:31.590> three<00:04:32.039> numbers<00:04:32.370> associated

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
going to be three numbers associated

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.670 
going to be three numbers associated
with<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.120> tire<00:04:33.270> size<00:04:33.510> and<00:04:33.780> it's<00:04:34.139> a<00:04:34.229> mix<00:04:34.530> of

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
with the tire size and it's a mix of

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.320 
with the tire size and it's a mix of
different<00:04:34.950> things<00:04:35.130> one<00:04:35.729> of<00:04:35.760> them<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.120> first

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
different things one of them the first

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.370 
different things one of them the first
one's<00:04:36.510> going<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.720> be<00:04:36.780> a<00:04:36.810> millimeter<00:04:37.200> the

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
one's going to be a millimeter the

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.779 
one's going to be a millimeter the
second<00:04:37.680> one's<00:04:37.800> an<00:04:37.919> aspect<00:04:38.460> ratio<00:04:38.729> a

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
second one's an aspect ratio a

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.429 
second one's an aspect ratio a
percentage<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.360> third<00:04:39.539> one<00:04:39.690> is<00:04:39.840> an<00:04:39.990> inch

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:40.439 
percentage of the third one is an inch

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:42.859 
percentage of the third one is an inch
so<00:04:41.099> breaking<00:04:41.489> it<00:04:41.580> down<00:04:41.639> first<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.629> first

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:42.869 
so breaking it down first the first

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:44.959 
so breaking it down first the first
number<00:04:43.169> let's<00:04:43.439> make<00:04:43.619> for<00:04:43.769> an<00:04:43.860> example<00:04:44.099> at<00:04:44.309> 2:15

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:44.969 
number let's make for an example at 2:15

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:47.419 
number let's make for an example at 2:15
45<00:04:45.569> 17<00:04:46.199> now<00:04:46.679> that's<00:04:46.860> going<00:04:46.979> to<00:04:47.069> be<00:04:47.189> a<00:04:47.219> very

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:47.429 
45 17 now that's going to be a very

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:50.299 
45 17 now that's going to be a very
specific<00:04:47.669> tire<00:04:48.089> size<00:04:48.389> so<00:04:49.139> 215<00:04:49.860> what<00:04:50.159> does<00:04:50.279> that

00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:50.309 
specific tire size so 215 what does that

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:52.339 
specific tire size so 215 what does that
mean<00:04:50.580> that's<00:04:51.149> going<00:04:51.389> to<00:04:51.479> be<00:04:51.569> the<00:04:51.749> tread<00:04:52.139> width

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
mean that's going to be the tread width

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.229 
mean that's going to be the tread width
and<00:04:52.589> millimeter<00:04:53.099> that's<00:04:53.519> the<00:04:53.729> actual<00:04:53.999> width

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:54.239 
and millimeter that's the actual width

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:55.999 
and millimeter that's the actual width
of<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:54.479> contact<00:04:54.899> patch<00:04:55.050> on<00:04:55.289> the<00:04:55.559> pavement<00:04:55.949> of

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
of the contact patch on the pavement of

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.639 
of the contact patch on the pavement of
the<00:04:56.099> tire<00:04:56.519> so<00:04:56.819> we<00:04:57.269> got<00:04:57.389> that<00:04:57.569> one<00:04:57.749> down<00:04:57.959> to<00:04:58.289> 15

00:04:58.639 --> 00:04:58.649 
the tire so we got that one down to 15

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:01.070 
the tire so we got that one down to 15
millimeter<00:04:59.069> wide<00:04:59.249> next<00:05:00.179> one<00:05:00.360> is<00:05:00.569> going<00:05:00.839> to<00:05:00.929> be

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
millimeter wide next one is going to be

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.559 
millimeter wide next one is going to be
our<00:05:01.289> 45<00:05:02.069> in<00:05:02.399> this<00:05:02.550> example<00:05:02.999> which<00:05:03.330> is<00:05:03.449> our

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
our 45 in this example which is our

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.959 
our 45 in this example which is our
aspect<00:05:04.169> ratio<00:05:04.529> this<00:05:05.159> is<00:05:05.219> the<00:05:05.580> way<00:05:05.699> that<00:05:05.849> you're

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:05.969 
aspect ratio this is the way that you're

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:07.609 
aspect ratio this is the way that you're
going<00:05:06.149> to<00:05:06.239> determine<00:05:06.449> how<00:05:06.719> tall<00:05:07.019> the<00:05:07.169> sidewall

00:05:07.609 --> 00:05:07.619 
going to determine how tall the sidewall

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:09.379 
going to determine how tall the sidewall
is<00:05:07.860> that's<00:05:08.550> part<00:05:08.759> that<00:05:08.879> you<00:05:08.939> actually<00:05:09.059> see

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
is that's part that you actually see

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.939 
is that's part that you actually see
when<00:05:09.539> you're<00:05:09.659> looking<00:05:09.689> at<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.439> difference<00:05:10.860> in

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
when you're looking at the difference in

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:12.079 
when you're looking at the difference in
diameter<00:05:11.159> between<00:05:11.399> the<00:05:11.610> wheel<00:05:11.759> and<00:05:11.789> the

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:12.089 
diameter between the wheel and the

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:13.699 
diameter between the wheel and the
outside<00:05:12.479> of<00:05:12.509> the<00:05:12.629> tire<00:05:12.779> now<00:05:13.349> to<00:05:13.409> make<00:05:13.589> this

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:13.709 
outside of the tire now to make this

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:14.509 
outside of the tire now to make this
more<00:05:13.769> confusing

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:14.519 
more confusing

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:16.999 
more confusing
that<00:05:14.759> doesn't<00:05:15.089> mean<00:05:15.179> it's<00:05:15.360> 45<00:05:15.869> mil<00:05:16.169> high<00:05:16.439> it

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
that doesn't mean it's 45 mil high it

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.819 
that doesn't mean it's 45 mil high it
actually<00:05:17.429> means<00:05:17.610> that<00:05:17.699> it's<00:05:17.929> 45%<00:05:18.929> as<00:05:19.050> tall<00:05:19.589> as

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:19.829 
actually means that it's 45% as tall as

00:05:19.829 --> 00:05:22.129 
actually means that it's 45% as tall as
the<00:05:19.889> tread<00:05:20.519> width<00:05:20.699> is<00:05:20.879> wide<00:05:21.239> that's<00:05:21.899> why<00:05:22.079> it

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
the tread width is wide that's why it

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:23.269 
the tread width is wide that's why it
will<00:05:22.289> vary<00:05:22.679> and<00:05:22.829> that's<00:05:22.979> why<00:05:23.099> it's<00:05:23.219> a

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:23.279 
will vary and that's why it's a

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:24.979 
will vary and that's why it's a
percentage<00:05:23.729> in<00:05:23.849> an<00:05:23.939> aspect<00:05:24.300> ratio<00:05:24.689> and<00:05:24.779> not<00:05:24.959> a

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:24.989 
percentage in an aspect ratio and not a

00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:27.139 
percentage in an aspect ratio and not a
static<00:05:25.379> number<00:05:25.459> now<00:05:26.459> the<00:05:26.519> last<00:05:26.789> one<00:05:26.969> that

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:27.149 
static number now the last one that

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:28.459 
static number now the last one that
we're<00:05:27.269> gonna<00:05:27.360> talk<00:05:27.509> about<00:05:27.539> is<00:05:27.839> super<00:05:28.110> easy<00:05:28.169> in

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
we're gonna talk about is super easy in

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:31.519 
we're gonna talk about is super easy in
our<00:05:28.769> example<00:05:29.189> of<00:05:29.249> a<00:05:29.339> 215<00:05:29.969> 45<00:05:30.449> 17<00:05:30.899> that's<00:05:31.289> just

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:31.529 
our example of a 215 45 17 that's just

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:33.889 
our example of a 215 45 17 that's just
the<00:05:31.619> diameter<00:05:32.039> of<00:05:32.069> the<00:05:32.219> wheel<00:05:32.339> so<00:05:33.179> think<00:05:33.719> about

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:33.899 
the diameter of the wheel so think about

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:35.149 
the diameter of the wheel so think about
it<00:05:33.989> to<00:05:34.289> simplify<00:05:34.679> it<00:05:34.739> in<00:05:34.829> your<00:05:34.949> head<00:05:35.039> when

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
it to simplify it in your head when

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.469 
it to simplify it in your head when
you're<00:05:35.249> looking<00:05:35.429> at<00:05:35.579> it<00:05:35.669> the<00:05:35.999> first<00:05:36.209> number

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
you're looking at it the first number

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.769 
you're looking at it the first number
215<00:05:37.169> 225<00:05:37.739> 205<00:05:38.519> whatever<00:05:38.819> that<00:05:38.969> is<00:05:39.089> that's<00:05:39.509> the

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:39.779 
215 225 205 whatever that is that's the

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.049 
215 225 205 whatever that is that's the

number is in this example is going to

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.809 
number is in this example is going to
vary<00:05:46.259> and<00:05:46.379> that's<00:05:46.559> going<00:05:46.740> to<00:05:46.829> be<00:05:47.039> how<00:05:47.459> tall
