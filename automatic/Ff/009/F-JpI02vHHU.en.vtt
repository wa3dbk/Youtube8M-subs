00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
ground doing over power moves dynamics

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.820 
ground doing over power moves dynamics
freezes<00:00:14.809> so<00:00:15.809> when<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.020> start<00:00:16.289> up<00:00:16.379> on<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.590> channel

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
freezes so when I start up on a channel

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.470 
freezes so when I start up on a channel

like the video percentage so I'm like

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.970 
like the video percentage so I'm like
it's<00:00:18.990> pretty<00:00:19.140> much<00:00:19.260> I'm<00:00:19.439> writing<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.770> whole

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
it's pretty much I'm writing a whole

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.700 
it's pretty much I'm writing a whole
essay<00:00:21.260> so<00:00:22.260> when<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.529> dance<00:00:23.000> I'm<00:00:24.000> starting<00:00:24.390> off

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
essay so when I dance I'm starting off

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.140 
essay so when I dance I'm starting off
this<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:27.740> change<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.400> find<00:00:29.910> different

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
this I change it up I find different

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.229 
this I change it up I find different
ways<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.420> get<00:00:30.539> into<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:31.250> then<00:00:32.540> down<00:00:35.120> into<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
ways to get into it then down into the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:48.740 
ways to get into it then down into the
body<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:38.210> think<00:00:39.210> footwork<00:00:42.020> this<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:47.750> my

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
body of it I think footwork this is my

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.240 
body of it I think footwork this is my
asset

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.680 

so<00:00:53.250> then<00:00:54.770> don't<00:00:55.770> want<00:00:55.950> to<00:00:56.040> end<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.250> off<00:00:56.400> I<00:00:56.760> can

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
so then don't want to end it off I can

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.590 
so then don't want to end it off I can
end<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.930> off<00:00:58.080> with<00:00:58.110> something<00:00:59.390> less<00:01:00.390> dynamic

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
end it off with something less dynamic

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.960 
end it off with something less dynamic
like<00:01:00.990> this<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.500> spun<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:01.920> that's<00:01:02.730> like

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
like this like I spun up that's like

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.219 
like this like I spun up that's like
that's<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.420> an<00:01:03.600> ellipses<00:01:04.230> to<00:01:04.440> be<00:01:04.680> continued

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.810 

when<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.350> something<00:01:10.650> else<00:01:10.920> something<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
when I do something else something a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:24.980 
when I do something else something a
little<00:01:12.060> bit<00:01:12.150> more<00:01:12.180> than<00:01:12.450> dynamic<00:01:23.330> more<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.750> an

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
little bit more than dynamic more of an

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.719 
little bit more than dynamic more of an
exclamation<00:01:25.290> mark

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.130 

so<00:01:29.729> when<00:01:30.290> but<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.250> downside<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.750> what<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> do

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
so when but is it downside so what I do

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.480 
so when but is it downside so what I do
something<00:01:34.550> that<00:01:35.550> I<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.880> do<00:01:36.140> properly<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:39.470> crash

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
something that I can do properly I crash

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:51.790 
something that I can do properly I crash
that's<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.640> question<00:01:46.550> what<00:01:47.550> finish<00:01:47.850> something

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.780 

that's<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:52.920> breeze<00:01:53.420> that's<00:01:54.420> my<00:01:54.570> theory
