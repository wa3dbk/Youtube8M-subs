shavon shavon can actually be heated up
with<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.690> heat<00:02:08.929> gun<00:02:08.959> which<00:02:09.470> causes<00:02:09.890> it<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.069> get

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
with a heat gun which causes it to get

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.790 
with a heat gun which causes it to get
soft<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:10.880> pliable<00:02:11.209> normally<00:02:12.110> it's<00:02:12.290> usually

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
soft and pliable normally it's usually

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.400

pretty waxy and hard to work with but by

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.110 
pretty waxy and hard to work with but by
heating<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.799> up<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.190> makes<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.519> easier<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.090> you

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
heating it up it makes it easier and you

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.600 
heating it up it makes it easier and you
can<00:02:17.390> create<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:18.049> armature<00:02:18.830> base<00:02:19.010> with<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.400> like

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
can create a armature base with it like

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.190 
can create a armature base with it like
I'm<00:02:19.790> doing<00:02:20.030> here<00:02:20.239> I'm<00:02:20.450> putting<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:20.810> on<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.900> stick

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
I'm doing here I'm putting it on a stick

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.809 
I'm doing here I'm putting it on a stick
eventually<00:02:21.920> going<00:02:22.069> to<00:02:22.130> make<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.340> sculpture<00:02:22.580> out

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
eventually going to make a sculpture out

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.550

of<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.750> I'm<00:02:23.810> just<00:02:23.959> starting<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.410> base

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
of it so I'm just starting the base

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.020 
of it so I'm just starting the base
right<00:02:24.799> there<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.099> heating<00:02:25.519> it<00:02:25.610> up<00:02:25.730> and

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
right there and heating it up and

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.530 
right there and heating it up and
squishing<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:26.840> siobhan<00:02:27.739> is<00:02:28.040> also<00:02:28.489> possible<00:02:29.150> to

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
squishing it siobhan is also possible to

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.080 
squishing it siobhan is also possible to
get<00:02:29.780> hard<00:02:30.080> again<00:02:30.230> by<00:02:30.620> making<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.250> cold<00:02:31.519> with<00:02:31.880> a

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
get hard again by making it cold with a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.150 
get hard again by making it cold with a
can<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.540> air<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.290> can<00:02:33.440> go<00:02:33.530> buy<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.709> can<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:34.040> air
