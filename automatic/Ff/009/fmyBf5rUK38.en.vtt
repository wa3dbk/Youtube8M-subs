00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
not going to decondition what I do is I

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.390 
not going to decondition what I do is I
shampoo<00:04:46.800> my<00:04:46.950> hair<00:04:46.980> and<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.850> use<00:04:48.180> my<00:04:49.190> apple<00:04:50.190> cider

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
shampoo my hair and I use my apple cider

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.330 
shampoo my hair and I use my apple cider
vinegar<00:04:50.610> I<00:04:51.240> mix<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:51.870> like<00:04:51.900> a<00:04:52.050> cup<00:04:52.380> of<00:04:52.530> a<00:04:52.560> half

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
vinegar I mix it like a cup of a half

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.030 
vinegar I mix it like a cup of a half
apple<00:04:53.790> cider<00:04:53.940> half<00:04:54.330> water<00:04:54.690> mixture<00:04:55.320> and<00:04:55.530> I

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
apple cider half water mixture and I

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.280 
apple cider half water mixture and I
just<00:04:56.250> poured<00:04:56.490> in<00:04:56.610> my<00:04:56.700> hair<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:57.260> after<00:04:58.260> I

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
just poured in my hair and after I

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.560 
just poured in my hair and after I
shampoo<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:58.980> this<00:04:59.550> works<00:04:59.790> really<00:04:59.910> well<00:05:00.510> for

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
shampoo and this works really well for

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.510 
shampoo and this works really well for
very<00:05:00.990> porous<00:05:01.470> hair<00:05:01.740> so<00:05:01.950> if<00:05:02.010> you<00:05:02.130> have<00:05:02.280> hair

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
very porous hair so if you have hair

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.880 
very porous hair so if you have hair
that<00:05:02.550> really<00:05:02.880> soaks<00:05:03.210> up<00:05:03.360> water<00:05:03.650> really<00:05:04.650> quick

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
that really soaks up water really quick

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.590 
that really soaks up water really quick
then<00:05:05.220> you<00:05:05.340> know<00:05:05.460> your<00:05:05.640> hair<00:05:05.790> is<00:05:05.820> really<00:05:06.090> porous

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
then you know your hair is really porous

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.170 
then you know your hair is really porous
you<00:05:06.890> can<00:05:07.890> do<00:05:07.980> a<00:05:08.010> test<00:05:08.280> cut<00:05:08.640> off<00:05:08.730> a<00:05:08.760> little<00:05:09.060> bit

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
you can do a test cut off a little bit

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.820 
you can do a test cut off a little bit
