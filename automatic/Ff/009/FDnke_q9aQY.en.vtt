a few moments because there are three

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.600 
a few moments because there are three

a number<00:02:00.850> of<00:02:00.940> attacks<00:02:01.240> but<00:02:01.780> Judy<00:02:02.320> I<00:02:02.380> would

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
a number of attacks but Judy I would

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.230 
a number of attacks but Judy I would
notice<00:02:02.890> if<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.340> bunch<00:02:03.520> of<00:02:03.580> Nod<00:02:03.760> tanks<00:02:04.150> were

rolling around stealing vehicles so the

second component of a mission is a

second component of a mission is a
distraction<00:02:07.900> where<00:02:08.350> you<00:02:08.890> attack<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.460> GDI

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
distraction where you attack the GDI

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.280 
distraction where you attack the GDI
base<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.300> you<00:02:10.720> disrupt<00:02:11.140> their

base and you disrupt their
communications<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.100> that<00:02:12.280> they're<00:02:12.700> not<00:02:12.850> able

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
some mamet's get sent towards you you

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.910 
some mamet's get sent towards you you
can<00:02:31.900> knock<00:02:32.050> those<00:02:32.200> out<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.650> use<00:02:32.770> your

can knock those out and use your

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.949 
can knock those out and use your
engineers<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.550> send<00:02:33.760> them<00:02:33.850> back<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.810> that

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
engineers to send them back and that

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.810 
engineers to send them back and that
works<00:02:35.110> just<00:02:35.230> as<00:02:35.440> well<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:36.040> key<00:02:36.280> things<00:02:36.610> with

recommend<00:03:02.410> you<00:03:02.440> plant<00:03:02.709> i<00:03:02.800> think<00:03:02.980> it's<00:03:03.070> pretty

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
recommend you plant i think it's pretty

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.039 
recommend you plant i think it's pretty
cool<00:03:03.400> well<00:03:04.060> i<00:03:04.090> think<00:03:04.209> it<00:03:04.390> gives<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.750> lot<00:03:04.930> more

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
cool well i think it gives a lot more

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.990 
cool well i think it gives a lot more
context<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.739> story<00:03:06.040> between<00:03:06.549> Kane<00:03:06.970> and

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
context to the story between Kane and

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.789 
context to the story between Kane and
all<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.630> so<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.900> splinter<00:03:08.170> factions<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.590> nod

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
all the so the splinter factions of nod

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.880 
all the so the splinter factions of nod
and<00:03:09.040> any<00:03:09.910> additional<00:03:10.470> backstory<00:03:11.470> you<00:03:11.590> can<00:03:11.739> get

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
and any additional backstory you can get

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.050 
and any additional backstory you can get
I<00:03:11.920> think<00:03:12.040> adds<00:03:12.310> flavor<00:03:12.610> to<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.850> entire

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
I think adds flavor to the entire

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.240 
I think adds flavor to the entire
campaign<00:03:13.390> this<00:03:14.080> is<00:03:14.260> Sam<00:03:14.470> Bass<00:03:14.650> encouraging
