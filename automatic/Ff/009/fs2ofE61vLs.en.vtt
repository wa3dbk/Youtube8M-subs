00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.710 
nearly failed and I tried to leave I
left<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.310> for<00:03:18.370> about<00:03:18.610> an<00:03:19.030> hour<00:03:19.180> or<00:03:19.420> two<00:03:19.570> after

think of most of the tnt walls above the
air<00:03:49.990> as<00:03:50.200> well<00:03:50.350> which<00:03:50.590> I<00:03:50.680> failed<00:03:50.920> out<00:03:51.100> again<00:03:51.490> but
