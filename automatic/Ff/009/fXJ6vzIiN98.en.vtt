00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.719
 hi guys found at my channel which 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.219
 sergio 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.410
 welcome back to my channel you find in 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.109
 today no recipes I wanted to cook today 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.270
 show some integration that I use 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.000
 you are asked questions on youtube 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.619
 and on other social networks with the asked 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.269
 exactly what kind of interactions 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.070
 did inside of us yes 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.060
 supplements that I use basically 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.830
 these are the alms in three 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.809
 categories both those I use 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.809
 regularly most days that 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.700
 they are essentially a supplement 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.239
 this multivitamin should never 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.160
 miss in my experience very 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.340
 those who do minico use it practically all 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.829
 then the days of omega 3 biscione 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.289
 which as you know are in the form of 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.640
 this type of oil pastigliette 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.620
 then a supplement of mineral salts 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.390
 also this on one who studies a lot 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.160
 I run so much I do a lot of sport and 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.960
 resistance on the much so a 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.080
 I use this kind of a lot 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.170
 Supplements are closed supplements 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.119
 practically every day while here 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.110
 we have some protein powder 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.710
 throats protect isolated proteins and use 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.540
 let's say not really every day but 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.670
 quite regularly however ne 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.920
 take a simone I buy maximum one 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.950
 kilo a month so I never spend more 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.740
 of 60 euros per month of protein after 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.850
 I inspire exactly as I see it 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.290
 such as 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.810
 finally protein integration of 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.420
 branched amino acids of creatine 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.060
 this as supplements that I don't use 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.700
 practically never apart from a few blocks 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.200
 moments of the year such as when 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.610
 I'm under race we need 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.640
 recover rather quickly 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.979
 then that dose the friends of the maps do not 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.470
 it's a rule I don't particularly use them 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.670
 the same the bad creatine maybe 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.399
 the last time I used it, it's done 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.190
 maybe last year a good memory 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.519
 certain moments I want to increase 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.380
 the loads no longer had to 

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:11.790
 invite a little then loads at the gym 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.450
 basically i think they are 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.000
 not so we also have supplement 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.130
 I know this great utility I don't know if 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.780
 how sincerely they are 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.420
 basically this supplements 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.310
 that I actually use guys I don't see 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.410
 so happy the industry 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.180
 more than anything else, I don't know if 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.360
 have you noticed when you go fat 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.549
 supplement to take protein 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.739
 are secret in the super label photo 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:42.780
 of surfaces of polygons own builder 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.130
 how it is possible that as possible 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.600
 get a physique like that with a 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.790
 This jar of protein seems to me 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.650
 a bit of a speed a little misleading a 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.600
 I don't see so much for this 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.690
 good eye proteins are proteins 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.030
 not away in unearthly naturally in 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.859
 physicist of the genus a question that me 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.060
 is often done and should be done for 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.120
 take the protein powder 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.340
 for 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.870
 on lamis force and no muscle mass 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.799
 absolutely does not know is not so 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.370
 essential 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.200
 I told myself, proteins are proteins 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.599
 simply the same proteins you find 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.489
 in the world you find in the egg whites 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.879
 egg which the fish find does not change 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.700
 anything 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:22.030
 however the advantage of the proteins that 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.180
 they are easily prepared really 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.310
 in a hurry you want to try a snack a 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.440
 subscription really in a moment that 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.069
 put the scalble treble plate 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.340
 etc 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:36.250
 at one time the vast measuring cup networks we eat 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.340
 a glass of water is already ready on 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.870
 tunnel already spoken snack another 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.599
 why I could recommend to 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.180
 bring dust that actually is a 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:49.269
 good savings to take the portent in the 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.069
 compared to taking limit proteins 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.440
 carefully the cost of proteins in 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.269
 much lower dust and this 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.950
 without doubt that I think the 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.159
 maximum results can get 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.040
 it depends on a good 95 percent 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:06.010
 the power also prohibits a part from 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.940
 your genetics is only 5 percent 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.260
 from integration 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.650
 so I would say that there is a good wall 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.660
 gap if protein intake is not 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.130
 so if the question is are needed 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.019
 proteins to put on mass 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.419
 muscles are dispensable, but not 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.520
 absolutely not indispensable 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.310
 proteins are inexpensive proteins 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.500
 they are definitely cheaper to accounts 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.039
 King made you save if you were to 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.660
 take the same amount of protein from 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.849
 food will certainly save you by taking on 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.700
 from the euro are in nothing are where 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:41.370
 through protein supplements 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.980
 is a question if they are like proteins 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.110
 yes yes yes definitely they are I am a lot 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.930
 comfortable are a receive are common for 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:53.010
 also make recipes combine with 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:56.160
 lots of foods like yoghurt her 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.340
 eco yogurt egg whites choose the 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.630
 cell you really make in the choices 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.450
 as spectacular as these you know well 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.190
 so I'm a lover of protein recipes 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.770
 if I can recommend proteins 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.010
 powder I could recommend it 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.780
 take but not see integration with 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.090
 an indispensable thing to put 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.050
 mass or to increase performance 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.970
 absolutely no sports are not as 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.860
 a true how is not so fundamental 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.500
 an absolutely long magic potion is 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.750
 just an integration that aims rather 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.550
 first your power supply be it for 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.530
 wait from all points of view from 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.650
 all nutritional points of view and 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.240
 only after dc decided inserted in the 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.220
 meanwhile we want supplements sometimes 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.630
 with this will be everything guys I have 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.760
 simply expressed mine 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.580
 my very personal very personal 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.680
 opinion on its integration and its 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.450
 I'm going to think about the next video indeed 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.140
 you have videos you want to be i 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.030
 process 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.530
 write it also in the comments I hope that 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.600
 have enjoyed this video if you have 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.610
 like a network I like to share it 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.470
 you find me on twitter as usual on 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.360
 twitter facebook instagram that us 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.470
 we ask the next video that they will be 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.800
 obviously a black recipe 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.800
 Hello
