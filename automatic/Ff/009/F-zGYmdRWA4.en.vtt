00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:10.950
 asus 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.170
 very determined company listing them 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.299
 very successful and at the same time extraordinary 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.369
 technical solutions is quite wide but 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.439
 one of the most significant positions in this 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.150
 the list is a clan of transformers 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.769
 literally forged taiwanese 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.470
 manufacturer one of the representatives 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.390
 This family is Tommy tablet 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.220
 or netbook named asus transformer 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.619
 book t100ta 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.410
 m with you Dmitry Lutsenko and the project ferrum 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.969
 com let's get to know him better 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.590
 most of the body is made of 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.140
 brushed aluminum with tinted aluminum 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.629
 such a solution can be called a coating 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.030
 definitely sensible and looks good and 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.280
 heat removes fine yes in terms of 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.440
 practicality claims should not be 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.600
 before you get into our hands device 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.910
 was in use but despite 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.890
 it still looks like new 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.020
 the front panel is made of pretty 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.149
 hard glass sorry what suture 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.550
 oleophobic coating unlike 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.250
 tablet before the keyboard is made completely 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.979
 even though plastic 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.130
 to find fault with and quality of performance 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.020
 is impossible 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.729
 the only flaw that I have 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.700
 able to detect during operation 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.500
 This is a small gap in the tablet arc 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.330
 Station without which apparently 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.790
 implementation of the constructions would be 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.110
 impossible or at least 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.270
 embarrassing practical problems with 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.070
 using this nuance does not create 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.580
 so not to sweat about it 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.860
 worth 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.930
 tablet ergonomics as a stand alone 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.909
 the device is pretty good device 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.710
 moderately heavy and well in hand 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.560
 thanks to the rounded body shape 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.000
 another thing is the adaptation of software to work with 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.799
 sensor and which truth be told 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.899
 leaves much to be desired 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.399
 because most applications 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.140
 oriented to the desktop interface and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.720
 use them on screen such 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.640
 sizing at best is very difficult in 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.560
 netbook mode the device is nice 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.360
 pleases with compactness and relatively 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.009
 good keyboard ergonomics and 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.899
 touchpad and which is quite possible 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.000
 use even in spite of modest 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.070
 dimensions of work areas type 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.479
 texts work in applications for every 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.000
 day on this device and quite 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.039
 maybe even without connecting the mouse though 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.630
 get used to the controls yet 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.850
 will have to fold the device into 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.010
 it's pretty easy to say the same about 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.470
 opening the lid it cannot be raised 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.840
 tight and yes and sometimes 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.760
 difficult maximum angle of loops 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.710
 not too high but problems are not 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.630
 creates as thanks to the excellent 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.460
 display with a computer can be comfortable 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.380
 work even when he's in 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.900
 close on your lap 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.210
 Calvi is already talking about the screen let's 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.650
 talk and display about it 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:42.010
 10 1 inch ips resolution matrix 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.110
 1366 by 768 points in theory is a little bit I 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.850
 would even say quite a bit but on 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.460
 practice picture clarity is quite 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.350
 working color screen traditionally 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.690
 for the manufacturer balanced 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.000
 the picture is very soft and that pleases the eye 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.010
 The screen viewing angles are gorgeous even when 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.900
 a glance the picture is no way 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.240
 readability at height is distorted 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.340
 brightness range is quite good in full 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.710
 of course you can't work with the dark 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.170
 but on the street in sunny weather, no 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.840
 There is no problem a few words asus gland 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.000
 clean and m equipped with quad 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.570
 Intel's Bay Trail family 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.760
 by the name and there z3 775 maximum 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.640
 whose operating frequency is 2 and 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.130
 4 gigahertz cache volume of the second level 2 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.210
 megabyte integrated intel graphics 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.100
 hd graphics 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.020
 about the advantages and disadvantages of this 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.180
 solutions we'll talk a little later 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.610
 RAM in the tablet 2 gigabytes 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.010
 internal memory 64 of which 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.780
 the user has access to the crumb after 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.730
 installations of several primitive 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.470
 applications in my possession left 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.930
 less than ten hectares that for 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.630
 computer very little but the story 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.250
 pleases two things first convenient micro sd 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.170
 card reader located on the case 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.570
 tablet and availability 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.000
 complete with keyboard with built-in 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.680
 one and a half batten tester last obviously 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.390
 will help people who are going 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.330
 use this device for 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.620
 domestic work hardware 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.720
 manifests itself very well even 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.120
 despite the fact that the processor is clearly not 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.730
 The most powerful ssd as practice has shown 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.800
 not the fastest interface and applications 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.900
 work here to cheer heavy films 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.359
 also spin without problems with the same games 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.880
 everything is different on cross-platform toys 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.109
 like the same asphalt 8 power iron 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.240
 enough with the head but the full 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.490
 and computer games things are not 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.379
 so rosy count on the opportunity 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.210
 play something fresh is not worth it 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:31.310
 will have to remember the classics 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.930
 to install new games at least not 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.610
 enough internal memory and yes 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.349
 iron performance will 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.629
 not enough as a device 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.729
 built on energy efficient gland 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:43.099
 which include not greedy 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.719
 video card indicators of autonomy can be 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.699
 call not only good but also 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:49.370
 the expected gadgets powered by 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.169
 31 watt battery hour which I 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.879
 enough for full time 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.069
 most of whom I spent in 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.500
 office suite and browser when browsing 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:59.960
 video for more than two hours the tablet sat down 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.029
 only 20 percent and a half hours of play 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.509
 in the brain mandate took him a little less 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:06.710
 30 and this is at least a good indicator 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:08.389
 passive device is used 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.729
 cooling system which by the way 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.240
 came into the world of screw tablets wrong 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.800
 long 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.900
 especially by heating our hero not 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.330
 different even during games up 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.669
 lukewarm he gets up to discomfort by this 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.590
 does not cause of pleasant moments also 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.210
 I would like to mention a decent sound in 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.250
 headphones that have 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.110
 listening to music on the device 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.120
 built-in speakers unfortunately not 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.219
 pleased them two for quality and 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.500
 the loudness of the speakers clearly suggest them 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:35.360
 use only for official purposes 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.460
 same movie using built 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.560
 acoustics can be seen except in 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.180
 total silence about the program stuffing 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.940
 telling in our case is meaningless 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.529
 before us is the most ordinary eight 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.360
 which is now installed on 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:48.379
 most computers of all modern 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.849
 users 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:52.129
 the only thing I would like to 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.199
 let slip so I will be the dogs of navigation 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:54.949
 on the interface and system when working with 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.479
 touchscreen 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:59.060
 during use I am surprised 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.009
 for myself I discovered that even when communicating 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.000
 I don’t have a desktop 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:03.520
 no problem 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.750
 navigation through the system occurs 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.729
 at ease with tiles at all 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.860
 no problem as i said before 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:11.479
 most complex programs like that 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.770
 photoshop is not adapted for 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.180
 similar devices 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.310
 but on the other hand for the same 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.379
 photo editing on the go there where 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.180
 more convenient application to the word 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:22.460
 device embedded several branded 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.740
 utilities of this nature many of us 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.770
 they definitely won't hurt time 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.070
 sum up and narrow down 103rd ranked 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.780
 excellent niche between 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.360
 tablet and netbooks which can 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.280
 perform daily work tasks with 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.080
 On the one hand, he is automotive satisfied 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.060
 ergonomic without duty that 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.950
 allows you to use it as a mobile 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.960
 entertainment center on the other 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.970
 connecting the keyboard you get 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.710
 mobile working machine capable 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.390
 stretch all day from completely 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.430
 charged battery of disadvantages 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.320
 the device can be distinguished except 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.090
 lack of main camera and module 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.370
 mobile communications on and first and second 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:59.220
 the manufacturer has already solved the problem when 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.900
 aid modifications with index rear price 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.360
 tablets in Ukraine 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.610
 is 470 dollars for our 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.740
 modifications and 530 for version with 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.240
 additional winchester given that 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.700
 what are competitors on other platforms 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.950
 more expensive and can not offer so 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.570
 the same wide functionality of our guy 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.000
 can safely be called 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.950
 optimal solution in its class for 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.940
 this money is the best you can take 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.010
 definitely 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.020
 characteristics and prices of devices in 

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:27.300
