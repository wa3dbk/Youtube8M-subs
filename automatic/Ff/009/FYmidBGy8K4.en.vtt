with you and today we're going to make
homemade<00:00:20.640> hot<00:00:20.970> chocolate<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:21.869> I've<00:00:22.350> actually

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
homemade hot chocolate so I've actually

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.320 
homemade hot chocolate so I've actually
tried<00:00:22.769> making<00:00:23.010> hot<00:00:23.340> chocolate<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.970> bunch<00:00:24.150> of

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
tried making hot chocolate in a bunch of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330 
tried making hot chocolate in a bunch of
different<00:00:24.660> ways<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.470> find<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.920> for<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
different ways and I find that for the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.400 
different ways and I find that for the
smoothest<00:00:26.939> richest<00:00:27.720> best<00:00:28.170> hot<00:00:28.380> chocolate

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
smoothest richest best hot chocolate

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.620 
smoothest richest best hot chocolate
it's<00:00:29.130> better<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.580> use<00:00:29.820> an<00:00:30.060> actual<00:00:30.240> chocolate

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
it's better to use an actual chocolate

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.510 
it's better to use an actual chocolate
bar<00:00:31.140> instead<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.679> cocoa<00:00:32.009> powder<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.340> that's

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
bar instead of cocoa powder so that's

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.729 
bar instead of cocoa powder so that's
what<00:00:32.669> we're<00:00:32.790> gonna<00:00:32.880> do<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:34.079> get<00:00:34.469> started

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
chocolate as well now I'm gonna take my

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.300 
chocolate as well now I'm gonna take my
chocolate<00:01:24.330> just<00:01:24.810> transfer<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.830> heat

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
chocolate just transfer it to a heat

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.219 
chocolate just transfer it to a heat
proof<00:01:26.670> Bowl<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:28.310> we're<00:01:29.310> actually<00:01:29.460> going<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
proof Bowl and we're actually going to

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.350 
proof Bowl and we're actually going to
microwave<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:32.009> 30-second<00:01:32.909> intervals

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
microwave this in 30-second intervals

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.469 
microwave this in 30-second intervals
until<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:34.500> melted<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.280> then<00:01:35.490> add<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
until it's melted and then add it to the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.679 
until it's melted and then add it to the
hot<00:01:36.689> milk<00:01:37.110> already<00:01:37.890> pretty<00:01:38.460> much<00:01:38.549> melted<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.659> I

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
hot milk already pretty much melted so I

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.080 
hot milk already pretty much melted so I
find<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.110> when<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.470> add<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.130> big<00:01:41.790> pieces

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
find that when you add the big pieces

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.210 
find that when you add the big pieces
straight<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> milk<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.680> kind<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.920> hard

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
straight to the milk it's kind of hard

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.940 
straight to the milk it's kind of hard
for<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.610> melt<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.360> not<00:01:45.479> as<00:01:45.659> smooth<00:01:45.990> so

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
for it to melt and it's not as smooth so

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.210 
for it to melt and it's not as smooth so
this<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.369> gonna<00:01:47.490> go<00:01:47.640> into<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.060> microwave<00:01:49.220> so

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
this is gonna go into the microwave so

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.240 
this is gonna go into the microwave so
my<00:01:50.340> chocolate<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.060> melted<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.170> my<00:01:52.740> milk<00:01:53.009> is

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
my chocolate is melted and my milk is

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.730 
my chocolate is melted and my milk is
nice<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.729> hot<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.329> I'm<00:01:54.780> going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.049> scrape<00:01:55.380> my
