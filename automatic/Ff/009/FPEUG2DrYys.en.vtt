00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This is not an SLR.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.000
This is not a compact.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.000
It’s a PEN.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.000
This is a kind of new generation (camera) in the market.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.900
I understand that there’s HD720p video recording.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
How important does Olympus see this feature?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Does this mean that all Micro Four Thirds cameras will have at least HD 720p?

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.000
As you know, some of the competitors are already offering 1080p.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.000
Talking about 720p, that issue…

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.000
As you know, some competitors…

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:39.000
are capable of 1080p, as you say

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.000
but their number of frames per second is less than 30.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This body is a new revolution in the photography equipment system in the world.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Unlike DSLRs, there is no mirror or prism box.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.000
We throw away the mirror and prism

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.000
which is why when you open the body-kit

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.000
you will see the sensor straight away

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.000
without the mirror.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.000
In the digital world, we don’t need the mirror and prism.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The sensor size is exactly the same as our Four Thirds system.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.000
No compromise.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Since the focal length became shorter, we can use smaller lens.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Everything becomes compact.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.000
Basically, it works like a digital SLR which we are used to.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.000
For this model, we use SD card.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.000
For this model, we support only one media.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:09.000
From this ring dial, we have all the manual

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.100
and automatic control you will look for, for a photographer.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:21.000
Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, Manual, Scene,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.000
which is similar to compact cameras,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.000
which will help you to choose the best setting.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:33.000
When you switch to Art, we will have our famous Art Filter function.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.000
This is the first time in the history for a camera manufacturer

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.000
to take care of the artistic function of photography.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.000
So far no manufacturer has taken care of this part.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.000
Olympus’ Art Filters provide in-camera creative effects.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.000
Photography is 70 percent art, 30 percent skill and technical function.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
If I turn to movie mode, when I press the shutter button, it starts to record.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
For this movie function,

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.000
it has a single auto-focus and continuous auto-focus.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
For this camera, we offer two lenses.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
One is the 14 to 42mm lens

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.000
which if you convert to the 35mm equivalent

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.000
it is 28-84

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.000
which is normal wide-angle to portrait.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Another one is the 17mm f2.8 lens.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.000
This is a pancake lens.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
The lens design is quite difficult in terms of thickness.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.000
We can make it so slim and it is auto-focus-enabled.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
This one gives you the shallow depth-of-field.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
We provide two lens mount adapter from Olympus.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.000
One is called between the Micro Four Thirds and the Four Thirds lens adapter.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.000
We also provide a lens mount adapter

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.000
between our OM lens and our Micro Four Thirds body

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
to satisfy the need of some of our OM users.
