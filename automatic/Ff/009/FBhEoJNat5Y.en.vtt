00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.900
 for our website garden 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.750
 world 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.080
 with you and me both 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.110
 dirt and 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.020
 you have no time to talk about aquatic plants 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:24.460
 because it's coming to an end 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.800
 it is time for their decorativeness but nevertheless 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.869
 I would like to say about them because 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.080
 in many nurseries now on water 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.190
 plants discounts and very tempting happens 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.720
 buy water plants in the fall 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.699
 let's talk to you about some 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.510
 look here in the nursery 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:46.559
 in such a small perfect 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.230
 pond these aquatic plants are represented 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.839
 here 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.659
 nymphea of different varieties and with white 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:58.559
 petals and with pink of purple 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:01.589
 as you can see from the labels 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.559
 cloudy weather and therefore enough 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.479
 it was cool so here are the buds yet 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.820
 not revealed but now that's ready 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.670
 open up I want to say that if you 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.500
 You have forged in an outstanding you can 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.740
 admire him fairies here these 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.190
 frost nymphs are represented here 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.580
 that is, with sufficient water depth 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.399
 can you pastor leave them to spend the winter 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.039
 right in the pond and these nymphs 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.890
 bloom until frost and the last 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:35.580
 flowers sometimes even shimmers in the ice then 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.250
 there is a period of decorativeness of these plants 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.970
 begins literally from the end of May when 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.399
 glossy leaves come to the surface 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.679
 shiny and ends in september 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.509
 when you can watch last 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:53.810
 buds what to say about storing these 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.610
 nympha if you give a small 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.060
 they can spend the winter at a depth of more 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.450
 meters already meter twenty already possible him 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.989
 fairy leave for the winter in the pond but myself 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.179
 pond house should be enough 

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:10.760
 spacious and there are little at all 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.620
 plastic molds 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.200
 which are also suitable for growing 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.209
 nympha but here they are completely frozen and 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.540
 in such a reservoir of course you can not leave 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.709
 and the plant needs to be lowered into the cellar as 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.340
 let in public you are watching here here 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.060
 containers 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.150
 These are very small and it's 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.870
 planting material here it is sold in 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.900
 such mesh containers lead here 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.900
 even germinate pores not here you buy 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.540
 this him fairy now naturally you her 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.430
 can still for some time omit 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.470
 pond and then you must be and 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.170
 lower the cellar if we give you away 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.510
 a small mat can be lowered here in 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.190
 same container here or will it be 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.349
 you wash bucket some kind of water level 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.209
 water should be here a little bit 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:08.540
 cover up literally these 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:11.970
 growth buds do not need a lot of water otherwise 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:16.049
 respiratory processes are disturbed by the plant 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:19.760
 in the winter it is not as active and 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:22.739
 so it can just happen 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.720
 suffocate will let us speak so your 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.030
 plants if you put it too 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.340
 deep and here are the kidneys 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.980
 literally cover with some water and everything and 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.670
 This form is completely calm in 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.150
 cellar winters your fairies nothing 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.370
 terrible if in extreme cold 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.440
 your cellar even freeze for a while 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.340
 Here I once had such a case in 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:51.420
 we arrived in our cellar for the first time in 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.430
 for many many years the water has frozen here 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.769
 the container where my nymphea was kept 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.799
 nothing terrible happened and that 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.669
 surprisingly she even bloomed this year 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:06.540
 more abundantly than usual 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:08.489
 it's all just a little pond 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.190
 absolutely not deep here on 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.709
 all summer long 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.930
 bloomed days and we are in the nursery 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.060
 sharks under Nizhny Novgorod you can 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.530
 here, too, fly come see all 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.810
 it blooms and smells sweet 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.229
 and that's enough containers for 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.750
 so that your fairy does not overwinter in 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.680
 In this form, you buy it and go to 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.680
 wintering cellar
