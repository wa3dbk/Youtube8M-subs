00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.060
 mitsubishi is still used in the 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.450
 montero the total transmission system 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.610
 connectable super 2 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.280
 is the lever of the automatic change and the 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.050
 transfer case system 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.329
 the first position is traction at 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.129
 rear wheels 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.610
 the next if connected to traction 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.690
 total 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.989
 on the t1 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.740
 in the third, the 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.870
 central differential 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.800
 and in the last one in grana the marches 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.800
 short of the reducer 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.790
 the steps of the first three 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.309
 positions in back will be total or 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.530
 total with the Central European differential 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.720
 can be done with the car 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.300
 movement without the need to turn it off 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.060
 reductive so select it with the 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.250
 stopped car 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.110
 on this screen 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.030
 to appear represented a scheme of 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.780
 sespa bustle of the car is illuminated 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.780
 the two rear wheels 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.920
 now the front flashes because 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.640
 just selected in the lever 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.640
 full- wheel drive system 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.310
 already this grenade 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.240
 then the lever to the third position 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.450
 the differential lock flashes 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.520
 central 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.299
 using this button you can block 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.299
 rear differential 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.479
 and I'm going to give it 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.500
 it is flashing 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.090
 is already blocked and when doing so it 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.460
 completely deactivates the control of 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.460
 traction and also the abs
