00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.500 
what I'm assuming is this Scrivener so
it's<00:02:16.320> basically<00:02:17.960> duplicating<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:20.510> you're

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
it's basically duplicating and you're

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.680 
it's basically duplicating and you're
like<00:02:21.630> copying<00:02:22.050> by<00:02:22.290> hand<00:02:23.090> so<00:02:24.090> it's<00:02:24.270> this<00:02:24.450> guy

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
like copying by hand so it's this guy

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.980 
like copying by hand so it's this guy
who<00:02:24.750> has<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.880> little<00:02:26.880> business<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.720> who

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
happened to be I like that number it was

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.990 
happened to be I like that number it was
a<00:05:43.180> very<00:05:43.510> interesting<00:05:44.220> descent<00:05:45.220> into

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.840 

but<00:05:49.570> that<00:05:50.110> well<00:05:50.320> I<00:05:50.590> decided<00:05:50.980> to<00:05:51.340> darkness

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
but that well I decided to darkness

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.760 
but that well I decided to darkness
let's<00:05:52.150> put<00:05:52.450> it<00:05:52.570> this<00:05:52.600> way<00:05:52.750> I<00:05:52.900> know<00:05:53.080> it's<00:05:53.380> quite

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
let's put it this way I know it's quite

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.030 
let's put it this way I know it's quite
dramatic<00:05:53.920> but<00:05:54.690> you<00:05:55.690> know<00:05:55.810> how<00:05:56.110> do<00:05:56.170> you<00:05:56.470> get

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
dramatic but you know how do you get

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.190 
dramatic but you know how do you get
from<00:05:57.100> a<00:05:57.370> fine<00:05:57.610> person<00:05:57.940> to<00:05:58.300> a<00:05:58.330> not<00:05:58.630> fine<00:05:58.900> person

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
from a fine person to a not fine person

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.560 
from a fine person to a not fine person
I<00:05:59.500> thought<00:05:59.710> that<00:05:59.890> then<00:06:00.090> trajectory<00:06:01.090> was<00:06:01.330> fine

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
I thought that then trajectory was fine

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.250 
I thought that then trajectory was fine
and<00:06:01.960> you<00:06:02.530> know<00:06:02.650> and<00:06:02.860> interesting<00:06:03.960> and<00:06:04.960> you

the<00:06:51.470> story<00:06:51.710> takes<00:06:51.830> place<00:06:51.980> up<00:06:52.340> with<00:06:52.460> a<00:06:52.490> student

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820 
the story takes place up with a student

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.210 
the story takes place up with a student
late<00:06:53.180> nineteenth<00:06:53.720> and<00:06:53.930> twelve<00:06:54.260> early

I<00:07:00.150> love<00:07:01.139> when<00:07:01.320> people<00:07:01.710> move<00:07:02.960> early<00:07:03.960> 20th

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 
I love when people move early 20th

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.900 
I love when people move early 20th
century<00:07:04.770> so<00:07:04.980> probably<00:07:05.490> you<00:07:05.639> know<00:07:05.730> they

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:05.910 
century so probably you know they

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.189 
century so probably you know they
obviously<00:07:06.060> did<00:07:06.449> not<00:07:06.480> have<00:07:06.810> the<00:07:06.960> same

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199

obviously did not have the same
understanding<00:07:07.680> of<00:07:08.220> viewpoints<00:07:08.639> so<00:07:08.669> it's

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:08.850 
understanding of viewpoints so it's

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.430 
understanding of viewpoints so it's
never<00:07:09.060> mentioned<00:07:09.510> that<00:07:09.570> this<00:07:09.690> person<00:07:10.080> would
