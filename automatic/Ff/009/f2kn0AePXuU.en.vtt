 Well, the diode is not visible and only the light 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.840

 there are no drops or steps 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.579
 it is made specifically we poured 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:57.169
 screed under the laminate to 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:00.060

 tiles as well as the ceiling on the floor 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.100

 originally on this balcony sill 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.160
 stood at an angle 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.440
 it was done to him 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.560
 water flowed but since we 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.210
 the balcony is glazed then we redid 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.280
 window sill and made it in 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.350
