00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.850
 sun with and harry caine to that we have in 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.369
 our hands the new saucony harry 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.650
 caine and his this slipper belongs to 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.300
 the iso series is a shoe with 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.800
 stability control for those 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.320
 runners who have an excess of 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.700
 pronation in the tread has many 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.770
 aspects in common with the first 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.990
 sneaker of the two series saucony 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.280
 triumph he made that for runners with 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.080
 tread on the computer 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.880
 what makes it different is that it is 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.340
 directed to runners who need a 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.860
 clear contribution of stability 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.170
 and so fit is a technology implanted in 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.239
 the apple or upper cut and it consists 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.100
 mainly in providing the shoe 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.900
 of an exceptional adjustment eliminating 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.000
 unwanted aspects such as accumulation 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.100
 of material or wrinkles in the flexion of the 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.989
 foot during the race combines a soft 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.820
 and light elastic internal mesh made to 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.100
 hand and that fits the foot as a 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.750
 sock with an isolated structure 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.820
 outer that fits on the foot with 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.120
 consistency and effectiveness when tightening 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.370
 Lambs 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.739
 another important aspect in harry caine 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.770
 wanted is the presence of the power 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.720
 grid plus on the midsole the previous 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.150
 Power grid has been clearly improved 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.009
 to be able to contribute 20% more than 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.009
 cushioning without increasing at all the 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.140
 weight support frame in the heel area 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.090
 is a semi-rigid structure that 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.800
 wraps and that improves stability in 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.800
 the moment to contact against the ground 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.369
 saucony harry caine that's a sneaker 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.840
 very light to be a sneaker 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.409
 daily training with control of 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.119
 stability is just 315 grams the drop 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.590
 that throws the shoe the difference 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.560
 between the height of the heel and the forefoot 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.810
 is 8 millimeters on the outer edge 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.630
 of the heel we observe the src structure 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.220
 plus impact interface and which is responsible 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.899
 to absorb part of the impact that 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.000
 causes contact against the ground 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.549
 during the run on the sole 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.640
 we found the material x of 900 with 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.160
 carbon that provides durability x of 900 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.780
 is combined with tvr plus 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.880
 another material also developed by 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.909
 saucony that provides above all a 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.429
 exceptional grip 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.140
 shaw conejal came floor is a perfect 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.790
 training shoe with control 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.860
 of programming no doubt the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.930
 combination of cushioning adjustment and 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.120
 stability of saucony harry caine and saw 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.590
 make it a great option for 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.970
 many runners that appear these 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.970
 features in a sneaker
