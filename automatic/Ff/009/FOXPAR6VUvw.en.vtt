here<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.030> check<00:01:03.240> the<00:01:03.360> quality<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.080> apples

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
here to check the quality of the apples

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.010 
here to check the quality of the apples
if<00:01:04.740> there's<00:01:04.980> any<00:01:05.130> bad<00:01:05.309> apples<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.630> throw<00:01:06.900> them

in<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.170> garbage<00:01:08.210> all<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.450> good<00:01:09.630> apples<00:01:10.020> will

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
in a garbage all the good apples will

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.660 
in a garbage all the good apples will
then<00:01:11.030> go<00:01:12.030> into<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.680> area<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:14.010> where<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:14.550> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
then go into this area here where it's a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.180 
then go into this area here where it's a
scrubber<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.420> washer<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.800> I<00:01:16.830> sometimes

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
scrubber and a washer so I sometimes

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.060 
scrubber and a washer so I sometimes
call<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.760> car<00:01:18.000> wash<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.450> apples<00:01:18.979> so<00:01:19.979> it

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
call it a car wash for apples so it

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.370 
call it a car wash for apples so it
cleans<00:01:20.310> off<00:01:20.550> any<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.910> the<00:01:21.060> dust<00:01:21.330> or<00:01:21.570> dirt<00:01:21.780> that

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
cleans off any of the dust or dirt that

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.230 
cleans off any of the dust or dirt that
was<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.770> them<00:01:22.920> why<00:01:23.490> they<00:01:23.640> were<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> trees

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
was on them why they were in the trees

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.580 
was on them why they were in the trees
as<00:01:24.619> they<00:01:25.619> exit<00:01:26.660> here<00:01:27.660> they<00:01:27.869> go<00:01:28.050> into<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
as they exit here they go into the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.160 
as they exit here they go into the
grinder<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.880> grinder<00:01:30.300> makes<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.600> lot<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.840> noise

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
grinder the grinder makes a lot of noise

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.130 
grinder the grinder makes a lot of noise
and<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:32.220> grinds<00:01:32.550> them<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:32.790> into<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> mash<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:34.110> a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
and it grinds them up into a mash like a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.790 
and it grinds them up into a mash like a
coarse<00:01:34.650> applesauce<00:01:36.050> after<00:01:37.050> they've<00:01:37.200> gone

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
coarse applesauce after they've gone

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.730

through<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.160> mash<00:01:39.050> they<00:01:40.050> get<00:01:40.259> pumped<00:01:40.590> out<00:01:40.650> of

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
through the mash they get pumped out of

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.900 
through the mash they get pumped out of
the<00:01:40.800> bottom<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.479> through<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> three<00:01:42.900> inch<00:01:43.080> hose

the the mash and tell is all the
moistures<00:02:03.660> Vince<00:02:03.869> wasn't<00:02:04.140> out<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.740> once<00:02:05.039> it

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
moistures Vince wasn't out so once it

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.850 
moistures Vince wasn't out so once it
once<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:05.670> fill<00:02:05.910> up<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.179> bags<00:02:06.420> with<00:02:07.410> that<00:02:07.590> 3

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
once you fill up the bags with that 3

once you fill up the bags with that 3
inch<00:02:08.009> hose<00:02:08.869> we<00:02:09.869> turn<00:02:10.110> on<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.380> hydraulics<00:02:11.009> and

inch hose we turn on the hydraulics and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.270 
inch hose we turn on the hydraulics and
it<00:02:11.520> squeezes<00:02:12.140> like<00:02:13.140> an<00:02:13.290> accordion<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.100> gets

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
it squeezes like an accordion so it gets

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.330 
it squeezes like an accordion so it gets

okra<00:04:17.790> is<00:04:18.030> about<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.959> perfect<00:04:19.590> size<00:04:19.799> for

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
okra is about the perfect size for

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:27.140 
okra is about the perfect size for
eating<00:04:21.740> the<00:04:22.740> female<00:04:23.220> flower<00:04:24.200> has<00:04:26.150> the

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
eating the female flower has the

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.140 
eating the female flower has the
zucchini<00:04:27.630> behind<00:04:27.990> it<00:04:28.169> like<00:04:28.320> this<00:04:28.940> so<00:04:29.940> you<00:04:29.970> can

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
zucchini behind it like this so you can

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.000 
zucchini behind it like this so you can
easily<00:04:30.810> tell<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.080> difference<00:04:31.169> between<00:04:31.680> the

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
easily tell the difference between the

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.620 
easily tell the difference between the
male<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.490> female<00:04:32.520> so<00:04:33.060> this<00:04:33.210> is<00:04:33.330> a<00:04:33.390> female

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
male and the female so this is a female

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.080 
male and the female so this is a female
if<00:04:34.530> you<00:04:34.770> try<00:04:35.010> to<00:04:35.070> find<00:04:35.400> them<00:04:35.550> off<00:04:35.669> the<00:04:35.820> tree

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
if you try to find them off the tree

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.469 
if you try to find them off the tree
they're<00:04:36.330> not<00:04:36.510> going<00:04:36.840> to<00:04:36.960> be<00:04:37.669> super<00:04:38.669> soft<00:04:39.150> to

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
they're not going to be super soft to

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.979 
they're not going to be super soft to
start<00:04:39.780> with<00:04:39.960> they'll<00:04:40.200> be<00:04:40.320> a<00:04:40.350> little<00:04:40.590> firm
