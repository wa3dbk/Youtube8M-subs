00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone with you vlad and you're on apple 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.170
 forgot today to tell you about new 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.960
 wonderful bolajon wilkins headphones 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.000
 seafight series 2 which recently bought 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.860
 when I went to Moscow and now we 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.719
 slowly recovering from these 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.420
 Christmas holidays and I decided to start and 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.160
 us stories about these wonderful 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:29.429
 headphones, well, let's not take a long time 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:31.940
 drove in this video probably tell 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.340
 In general, there would be a small operating experience 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:39.390
 first and here are these wonderful 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.550
 series 2 which recently acquired and this 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.940
 just really the device that I 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.070
 for a long time he was thirsty and wanted this 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.719
 review decided to build more as an experience 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.000
 exploiting my impressions of 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.500
 headphones and start and think us boxes 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.480
 here, as always, they kept us 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.270
 little headphones that is 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.430
 box and after two basically nothing 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.530
 practically does not differ from the first well 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.930
 let's open it open up also 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.020
 Basically, the box is such a store, that is 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.630
 she hangs herself on some stand and there 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.869
 how long has the network been? 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.720
 without an urn they were not here and here 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.259
 lay seekers boxes were promised 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.850
 Cheholchik I will immediately say it became better well 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.850
 just changed it 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.310
 and he became more like ours here he 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.020
 It has become such a thicker shorter 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.240
 saying new case seriously 2 really 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.360
 more convenient it is straight 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.920
 respect dudes because i love my 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.130
 our headphones and covers 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.140
 but here we are shorter than everyone says 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.850
 as usual the box is interesting well 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.430
 let's postpone go to ourselves 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.700
 headphones past as you remember from me 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.530
 were the color itself is probably silver 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.259
 calculated removed some sort of not 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.970
 I called the same version of black and 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.280
 see here the black wire 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.649
 I'll tell you right away that these things have become 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.140
 softer and the headphones themselves in principle 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.180
 Of course, those headphones haven't changed 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.509
 The first version was on the market for a long time 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.020
 and here we are new technologies and in short 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.970
 by saying 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.340
 and became cooler sound louder immediately 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.230
 I would say it seems to be exactly the same well in 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.780
 Basically, I did not find a great but louder 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.610
 I also do not really like that brothers 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.830
 put forward divisions of wire that is 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.129
 there was such a crap move prot 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.209
 shares here is not and very big lilac 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.220
 so that the wire does not 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.500
 and it broke me can not but rejoice 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.299
 that is, this is really respect dudes 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.970
 towels you can use with any 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:36.000
 gadget here audiophiles will include 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.489
 what headphones what phone do you need 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.040
 listen to records but in principle really 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.930
 I am very happy with the sound 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.860
 that the first version broke me 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.310
 so I donâ€™t show them and these 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.930
 Headphones are very , very budget 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.750
 14,000 rubles that's what I did 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.900
 mutter sound but me basically very 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.420
 Pleases seriously the first version broke 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.150
 on the left earpiece I came a space get 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.680
 poll and then I was struck by the service 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.530
 service for the first time I have 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.810
 was just brought headphones dude 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.030
 watched listened and then says type u 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.030
 we are not sorry for the first series but we 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.549
 I will refund the money right away with the bats 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.120
 white wind I wandered there for service 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:24.060
 I literally do not know for two months while waiting 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.000
 they will test me there for new ones 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.489
 Here is such a garbage here everything is just right 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.980
 man says well no headphones all 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.950
 money is some kind of paid 4000 took 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.870
 3 series 2 because without pathos we will find 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.510
 with life , May simply does not appear 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.430
 Well, serious so pack a pancake like 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.840
 phone some phones are better 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.329
 packed and 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.579
 customer relationships down arrows times 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.769
 I am glad I gave them a second chance complained 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.109
 bit himself a second chance they did not justify them 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.569
 see whether these headphones but acquitted 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.209
 sound great or like inside channel 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.099
 and I don't like at all I don't like headphones 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.669
 who wore on top don't know only 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:05.040
 inside channel ki vacuum good bass players 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:08.410
 such a bass sound 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.450
 tools don't mix in a heap that don't 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.610
 all the headphones may not please him 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.269
 Well just fly standings also holds 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.010
 well actually like the first version 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:21.250
 in short me especially look 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.940
 beautiful phone 6 unscrew the hand and in short 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.970
 saying you must understand what headphones 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.310
 transcripts very seriously here if you want to 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.230
 good sound pick I think not 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.420
 you will regret of course many can not 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.020
 fits anatomical this form i 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.750
 picked up 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.790
 ambushure for themselves and set up this crap and 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.100
 in principle, it is actually more convenient that is 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.380
 I really like how the sound is transmitted 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.570
 both lie in the ears that is not yet fall 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.330
 may I have been walking all this time until it was 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.580
 with again the first version of circles from ipod 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.800
 with the opinions of the iPhone set on their 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.540
 I'm going to give them no pity for them 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.610
 unpack and in short i'm short 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.550
 I went with these I will say if you have headphones 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.290
 old must clean them and 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.760
 pour in cork from here and peroxide 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.210
 hydrogen and that's how the toilet is very 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.790
 neat well for about 15-20 minutes then 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.350
 shake just on there sasovo through 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.660
 pen wrote on the form everything will be 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.450
 ok wipe and 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.430
 really wash out all the sulfur that is 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.320
 that 's where the headphones are jammed and just 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.140
 sounded second life necessarily if 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.150
 you old have make it so very 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.610
 help when inside the channel is like a magnet 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.660
 inside the channel of the whale rather droplets 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.610
 liners began to arrange me put 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.080
 to this 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.800
 arrange a campaign of course but you somehow 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.040
 just like 14,000 rubles of course expensive I 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.810
 I bought the story but basically I think 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.430
 This is such a premium product. 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.520
 the price especially appeared recently in 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.950
 difference from the first version is shorter guys 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.480
 for audiophile probably but mast hev 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.060
 audiophile probably 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.860
 and simkin coach i principle i can myself 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.950
 neither should not have asked his 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.840
 grandmother type i am a music lover yo she said 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.340
 of course because the headphones are always me 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.960
 I thought that this is really so I 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.100
 just always headphones and for me this 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.590
 cool solution looked there is 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.560
 intracanal walls 60 like 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:18.300
 thousand or 40 for a long time and looked 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:21.310
 private can be closer to 60 for audiophiles 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.350
 Well, I do not know shorter than me, these are very 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.610
 pleases so take will not regret
