take<00:04:20.100> a<00:04:20.130> look<00:04:20.519> at<00:04:20.700> them<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.209> can<00:04:21.359> see<00:04:21.600> there's

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
take a look at them you can see there's

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.870 
take a look at them you can see there's
got<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.260> VSS<00:04:22.890> so<00:04:23.100> basically<00:04:23.490> that's<00:04:23.580> the

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
got the VSS so basically that's the

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.210 
got the VSS so basically that's the
modes<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.540> you've<00:04:25.110> got<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:25.260> volume<00:04:25.800> here<00:04:26.040> and

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
modes and you've got the volume here and

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.730 
modes and you've got the volume here and
I<00:04:26.310> believe<00:04:26.550> that's<00:04:26.760> on<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.680> left-hand<00:04:28.680> side

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
I believe that's on the left-hand side

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.409 
I believe that's on the left-hand side
and<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.010> left<00:04:29.190> earcup<00:04:29.480> aps<00:04:30.480> logo<00:04:30.900> volume<00:04:31.470> mute

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
and the left earcup aps logo volume mute

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.950 
and the left earcup aps logo volume mute
vs<00:04:33.419> s<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:34.310> neathia<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:35.760> do<00:04:35.910> have<00:04:36.090> micro<00:04:36.450> USB

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
vs s and neathia you do have micro USB

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.040 
vs s and neathia you do have micro USB
to<00:04:37.169> charge<00:04:37.200> and<00:04:37.980> then<00:04:38.220> you're<00:04:38.940> lining<00:04:39.540> Jack

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
to charge and then you're lining Jack

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.150 
to charge and then you're lining Jack
for<00:04:40.230> a<00:04:40.260> 3.5<00:04:40.890> and<00:04:41.310> they've<00:04:41.700> got<00:04:41.990> off<00:04:42.990> one<00:04:43.950> and

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
for a 3.5 and they've got off one and

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.650 
for a 3.5 and they've got off one and
two<00:04:44.400> so<00:04:44.760> we<00:04:44.880> definitely<00:04:45.090> check<00:04:45.480> that<00:04:45.510> out

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
two so we definitely check that out

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.659

you've got sound and chart volume so

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.040 
you've got sound and chart volume so
you've<00:04:47.790> got<00:04:47.820> standard<00:04:48.419> volume<00:04:48.570> then<00:04:48.960> you've

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
you've got standard volume then you've

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.320 
you've got standard volume then you've
got<00:04:49.169> sound<00:04:49.560> and<00:04:49.830> char<00:04:50.070> chat<00:04:50.490> which<00:04:51.120> you<00:04:51.210> can

pretty<00:05:10.860> nice<00:05:11.220> looking<00:05:11.850> headset<00:05:12.830> let's<00:05:13.830> see

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
pretty nice looking headset let's see

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.120 
pretty nice looking headset let's see
off<00:05:14.510> what<00:05:15.510> happens<00:05:15.810> if<00:05:15.900> you<00:05:15.990> turn<00:05:16.169> on<00:05:16.410> here<00:05:16.860> so

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
off what happens if you turn on here so

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.420 
off what happens if you turn on here so
that's<00:05:17.400> on<00:05:17.610> one<00:05:18.030> on<00:05:18.330> two<00:05:19.050> so<00:05:19.290> basically<00:05:19.740> if<00:05:20.280> I

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
that's on one on two so basically if I

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.890 
that's on one on two so basically if I
mistaken<00:05:20.940> this<00:05:21.060> might<00:05:21.270> mean<00:05:21.450> that<00:05:21.510> you<00:05:21.720> can

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
mistaken this might mean that you can

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.560 
mistaken this might mean that you can
actually<00:05:22.140> link<00:05:22.440> you<00:05:22.560> to<00:05:22.590> two<00:05:22.830> devices<00:05:23.100> at<00:05:23.310> once

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
actually link you to two devices at once

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.120 
actually link you to two devices at once
you<00:05:24.570> just<00:05:24.750> have<00:05:24.840> to<00:05:24.870> switch<00:05:25.140> between<00:05:25.320> youtube

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
you just have to switch between youtube

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.430 
you just have to switch between youtube
channels<00:05:26.660> but<00:05:27.660> that's<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:28.080> off<00:05:28.200> position

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
channels but that's the off position

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.870 
channels but that's the off position
that's<00:05:28.890> one<00:05:29.070> or<00:05:29.190> two<00:05:29.280> but<00:05:29.430> again<00:05:29.700> I<00:05:29.729> will

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
that's one or two but again I will

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.480 
that's one or two but again I will
clarify<00:05:30.560> when<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:31.590> do<00:05:31.710> some<00:05:31.979> reviews<00:05:32.250> and<00:05:32.400> set

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
clarify when I do some reviews and set

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.700 
clarify when I do some reviews and set
up<00:05:32.610> we'll<00:05:32.820> try<00:05:33.030> and<00:05:33.090> do<00:05:33.240> a<00:05:33.270> pc<00:05:33.900> setup<00:05:34.110> that's

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
up we'll try and do a pc setup that's

up we'll try and do a pc setup that's
one<00:05:34.919> of<00:05:35.010> the<00:05:35.100> first<00:05:35.250> things<00:05:35.370> will<00:05:35.640> do<00:05:35.790> probably

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
one of the first things will do probably

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.420 
one of the first things will do probably

look like they have 40mm drivers and
they<00:05:46.320> actually<00:05:46.500> angled<00:05:47.280> wow<00:05:47.610> this<00:05:47.760> is<00:05:47.910> pretty

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
they actually angled wow this is pretty

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.980 
they actually angled wow this is pretty
cool<00:05:48.419> interesting<00:05:49.380> so<00:05:50.660> another<00:05:51.660> if<00:05:51.780> you<00:05:51.810> guys

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
cool interesting so another if you guys

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.260 
cool interesting so another if you guys
can<00:05:52.140> see<00:05:52.289> that<00:05:52.470> clearly<00:05:52.620> see<00:05:53.130> that<00:05:53.160> so<00:05:53.880> this<00:05:54.150> is

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
can see that clearly see that so this is

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.909 
can see that clearly see that so this is
the<00:05:54.390> air<00:05:54.479> cup<00:05:54.690> and<00:05:54.870> this<00:05:55.080> is<00:05:55.200> my<00:05:55.320> finger<00:05:55.620> flat

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
the air cup and this is my finger flat

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.219 
the air cup and this is my finger flat
you<00:05:56.070> can<00:05:56.130> see<00:05:56.340> it's<00:05:56.729> low<00:05:56.970> on<00:05:57.120> one<00:05:57.360> end<00:05:57.570> and<00:05:57.780> then

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
you can see it's low on one end and then

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.830 
you can see it's low on one end and then
angles<00:05:58.740> into<00:05:59.430> the<00:05:59.550> corner<00:05:59.850> there<00:06:00.479> on<00:06:00.690> the

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
angles into the corner there on the

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.380 
angles into the corner there on the
right-hand<00:06:01.169> side<00:06:01.729> and<00:06:02.729> some<00:06:02.910> extra<00:06:03.150> lighting

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
right-hand side and some extra lighting

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.909 
right-hand side and some extra lighting
here<00:06:03.690> maybe<00:06:03.900> you<00:06:03.960> can<00:06:04.050> see<00:06:04.260> that<00:06:04.289> better<00:06:04.680> so

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
here maybe you can see that better so

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.560 
here maybe you can see that better so
you<00:06:04.950> can<00:06:05.099> see<00:06:05.370> it's<00:06:05.460> angled<00:06:05.910> there<00:06:06.090> and<00:06:06.360> it's

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
you can see it's angled there and it's
