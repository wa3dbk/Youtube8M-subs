here<00:00:20.060> here<00:00:21.060> are<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> battery<00:00:21.630> readings<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.140> it

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
here here are the battery readings on it

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.759 
here here are the battery readings on it
so<00:00:24.570> what<00:00:24.689> he<00:00:24.750> did<00:00:24.900> was<00:00:25.050> he<00:00:25.320> replaced<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
so what he did was he replaced the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.460 
so what he did was he replaced the
battery<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.510> the<00:00:27.510> battery<00:00:27.720> warning<00:00:28.320> light<00:00:28.439> on

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
battery and the battery warning light on

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.790 
battery and the battery warning light on
the<00:00:28.560> dashboard<00:00:28.619> was<00:00:29.130> still<00:00:29.369> actually<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:30.800> so

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
the dashboard was still actually on so

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.740 
the dashboard was still actually on so
we<00:00:31.920> assumed<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.430> might<00:00:32.610> be<00:00:32.820> an<00:00:33.059> alternator<00:00:33.480> or

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
we assumed it might be an alternator or

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.200 
we assumed it might be an alternator or
a<00:00:33.809> v-belt<00:00:34.520> problem

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
a v-belt problem

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.940 
a v-belt problem
both<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.719> which<00:00:36.840> checked<00:00:37.230> out<00:00:37.350> fine<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
both of which checked out fine the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.119 
both of which checked out fine the
non-linear<00:00:38.790> test<00:00:39.770> which<00:00:40.770> showed<00:00:41.040> are

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
non-linear test which showed are

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.340 
non-linear test which showed are
absolutely<00:00:41.579> fine

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
absolutely fine

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.779

if you do need to do you want only a

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.459 
if you do need to do you want only a
test<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.210> search<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.930> other<00:00:46.020> videos<00:00:46.320> on

on how you can actually do your when the
test<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> test<00:00:50.820> if<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:52.079> Nate<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.559> is

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
test is a test if you all Nate and is

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.889 
test is a test if you all Nate and is
shot<00:00:53.190> or<00:00:53.370> needs<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:54.059> replaced<00:00:54.390> or<00:00:54.660> is

shot or needs to be replaced or is

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.889 
shot or needs to be replaced or is
actually<00:00:55.230> fine<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.039> was<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.430> case<00:00:56.899> so

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
actually fine as it was in this case so

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.410 
actually fine as it was in this case so
what<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> customer<00:00:58.500> did<00:00:58.680> was<00:00:58.859> they<00:00:59.420> changed

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
what the customer did was they changed

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.670 
what the customer did was they changed
the<00:01:00.510> battery<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.230> was<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> battery

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the battery but this was the battery

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.250 
the battery but this was the battery
they<00:01:01.920> operated<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.899> now<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.199> see

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
they operated to now as you can see

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.130 
they operated to now as you can see
probably<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.400> come<00:01:06.030> out<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
probably if I come out of it the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.060 
probably if I come out of it the
original<00:01:07.500> BMW<00:01:07.680> battery<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> lot<00:01:09.030> bigger

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
original BMW battery was a lot bigger

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.749 
original BMW battery was a lot bigger
and<00:01:11.070> look<00:01:11.220> at<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> readings<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:11.939> well<00:01:14.030> 9<00:01:15.030> th

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
and look at the readings as well 9 th

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.249 
and look at the readings as well 9 th
and<00:01:17.759> 720<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:20.369> 1e<00:01:20.580> replaced<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.180> was<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> 70<00:01:22.020> for

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
and 720 the 1e replaced to was a 70 for

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.080 
and 720 the 1e replaced to was a 70 for
age<00:01:23.090> 680<00:01:24.090> basically<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.930> battery<00:01:25.909> was<00:01:26.909> not

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
age 680 basically this battery was not

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.270 
age 680 basically this battery was not
powerful<00:01:27.390> enough<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:28.080> cope<00:01:28.740> with<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.950> demands

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
powerful enough to cope with the demands

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.800 
powerful enough to cope with the demands
of<00:01:29.490> all<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.880> systems<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.450> BMW

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
of all of the systems in the BMW

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.830 
of all of the systems in the BMW
5-series

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
5-series

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.420 
5-series
so<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:33.960> took<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.229> battery<00:01:34.590> out<00:01:34.619> we've<00:01:35.189> listed

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
so we took this battery out we've listed

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.109 
so we took this battery out we've listed
for<00:01:35.850> us

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
for us

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.999 
for us
a<00:01:36.150> similar<00:01:36.540> battery<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.530> although

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
a similar battery to this one although

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.730 
a similar battery to this one although
wasn't<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> BMW<00:01:39.110> we<00:01:40.110> were<00:01:40.200> placed<00:01:40.439> there<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.710> a

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
wasn't a BMW we were placed there with a

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.530 
wasn't a BMW we were placed there with a
180<00:01:41.520> H<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.210> 800<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:45.210> did<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.450> trick

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
180 H and a 800 a and that did the trick

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.899 
180 H and a 800 a and that did the trick
that<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.470> battery<00:01:47.159> warning<00:01:47.490> light<00:01:47.640> went<00:01:47.850> out

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
that the battery warning light went out

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.260 
that the battery warning light went out
straight<00:01:48.299> away<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:50.130> my<00:01:50.250> advice<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
straight away so my advice is the the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.550 
straight away so my advice is the the
reason<00:01:51.479> for<00:01:51.630> making<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.930> video<00:01:52.079> as<00:01:52.290> well<00:01:52.439> as

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
reason for making this video as well as

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.380 
reason for making this video as well as
just<00:01:52.740> basically<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.820> make<00:01:54.000> sure<00:01:54.210> that

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
just basically to to make sure that

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.170 
just basically to to make sure that
nobody<00:01:54.659> else<00:01:54.899> does<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.969> hopefully<00:01:56.969> won't

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
nobody else does this hopefully won't

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.639 
nobody else does this hopefully won't
you<00:01:57.570> won't<00:01:57.719> be<00:01:57.810> stupid<00:01:58.079> enough<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:58.469> this

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
you won't be stupid enough to do this

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.670 
you won't be stupid enough to do this
but<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.579> stands<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.090> reason<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:01.500> need<00:02:01.649> a

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
but it stands the reason that you need a

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.080
