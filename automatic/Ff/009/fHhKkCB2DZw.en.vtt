00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.290
 very good guys are that as you are 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.360
 me without scotti and welcome to a video 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.800
 of whites 2 if after a week 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.500
 age you go warfare then a tad of 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.330
 whites because as you are already well in the 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.430
 title of the video black ops 2 never 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.410
 disappoint good this game is a 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.200
 heading to take the map flag from 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.119
 being that I get out then the first 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.529
 days of my return a week ago with 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.500
 accent and lin more than one week to 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.940
 youtube then it 's pretty 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.380
 interesting obviously not saying how it 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.180
 develops the game simply the 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.890
 let's see let's comment the one 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.180
 little bit because I want to compare at last 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.890
 it's about time after a week already 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.290
 we have all of us who have the game 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.570
 we have squeezed it enough we have 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.180
 tried everything and we finally know we can 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.100
 compare the call of duty black or two by 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.860
 example with the call of advanced advanced 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.030
 warfare why because I want to make a 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.580
 comparison because I find it quite 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.280
 interesting because it gives me the impression of 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.019
 that people do not convince me 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.509
 so what I'm going to do is going to be a 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.780
 in detailed comparison coming up 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.549
 the spine describing quite 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.039
 videogame from back warfare and we're going to 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.079
 see a little in the main arcs and 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.479
 features of the game first of 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.310
 all of the more warfare is to say that the 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.909
 playability is similar to that of whites 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.729
 two 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.930
 relatively relatively good because 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.060
 because first 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.710
 and move and all that is similar 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.880
 weapons are similar although there are some 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.110
 news but the truth that they have 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.340
 cured pretty little weapons maps 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.979
 they are not bad, but you have to take 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.720
 account that each map the simple maps 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.970
 They have 23 prison heights and maps that 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.369
 they have up to 4 or 5 heights that 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.140
 it seems like a fucking madness to me 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.880
 to the issues of jumps well then it is 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.410
 the hummer has wanted this call of 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.360
 duty was something innovative but for me 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.890
 call of duty is not jumping that is already in 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.229
 other games call of duty is call of 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.270
 duty and then you can vary other things 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.670
 as the graphics the playability or 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.500
 new weapons and new game modes that 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.450
 they make call of duty, be it 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.050
 following cases of wine you 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.650
 you understand 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.510
 weapons maps and game modes then modes 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.340
 of game also fail quite is in 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.320
 initiative mode that is not bad 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.770
 you have to keep in mind that for example 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.990
 the demolition mode is not in league mode 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.880
 say that is not bad yes there 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.500
 it's true that I'm going to think that it was going to be 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.600
 rather worse I remind you how it works 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.850
 just in case some do not know the 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.290
 league mode the most war fan goes by 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.000
 divisions the first I think that it 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.720
 produces a thing like this silver bronze is not 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.310
 exempt this person silver platinum gold 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.010
 diamond and then there is teacher who is the 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.390
 last and you win games you raise points and 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.400
 Navigations about certain points 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.110
 then division actions if you leave 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.350
 games and lose a game then you 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.150
 they go down points but you ascend 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.500
 It is not so bad not bad this 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.380
 game mode is a pretty good idea 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.270
 quite applicable but that if the weapons 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.610
 and the maps and the gameplay would have been 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.160
 totally different one thing that fails 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.950
 much the advanced uav farc is the gusts 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.890
 caracas are very bad as I said the 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.170
 bomber the war live controlled by 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.610
 the guide are the best of all the 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.140
 paladin good for independent 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.220
 dependencies or open map if they are not 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.650
 open map because if it's not a little 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.600
 shits but there are very few streaks there 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.330
 universal there is no bulletproof vest 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.020
 to prevent you from dying constantly there is no 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.070
 something that protects you from that I have you for 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.770
 your back in a game where you 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.740
 they can come in the back 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.000
 constantly in a game in which 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.700
 you have to be hanging all the time 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.680
 from your surroundings it can not be that 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.960
 there is nothing that gives you a plus of life if 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.660
 there is one thing that is 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.340
 the fitness sex an attitude sex that you 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.960
 It gives a little increase your life but that does not 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.540
 hard nothing is a bit is a shit 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.670
 then lack is missing many things to the 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.850
 game for me the connection well neither 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.500
 is that it goes very well at all 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.970
 fail many things in the advanced 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.800
 warfighter the first week of play or 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.320
 well they arrange the whole game or I 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.970
 it seems to me that connecting the words 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.230
 until here he whipped it is exceeded in 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.820
 the most beautiful is a little thing 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.610
 strong to say because at the beginning 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.050
 chaotic this we did not like much but 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.220
 I did not finish it, I liked what 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.560
 You want me to tell you why there are some 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.030
 It's a good thing that the maps 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.070
 textures are good for good 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.300
 they continue failing the textures 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.799
 things are clear enough that 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.470
 thank you very much 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.060
 whites 2 never disappoints guys is a 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.770
 very complete game is a game that has 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.990
 gusts that have good weapons that are 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.370
 well balanced thing that in amber 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.949
 warfare does not happen there is much difference 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.919
 between assault rifles and their rifles in 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:38.690
 the white 2 the courts the msn cela mp7 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.440
 has nothing to envy a rifle 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.440
 assault you already know 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.830
 and also tell you that effectively 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:47.419
 gusts the maps are pretty good are 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.470
 pretty clear moral game modes 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:53.780
 very much hot point of measurement 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.640
 all of these modes that are also in 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.980
 white in the warfare atlas but for 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.810
 example is not much variety of games 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.950
 of weapons game for example games 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.740
 of bonus that one that we hope 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.540
 that they put it as they go through the 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.000
 game or not 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.510
 the thing is a game that is super 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.580
 complete and why because you know 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.370
 they inspired and inspired that 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.660
 day using that great advantage because I say 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.430
 that great advantage because I do not know about you 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:24.400
 but in the amar wafa I have to be 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:28.190
 constantly pending of everything or 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.740
 When it was a game I feel lame 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.420
 the command concentrated and I stared 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.720
 the screen and minute of treatment to the 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.550
 sides and I look ahead from behind 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.050
 left right up down I have to 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.670
 control the heights I have to be 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.010
 very attentive if airstrip exempt 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.330
 streak of 12 try not to field for 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.970
 the games that I took are 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.460
 entertaining costs a lot costs a lot 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.530
 in the Cause 2 you did that yes 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.570
 you effectively did that to what extent 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.760
 until it's over until it's over 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.100
 selu kiss when I took that place 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.870
 sad more rested a bit because you leave 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.480
 the enemies have been relaxed the 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.130
 view you took 10 seconds of relaxation and 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.600
 you say good because I know where they are for 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.610
 tell him kill them and I know they are not going to 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.230
 kill because I have them checked here 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.660
 not here you can skip one from three 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.600
 meters and suddenly they come and suddenly 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.430
 kill you on the back they prescribe a lot 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.740
 people that I do not know if it happens to you 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.690
 also but I do not know if they will be the ones 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:25.670
 camps that are very false I do not know what will be 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:27.290
 but you kill 164 varas and in which the 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.450
 you are contracting 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.950
 front and there is no time neither to turn you neither 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.639
 to make a reaction because it kills you 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.830
 two bullets 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:36.810
 one thing I say is chemistry 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.180
 well this is extremely false 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:42.060
 the truth is that white this is a 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.220
 I play and also this week playing in 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.570
 besides wafer I realized it has served 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.280
 to realize that I'm going to continue 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.460
 with the nuclear series with almost hey 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.570
 nuclear guarantor I believe that the nape of 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.650
 subscribers a series that has to 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.150
 be finished and could not be 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.950
 determine you already know what we need 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.900
 nuclear here continues as a clear 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:01.139
 is ready are two weapons and you have to 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.730
 finish it and what the fuck now all the 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:03.960
 world is talking about the heron and 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.220
 sure it's a lot more people 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.560
 Carmela costs and because there is no need 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.570
 take advantage of it is also the assembly of 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.680
 black ops 12 and the ghost that will be very 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.000
 entertaining 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.700
 Obviously I will keep uploading more 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.229
 beautiful warfare is the novelty but not that 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.360
 it does not mean that I do not stop uploading this 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:20.100
 great game that gives everything I do not know what 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.930
 You think about the subject, although it is the same as 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:26.970
 I fail things like gusts 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:28.860
 maps game modes of weapons I do not know what 

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.200
 you think I think it's an opinion 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.400
 shared that many people will say 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.570
 Well, if I have to try and also 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.880
 warfare because I said that is the 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.820
 Novelty but when we get a month 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.380
 squeezing the issues in my prestige is 

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.419
 seventh eighth we are in the last 

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.500
 prestige we will say and now that now 

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:45.870
 because I play because 

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.910
 to play to get an adn to the one that is 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:50.490
 impossible almost practically is very 

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.990
 difficult because I'm going to play by taking out 

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.510
 fewer medals but two with gusts 

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:57.150
 it does not have merit either but it is a 

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:58.910
 little boring think about it think about 

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.950
 it 

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:03.110
 and please tell me in the comments 

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.060
 what do you think but as you can see in the title 

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:08.240
 I think the truth is fine 

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:10.850
 chosen white two guys is a game 

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.020
 never never never disappoints hope 

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.220
 that you liked the video guys and that 

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.120
 you give them favorites and see you in the 

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.120
 next until after
