00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
been on if we could only have got

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.770 
been on if we could only have got
through<00:00:39.660> someone<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.050> beat<00:00:40.350> games<00:00:40.649> against

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
through someone in beat games against

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.869 
through someone in beat games against
Chelsea<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.559> know<00:00:43.710> against<00:00:44.040> Stoke<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.670> mean

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
Chelsea you know against Stoke I mean

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.580 
Chelsea you know against Stoke I mean
we'd<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.660> been<00:00:45.870> we'd<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.350> been<00:00:46.440> right

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
we'd have been we'd have been right

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.080 
we'd have been we'd have been right
there<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.340> finish<00:00:47.489> off<00:00:47.760> what<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:47.969> was

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
there just to finish off what I was

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.340 
there just to finish off what I was
saying<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:48.450> well<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> think<00:00:48.690> our<00:00:49.020> level<00:00:49.200> of

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
saying as well I think our level of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.979 
saying as well I think our level of
performance<00:00:49.969> generally<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.300> improved<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.870> our

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
performance generally is improved in our

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.200 
performance generally is improved in our
players<00:00:52.230> room<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.489> show<00:00:53.670> Nia<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
players room so you can show Nia but the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.330 
players room so you can show Nia but the
one<00:00:54.329> caveat<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.770> also

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
one caveat I have to that is I also

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.160 
one caveat I have to that is I also
judge<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> tune<00:00:56.969> by<00:00:57.149> they<00:00:57.270> go<00:00:57.449> different<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
judge a tune by they go different and

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.349 
judge a tune by they go different and
our<00:00:58.920> bow<00:00:59.160> differences<00:00:59.670> twenty-something

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
our bow differences twenty-something

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.970 
our bow differences twenty-something
we're<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> same<00:01:00.930> level<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.350> Everton<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
we're on the same level as Everton and

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.850 
we're on the same level as Everton and
Man<00:01:02.550> United<00:01:03.000> were<00:01:03.149> miles<00:01:03.840> behind<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.650> likes

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
Man United were miles behind the likes

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.830 
Man United were miles behind the likes
of<00:01:04.979> Liverpool<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.580> City<00:01:05.790> or<00:01:06.030> about<00:01:06.299> 30<00:01:06.540> goals

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
of Liverpool and City or about 30 goals

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.510 
of Liverpool and City or about 30 goals
ahead<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.229> needs<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.710> addressed<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.159> as

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
ahead that needs to be addressed and as

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.700 
ahead that needs to be addressed and as
you<00:01:08.700> just<00:01:08.909> said<00:01:09.060> will<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.260> big<00:01:10.439> games

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
you just said will be and the big games

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.440 
you just said will be and the big games
and<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> Stoke<00:01:11.310> we've<00:01:11.880> been<00:01:12.060> good<00:01:12.210> against

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
and the Stoke we've been good against

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.000 
and the Stoke we've been good against
the<00:01:12.540> lesser<00:01:12.780> team<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.170> much<00:01:13.260> totally<00:01:13.799> fair

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the lesser team as much totally fair

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.030 
the lesser team as much totally fair
that<00:01:14.220> was<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> one-off<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:15.560> we<00:01:16.560> need<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> sort

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that was a one-off but we need to sort

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.440 
that was a one-off but we need to sort
out<00:01:17.159> our<00:01:17.369> approach<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> away<00:01:18.210> games

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
out our approach to the away games

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.120 
out our approach to the away games
against<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> bigger<00:01:19.049> teams<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.650> think<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
against the bigger teams I think the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.590 
against the bigger teams I think the
template<00:01:20.580> will<00:01:20.700> need<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.939> follow<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.390> not

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
template will need to follow is not

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.300 
template will need to follow is not

the<00:01:23.610> by<00:01:23.790> Munich<00:01:24.180> away<00:01:24.390> performance<00:01:24.810> where<00:01:24.990> I

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the by Munich away performance where I

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.539 
the by Munich away performance where I
thought<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.350> played<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:25.680> intelligently

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
thought we played really intelligently

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.219 
thought we played really intelligently
there<00:01:26.790> arguably<00:01:27.119> were<00:01:27.299> at<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.810> time<00:01:27.990> they're

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
there arguably were at the time they're

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.190 
there arguably were at the time they're
the<00:01:28.320> best<00:01:28.500> team<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.799> Europe<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:30.299> defended

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the best team in Europe and we defended

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.450 
the best team in Europe and we defended
very<00:01:31.229> well<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.770> game<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.250> also

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
very well in that game and we also

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.100 
very well in that game and we also
looked<00:01:32.729> ain't<00:01:32.939> just<00:01:33.119> going<00:01:33.299> forward<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.840> we're

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
looked ain't just going forward so we're

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.190 
looked ain't just going forward so we're
so<00:01:34.710> we're<00:01:35.369> playing<00:01:35.640> cautiously<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.540> with<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
so we're playing cautiously and with the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200 
so we're playing cautiously and with the
second<00:01:37.530> intent<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.070> where<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.909> games

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210
