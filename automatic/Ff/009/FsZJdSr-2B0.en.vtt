salil<00:01:25.070> now<00:01:26.450> for<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:27.990> extra<00:01:28.170> good<00:01:28.350> we're<00:01:28.770> gonna

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
salil now for one extra good we're gonna

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.039 
salil now for one extra good we're gonna
do<00:01:28.979> next<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.490> align<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> wiimote<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.780> right

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
do next is align the wiimote just right

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.020 
do next is align the wiimote just right
so<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.590> far<00:01:31.860> back<00:01:32.100> enough<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> good

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
so it's far back enough to get a good

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.359 
so it's far back enough to get a good
angle<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:33.659> too<00:01:33.869> far<00:01:34.140> back<00:01:34.380> too<00:01:34.979> far<00:01:35.009> back

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
angle but not too far back too far back

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.580 
angle but not too far back too far back
to<00:01:35.549> get<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.729> bad<00:01:36.210> resolution<00:01:36.900> now<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.979> start<00:01:38.340> off
