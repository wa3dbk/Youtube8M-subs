extremely<00:02:06.959> manageable<00:02:07.880> and<00:02:09.229> I<00:02:10.229> really<00:02:10.800> think

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
extremely manageable and I really think

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.140 
extremely manageable and I really think
it's<00:02:11.130> sickness<00:02:11.430> I'm<00:02:11.610> going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.849> continue<00:02:12.030> to

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
it's sickness I'm going to continue to

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.910

ask<00:02:12.360> my<00:02:12.570> hair<00:02:12.810> regimen<00:02:12.960> I<00:02:13.290> probably<00:02:13.710> should

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
ask my hair regimen I probably should

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.830 
ask my hair regimen I probably should

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
that's in to use rican sugars about

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.770 
that's in to use rican sugars about
every<00:02:17.750> other<00:02:17.780> wash<00:02:18.200> versus<00:02:18.980> on<00:02:19.400> every<00:02:20.390> wash<00:02:20.599> if

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
every other wash versus on every wash if

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.750 
every other wash versus on every wash if
it<00:02:20.870> misses<00:02:20.989> had<00:02:21.319> much<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.580> definitely

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
it misses had much this is definitely

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.940 
it misses had much this is definitely
great<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.330> use<00:02:23.840> in<00:02:24.430> between<00:02:25.430> using<00:02:26.180> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
great to use in between using the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.759
