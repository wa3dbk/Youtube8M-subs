can go on Zoya calm and order this whole
thing<00:02:12.810> i<00:02:12.959> think<00:02:13.260> i<00:02:13.440> paid<00:02:13.739> twenty<00:02:14.099> four<00:02:14.280> dollars

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
thing i think i paid twenty four dollars

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.190 
thing i think i paid twenty four dollars
for<00:02:14.819> this<00:02:14.910> but<00:02:15.090> that's<00:02:15.209> because<00:02:15.480> i<00:02:15.750> get<00:02:15.989> a

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
for this but that's because i get a

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.320 
for this but that's because i get a
professional<00:02:16.709> rate<00:02:17.130> so<00:02:18.000> i<00:02:18.030> think<00:02:18.150> it's

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
professional rate so i think it's

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.670 
professional rate so i think it's
probably<00:02:18.420> forty<00:02:18.900> eight<00:02:19.020> dollars<00:02:19.440> for<00:02:19.470> all

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
probably forty eight dollars for all

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.990 
probably forty eight dollars for all
them<00:02:19.800> because<00:02:19.980> they're<00:02:20.099> eight<00:02:20.250> dollars<00:02:20.670> each

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
them because they're eight dollars each

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.210 
them because they're eight dollars each
but<00:02:21.810> i<00:02:22.260> still<00:02:22.590> thought<00:02:22.769> i<00:02:22.830> would<00:02:23.010> introduce
