Oh

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.640 

I<00:00:33.810> pretty<00:00:34.810> much<00:00:34.900> narrow<00:00:35.170> down<00:00:35.380> we<00:00:35.530> have<00:00:35.620> a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
I pretty much narrow down we have a

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.230 
I pretty much narrow down we have a
problem<00:00:35.950> with<00:00:36.220> the<00:00:36.400> master<00:00:36.760> cylinder<00:00:36.910> does

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.240 
problem with the master cylinder does

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.120 
problem with the master cylinder does
have<00:00:37.420> a<00:00:37.450> leak<00:00:37.660> but<00:00:37.810> its<00:00:37.960> internal<00:00:38.560> inside<00:00:38.950> of

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
have a leak but its internal inside of

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.650 
have a leak but its internal inside of
the<00:00:39.190> master<00:00:39.550> solder<00:00:39.820> where<00:00:40.180> it's<00:00:40.300> actually

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
the master solder where it's actually

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.050 
the master solder where it's actually
losing<00:00:41.050> pressure<00:00:41.410> the<00:00:42.100> next<00:00:42.370> step<00:00:42.550> now<00:00:42.760> is<00:00:42.790> to

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
losing pressure the next step now is to

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.120 
losing pressure the next step now is to
go<00:00:43.270> ahead<00:00:43.360> and<00:00:43.720> take<00:00:43.930> our<00:00:44.110> two<00:00:44.290> lines<00:00:44.620> off<00:00:44.920> the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
go ahead and take our two lines off the

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.340 
go ahead and take our two lines off the
master<00:00:45.460> solder<00:00:45.760> take<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:46.390> two<00:00:46.540> bolts<00:00:46.840> off<00:00:47.080> and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
master solder take the two bolts off and

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:56.720 
master solder take the two bolts off and
then<00:00:47.680> we<00:00:47.740> go<00:00:47.860> and<00:00:47.920> pull<00:00:48.100> it<00:00:48.190> out<00:00:48.280> of<00:00:48.310> the<00:00:48.460> way

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.979 

when<00:00:57.730> we<00:00:57.820> disconnect<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.270> brake<00:00:58.480> lines<00:00:58.750> for

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
when we disconnect the brake lines for

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.180 
when we disconnect the brake lines for
the<00:00:59.050> master<00:00:59.380> so<00:00:59.500> there's<00:00:59.710> going<00:00:59.800> to<00:00:59.860> be<00:00:59.920> some

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
the master so there's going to be some

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.740 
the master so there's going to be some

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
okay we have the power brake hose out of

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.960 
okay we have the power brake hose out of
our<00:01:35.830> way<00:01:35.980> the<00:01:36.250> next<00:01:36.430> thing<00:01:36.550> I<00:01:36.580> want<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.730> do<00:01:36.820> is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
our way the next thing I want to do is

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.310 
our way the next thing I want to do is
when<00:01:37.450> we're<00:01:37.540> taking<00:01:37.660> the<00:01:37.840> master<00:01:38.170> cylinder

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
when we're taking the master cylinder

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.140 
when we're taking the master cylinder
off<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.830> vehicle<00:01:39.010> just<00:01:39.310> leave<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.610> cap<00:01:39.880> on

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
off of the vehicle just leave the cap on

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.420 
off of the vehicle just leave the cap on
there<00:01:40.510> because<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:40.960> is<00:01:41.140> full<00:01:41.380> of<00:01:41.500> fluid<00:01:41.860> but<00:01:42.370> I

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
there because it is full of fluid but I

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.310 
there because it is full of fluid but I
do<00:01:42.520> want<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:42.880> unplug<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.360> level<00:01:43.690> sensor<00:01:44.110> and

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
do want to unplug the level sensor and

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.170 
do want to unplug the level sensor and
if<00:01:45.040> you<00:01:45.130> look<00:01:45.250> at<00:01:45.370> our<00:01:45.460> two<00:01:45.610> plugs<00:01:45.940> here

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
if you look at our two plugs here

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.340 
if you look at our two plugs here
there's<00:01:46.360> only<00:01:46.480> really<00:01:46.630> one<00:01:46.780> way<00:01:47.110> they<00:01:47.290> can

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
there's only really one way they can

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.890 
there's only really one way they can
reconnect<00:01:50.820> we<00:01:51.820> have<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.060> female<00:01:52.270> connector

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
reconnect we have the female connector

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.240 
reconnect we have the female connector
on<00:01:53.020> this<00:01:53.200> end<00:01:53.470> of<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.710> sensor<00:01:56.040> we<00:01:57.040> have<00:01:57.130> the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
on this end of the sensor we have the

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.800 
on this end of the sensor we have the
male<00:01:57.460> in<00:01:57.640> on<00:01:57.790> this<00:01:57.910> end<00:01:58.090> of<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.210> sensor<00:01:58.510> so<00:01:58.660> we

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
male in on this end of the sensor so we

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.780 
male in on this end of the sensor so we
go<00:01:58.930> to<00:01:58.990> reattach<00:01:59.590> it<00:01:59.890> it's<00:02:00.340> pretty<00:02:00.610> much

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
go to reattach it it's pretty much

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.340 
go to reattach it it's pretty much
foolproof<00:02:01.270> which<00:02:01.780> way<00:02:01.930> it<00:02:02.020> goes<00:02:02.050> back

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
foolproof which way it goes back

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.010 
foolproof which way it goes back
together<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:04.180> next<00:02:04.330> step<00:02:04.570> we<00:02:04.720> want<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.930> leave

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
together the next step we want to leave

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.420 
together the next step we want to leave
the<00:02:05.140> master<00:02:05.500> cylinder<00:02:05.650> attached<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.340> the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
the master cylinder attached to the

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.620 
the master cylinder attached to the
power<00:02:06.610> brake<00:02:06.820> booster<00:02:06.970> to<00:02:07.150> help<00:02:07.330> hold<00:02:07.510> it

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
power brake booster to help hold it

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.419 
power brake booster to help hold it
still<00:02:07.960> we<00:02:08.619> want<00:02:08.740> to<00:02:08.800> go<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:08.979> take<00:02:09.070> the<00:02:09.220> brake

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
still we want to go and take the brake

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.540 
still we want to go and take the brake
lines<00:02:09.700> off<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.090> master<00:02:10.420> cylinder

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.370 

okay<00:02:14.330> this<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:14.540> where<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.690> line<00:02:14.900> wrench<00:02:15.170> ruler

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
okay this is where a line wrench ruler

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.690 
okay this is where a line wrench ruler
comes<00:02:15.530> in<00:02:15.770> handy<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.160> way<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.370> wrench<00:02:16.550> is

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
comes in handy the way the wrench is

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.160 
comes in handy the way the wrench is
made<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.030> line<00:02:17.210> could<00:02:17.420> go<00:02:17.510> in<00:02:17.690> between<00:02:17.840> the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
made the line could go in between the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.600 
made the line could go in between the
wrench<00:02:18.380> there<00:02:18.620> if<00:02:18.890> you've<00:02:19.070> ever<00:02:19.220> taken<00:02:19.400> a

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
wrench there if you've ever taken a

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.190 
wrench there if you've ever taken a
fitting<00:02:19.940> off<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.240> you<00:02:20.300> fittings<00:02:20.930> all<00:02:21.050> been

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
fitting off and you fittings all been

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.470 
fitting off and you fittings all been
rounded<00:02:21.650> off<00:02:21.800> chances<00:02:22.400> are<00:02:22.580> they<00:02:23.030> just<00:02:23.180> use<00:02:23.360> an

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
rounded off chances are they just use an

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.150
