00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello them today I would teach them to make a 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.740
 mask of her and the jac 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.830
 they do not want to say good for that anymore 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.060
 we will need a mold which I used 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.010
 is then recognize her but 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.710
 they can use the ones they want too 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.210
 subject we can leave subject as you want 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.189
 all right 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.970
 then after we have the 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:29.570
 layers of cumin are left a paste of 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:33.380
 toilet paper with water 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.780
 glue so it is not so fragile and 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.150
 be more resistant I recommend you 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.630
 make at least 5 layers or 6 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.630
 Well, see how many emergencies 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.110
 then there that criterion the first thing that 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.250
 we would do 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.740
 that is the eyes 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.020
 there is not a certain way of eyes so that 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:58.160
 be the church that you consider 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.820
 it depends on your good mask mold 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.420
 as I have this then I decided 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.210
 cut them and I decided to cut them short 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.100
 good side can be cut with a cutter 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.640
 or with a knife that has scarce 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.540
 well what they say that I take a lot and 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.540
 now I have cut 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.320
 all right 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.450
 since we have it that way now what 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.030
 we will paint and I recommend it to be painting 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.840
 fifteen 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.840
 He is the king 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.700
 Not toxic, of course, and therefore 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.700
 let's paint 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.220
 this is not the brush it 's good this 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.729
 paintbrushes for wall paintings 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:06.340
 because it's a little bit good, it's not very 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:11.110
 well that we say I recommend a brush 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.420
 brush average thickness of the drawing 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.760
 I did not load as much paint 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.939
 which, because it is very liquid , can 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.730
 it's more wade grace or something like that and well no 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.730
 we want to hear it 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.390
 while I start doing this thing 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.299
 get the history of this and the eyak 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.990
 good since he is a character of vast 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:40.370
 As everybody know 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:44.960
 but this this character that does not have 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.210
 voice eyes my mouth is in a 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.990
 revolutionary of a position of 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.819
 newspapers 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.519
 and so 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.100
 his country came in as the USA between 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.030
 Second World War 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.080
 well see was written no 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.180
 and inside protection was found a 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.810
 companions 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.810
 brother friend or whatever and this 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.930
 and then they two went to war 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.620
 but when they were launching the 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.400
 enemy lines 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.290
 you threw poison gas and then 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.909
 It caused her to stay in chat 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.849
 blind and his friend then with the impact or 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.160
 something like that I do not remember well but I received a 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:34.500
 Shooting 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:38.100
 and then his friend died 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.930
 he himself died and he returned home and 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.120
 We only expected you to be there 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:47.930
 that his mom was very 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.780
 you can say not impressed by everything 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.970
 that because his son no longer had eyes 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.820
 because spending on the bear would do it 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.180
 had caused me this something like 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.700
 infection or irritation which is something 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.830
 bad 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.160
 and this one and he had asked him what 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.500
 I had passed 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.090
 and then its 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.850
 because his mom told him that his brother 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.090
 he had died in a work accident 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.070
 then she has already stayed them 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.260
 I wanted to cry but I could not girl no 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.330
 we had 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.300
 and then his mother died a few 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.090
 weeks died he is said to have died for that 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.920
 great sadness 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.740
 and so 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.569
 and then we think that was something sad you 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.630
 I put myself 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.529
 and so 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.569
 then lesjak 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:42.569
 he grabbed a gun that was in his house 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.230
 he shot opened his mouth and fired 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:53.680
 inside his vocal cords he 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:57.250
 they broke in a millisecond but it seemed 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:00.700
 that everything was already brother and he would fall 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.830
 lifeless to the ground but to his surprise 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:10.140
 I was still standing 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:10.140
 the burst of his pistol 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.010
 it did not cause you like a show or something like that 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.780
 Then he decided 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.780
 after that he decided to look 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.810
 it can be a love, a love or something 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.180
 well but 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:35.320
 but he did not look for it like all 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.110
 but he kills or removes good organs is 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.550
 as a vigilante that when you go to 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.330
 sleep 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.009
 and good is always at night 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.480
 good you'll always end you is 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:48.540
 original 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.210
 time is watching but in that in 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.830
 the one of those nights is to remove the eyes 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:56.860
 because I do not know 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.720
 it's something like that and well our mask 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.950
 it stays like this 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:05.370
 ok would upload another video to teach them 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.280
 how to do 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:14.120
 dripping things and the shadow effect 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.120
 back well that's it and thank you
