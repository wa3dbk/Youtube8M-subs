located<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:58.439> terms<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.920> where<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.340> house<00:01:59.549> is

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
located in terms of where the house is

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.539 
located in terms of where the house is
and<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.960> lot<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.409> comes<00:02:01.950> into<00:02:02.340> play

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
and a lot of this comes into play

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.429 
and a lot of this comes into play
because<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:03.030> all<00:02:03.210> energy<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:03.990> it's<00:02:04.290> all

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
because it's all energy and it's all

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.920 
because it's all energy and it's all
what's<00:02:04.680> happening<00:02:05.159> on<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.340> site<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.479> it

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
what's happening on the site so it it

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.050 
what's happening on the site so it it
actually<00:02:07.170> determines<00:02:08.099> how<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.310> lay<00:02:08.670> out<00:02:08.849> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
actually determines how we lay out the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.660 
actually determines how we lay out the
garden<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.690> how<00:02:10.319> we<00:02:10.379> design<00:02:11.099> how<00:02:11.459> we're<00:02:11.580> going

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
garden and how we design how we're going

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.110 
garden and how we design how we're going
to<00:02:11.730> grow<00:02:11.910> our

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
to grow our

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.149 
to grow our
food<00:02:12.299> after<00:02:13.290> we<00:02:13.409> make<00:02:13.590> those<00:02:13.799> observations

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
food after we make those observations

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.160 
food after we make those observations
together<00:02:14.970> we<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:15.390> go<00:02:15.629> through<00:02:15.659> a<00:02:15.900> simple

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
together we just go through a simple

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.500 
together we just go through a simple
mapping<00:02:16.500> process<00:02:16.950> where<00:02:17.760> we<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.060> articulate

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
mapping process where we can articulate

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.380 
mapping process where we can articulate
it<00:02:18.870> in<00:02:19.019> one<00:02:19.650> place<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.250> see<00:02:20.519> what<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.000> what

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
it in one place and see what the what

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.690 
it in one place and see what the what
those<00:02:21.599> flows<00:02:21.989> end<00:02:22.290> up<00:02:22.470> shape<00:02:23.190> how<00:02:23.459> they<00:02:23.640> should

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
those flows end up shape how they should

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.970 
those flows end up shape how they should
end<00:02:23.940> up<00:02:24.060> shaping<00:02:24.480> our<00:02:24.599> garden<00:02:25.019> or<00:02:25.650> we<00:02:25.799> can

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
end up shaping our garden or we can

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.430 
end up shaping our garden or we can
create<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.489> pathway<00:02:27.060> that's<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.140> easiest

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
create a pathway that's the easiest

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.770 
create a pathway that's the easiest
access<00:02:28.680> for<00:02:29.159> us<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.640> then<00:02:29.849> just<00:02:30.060> plant<00:02:30.510> all

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
access for us and then just plant all

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.649 
access for us and then just plant all
around<00:02:30.890> that<00:02:31.890> space<00:02:32.370> all<00:02:32.730> around<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.329> the<00:02:33.420> path

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
around that space all around to the path

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.660 
around that space all around to the path
so<00:02:34.260> we<00:02:34.379> basically<00:02:34.530> make<00:02:34.980> paths<00:02:35.220> through<00:02:35.549> the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
so we basically make paths through the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.550 
so we basically make paths through the
garden<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.239> then<00:02:36.450> plant<00:02:36.690> where<00:02:36.930> there<00:02:37.379> aren't

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
garden and then plant where there aren't

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.740 
garden and then plant where there aren't
there<00:02:37.860> isn't<00:02:38.129> a<00:02:38.159> path<00:02:38.340> after<00:02:39.090> we've<00:02:39.239> laid<00:02:39.569> out

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
there isn't a path after we've laid out

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.569 
there isn't a path after we've laid out
the<00:02:39.959> pass<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.560> determine<00:02:40.890> where<00:02:41.310> they<00:02:41.430> are

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
the pass and to determine where they are

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.490 
the pass and to determine where they are
we<00:02:41.760> just<00:02:41.940> start<00:02:42.180> building<00:02:42.599> up<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.900> beds<00:02:43.140> and

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
we just start building up the beds and

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.289 
we just start building up the beds and
that's<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.099> perfect<00:02:44.280> time<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.910> bring<00:02:45.090> in<00:02:45.209> the

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
that's the perfect time to bring in the

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.380 
that's the perfect time to bring in the
compost<00:02:45.780> which<00:02:46.109> is<00:02:46.319> broken<00:02:47.250> down<00:02:47.489> organic

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
compost which is broken down organic

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.890 
compost which is broken down organic
matter<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:49.579> which<00:02:50.579> that's<00:02:50.940> what<00:02:51.239> feeds<00:02:51.569> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
matter and which that's what feeds the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.349 
matter and which that's what feeds the
soil<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.470> which<00:02:53.099> in<00:02:53.310> turn<00:02:53.489> feeds<00:02:53.790> our<00:02:53.940> plants

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
soil and which in turn feeds our plants

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.839 
soil and which in turn feeds our plants
that<00:02:54.540> are<00:02:54.569> feeding<00:02:54.870> us<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.099> link<00:02:56.400> actually

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
that are feeding us I the link actually

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.319 
that are feeding us I the link actually
is<00:02:57.180> from<00:02:57.569> from<00:02:58.379> Lex<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.769> dairy<00:02:59.280> farms<00:02:59.790> have

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
is from from Lex a dairy farms have

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.660 
is from from Lex a dairy farms have
manure<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.140> compostable<00:03:01.829> materials<00:03:02.040> like

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
manure and compostable materials like

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.940 
manure and compostable materials like
that<00:03:02.879> that<00:03:03.540> are<00:03:03.569> already<00:03:03.780> pre<00:03:04.170> composted<00:03:04.769> like

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
that that are already pre composted like

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.800 
that that are already pre composted like
this<00:03:05.159> maneuver<00:03:05.519> here<00:03:05.760> yeah<00:03:06.030> would<00:03:06.420> come<00:03:06.659> in

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
this maneuver here yeah would come in

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.349 
this maneuver here yeah would come in
and<00:03:07.079> go<00:03:07.200> directly<00:03:07.590> into<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:08.010> soil<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.489> then

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
and go directly into the soil and then

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.300 
and go directly into the soil and then
you<00:03:09.510> add<00:03:09.690> moisture<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.440> incorporate<00:03:11.190> it<00:03:11.280> with

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
you add moisture and incorporate it with

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.819 
you add moisture and incorporate it with
your<00:03:11.489> soil<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.090> grow<00:03:12.510> plant<00:03:12.810> material<00:03:13.379> and

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
your soil and grow plant material and

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.949 
your soil and grow plant material and
you'll<00:03:13.950> get<00:03:14.099> wheat<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:15.299> part<00:03:15.569> of<00:03:15.599> that<00:03:15.720> cycle

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
you'll get wheat and part of that cycle

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.720 
you'll get wheat and part of that cycle
is<00:03:16.230> what<00:03:16.410> he<00:03:16.500> do<00:03:16.620> with<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.889> weeds<00:03:17.099> the<00:03:17.340> we<00:03:17.489> go

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
is what he do with the weeds the we go

cobbler thank you party crew so there's

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.189 
cobbler thank you party crew so there's
a<00:03:47.549> bunch<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.090> different<00:03:48.150> ways<00:03:48.540> we<00:03:48.780> can<00:03:48.989> get

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
a bunch of different ways we can get

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.619 
a bunch of different ways we can get
water<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.949> the<00:03:50.190> planets<00:03:50.609> to<00:03:51.120> make<00:03:51.269> it<00:03:51.389> really

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
water to the planets to make it really

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.860 
water to the planets to make it really
simple<00:03:52.430> for<00:03:53.430> people<00:03:53.459> were<00:03:53.879> a<00:03:54.150> lot<00:03:54.449> of<00:03:54.480> times<00:03:54.720> we

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
simple for people were a lot of times we

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.780 
simple for people were a lot of times we
put<00:03:55.049> in<00:03:55.139> drip<00:03:55.440> irrigation<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:56.129> micro<00:03:56.459> spray

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
put in drip irrigation and micro spray

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.339 
put in drip irrigation and micro spray
and<00:03:56.940> that's<00:03:57.090> just<00:03:57.299> super<00:03:58.019> simple

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
and that's just super simple

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.860 
and that's just super simple
plug-and-play<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.760> goes<00:03:59.940> off<00:04:00.180> on<00:04:00.209> timers

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
plug-and-play and it goes off on timers

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.229 
plug-and-play and it goes off on timers
and<00:04:01.139> so<00:04:01.319> you<00:04:01.379> basically<00:04:01.590> don't<00:04:02.010> have<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.430> to

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
and so you basically don't have to to

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.270 
and so you basically don't have to to
worry<00:04:03.449> about<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:03.930> garden<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.680> water<00:04:04.919> it

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
worry about the garden and the water it

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.449 
worry about the garden and the water it
just<00:04:05.519> takes<00:04:05.879> care<00:04:06.120> of<00:04:06.150> itself<00:04:07.040> we<00:04:08.040> put<00:04:08.250> in<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
just takes care of itself we put in the

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:15.020 
just takes care of itself we put in the
irrigation<00:04:09.120> now<00:04:09.299> we're<00:04:09.449> ready<00:04:09.569> to<00:04:09.780> plant<00:04:14.030> the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
irrigation now we're ready to plant the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.719 
irrigation now we're ready to plant the
ground<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.660> couple<00:04:16.169> of<00:04:16.410> these<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.919> just<00:04:17.340> dream

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
ground a couple of these and just dream

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.240 
ground a couple of these and just dream
out<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.150> garden<00:04:18.299> we're<00:04:18.630> going<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:19.250> just

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
out to the garden we're going to just

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.180 
out to the garden we're going to just
hold<00:04:20.400> on<00:04:20.579> to<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:21.120> point<00:04:21.630> out<00:04:21.840> once<00:04:22.650> we<00:04:22.860> start

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
hold on to a point out once we start

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.070 
hold on to a point out once we start
planting<00:04:23.849> we're<00:04:24.300> pretty<00:04:24.479> much<00:04:24.719> dancing

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
together we were taking all working

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.320 
together we were taking all working
together<00:04:28.469> as<00:04:29.039> a<00:04:29.099> team<00:04:29.400> and<00:04:29.880> putting<00:04:30.210> our

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
together as a team and putting our

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.300 
together as a team and putting our
country<00:04:30.780> certain<00:04:31.500> plants<00:04:31.620> with<00:04:31.919> a<00:04:31.979> certain

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
country certain plants with a certain

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.490 
country certain plants with a certain
bed<00:04:32.520> garden<00:04:33.030> bed<00:04:33.210> like<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:33.870> mentioned<00:04:34.140> earlier

we're creating mimicking an ecosystem

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.969 
we're creating mimicking an ecosystem
out<00:04:50.639> in<00:04:50.909> the<00:04:51.030> wild<00:04:51.479> where<00:04:52.080> some<00:04:52.440> plants<00:04:52.830> are

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
out in the wild where some plants are

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.060 
out in the wild where some plants are
creating<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:54.240> fertility<00:04:55.050> for<00:04:55.380> others<00:04:55.770> and
