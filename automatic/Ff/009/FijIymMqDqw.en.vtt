00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
leveling there's a bunch of things that

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.980 
leveling there's a bunch of things that
I<00:00:28.349> noticed<00:00:28.800> right<00:00:29.010> from<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.369> start

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
I noticed right from the start

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.780 
I noticed right from the start
dynamic<00:00:30.990> events<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.769> pop<00:00:31.949> up<00:00:32.099> all<00:00:32.279> over<00:00:32.700> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
dynamic events that pop up all over the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.190 
dynamic events that pop up all over the
map<00:00:32.940> like<00:00:33.149> you're<00:00:33.300> seeing<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> footage<00:00:34.110> on

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
map like you're seeing in the footage on

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.250 
map like you're seeing in the footage on
the<00:00:34.320> screen<00:00:34.590> right<00:00:34.829> now<00:00:34.940> actually<00:00:35.940> give<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.870> lot

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the screen right now actually give a lot

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.569 
the screen right now actually give a lot
of<00:00:37.380> experience<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.070> should<00:00:38.100> pretty<00:00:38.489> much

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
of experience you should pretty much

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.389 
of experience you should pretty much
always<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.660> um<00:00:39.870> they<00:00:40.530> are<00:00:40.770> probably<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
always do this um they are probably the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.130 
always do this um they are probably the
highest<00:00:41.610> experienced<00:00:42.420> things<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> game

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
highest experienced things in the game

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.020 
highest experienced things in the game
and<00:00:43.440> there's<00:00:43.920> really<00:00:44.100> no<00:00:44.280> reason<00:00:44.489> not<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> do

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and there's really no reason not to do

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.240 
and there's really no reason not to do
them<00:00:45.239> especially<00:00:46.050> if<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.500> combine<00:00:46.829> them

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
them especially if you can combine them

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.970 
them especially if you can combine them
somehow<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> hard<00:00:48.300> quest<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:49.739> hard

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
somehow with the hard quest the hard

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.160 
somehow with the hard quest the hard
quest<00:00:50.250> actually<00:00:50.730> gives<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.780> lot<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:51.989> experience

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
quest actually gives a lot of experience

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.959 
quest actually gives a lot of experience
as<00:00:52.680> well<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.190> course<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.610> lot<00:00:53.760> better

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
as well but of course it's a lot better

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.090 
as well but of course it's a lot better
if<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.420> combine<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.500> actually

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
if you can combine it to and actually

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.560 
if you can combine it to and actually
get<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> double<00:00:56.789> experience<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.420> would

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
get the double experience I would

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.180 
get the double experience I would
recommend<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.170> every<00:00:58.500> single<00:00:58.649> dynamic

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
recommend you do every single dynamic

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.990 
recommend you do every single dynamic
event<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.670> pops<00:00:59.879> up<00:01:00.059> nearby<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.850> so<00:01:02.850> one

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
event that pops up nearby to you so one

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.130 
event that pops up nearby to you so one
thing<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.359> lot<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.570> people<00:01:03.960> do<00:01:04.110> not

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
thing that a lot of people do not

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.080 
thing that a lot of people do not
realize<00:01:04.320> with<00:01:04.979> dynamic<00:01:05.400> event<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:05.970> you

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
realize with dynamic event is that you

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.820 
realize with dynamic event is that you
do<00:01:06.270> not<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.720> stay<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> area<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.680> you

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
do not have to stay in the area if you

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.190 
do not have to stay in the area if you
already<00:01:08.310> think<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.790> gold<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.780> example

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
already think you have gold for example

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.020 
already think you have gold for example
an<00:01:10.260> event<00:01:10.650> pop-up<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.280> next<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.909> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
an event pop-up right next to you and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.760 
an event pop-up right next to you and
you<00:01:12.240> do<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.570> half<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.140> progress<00:01:13.530> bar

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
you do like half of the progress bar

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.410 
you do like half of the progress bar
yourself<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.549> not<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.970> stay<00:01:15.210> there

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
yourself you do not have to stay there

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.539 
yourself you do not have to stay there
and<00:01:15.630> finish<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> entire<00:01:16.740> event<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.340> just

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
and finish the entire event you can just

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.789 
and finish the entire event you can just
move<00:01:17.729> away<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.299> as<00:01:19.110> long<00:01:19.320> as<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.530> do<00:01:19.710> not

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
move away and as long as you do not

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.039 
move away and as long as you do not
leave<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.189> area<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.610> think<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.119> actually<00:01:21.479> will

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
leave the area I think you actually will

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.690 
leave the area I think you actually will
gain<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.350> gold<00:01:22.770> medal<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.310> build<00:01:23.520> gained

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
gain the gold medal and you build gained

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.039 
gain the gold medal and you build gained
the<00:01:23.850> experience<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.479> do<00:01:24.659> not<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:24.840> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the experience so you do not have to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.840 
the experience so you do not have to
stay<00:01:25.229> there<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.310> need<00:01:26.400> some<00:01:26.670> other

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
stay there you just need some other

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.539 
stay there you just need some other
people<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.390> will<00:01:27.570> finish<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.020> out<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.380> you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
so while you're going through the world

of experience as well most people do not
realize<00:02:23.860> this<00:02:24.430> but<00:02:24.610> if<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.849> level<00:02:25.060> from<00:02:25.390> one

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599

leveling<00:02:30.790> up<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:31.060> can<00:02:31.180> probably<00:02:31.360> do<00:02:31.720> this

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
leveling up you can probably do this

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.570

that's pretty much ten to twenty three

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.460 
that's pretty much ten to twenty three
levels<00:02:35.709> if<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.430> do<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:36.880> properly<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.569> since
