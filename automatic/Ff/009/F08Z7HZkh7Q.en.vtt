00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.010 
actually came first
bangles<00:01:51.920> after<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:52.340> did<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:53.149> disc<00:01:53.420> earring

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
bangles after I did the the disc earring

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.169 
bangles after I did the the disc earring
the<00:01:54.799> disc<00:01:55.039> earring<00:01:55.490> really<00:01:56.319> became<00:01:57.340> this<00:01:58.340> that

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
the disc earring really became this that

the disc earring really became this that
bangle<00:01:59.719> and<00:02:00.079> you<00:02:00.709> can<00:02:00.859> see<00:02:01.039> this<00:02:01.219> the

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
bangle and you can see this the

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.090 
bangle and you can see this the
correlation<00:02:02.090> because<00:02:02.929> it<00:02:03.289> has<00:02:03.439> a<00:02:03.469> thick<00:02:03.859> edge

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
correlation because it has a thick edge

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.190 
correlation because it has a thick edge
to<00:02:04.549> it<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:04.850> then<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:05.509> was<00:02:05.569> hammered<00:02:05.990> from

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
to it and then it was hammered from

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.330 
to it and then it was hammered from
within<00:02:06.409> to<00:02:07.250> have<00:02:07.429> a<00:02:07.459> bulge<00:02:07.819> and<00:02:08.269> that

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
within to have a bulge and that

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.630 
within to have a bulge and that
full-blown<00:02:10.340> shape<00:02:10.849> is<00:02:11.209> what<00:02:11.950> gave<00:02:12.950> me<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.250> lot

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
full-blown shape is what gave me a lot

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.020 
full-blown shape is what gave me a lot
of<00:02:13.810> my<00:02:14.810> iconic<00:02:15.260> imagery<00:02:15.769> back<00:02:16.459> in<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.730> 70s<00:02:17.290> and

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
of my iconic imagery back in the 70s and

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.110 
of my iconic imagery back in the 70s and
they<00:02:20.030> still<00:02:20.650> wear<00:02:21.650> these<00:02:21.799> today<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.579> mean

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
they still wear these today I mean

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.819 
they still wear these today I mean
they're<00:02:23.269> still<00:02:23.360> buying<00:02:23.660> them<00:02:23.900> today<00:02:24.170> they're

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
they're still buying them today they're

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.759 
they're still buying them today they're
still<00:02:25.010> using<00:02:25.310> them<00:02:25.430> in<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.760> magazines<00:02:26.209> today

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
still using them in the magazines today

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.970 
still using them in the magazines today
so<00:02:27.769> that's<00:02:28.430> classic
