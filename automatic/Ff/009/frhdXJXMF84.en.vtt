00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.040
 The Project Percent is Sepp Maier's commitment in the Lingen Year nuclear power plant 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.860
 mate 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.480
 it's about cooling the critical points in the reactor blocks 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.950
 We already have two years of experience with both Base's customers 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.680
 In addition, we have on a deployment experiences critical situation 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.990
 So, for example, even in Chernobyl in use so this pump 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.570
 has a frame quantity of 62 meters so that it can be over the reactor 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.850
 reach over it 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.240
 and by the 6 single army, she is very flexible in the use of the water 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.730
 to spend in the right place 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.320
 will also be machines of murder that he will use and will 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.770
 Antonov strives again 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.860
 So who else will you get an identical machine from her again? 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:14.550
 ship or even shipped from the US two machines 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.400
 These machines we spend from the USA are even longer 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.400
 an insert at from 70 meters 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.450
 it is an Antonov 124 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.869
 one of the biggest costume moves things civilian area care 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.830
 One of the few machines Moreno Lauenroth can make trouble 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.040
 the way fully loaded next days almost 400 tons 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.830
 by Dominik Stein 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.109
 Partner span of about 80 messages 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:14.979
 the approximately 70 message to the cargo today trade weight of just under 60 tons 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:19.029
 and you can do this loading there 110 tons 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:23.609
 for this storage certainly no idea speech there it is the only aircraft of the 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.719
 TuS can do 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.779
 and therefore the freighters will be done with this invitation now or around 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.609
 the answer will be whether we are more often used for this 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:33.899
 this project 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:36.599
 which will be used again for this project 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.739
 expected on April 11th
