to uncheck that i'm going to choose

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.520 
to uncheck that i'm going to choose
object<00:02:17.730> offset<00:02:18.730> which<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.750> object<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.349> we

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
object offset which the object that we

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.000 
object offset which the object that we
have<00:02:20.709> selected<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.690> simply<00:02:23.140> drag<00:02:23.530> like<00:02:23.799> this

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
you seem go in different ways so i'm

just going to pull it up a little bit
like<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:30.400> can<00:02:30.610> actually<00:02:30.760> start<00:02:31.150> to

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
like that so you can actually start to

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.970 
like that so you can actually start to
see<00:02:31.480> more<00:02:31.690> look<00:02:31.989> like<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.200> chain<00:02:32.470> link<00:02:32.680> up<00:02:32.830> is

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
see more look like a chain link up is

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.789 
see more look like a chain link up is
our<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.670> rotate<00:02:34.090> see<00:02:34.930> it's<00:02:35.290> not<00:02:35.440> looking<00:02:35.709> like

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
our to rotate see it's not looking like

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.009 
our to rotate see it's not looking like
a<00:02:35.830> chain<00:02:36.130> i'm<00:02:36.970> going<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.180> rotate<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.569> on<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.810> z

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
a chain i'm going to rotate it on the z

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.839 
a chain i'm going to rotate it on the z
axis<00:02:38.459> so<00:02:40.110> here<00:02:41.110> I<00:02:41.260> have<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.829> have<00:02:41.920> my<00:02:42.250> chain<00:02:42.549> I

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
axis so here I have it I have my chain I

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.990 
axis so here I have it I have my chain I
can<00:02:43.720> add<00:02:46.019> more<00:02:47.019> to<00:02:47.349> it<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.709> can<00:02:48.280> make<00:02:48.489> my<00:02:48.670> chain

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
can add more to it I can make my chain

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.539 
can add more to it I can make my chain
they<00:02:49.299> form<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:51.480> path<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:53.350> that's<00:02:54.250> easily

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
they form to a path and that's easily

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:01.860 
they form to a path and that's easily
done<00:02:56.250> simply<00:02:57.450> let's<00:02:59.340> just<00:03:00.340> baseball<00:03:00.519> add<00:03:00.970> and

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
done simply let's just baseball add and

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.970 
done simply let's just baseball add and
then<00:03:02.019> curve<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.130> then<00:03:03.940> path

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
then curve and then path

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.430 
then curve and then path
I<00:03:06.120> have<00:03:07.120> my<00:03:07.330> path<00:03:07.540> over<00:03:07.840> here<00:03:08.050> I'm<00:03:08.200> just<00:03:08.260> going

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
I have my path over here I'm just going

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:23.190 
I have my path over here I'm just going
to<00:03:08.590> rotate<00:03:08.830> it<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.400> little<00:03:09.700> bit<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:22.200> and

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
to rotate it a little bit this that and

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.880 
to rotate it a little bit this that and
that's<00:03:23.590> my<00:03:23.769> path<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:25.230> i'm<00:03:26.230> just<00:03:26.530> going<00:03:26.680> to

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
that's my path and i'm just going to

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.670 
that's my path and i'm just going to
it's<00:03:27.280> called<00:03:27.459> curve<00:03:27.849> okay<00:03:28.599> so<00:03:29.349> i'm<00:03:29.440> going<00:03:29.620> to

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
it's called curve okay so i'm going to

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.240 
it's called curve okay so i'm going to
go<00:03:29.739> back<00:03:29.860> here<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:32.079> my<00:03:32.200> chain<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.680> then<00:03:33.010> add

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
go back here to my chain and then add

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.250 
go back here to my chain and then add
another<00:03:33.280> modifier<00:03:34.090> let's<00:03:34.510> make<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:34.989> more

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
another modifier let's make this more

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.250 
another modifier let's make this more
modifier<00:03:36.159> and<00:03:36.400> then<00:03:37.360> I'm<00:03:37.599> going<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.840> add<00:03:37.900> I<00:03:40.260> can

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
modifier and then I'm going to add I can

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.160 
modifier and then I'm going to add I can
see<00:03:42.989> curve<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.879> then<00:03:45.879> object<00:03:46.329> I'm<00:03:46.930> going<00:03:47.109> to

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
see curve and then object I'm going to

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.130 
see curve and then object I'm going to
choose<00:03:47.349> curve<00:03:50.879> you<00:03:51.879> see<00:03:51.910> it's<00:03:52.329> deformed<00:03:52.900> but

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
choose curve you see it's deformed but

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.839 
choose curve you see it's deformed but
in<00:03:53.319> the<00:03:53.410> wrong<00:03:53.560> path<00:03:53.890> so<00:03:54.400> I'm<00:03:54.459> just<00:03:54.609> going<00:03:54.790> to

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
in the wrong path so I'm just going to

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.270 
in the wrong path so I'm just going to
choose<00:03:55.349> so<00:03:56.349> right<00:03:56.500> now<00:03:56.530> with<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:56.859> forms<00:03:57.129> on

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
choose so right now with the forms on

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.380 
choose so right now with the forms on
the<00:03:57.370> y-axis<00:03:57.519> which<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.299> right<00:03:58.420> one<00:04:00.269> but<00:04:01.269> it

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
the y-axis which is the right one but it

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.640 
the y-axis which is the right one but it
doesn't<00:04:01.629> look<00:04:01.690> right<00:04:01.930> so<00:04:02.349> I'm<00:04:02.440> going<00:04:02.500> to

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
doesn't look right so I'm going to

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.410 
doesn't look right so I'm going to
expand<00:04:04.230> here<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.829> join<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:06.819> options<00:04:07.329> under

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
expand here and join the options under

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.420 
expand here and join the options under
array<00:04:07.870> what<00:04:08.019> is<00:04:08.109> his<00:04:08.290> fixed<00:04:08.680> count<00:04:08.920> I'm<00:04:09.220> going

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
array what is his fixed count I'm going

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.009 
array what is his fixed count I'm going
to<00:04:09.630> fit<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.810> curve<00:04:11.049> length<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:13.450> then<00:04:13.630> put<00:04:13.870> the

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
to fit the curve length and then put the

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:43.939 
to fit the curve length and then put the
name<00:04:15.750> curve<00:04:24.599> now

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.669 

all<00:04:44.949> right<00:04:45.129> there<00:04:45.429> you<00:04:45.459> have<00:04:45.699> it<00:04:45.729> a<00:04:46.559> then<00:04:47.559> you

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:47.679 
all right there you have it a then you

00:04:47.679 --> 00:05:02.059 
all right there you have it a then you
can<00:04:48.509> expand<00:04:49.509> that<00:04:49.749> a<00:04:50.279> 4<00:04:51.279> X<00:04:51.399> 3<00:04:51.489> X<00:04:58.769> truth<00:04:59.769> a<00:05:00.449> truth

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:02.069 
can expand that a 4 X 3 X truth a truth

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:07.079 
can expand that a 4 X 3 X truth a truth
and<00:05:03.069> you<00:05:03.789> can<00:05:03.999> move<00:05:04.209> that<00:05:05.639> and<00:05:06.639> you'll<00:05:06.759> chain

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:07.089 
and you can move that and you'll chain

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:09.749 
and you can move that and you'll chain
will<00:05:07.269> deform<00:05:07.629> with<00:05:07.899> it<00:05:08.099> it's<00:05:09.099> just<00:05:09.399> you<00:05:09.580> gotta

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
will deform with it it's just you gotta

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:15.959 
will deform with it it's just you gotta
be<00:05:09.969> careful<00:05:11.039> how<00:05:12.039> it<00:05:12.189> looks<00:05:12.369> like<00:05:12.639> and<00:05:14.969> so

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:15.969 
be careful how it looks like and so

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:18.059 
be careful how it looks like and so
won't<00:05:16.209> have<00:05:16.360> any<00:05:16.539> bends<00:05:16.779> like<00:05:17.050> that<00:05:17.289> you<00:05:17.919> want

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:18.069 
won't have any bends like that you want

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:20.399 
won't have any bends like that you want
to<00:05:18.099> make<00:05:18.249> your<00:05:18.369> curve<00:05:18.669> into<00:05:19.389> the<00:05:19.539> knot<00:05:19.899> in<00:05:20.019> 3d

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:20.409 
to make your curve into the knot in 3d

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:22.799 
to make your curve into the knot in 3d
you<00:05:20.679> can<00:05:21.279> make<00:05:21.490> it<00:05:21.580> in<00:05:21.669> 3d<00:05:22.029> but<00:05:22.240> you<00:05:22.419> gotta<00:05:22.599> just

00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:22.809 
you can make it in 3d but you gotta just

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:26.669 
you can make it in 3d but you gotta just
have<00:05:23.499> to<00:05:23.649> adjust<00:05:23.769> it<00:05:24.189> in<00:05:24.309> a<00:05:24.369> better<00:05:24.519> view<00:05:25.679> that

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:26.679 
have to adjust it in a better view that

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:28.109 
have to adjust it in a better view that
will<00:05:26.829> give<00:05:27.009> you<00:05:27.069> a<00:05:27.099> better<00:05:27.219> results<00:05:27.759> but

00:05:28.109 --> 00:05:28.119 
will give you a better results but

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:31.379 
will give you a better results but
that's<00:05:28.329> mainly<00:05:28.479> how<00:05:28.749> to<00:05:28.809> make<00:05:29.019> a<00:05:29.050> chain
