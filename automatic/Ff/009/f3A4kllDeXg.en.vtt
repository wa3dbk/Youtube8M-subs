00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:12.110
 the fire is lucas valÃ©rio and the theme 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.110
 weird stuff 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.180
 today we will talk about a very 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.060
 crazy because nobody has any idea what 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.640
 serves more than once in a while or 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.859
 another one appears in the photos drawings in 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.410
 progress of facebook and 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.619
 other social networks and everyone stays 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.930
 in that doubt what is this for? 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.200
 this is ok 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.120
 so to clarify this doubt 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.120
 We'll talk about it today. 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.379
 this business here that looks more like a 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.239
 knitting needle to be the same as you 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.440
 You must be wondering those 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.559
 questions that always come to mind what 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.559
 is 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:10.880
 In fact, in fact, the scorer is nothing more. 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:14.600
 than an instrument that we artists 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.090
 we use when we are tired of 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:23.360
 draw are expendable and such 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:25.310
 we used it to knit and I think the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.290
 people just ran where they will not miss 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:37.119
 remained 21 Saturday forced the state do not know 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.119
 the scorer is known and famous for love 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.479
 but it 's not what the goalkeeper is known for 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:49.210
 for a few people and this is to know 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:52.630
 few people and is used to make 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.330
 textures for example bearded hair 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:01.759
 clothes what he does 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:04.369
 had a metal tip comes from several 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.470
 sizes is in case you do not have a 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.670
 scorer you can substitute for a 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:14.000
 crochet needle almost the same as the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.420
 that he does he kneads the role he has created 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.630
 a hole you can squeeze and drag 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.820
 finally do the things he's pro workout the 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.310
 our paper prevents graphite from losing 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.610
 there then that area that you used the power 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.560
 will not get gray will not get the 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.600
 Graphite will stay in panties 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.080
 This is what makes it possible to 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.940
 things in common 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.440
 the hair strands that everyone corner 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:44.070
 have a question about how to shave with a 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.740
 mesio can make texture of clothes 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.230
 jeans for example to make a punk 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.530
 paulo just make several wine circles 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.800
 so you can do a lot with the 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.800
 scorer 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.200
