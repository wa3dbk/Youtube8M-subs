that because doesn't matter how well we
think<00:00:27.119> we're<00:00:27.330> doing<00:00:27.449> if<00:00:27.660> we're<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:27.869> to

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
think we're doing if we're going to

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.810 
think we're doing if we're going to
concede<00:00:28.260> dolls<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> manner<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:29.670> did

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
concede dolls in the manner we did

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.250 
concede dolls in the manner we did
tonight<00:00:30.090> then<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:30.660> going<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.840> be<00:00:30.990> really

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
tonight then it's going to be really

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.100 
tonight then it's going to be really
tough<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:32.000> we<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.180> didn't<00:00:33.420> deal<00:00:33.570> well<00:00:33.809> at

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
tough and we just didn't deal well at

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.380

all was with them as an attacking force

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.630 
all was with them as an attacking force
and<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.960> could<00:00:37.680> say<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.309> terms<00:00:38.520> of

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
well that's all tonight as a team we

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.109 
well that's all tonight as a team we
didn't<00:01:25.380> look<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.710> solid<00:01:25.979> or<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.250> stronger<00:01:26.670> you

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
didn't look just solid or a stronger you

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.969 
didn't look just solid or a stronger you
know<00:01:27.240> both<00:01:27.479> ends<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.960> pitch<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.350> there

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
know both ends of the pitch and there

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.190 
know both ends of the pitch and there
has<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.340> concern<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.150> think<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.689> was

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
has to be a concern and I think it was

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.679 
has to be a concern and I think it was
relatively<00:01:31.560> easy<00:01:31.770> for<00:01:31.979> Middlesbrough

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
relatively easy for Middlesbrough

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.730 
relatively easy for Middlesbrough
particular<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> longer<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.140> game<00:01:34.170> when<00:01:34.530> we

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
particular the longer the game when we

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.140 
particular the longer the game when we
was<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.159> always<00:01:35.369> saved<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.820> know<00:01:35.939> if<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
was you always saved you know if the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.140 
was you always saved you know if the
game<00:01:36.299> carries<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:37.369> would<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.520> get<00:01:38.640> back<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:38.970> it

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
game carries on would we get back in it

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.700 
game carries on would we get back in it
the<00:01:39.299> answer's<00:01:39.570> no<00:01:39.600> tonight<00:01:40.110> wasn't<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.560> wasn't

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the answer's no tonight wasn't it wasn't

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.200 
the answer's no tonight wasn't it wasn't
good<00:01:40.920> enough<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.310> know<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> game<00:01:41.850> goes<00:01:42.030> of

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
good enough you know if the game goes of

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.700 
good enough you know if the game goes of
another<00:01:42.390> 10-15<00:01:43.020> minutes<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.320> could<00:01:43.439> let<00:01:43.530> me<00:01:43.590> see

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
another 10-15 minutes I could let me see

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.639
