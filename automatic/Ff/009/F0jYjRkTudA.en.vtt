 Hello guys 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.770
 Today we are going to make an empathy kitten. 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.140
 in the book read then I'll try first 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.769
 all my nails have already been based on 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.810
 all 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:38.590
 so I'll start in October 2000 home 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:40.750
 white while drying the white enamel 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.070
 with this second layer I'll go 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:58.260
 start passing the other lines and I know 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:58.260
 there is now the second layer of white 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.450
 and now another layer has inserted the 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.940
 in all a good one now we'll do the 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.940
 kitty shape 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:35.110
 I just picked it up in the corner and it pulls in the middle. 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:39.990
 will press the sky and pull to stay 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.990
 round my head I was going to see 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.640
 the effort let's retouch jack 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:11.720
 I'll start making the little face of 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:22.510
 kitten by nose with the glory both 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:22.510
 eyes and finally the tricky 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:59.040
 The two kittens are ready now. 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:03:02.400

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:09.390

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:11.940
