00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.230
 it was the denunciations you received relating to the works of the world cup 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.350
 and the olympics in brazil what are not happening 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.849
 is that there is no information 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:12.309
 cases of removal 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.959
 without any interference 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.900
 many passes and the peace dialogue 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.539
 citing no space for the community to present a project 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.949
 alternative that minimize the removals at last, this is perfect 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.489
 on the other hand there are also many violations in the case 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.680
 of compensation financial compensation and in frap apc 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.019
 is that compensation then with appreciation 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.680
 in which 3 thousand 5 thousand and 10 thousand were born I am now totally insufficient 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.980
 will the family be treated as adequate housing? 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.609
 live 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.440
 in which cities these irregular removals have taken place 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.210
 the city that we have received denunciations are about everything 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.440
 with rio de janeiro sÃ£o paulo beautiful lesson to the dci 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.130
 porto alegre on this 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.650
 you have no doubt that the big losers 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.070
 are the people being removed 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.890
 without adjusting for fair resettlement, it is not fair to be alone 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.040
 of dialogue and park 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.900
 these reports that are extremely serious she sends her image of the country there 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.720
 out 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.979
 these denunciations it is a constraint that the country 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.889
 infection in all of Brazil that is a country 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.979
 who has my testimony this is a stance before the council of rights 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:14.669
 humans 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:20.069
 very proactive rights advocacy campaign and 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.829
 I think that Brazil has finally decided to prove 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.719
 who respects these rights when making a mega event 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.109
 the newspaper of the ten get in touch with the sports ministry asking for a 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.759
 reply to the complaints made by the UN 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:40.249
 let's hear what the steering wheel said but prepare it does not exactly speak of 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:43.719
 expropriations, but rather of withdrawing from the 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:46.860
 from time to time I hear here and there 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.670
 some in the south of brazil intends to make social asepsis' to house people who 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.850
 live and in a street situation and do not have any of that we want to show the 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.080
 Real Brazil, the world.
