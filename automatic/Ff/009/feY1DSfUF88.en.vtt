contortion<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.990> breathing<00:01:07.680> actually<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.340> did

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
contortion is breathing actually I did

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.080 
contortion is breathing actually I did
not<00:01:09.210> realize<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.790> when<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.820> first

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
not realize this and when I first

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.940 
not realize this and when I first
started<00:01:12.299> out<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.689> never<00:01:12.930> ever<00:01:13.380> took<00:01:13.590> breathing

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
started out I never ever took breathing

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.230 
started out I never ever took breathing
seriously<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.670> would<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:16.970> just<00:01:17.970> stretch

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
seriously I would just like just stretch

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.940 
seriously I would just like just stretch
and<00:01:18.600> then<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.810> would<00:01:19.020> hold<00:01:19.200> my<00:01:19.320> breath<00:01:19.530> while<00:01:19.890> I

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
and then I would hold my breath while I

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.399 
and then I would hold my breath while I
was<00:01:20.159> stretching<00:01:20.600> that's<00:01:21.600> really<00:01:21.990> bad<00:01:22.170> like

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
was stretching that's really bad like

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.690 
was stretching that's really bad like
you<00:01:22.439> can't<00:01:22.799> even<00:01:22.950> reach<00:01:23.369> your<00:01:23.400> maximum

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you can't even reach your maximum

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.520 
you can't even reach your maximum
stretch<00:01:24.570> if<00:01:24.840> you're<00:01:24.960> holding<00:01:25.259> your<00:01:25.350> breath

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
stretch if you're holding your breath

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.219 
stretch if you're holding your breath
which<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:25.979> never<00:01:26.130> knew<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:27.210> having<00:01:28.080> like

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
which I have never knew so having like

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.830 
which I have never knew so having like
breathing<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.340> really<00:01:30.240> really<00:01:30.390> important<00:01:30.810> for

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
breathing is really really important for

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.270 
breathing is really really important for
stretching<00:01:31.350> cuz<00:01:31.470> you're<00:01:31.590> getting<00:01:31.799> oxygen

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
stretching cuz you're getting oxygen

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.920 
stretching cuz you're getting oxygen
around<00:01:32.400> your<00:01:32.729> blood<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.240> which<00:01:33.630> means<00:01:33.780> just

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
around your blood and which means just

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.450 
around your blood and which means just
going<00:01:34.200> into<00:01:34.380> your<00:01:34.579> muscles<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.640> lot<00:01:35.729> faster<00:01:36.240> and

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
going into your muscles a lot faster and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.710 
going into your muscles a lot faster and
cooling<00:01:38.460> down<00:01:38.640> cooling<00:01:39.119> down<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.479> really

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
cooling down cooling down is really

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.060 
cooling down cooling down is really
important<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.290> well<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.829> don't<00:01:41.009> just

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
important as well so you don't just

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.730 
important as well so you don't just
leave<00:01:41.280> your<00:01:41.340> muscles<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.000> stretch<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.259> sore

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
leave your muscles like stretch or sore

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.219 
leave your muscles like stretch or sore
and<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.360> gives<00:01:45.509> your<00:01:45.659> muscles<00:01:45.990> chance

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
and it just gives your muscles chance

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.440 
and it just gives your muscles chance
just<00:01:46.530> yeah<00:01:46.770> cool<00:01:47.100> down<00:01:47.280> that's<00:01:48.000> really<00:01:48.270> good

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
just yeah cool down that's really good

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.639 
just yeah cool down that's really good
so<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.720> could<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.110> just<00:01:49.350> light

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
so that could be like just light

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.520 
so that could be like just light
stretches<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.390> relaxing<00:01:51.960> yourself<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
stretches and just relaxing yourself and

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.920 
stretches and just relaxing yourself and
shaking<00:01:52.890> all<00:01:53.009> your<00:01:53.130> muscles<00:01:53.460> I've<00:01:53.579> basically

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
shaking all your muscles I've basically

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.469 
shaking all your muscles I've basically
um<00:01:54.930> another<00:01:55.259> question<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.710> got<00:01:55.860> was<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.540> is<00:01:57.540> um

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
um another question I got was and is um

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.969 
um another question I got was and is um
contortion<00:02:00.479> doing<00:02:00.960> contortion<00:02:01.439> more<00:02:01.590> likely

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
contortion doing contortion more likely

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.819 
contortion doing contortion more likely
to<00:02:02.250> give<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.399> arthritis<00:02:03.090> when<00:02:03.270> you're<00:02:03.390> older

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.080 
to give you arthritis when you're older
this<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.890> really<00:02:05.280> hard<00:02:05.460> question<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:05.909> me<00:02:06.060> to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
this is really hard question for me to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.380 
this is really hard question for me to
answer<00:02:06.299> because

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
answer because

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.760 
answer because
I<00:02:07.420> didn't<00:02:08.170> really<00:02:08.350> know<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.500> lot<00:02:08.620> about

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
I didn't really know a lot about

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.260 
I didn't really know a lot about
arthritis<00:02:09.670> but<00:02:10.570> why<00:02:10.690> would<00:02:10.930> say<00:02:11.140> is<00:02:12.270> people

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
arthritis but why would say is people

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.560 
arthritis but why would say is people
say<00:02:13.930> if<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.140> click<00:02:14.380> your<00:02:14.560> fingers<00:02:15.120> then<00:02:16.120> you

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
say if you click your fingers then you

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.540 
say if you click your fingers then you
are<00:02:17.020> more<00:02:17.350> prone<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.590> arthritis<00:02:18.220> because<00:02:18.340> it's

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
are more prone to arthritis because it's

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.610 
are more prone to arthritis because it's
really<00:02:18.700> bad<00:02:18.880> for<00:02:18.910> your<00:02:19.150> joints

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
really bad for your joints

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.430 
really bad for your joints
so<00:02:21.010> I'd<00:02:21.220> say<00:02:21.490> again<00:02:22.060> if<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:22.540> warm<00:02:22.810> up<00:02:22.960> and<00:02:23.200> you

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
so I'd say again if you warm up and you

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.620 
so I'd say again if you warm up and you
do<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.980> right<00:02:24.190> things<00:02:24.520> with<00:02:24.640> convulsion<00:02:25.420> and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
do the right things with convulsion and

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.030 
do the right things with convulsion and
it's<00:02:25.960> going<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.170> be<00:02:26.230> like<00:02:26.350> any<00:02:26.530> other<00:02:26.740> sports

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
it's going to be like any other sports

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.660 
it's going to be like any other sports
gonna<00:02:27.310> be<00:02:27.490> good<00:02:27.640> for<00:02:27.820> you<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:29.140> I'm<00:02:30.010> not<00:02:30.250> sure

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
gonna be good for you and I'm not sure

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.990 
gonna be good for you and I'm not sure
about<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.000> whole<00:02:31.030> apparatus<00:02:31.690> thing<00:02:32.200> really

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
about the whole apparatus thing really

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.510 
about the whole apparatus thing really
but<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.330> would<00:02:34.810> say<00:02:35.380> if<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.770> literally<00:02:36.250> air

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
but I would say if you literally air

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.290 
but I would say if you literally air
just<00:02:36.730> warm<00:02:36.940> up<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:38.520> down<00:02:39.520> and<00:02:39.820> breathe

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
just warm up and down and breathe

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.690 
just warm up and down and breathe
properly<00:02:40.540> then<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:41.440> will<00:02:41.590> be<00:02:41.740> healthy<00:02:42.340> for<00:02:42.580> you

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
properly then it will be healthy for you

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.360 
properly then it will be healthy for you
