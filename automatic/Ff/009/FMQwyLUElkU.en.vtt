unfortunately<00:00:19.470> when<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.740> have<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.950> roof<00:00:20.490> leak

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
unfortunately when you have a roof leak

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.240 
unfortunately when you have a roof leak
the<00:00:21.450> water<00:00:21.720> eventually<00:00:21.960> follows<00:00:22.740> gravity

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
the water eventually follows gravity

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.310 
the water eventually follows gravity
down<00:00:23.520> through<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.240> components<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.140> roof

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
down through the components of the roof

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.580 
down through the components of the roof
into<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.190> walls<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.850> it<00:00:27.510> will<00:00:27.720> find<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.289> floor

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
into the walls and it will find a floor

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.609 
into the walls and it will find a floor
to<00:00:28.980> land<00:00:29.220> on<00:00:29.460> somewhere<00:00:30.359> else<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.840> spill<00:00:31.410> out

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
to land on somewhere else to spill out

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.100 
to land on somewhere else to spill out
and<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.520> case<00:00:32.850> that's<00:00:33.480> what<00:00:33.660> happened

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
and in this case that's what happened

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.049 
and in this case that's what happened
here<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.949> sure<00:00:35.160> enough<00:00:35.430> we're<00:00:35.670> outside<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
here and sure enough we're outside the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.759 
here and sure enough we're outside the
master<00:00:36.480> bathroom<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.050> house<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
master bathroom of this house and the

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.460 
master bathroom of this house and the
water<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.190> started<00:00:39.150> with<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.629> defective<00:00:40.230> roof

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
water that started with a defective roof

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.950 
water that started with a defective roof
and<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.250> leak<00:00:41.460> from<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.850> roof<00:00:42.120> ended<00:00:42.809> up

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
and the leak from that roof ended up

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.560 
and the leak from that roof ended up
coming<00:00:43.379> down<00:00:43.559> into<00:00:44.370> these<00:00:44.519> walls<00:00:44.909> and<00:00:45.300> as

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
coming down into these walls and as

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.189 
coming down into these walls and as
we'll<00:00:45.720> soon<00:00:45.930> see

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
we'll soon see

as you can see where I'm pointing now
about<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.670> window<00:00:57.060> there<00:00:57.570> was<00:00:57.810> a<00:00:58.110> slight

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
about the window there was a slight

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.820 
about the window there was a slight
drift<00:00:59.610> that<00:00:59.940> appeared<00:01:00.450> at<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.140> top<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.710> this

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830

window
eventually<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.840> drip<00:01:04.320> showed<00:01:04.800> itself<00:01:05.160> on

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
eventually that drip showed itself on

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.690 
eventually that drip showed itself on
the<00:01:05.730> sill<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.690> window<00:01:07.110> down<00:01:07.560> below<00:01:08.010> as
