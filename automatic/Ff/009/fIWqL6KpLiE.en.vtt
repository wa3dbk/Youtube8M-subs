00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:06.890
 so day 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.040
 It's definitely Monday 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.449
 and I have yesterday on sunday the am 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.570
 saturday i still have saturday i have 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.800
 yes still wins yesterday on sunday not 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.029
 more there but still the film on it 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.619
 and nothing has changed 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.180
 As you can see , I am under you now 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.789
 I did not like it 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.260
 a very simple reason it did not work 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.320
 and since as easy as shit down 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.660
 I have done it yesterday on Sunday 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.890
 I've been on the wiesn again 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.410
 the film ex left because I 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.960
 had no stomach on the wiesn with the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.190
 to run open chat room have 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.129
 or in the afternoon in the evening when I'm at home 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.840
 I went to shower and then have 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.590
 tries to make the film off and to 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.360
 watch how it works 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.239
 and it was really shitty 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.270
 down and it has really hurt already 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.280
 I have to say surely that is 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.600
 not filmed so I have it first 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.909
 pulled but maybe nothing can 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.229
 Movies pushed so but it did not work 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.520
 So I really started then 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.880
 under the shower had a lot of water 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.920
 then a skin oil you gay from berlin 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.170
 That's it, that's what I did 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.650
 because hopefully i thought the glue 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.689
 better solves but it did not go that way 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.659
 simply it was really one 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.549
 I stood under the shower for fifteen minutes 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.840
 piece by piece these films under 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.170
 pulled it really hurts shit 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.840
 just done hiring here back where 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.810
 even the skin with me was me and 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.640
 everything is so soft and sporty 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.070
 gives in and is so sensitive it has 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.200
 really shit hurt but I have it 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.850
 Done where you got down there I got it 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.630
 washed carefully and then have 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.460
 let it dry up and then I have one 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.490
 Let's get it running again 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.960
 times med and and healing salve and today have 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.229
 I is nothing on it yet made the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.149
 now 11 o'clock the church bells go there 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.530
 is 11 o'clock one says nothing running yet 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.530
 that's what it looks like now 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.090
 So as you can see it starts now 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.030
 to shed the skin solves this so 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.319
 it's not as expected 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.840
 that I have in the time under the 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.459
 foil dissolves the skin and another idea 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.380
 was also that when the skin 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.819
 almost triggers the film easier going off 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.959
 i have no idea maybe this is 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.099
 slide even two days longer 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.989
 have to let it go 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.670
 I do not know for sure I have it 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.900
 annoyed we looked curious 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.610
 everything was dry 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.170
 but as I said that was really shit 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.750
 I have to deduct the film completely honestly 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.549
 say 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.380
 it just feels like when you're in 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.480
 peel off plaster it would have to stick 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.519
 knows the last plaster as you pull 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.170
 also prefer displays quickly so hurts 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.799
 what I as a person do this 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.819
 of course, can not do is a 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:01.650
 So, somehow, this is trying 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.250
 to catch up on film and yes I do not know 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.810
 I am still here 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.390
 I 'm torn that up 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.459
 on the one hand has been with me 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.200
 this place ignited because stop the 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.370
 stress because the film developed on 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.320
 It was tension that I have now 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.940
 Great stroke because the film glued on 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.650
 because I'm probably my poor 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:25.140
 somehow stupid twisted had the slides 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.940
 stick on it and that's why it was 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.010
 pull off that was really shit that was 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.720
 really caustic to deduct it i thought 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.730
 between me that's a foil 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.989
 it because it was really hurt and I 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.410
 I'm really not sensitive so my 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.790
 man had to laugh at me first because I was 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.630
 just so pitying in the shower and 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.120
 but was meant by what he does 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.500
 really like that because I'm not 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.359
 insulted and it knows that I do not 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.910
 I am sad with pain and 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.609
 tattoos and blah but I really have 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.920
 I do not like that so much 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:04:00.299
 it went off easily sometimes that's really 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.310
 Shit like that , that's why I do not know 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.200
 if I think the film is great or 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.389
 not i have no idea one hand 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.769
 which is so relaxed because I do not 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.329
 I did not have to apply creaming 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.720
 I was able to wear what I could 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.579
 wanted 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.020
 there is no one anywhere 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.180
 Classroom lubricated if 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.320
 So it's a clemens then it's everywhere 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.510
 the schlaatz off 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.340
 that was extremely cool and the days were 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.070
 I have to be extremely relaxed 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.680
 say it was super relaxed 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.680
 but this was really shit and pull off 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.440
 that this aspect has so I think 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.060
 if it is a place that is not drum 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.040
 walking around who do not so much as for example 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.040
 is moving if it's just up here because 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.560
 Although it is not like me 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.670
 so completely twisted as here in the 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.530
 Do not believe it when it stings 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.450
 it's october when it's engraved 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.950
 is ready stung it's okay if 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.060
 the film is on it but me 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.420
 have no bock that here again 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.220
 so much foil on it is a page 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.850
 are awesome and I will be once 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.320
 try 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.030
 on the other hand, maybe the oldschool 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.740
 the variant with just open 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.660
 let and cream but the best me 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.120
 have no idea I think so a slide 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.620
 is cool on the gaps for example because 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.900
 then you can move back anyway 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.430
 somehow a glue and with loud and 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.850
 so be careful not if you 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.620
 always has his back covered I think 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.650
 me then so flat just this 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.490
 foil on it is pretty cool 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.760
 probably always remove 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.980
 shit like but good i am my reason 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.130
 It's a quarter of an hour or ten minutes 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.150
 pull off and torture or five minutes 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.620
 no idea maybe i have them 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.480
 maybe only five 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.180
 Torment minutes but for five days 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.470
 Relaxed with new tattoo is worth it 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.390
 Maybe I do not know 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.830
 I think I 'll be there then 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.240
 is also finished again 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.320
 let this slide on it and then 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.180
 Maybe I can give you something again 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.480
 say yes right now you can see it too 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.700
 the motive and the whole arm will be yes 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.570
 now he is as black gray as contrast to 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.670
 the colorful arm 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:57.000
 that means I want one more 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.169
 pattern bit more accustomed to the 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.600
 Dealer fits there a connection 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:04.500
 that is now also the pattern 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:08.520
 background from nick cave and but it 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:11.910
 is just very black he like 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.540
 You can see exactly that is the plan of 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.640
 my office 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.080
 I am pleased and transition out he must 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.640
 So it's the end of it 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.249
 already quite finished but here had 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.079
 leave 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:23.799
 still the lines are gray and then 

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:27.639
 one is ready to stab and then already 

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:28.619
 what happens next I hope that we 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.169
 thus fallen 

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:34.599
 Do you have a great slide? 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:35.919
 had on it and experience with it does it 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:37.269
 shit on you as well as pulling off 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:46.449
 or not, or I'm just 

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:47.649
 offended let me know and me 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:49.299
 thank you very much for always 

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:51.869
 attention and until the next 

00:06:49.299 --> 00:06:51.869
 Video
