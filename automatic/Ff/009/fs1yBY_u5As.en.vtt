there<00:04:36.780> right<00:04:36.990> off<00:04:37.139> right<00:04:37.530> off<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.860> lift<00:04:38.750> I

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
there right off right off the lift I

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.990 
there right off right off the lift I
think<00:04:39.990> if<00:04:40.110> you<00:04:40.260> could<00:04:40.500> actually<00:04:40.860> move<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.850> the

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
think if you could actually move to the

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.590 
think if you could actually move to the
corner<00:04:42.450> and<00:04:42.630> trip<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:43.979> actually<00:04:44.850> trap<00:04:45.389> the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
corner and trip and actually trap the

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.930 
corner and trip and actually trap the
ankle<00:04:46.050> as<00:04:46.200> they<00:04:46.500> fall<00:04:46.860> when<00:04:47.430> you<00:04:47.550> have<00:04:47.760> the

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
ankle as they fall when you have the

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.550 
ankle as they fall when you have the
wrist<00:04:48.180> puts<00:04:48.479> you<00:04:48.600> in<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.750> nice<00:04:48.930> position<00:04:49.110> foot

for

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.750 
for
well<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.170> kill<00:05:48.350> we<00:05:48.500> haven't<00:05:48.800> seen<00:05:48.950> much<00:05:49.250> from

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
well the kill we haven't seen much from

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.270 
well the kill we haven't seen much from
Jesse<00:05:50.480> except<00:05:50.990> for<00:05:51.260> his<00:05:51.500> move<00:05:51.740> was<00:05:51.920> his

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
Jesse except for his move was his

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.700 
Jesse except for his move was his
takedown<00:05:52.550> was<00:05:52.730> a<00:05:52.880> defensive<00:05:53.450> one<00:05:53.630> and<00:05:53.900> I<00:05:54.380> think

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
takedown was a defensive one and I think

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.790 
takedown was a defensive one and I think
that<00:05:55.630> leave<00:05:56.630> I<00:05:56.750> will<00:05:56.960> look<00:05:57.080> for<00:05:57.260> a<00:05:57.320> duck<00:05:57.470> under

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
that leave I will look for a duck under

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.890 
that leave I will look for a duck under
