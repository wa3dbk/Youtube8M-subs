00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:03.640
 so that Loew now the little Asus 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.680
 I could have it for video in two parts 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.859
 what would be like 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.640
 once the outer and think good process at minus 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.339
 and later again 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.349
 Several shots from the screen can give our tribe impression 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:20.909
 from the outside world 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:25.879
 white device at the European Championship he puts Ronny Markus or Pablo way GrÃ¤nichen have 

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:27.419
 Solon sage cabbage 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:28.960
 I am not bad 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.789
 of the dimensions 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.789
 but that seems a bit bigger Arnold 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.730
 I have the man from you connected everything about the video presentation 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.220
 works easier 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.030
 believe in it 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.720
 Make Schalding easy 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.410
 I liked the preinstalled Linux so much and that's why I am 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.090
 right on it 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.400
 around 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.400
 Dariusz like XP too install 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.590
 do you have my misgivings that now everything is going to union 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.800
 but in the end it has been a big problem at the moment 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.950
 a problem, however, was simply to have the installation of the Windows 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.560
 Also the whole picture was gone that was very bad 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.210
 there was Dr 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.510
 available memory occupied very quickly 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.960
 that means I could repeat everything again the complete installation 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.440
 and so have 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.620
 well talk about memory can be available 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.710
 Century between offer and 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.180
 seen that way 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.740
 around 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.450
 Wollitz anti-virus software I have now installed on the we 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.140
 that delay of course Horber again 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.140
 in principle no problem so realize that the fast high 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.630
 that fits already 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.610
 then I have my windows here 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.090
 in the second part 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.360
 then a little bit more about what is installed Euro and how much space is 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.010
 Space is still sparse 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.220
 I'll show you the same
