well<00:00:02.650> when<00:00:03.040> I<00:00:03.070> was<00:00:03.190> a<00:00:03.250> kid<00:00:03.310> and<00:00:03.730> we<00:00:04.060> bail<00:00:04.270> straw

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:04.600 
well when I was a kid and we bail straw

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.269 
well when I was a kid and we bail straw
sometimes<00:00:05.140> you<00:00:05.260> get<00:00:05.350> a<00:00:05.410> fail<00:00:05.859> that<00:00:06.009> was<00:00:06.130> broken

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:06.279 
sometimes you get a fail that was broken

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:07.740 
sometimes you get a fail that was broken
open<00:00:06.520> so<00:00:06.790> we<00:00:06.880> throw<00:00:07.060> it<00:00:07.120> up<00:00:07.180> against<00:00:07.420> the<00:00:07.480> barn

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:07.750 
open so we throw it up against the barn

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.810 
open so we throw it up against the barn
and<00:00:08.290> about<00:00:08.530> six<00:00:08.889> months<00:00:09.010> or<00:00:09.250> a<00:00:09.280> year<00:00:09.340> later<00:00:09.639> as

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
and about six months or a year later as

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.879 
and about six months or a year later as
it<00:00:09.940> started<00:00:10.240> he<00:00:10.389> composed<00:00:10.780> great<00:00:11.410> big<00:00:11.650> weeds

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:11.889 
it started he composed great big weeds

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.009 
it started he composed great big weeds
would<00:00:12.130> grow<00:00:12.309> a<00:00:12.370> lot<00:00:12.490> of<00:00:12.639> those<00:00:12.700> bales<00:00:13.030> and<00:00:13.630> so<00:00:13.990> I

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
would grow a lot of those bales and so I

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.240 
would grow a lot of those bales and so I
always<00:00:14.230> remember<00:00:14.710> how<00:00:14.830> that<00:00:14.860> would<00:00:15.130> happen

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
always remember how that would happen

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.920 
always remember how that would happen
around<00:00:15.519> as<00:00:15.700> a<00:00:15.759> kid<00:00:15.790> years<00:00:16.420> later<00:00:16.630> when<00:00:16.779> I

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930 
around as a kid years later when I

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.089 
around as a kid years later when I
bought<00:00:17.110> a<00:00:17.170> house<00:00:17.410> and<00:00:17.439> I<00:00:17.770> didn't<00:00:17.980> have<00:00:18.009> very

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
bought a house and I didn't have very

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.729 
bought a house and I didn't have very
good<00:00:18.310> soil<00:00:18.669> didn't<00:00:19.630> have<00:00:19.720> hardly<00:00:20.020> any<00:00:20.230> topsoil

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:20.739 
good soil didn't have hardly any topsoil

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.130 
good soil didn't have hardly any topsoil
at<00:00:20.890> all<00:00:21.040> I<00:00:21.310> decided<00:00:21.910> to<00:00:22.060> try<00:00:22.360> using<00:00:22.779> those

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
at all I decided to try using those

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.170 
at all I decided to try using those
bales<00:00:23.500> as<00:00:23.890> a<00:00:23.950> substrate<00:00:24.730> for<00:00:25.029> growing

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
bales as a substrate for growing

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.519 
bales as a substrate for growing
vegetables<00:00:25.450> I<00:00:25.930> did<00:00:26.110> a<00:00:26.140> whole<00:00:26.230> bunch<00:00:26.410> of

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
vegetables I did a whole bunch of

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.200 
vegetables I did a whole bunch of
experiments<00:00:27.189> and<00:00:27.279> as<00:00:27.399> it<00:00:27.550> turns<00:00:27.730> out<00:00:27.880> it<00:00:28.059> works

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
experiments and as it turns out it works

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.569 
experiments and as it turns out it works
really<00:00:28.419> really<00:00:28.570> well<00:00:28.779> but<00:00:29.680> he<00:00:29.770> live<00:00:30.009> on<00:00:30.279> the

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
really really well but he live on the

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.120 
really really well but he live on the
outskirts<00:00:30.610> of<00:00:31.210> town<00:00:31.450> where<00:00:31.989> we<00:00:32.710> have<00:00:32.860> a<00:00:32.890> lot<00:00:33.100> of

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
outskirts of town where we have a lot of

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.880 
outskirts of town where we have a lot of
deer<00:00:33.399> and<00:00:33.579> rabbit<00:00:33.850> problems<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.530> I<00:00:35.649> thought

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
deer and rabbit problems and I thought

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.910 
deer and rabbit problems and I thought
this<00:00:36.070> would<00:00:36.219> be<00:00:36.280> a<00:00:36.460> good<00:00:37.269> idea<00:00:37.390> to<00:00:37.660> drive<00:00:37.960> my

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
this would be a good idea to drive my

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.459 
this would be a good idea to drive my
husband<00:00:39.250> just<00:00:39.399> built<00:00:39.699> up<00:00:39.940> little<00:00:40.300> gazebo<00:00:40.600> for

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
husband just built up little gazebo for

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.439 
husband just built up little gazebo for
a<00:00:41.500> raised<00:00:41.800> garden<00:00:42.070> and<00:00:42.760> so<00:00:43.120> we'll<00:00:43.269> be<00:00:43.420> doing

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
a raised garden and so we'll be doing

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.869 
a raised garden and so we'll be doing
that<00:00:43.870> and<00:00:44.199> possibly<00:00:44.949> doing<00:00:45.280> so<00:00:45.460> strong<00:00:45.670> yellow

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
that and possibly doing so strong yellow

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.979 
that and possibly doing so strong yellow
star<00:00:46.749> you<00:00:46.899> have<00:00:47.289> no<00:00:47.859> hand<00:00:48.280> garden<00:00:48.910> in<00:00:49.480> our<00:00:49.660> yard

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
star you have no hand garden in our yard

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.169 
star you have no hand garden in our yard
because<00:00:50.260> of<00:00:50.559> so<00:00:50.710> many<00:00:50.890> underground<00:00:51.460> utilities

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179 
because of so many underground utilities

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.439 
because of so many underground utilities
and<00:00:52.510> this<00:00:52.629> seemed<00:00:52.839> like<00:00:52.870> a<00:00:53.109> great<00:00:53.980> way<00:00:54.280> to<00:00:54.449> get

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
and this seemed like a great way to get

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.439 
and this seemed like a great way to get
back<00:00:55.659> into<00:00:55.929> vegetable<00:00:56.769> gardening<00:00:57.519> so<00:00:58.300> you've

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
back into vegetable gardening so you've

00:00:58.449 --> 00:00:59.880 
back into vegetable gardening so you've
never<00:00:58.570> done<00:00:58.780> this<00:00:58.899> before<00:00:59.019> them<00:00:59.320> no<00:00:59.530> I<00:00:59.559> haven't

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
never done this before them no I haven't

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.559 
never done this before them no I haven't
thought<00:01:00.219> that<00:01:00.399> that<00:01:00.579> garden<00:01:01.059> a<00:01:01.149> lot<00:01:01.359> but

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:01.569 
thought that that garden a lot but

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.350 
thought that that garden a lot but
office<00:01:02.050> I've<00:01:02.559> had<00:01:02.649> a<00:01:02.710> really<00:01:03.010> small<00:01:03.550> city<00:01:03.999> lot

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
office I've had a really small city lot

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.039 
office I've had a really small city lot
and<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:06.460> wanted<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:06.909> plant<00:01:07.450> more<00:01:07.630> than<00:01:07.840> just

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
and I wanted to plant more than just

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.960

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
tomato I wanted to maybe try

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.910 
tomato I wanted to maybe try
