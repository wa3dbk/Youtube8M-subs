00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.140
 and how was the first draw for SC Freiburg this season as well 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.140
 can they live with the one point we can live well 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.000
 yes I think 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 the Leverkusen with the 2 2 a visibly good life 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.599
 that annoys me personally a bit more for the second witness yet 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.849
 got 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.249
 around he has won over 2 1 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.820
 but good effect 7 2 2 percent I have slept 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.570
 Sir speaks less performance that without claims the press woman meanwhile 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.109
 also has 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.189
 but there was only change in the central defense so right in front of them 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.079
 Oliver Barth could not come with it so was Johannes beat this time 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.510
 in central defense how difficult it is for her as a young goalkeeper again 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.510
 to adjust something like that 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.690
 now he has not won any more the roles in front of me has that really good 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.260
 made 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.150
 I could fully rely on him 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.610
 and that is actually always pretty smooth and 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.950
 risen 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.570
 how important is a sense of SC Freiburg's knowledge that you too 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.710
 without Papiss CissÃ© can play successfully 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.260
 very well 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.470
 Interior ministers in the game were already sitting 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.570
 Action shot many goals 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.020
 now it is clear that he is not 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.170
 Throughout the season play the latter filmed unhappiness us percent 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.480
 compensate the Struth 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.550
 and Hans Taucher managed to score two goals without him 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.409
 for the crew 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.359
 that has the SC Freiburg the 28 points in the account great success 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:23.429
 Interim result after the half-series anyway talking silly is the question 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.079
 Of course, from the class whereabouts that at least the official 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.109
 Speech control how difficult it is actually to stack permanently deep 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.640
 Appelt and actually no longer wanted 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.420
 it's nice if we have one 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.909
 can collect as many points as early as possible and in the end 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.130
 said Schaaf the renounce especially in the second half nor as much as 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.890
 possible 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.609
 so can collect the points 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:49.249
 and up to plus all the prettier if he plays as secured as possible Rischon 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:50.880
 we have to be much more relaxed 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.890
 yes you are 20 years young 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.790
 Today you have forgiven the Bundesliga match they are in 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.490
 come into the team this season because the actual goalkeeper 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.620
 Simon Pouplin has injured now he will go back next year 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.619
 They assume that they will continue to be smoking number one back round 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.849
 I can not say that 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.499
 Simon is promoting his build training 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.169
 Try to get fit again, there should still be a place 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:20.469
 meanwhile, getting down and fit will work out so well 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.469
 the tears I try to bring my performance 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.849
 Bonn - so that she does not decide the coach lies in his hand that he 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.729
 this role she was able to survive so early in the week competitor Simon Kopp 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:32.130
 accordingly many thanks for the conversation and love 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.540
 because good on the weather conditions are all unique 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.650
 whine that they will soon get out and so before Christmas and 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.640
 A good rest at this time thanks for the conversation
