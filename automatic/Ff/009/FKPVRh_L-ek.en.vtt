going to ignore lighting all the flames

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:21.120 
going to ignore lighting all the flames

spinning<00:00:24.490> fire<00:00:24.820> at<00:00:25.029> us

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
spinning fire at us

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.900

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.450 

doesn't<00:01:31.440> matter<00:01:31.560> how<00:01:31.710> many<00:01:31.740> times<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.220> kill<00:01:32.430> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
it wasn't as complicated as I made it

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.570 
it wasn't as complicated as I made it
out<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.030> be<00:03:57.210> I<00:03:57.680> just<00:03:58.680> assumed<00:03:59.040> that<00:03:59.160> we<00:03:59.400> might

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
out to be I just assumed that we might

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.809 
out to be I just assumed that we might
it<00:03:59.820> might<00:04:00.000> be<00:04:00.180> important<00:04:00.690> than<00:04:00.900> such

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.089 

an<00:04:04.120> IRA<00:04:04.569> got<00:04:04.749> the<00:04:04.840> big<00:04:05.019> chest<00:04:05.349> so<00:04:05.590> that's<00:04:05.829> out

an IRA got the big chest so that's out

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.429 
an IRA got the big chest so that's out
of<00:04:06.159> the<00:04:06.370> way<00:04:06.400> too<00:04:06.689> unless<00:04:07.689> there's<00:04:07.989> two<00:04:08.230> big

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:08.439 
of the way too unless there's two big

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.070 
of the way too unless there's two big
chests<00:04:08.980> which<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:09.459> hope<00:04:09.670> there<00:04:09.939> isn't

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
chests which I hope there isn't

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:42.360 
chests which I hope there isn't
another<00:04:12.890> recording

huh<00:04:42.970> it<00:04:43.930> says<00:04:44.139> if<00:04:44.290> you<00:04:44.410> walk<00:04:44.650> through<00:04:44.949> the<00:04:45.430> fake

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
huh it says if you walk through the fake

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.950
