00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.450 
netting so what this video is gonna be
about<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:07.310> rubberize<00:01:08.310> coat<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:09.320> net<00:01:10.460> so

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
about is can we rubberize coat a net so

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.789 
about is can we rubberize coat a net so
this<00:01:11.790> net<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:12.330> has<00:01:12.510> rubberized<00:01:13.170> coating<00:01:13.470> on

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
this net here has rubberized coating on

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.620 
this net here has rubberized coating on
it<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.909> seems<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:16.820> just<00:01:17.820> looking<00:01:18.180> at<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.509> it

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
it but it seems to just looking at it it

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.429 
it but it seems to just looking at it it
seems<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:20.060> yeah<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.270> definitely<00:01:21.450> has<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
seems to have yeah it definitely has a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.999 
seems to have yeah it definitely has a
fabric<00:01:23.250> underneath<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.350> just

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
fabric underneath so it's not just

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.480 
fabric underneath so it's not just
strictly<00:01:26.340> rubber<00:01:27.049> so<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.080> wondered<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:29.250> order

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
strictly rubber so I wondered in order

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.670 
strictly rubber so I wondered in order
to<00:01:29.579> prevent<00:01:29.939> hooks<00:01:30.450> from<00:01:30.750> really<00:01:31.079> sinking

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
to prevent hooks from really sinking

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.789 
to prevent hooks from really sinking
into<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.070> net<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.490> creating<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.970> mess<00:01:33.619> could<00:01:34.619> I

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
into the net and creating a mess could I

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.590 
into the net and creating a mess could I
take<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.430> net<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.229> rubberized<00:01:37.229> coated<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
take this net and rubberized coated and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.210 
take this net and rubberized coated and
I<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> couple<00:01:40.320> different<00:01:40.439> products<00:01:41.100> that

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
I have a couple different products that

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.730 
I have a couple different products that
I<00:01:41.610> think<00:01:41.909> I'm<00:01:42.060> going<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> test<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.500> piece

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
I think I'm going to test on this piece

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.230 
I think I'm going to test on this piece
of<00:01:43.920> fabric<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.729> piece<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.060> fabric

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
of fabric because this piece of fabric

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.710 
of fabric because this piece of fabric
was<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.869> lot<00:01:46.320> less<00:01:46.729> expensive<00:01:47.729> than<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.390> net

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
was a lot less expensive than this net

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.990 
was a lot less expensive than this net
this<00:01:49.470> net<00:01:49.530> year<00:01:49.950> wasn't<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.340> badly<00:01:50.610> price

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
this net year wasn't that badly price

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.319 
this net year wasn't that badly price
the<00:01:51.689> reason<00:01:51.960> why<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.079> like<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.619> net<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.329> you

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the reason why I like this net is you

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.109 
the reason why I like this net is you
know<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.600> love<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.259> net<00:01:55.560> here<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.729> has<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> nice

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119

know I love this net here it has a nice
deep<00:01:57.180> dish<00:01:58.610> it's<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.969> would<00:02:00.060> hold<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.450> lot<00:02:00.659> of

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
deep dish it's it would hold a lot of

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.980 
deep dish it's it would hold a lot of
different<00:02:01.140> fish<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:02.100> I'm<00:02:02.219> going<00:02:02.460> after<00:02:02.990> but

clearance section of the fabric store
and<00:03:08.900> so<00:03:09.620> I'm<00:03:10.069> gonna<00:03:10.310> do<00:03:10.579> some<00:03:10.909> tests<00:03:11.269> on<00:03:11.359> this

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
and so I'm gonna do some tests on this

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.800 
and so I'm gonna do some tests on this
with<00:03:13.000> some<00:03:14.000> rubberized<00:03:14.629> coating<00:03:14.989> products

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
with some rubberized coating products

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.569 
with some rubberized coating products
you<00:03:17.810> also<00:03:18.079> commonly<00:03:18.500> see<00:03:18.829> me<00:03:19.040> use<00:03:20.560> bondo

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
you also commonly see me use bondo

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.059 
you also commonly see me use bondo
heavy-duty<00:03:22.579> rubberized<00:03:23.120> undercoating<00:03:23.269> for

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
heavy-duty rubberized undercoating for

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.759 
heavy-duty rubberized undercoating for
PVC<00:03:25.069> type<00:03:25.609> products<00:03:26.349> now<00:03:27.729> the<00:03:28.729> only<00:03:28.970> thing<00:03:29.329> is

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
PVC type products now the only thing is

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.349 
PVC type products now the only thing is
this<00:03:30.769> heavy-duty<00:03:31.129> bondo<00:03:31.909> rubberized

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
this heavy-duty bondo rubberized

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.800 
this heavy-duty bondo rubberized
undercoating<00:03:32.680> sprays<00:03:33.680> thick<00:03:34.129> and<00:03:34.780> when<00:03:35.780> I

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
undercoating sprays thick and when I

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.379 
undercoating sprays thick and when I
look<00:03:36.079> at<00:03:36.229> the<00:03:36.349> fabric<00:03:36.919> and<00:03:37.189> the<00:03:38.120> coating

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
look at the fabric and the coating

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.860 
look at the fabric and the coating
that's<00:03:38.659> on<00:03:38.870> this<00:03:39.560> net<00:03:39.919> here<00:03:40.370> it<00:03:41.299> seems<00:03:41.689> like

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
that's on this net here it seems like

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.979 
that's on this net here it seems like
it's<00:03:42.049> a<00:03:42.139> thinner<00:03:42.439> rubberized<00:03:43.009> coating<00:03:43.400> and

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
it's a thinner rubberized coating and

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.379 
it's a thinner rubberized coating and
just<00:03:44.989> knowing<00:03:45.229> how<00:03:46.220> this<00:03:46.459> stuff<00:03:46.759> sprays<00:03:47.150> I

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
just knowing how this stuff sprays I

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:48.789 
just knowing how this stuff sprays I
don't<00:03:47.569> think<00:03:47.810> bondo<00:03:48.319> rubberized

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
don't think bondo rubberized

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.289 
don't think bondo rubberized
undercoating<00:03:48.919> is<00:03:49.519> going<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:49.909> be<00:03:50.060> what<00:03:50.209> I'm

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
undercoating is going to be what I'm

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.699 
undercoating is going to be what I'm
going<00:03:50.419> to<00:03:50.479> use<00:03:50.689> for<00:03:50.720> this<00:03:50.989> particular<00:03:51.139> project

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
going to use for this particular project

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.149 
going to use for this particular project
I<00:03:52.389> usually<00:03:53.389> hate<00:03:53.599> flex<00:03:54.079> seal<00:03:54.349> because<00:03:55.009> it

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 
I usually hate flex seal because it

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.050 
I usually hate flex seal because it
sprays<00:03:55.579> so<00:03:56.000> thin<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.049> it's<00:03:57.199> really<00:03:57.530> watery

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
sprays so thin and it's really watery

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.240 
sprays so thin and it's really watery
but<00:03:59.060> I<00:03:59.090> think<00:03:59.449> that's<00:03:59.659> going<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.079> actually

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
but I think that's going to actually

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.069 
but I think that's going to actually
perform<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.519> best<00:04:01.729> for<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.209> fabric<00:04:02.780> it'll

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
perform the best for the fabric it'll

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.219 
perform the best for the fabric it'll
soak<00:04:03.349> into<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.769> fabric<00:04:04.220> and<00:04:04.780> absorb<00:04:05.780> into<00:04:05.989> it

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:06.229 
soak into the fabric and absorb into it

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:08.319 
soak into the fabric and absorb into it
really<00:04:06.409> well<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:06.979> we're<00:04:07.639> going<00:04:07.759> to<00:04:07.819> do<00:04:07.939> tests

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
really well so we're going to do tests

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.909 
really well so we're going to do tests
with<00:04:08.449> this<00:04:08.659> and<00:04:08.959> I<00:04:09.169> will<00:04:09.349> let<00:04:09.439> you<00:04:09.590> know<00:04:09.620> how<00:04:09.799> it

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
with this and I will let you know how it

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:14.409 
with this and I will let you know how it
turns<00:04:10.129> out<00:04:10.370> here<00:04:12.280> okay<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:13.340> there<00:04:13.790> is<00:04:14.060> our

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:14.419 
turns out here okay so there is our

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.949 
turns out here okay so there is our
netting<00:04:15.169> fabric<00:04:15.769> that<00:04:16.489> we<00:04:17.029> bought<00:04:17.299> at<00:04:17.539> Joanns

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
netting fabric that we bought at Joanns

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.440 
netting fabric that we bought at Joanns
fabric<00:04:18.769> and<00:04:18.979> we<00:04:19.459> sprayed<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:19.909> with<00:04:20.060> flex<00:04:20.450> seal

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
fabric and we sprayed it with flex seal

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.500 
fabric and we sprayed it with flex seal
to<00:04:21.600> do<00:04:21.720> a<00:04:21.780> test<00:04:22.140> to<00:04:22.320> see<00:04:22.650> if<00:04:22.950> it<00:04:23.190> would<00:04:23.370> coat<00:04:23.760> the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
to do a test to see if it would coat the

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.480 
to do a test to see if it would coat the
netting<00:04:24.900> material<00:04:25.020> just<00:04:25.830> like<00:04:26.190> the

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
netting material just like the

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.600 
netting material just like the
rubberized<00:04:26.940> nets<00:04:27.360> that<00:04:27.540> you<00:04:27.660> can<00:04:27.810> buy

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
rubberized nets that you can buy

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.740 
rubberized nets that you can buy
so<00:04:29.610> now<00:04:30.380> after<00:04:31.380> we<00:04:31.500> determine<00:04:32.040> that<00:04:32.090> this<00:04:33.090> does

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
so now after we determine that this does

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.440 
so now after we determine that this does
indeed<00:04:33.780> coat<00:04:34.440> it<00:04:34.620> just<00:04:35.580> like<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:36.210> previous

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
indeed coat it just like the previous

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.550 
indeed coat it just like the previous
net<00:04:36.900> that<00:04:37.020> we<00:04:37.140> showed<00:04:37.380> we<00:04:38.310> now<00:04:38.490> are<00:04:38.670> going<00:04:38.850> to

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
net that we showed we now are going to

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.880 
net that we showed we now are going to
spray<00:04:40.560> it<00:04:40.920> on<00:04:41.880> our<00:04:42.240> folding<00:04:42.900> net<00:04:44.870> so<00:04:45.870> we<00:04:45.900> just

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
spray it on our folding net so we just

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:52.520 
spray it on our folding net so we just
finished<00:04:47.840> coating<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:49.020> entire<00:04:51.320> fishing<00:04:52.320> net

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
finished coating the entire fishing net

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.140 
finished coating the entire fishing net
with<00:04:53.070> Flex<00:04:53.970> seal<00:04:54.240> and<00:04:55.310> we<00:04:56.310> get<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.520> couple<00:04:56.820> coats

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
with Flex seal and we get a couple coats

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.110 
with Flex seal and we get a couple coats
on<00:04:57.390> it<00:04:57.420> we<00:04:57.810> actually<00:04:58.200> let<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.590> first<00:04:58.860> coat<00:04:59.070> dry

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
on it we actually let the first coat dry

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.880 
on it we actually let the first coat dry
and<00:05:00.120> then<00:05:00.360> we<00:05:00.570> ended<00:05:00.780> up<00:05:00.900> doing<00:05:01.230> another<00:05:01.350> two

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
and then we ended up doing another two

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.840 
and then we ended up doing another two
coats<00:05:02.280> after<00:05:02.760> that<00:05:02.910> just<00:05:03.870> to<00:05:04.050> give<00:05:04.200> it<00:05:04.290> a<00:05:04.500> nice

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
coats after that just to give it a nice

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.350 
coats after that just to give it a nice
good<00:05:05.850> thick<00:05:06.720> coating<00:05:07.170> to<00:05:07.380> kind<00:05:07.620> of<00:05:07.790> match<00:05:08.790> what

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
good thick coating to kind of match what

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.800 
good thick coating to kind of match what
the<00:05:09.750> other<00:05:09.900> net<00:05:10.200> looks<00:05:10.500> like<00:05:10.710> so<00:05:11.580> we<00:05:12.270> just<00:05:12.480> used

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
the other net looks like so we just used

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.560 
the other net looks like so we just used
this<00:05:13.740> rubberized<00:05:14.430> net<00:05:15.230> we<00:05:16.230> use<00:05:16.410> this<00:05:16.620> as<00:05:16.860> a

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
this rubberized net we use this as a

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.050 
this rubberized net we use this as a
guide<00:05:18.570> to<00:05:18.960> kind<00:05:19.500> of<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:19.830> thickness<00:05:20.100> of<00:05:20.520> the

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
guide to kind of the thickness of the

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.030 
guide to kind of the thickness of the
coating<00:05:21.240> that<00:05:21.570> we<00:05:21.660> needed<00:05:21.870> because<00:05:22.500> the

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
coating that we needed because the

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.120 
coating that we needed because the
netting<00:05:23.430> material<00:05:24.020> was<00:05:25.020> almost<00:05:25.470> identical<00:05:25.680> to

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
netting material was almost identical to

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.760 
netting material was almost identical to
the<00:05:26.700> netting<00:05:27.030> material<00:05:27.120> here<00:05:27.810> except<00:05:28.590> this

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
the netting material here except this

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.640 
the netting material here except this
one<00:05:29.040> was<00:05:29.070> rubberized<00:05:29.760> so<00:05:31.280> after<00:05:32.280> two<00:05:33.150> coats<00:05:33.650> it

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
one was rubberized so after two coats it

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.530 
one was rubberized so after two coats it
really<00:05:35.330> really<00:05:36.330> coated<00:05:36.810> well<00:05:37.050> onto<00:05:37.650> the

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
really really coated well onto the

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.350 
really really coated well onto the
netting<00:05:39.540> fabric<00:05:40.050> and<00:05:40.790> that's<00:05:41.790> pretty<00:05:42.240> much

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
netting fabric and that's pretty much

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.020 
netting fabric and that's pretty much
how<00:05:42.630> you<00:05:42.690> do<00:05:42.870> it
