ammonia's that come out of those tea
bags<00:03:36.760> simultaneously<00:03:37.760> just<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.090> there<00:03:38.330> we're

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
bags simultaneously just to there we're

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.810 
bags simultaneously just to there we're
working<00:03:39.050> on<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.230> same<00:03:39.410> temperature<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:42.820> you

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
working on the same temperature and you

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.210 
working on the same temperature and you
know<00:03:43.940> heating<00:03:44.240> up<00:03:44.360> this<00:03:44.510> a<00:03:44.570> weather<00:03:44.870> window<00:03:45.220> so

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
know heating up this a weather window so

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.810 
know heating up this a weather window so
that's<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.580> this<00:03:47.060> really<00:03:47.330> demonstrates<00:03:47.600> just

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
that's it this really demonstrates just

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.070 
that's it this really demonstrates just
what<00:03:49.820> we're<00:03:49.970> doing<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.240> the<00:03:50.390> little<00:03:50.630> vortex

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
what we're doing to the little vortex

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
what we're doing to the little vortex
and<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:52.240> final<00:03:53.240> is<00:03:53.420> creating<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:56.500> vortex<00:03:57.500> of

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
and the final is creating a vortex of

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.650 
and the final is creating a vortex of
water<00:03:58.520> moving<00:03:59.450> it

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660
