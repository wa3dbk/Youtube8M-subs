00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270 

in<00:00:00.060> this<00:00:01.020> video<00:00:01.290> I<00:00:01.350> wanted<00:00:01.709> to<00:00:01.800> do<00:00:01.949> a<00:00:01.979> very

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
in this video I wanted to do a very

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.869 
in this video I wanted to do a very
brief<00:00:02.520> introduction<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.510> glycolysis<00:00:04.879> which

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
brief introduction to glycolysis which

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:06.860 
brief introduction to glycolysis which
is<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.029> pathway<00:00:06.299> that<00:00:06.509> we're<00:00:06.629> going<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.810> be

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
is a pathway that we're going to be

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.220 
is a pathway that we're going to be
talking<00:00:07.049> about<00:00:07.259> more<00:00:07.620> in<00:00:07.680> future<00:00:08.130> videos<00:00:09.230> so

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
talking about more in future videos so

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.259 
talking about more in future videos so
what<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.530> glycolysis<00:00:11.010> glycolysis<00:00:11.700> literally

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
what is glycolysis glycolysis literally

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.509 
what is glycolysis glycolysis literally
comes<00:00:12.480> from<00:00:12.719> glyco<00:00:13.349> which<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:14.190> know<00:00:14.250> implies

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
comes from glyco which you know implies

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.670 
comes from glyco which you know implies
the<00:00:14.670> sugar<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.179> lysis<00:00:15.929> which<00:00:16.109> means<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.500> break

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
the sugar and lysis which means to break

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.470 
the sugar and lysis which means to break
up<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.130> basically<00:00:17.640> glycolysis<00:00:18.150> means

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
up so basically glycolysis means

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.480 
up so basically glycolysis means
splitting<00:00:18.869> sugar<00:00:19.230> which<00:00:20.039> sugar<00:00:20.310> in

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
splitting sugar which sugar in

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.460 
splitting sugar which sugar in
particular<00:00:20.970> are<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.270> splitting<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:22.199> probably

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
particular are we splitting you probably

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.490 
particular are we splitting you probably
already<00:00:22.619> know<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.189> answer<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.550> glucose

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
already know this the answer is glucose

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.220 
already know this the answer is glucose
which<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.769> six<00:00:26.070> carbon<00:00:26.279> molecule<00:00:26.779> so<00:00:27.779> is

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
which is a six carbon molecule so is

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.099 
which is a six carbon molecule so is
this<00:00:29.099> process<00:00:29.340> process<00:00:30.119> aerobic<00:00:30.929> or

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
this process process aerobic or

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.220 
this process process aerobic or
anaerobic<00:00:32.450> what<00:00:33.450> we'll<00:00:33.570> find<00:00:33.840> out<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.200> that

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
anaerobic what we'll find out is that

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.139 
anaerobic what we'll find out is that
this<00:00:34.500> process<00:00:34.980> well<00:00:35.370> first<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.700> all<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:36.030> is

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
this process well first of all what is

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.020 
this process well first of all what is
Arabic<00:00:36.450> Arabic<00:00:36.750> means<00:00:37.170> requires<00:00:37.530> oxygen

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
Arabic Arabic means requires oxygen

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.280 
Arabic Arabic means requires oxygen
anaerobic<00:00:39.030> means<00:00:39.180> does<00:00:39.510> not<00:00:39.660> require<00:00:40.050> oxygen

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
anaerobic means does not require oxygen

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.420 
anaerobic means does not require oxygen
so<00:00:41.280> glycolysis<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:42.030> actually<00:00:42.329> an<00:00:42.450> anaerobic

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
so glycolysis is actually an anaerobic

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.900 
so glycolysis is actually an anaerobic
process<00:00:44.660> because<00:00:45.660> no<00:00:46.350> oxygen<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.340> required

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
process because no oxygen is required

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.080 
process because no oxygen is required
for<00:00:48.809> glycolysis<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.950> occur<00:00:51.020> okay<00:00:52.910> how<00:00:53.910> many

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
for glycolysis to occur okay how many

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.869 
for glycolysis to occur okay how many
steps<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.660> glycolysis<00:00:55.579> there<00:00:56.579> are<00:00:56.670> actually

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
steps is glycolysis there are actually

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.260 
steps is glycolysis there are actually
10<00:00:57.120> enzyme<00:00:57.899> catalyzed<00:00:58.469> steps<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.850> glycolysis

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
10 enzyme catalyzed steps to glycolysis

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.569 
10 enzyme catalyzed steps to glycolysis
and<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.719> way<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.620> kind<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.980> think<00:01:02.039> about<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.489> is

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
and the way I kind of think about it is

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.149 
and the way I kind of think about it is
there's<00:01:02.850> there<00:01:03.239> are<00:01:03.270> two<00:01:03.719> phases<00:01:04.170> one<00:01:04.830> being

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
there's there are two phases one being

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.340 
there's there are two phases one being
the<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:06.180> investment<00:01:06.659> phase<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.020> second

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the the investment phase the second

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.880 
the the investment phase the second
being<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.530> payoff<00:01:07.920> phase<00:01:09.140> so<00:01:10.140> glycolysis<00:01:10.590> is

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
being the payoff phase so glycolysis is

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.070 
being the payoff phase so glycolysis is
first<00:01:11.159> five<00:01:11.460> reactions<00:01:11.729> will<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.600> considered

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
first five reactions will be considered

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.010 
first five reactions will be considered
the<00:01:13.200> investment<00:01:13.680> phase<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.130> which<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:14.790> invest

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
the investment phase in which we invest

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.940 
the investment phase in which we invest
to<00:01:16.130> ATP<00:01:17.240> right<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.570> invent<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.409> normally<00:01:19.830> when

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
to ATP right so invent we normally when

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.770 
to ATP right so invent we normally when
you<00:01:20.009> invest<00:01:20.460> anything<00:01:21.090> right<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> invest

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
you invest anything right if you invest

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.690 
you invest anything right if you invest
money<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.380> particular<00:01:22.470> company<00:01:23.130> or<00:01:23.159> idea<00:01:23.520> or

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
money in a particular company or idea or

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.039 
money in a particular company or idea or
something<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.030> expect<00:01:24.299> some<00:01:24.509> sort<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.750> return

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
something you expect some sort of return

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.660 
something you expect some sort of return
right<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.650> expect<00:01:26.009> them<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.340> hope<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
right and you expect them and hope the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.940 
right and you expect them and hope the
return<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.090> larger<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> payoff<00:01:28.710> phase

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
return is larger so in the payoff phase

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.440 
return is larger so in the payoff phase
which<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> second<00:01:30.030> five<00:01:30.210> reactions

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
which is just the second five reactions

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.440 
which is just the second five reactions
of<00:01:30.900> glycolysis<00:01:31.310> we<00:01:32.310> actually<00:01:32.640> make<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> total

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
of glycolysis we actually make a total

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.230 
of glycolysis we actually make a total
of<00:01:33.659> four<00:01:34.530> ATP<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.820> think<00:01:35.909> about<00:01:36.000> that

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
of four ATP so if you think about that

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.230 
of four ATP so if you think about that
four<00:01:36.479> minus<00:01:36.840> two<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.290> actually<00:01:37.619> net<00:01:37.950> two<00:01:38.670> ATP

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
four minus two we actually net two ATP

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.780 
four minus two we actually net two ATP
so<00:01:40.229> part<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.890> reason<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.280> call<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.460> part<00:01:41.729> of

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
so part of the reason I call it part of

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.190 
so part of the reason I call it part of
the<00:01:41.850> purpose<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.210> glycolysis<00:01:42.600> two<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.049> to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the purpose of glycolysis two is to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.380 
the purpose of glycolysis two is to
create<00:01:43.500> ATP<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.030> moment<00:01:45.329> I'll

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
create ATP but in just a moment I'll

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.630 
create ATP but in just a moment I'll
mention<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.810> few<00:01:45.960> other<00:01:46.140> things<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.640> like

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
mention a few other things that like

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.719 
mention a few other things that like
pollicis<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.180> important<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:49.399> we<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.610> be

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
pollicis is important for we have to be

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.289 
pollicis is important for we have to be
a<00:01:50.970> keep<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.540> mind<00:01:52.399> we're<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.909> cell<00:01:54.119> does

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
a keep in mind we're in the cell does

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.959 
a keep in mind we're in the cell does
glycolysis<00:01:54.689> occur<00:01:55.079> by<00:01:55.860> collossus<00:01:56.340> occurs<00:01:56.670> in

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
glycolysis occur by collossus occurs in

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.090 
glycolysis occur by collossus occurs in
the<00:01:57.360> cytosol<00:01:58.759> right<00:01:59.759> over<00:01:59.909> the<00:01:59.969> cytoplasm<00:02:01.100> so

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the cytosol right over the cytoplasm so

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.429 
the cytosol right over the cytoplasm so
it<00:02:02.250> does<00:02:02.369> not<00:02:02.490> occur<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.509> membrane-bound

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
organelle other pathways it's important

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.389 
organelle other pathways it's important
to<00:02:06.630> keep<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.840> mind<00:02:06.869> where<00:02:07.799> these<00:02:08.129> pathways

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
to keep in mind where these pathways

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.249 
to keep in mind where these pathways
actually<00:02:09.060> occur<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.599> I'll<00:02:09.959> get<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.170> that

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
actually occur and I'll get to that

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.080 
actually occur and I'll get to that
later<00:02:10.440> but<00:02:10.860> bear<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.280> mind<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.550> glycolysis

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
later but bear in mind that glycolysis

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.470 
later but bear in mind that glycolysis
occurs<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.959> side<00:02:13.110> of

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
occurs in the side of

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.449 
occurs in the side of
now<00:02:14.480> um<00:02:17.769> one<00:02:18.769> thing<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.069> want<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.340> mention

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
now um one thing I want to mention

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.759 
now um one thing I want to mention
before<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:19.970> go<00:02:20.120> on<00:02:20.269> about<00:02:20.480> how<00:02:20.690> this<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:21.290> whether

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
before I go on about how this is whether

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.170 
before I go on about how this is whether
this<00:02:21.950> is<00:02:22.069> an<00:02:22.190> oxidation<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.760> reductive

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
this is an oxidation of a reductive

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.600 
this is an oxidation of a reductive
pathway<00:02:23.569> we're<00:02:24.290> taking<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:24.800> glucose<00:02:25.220> and

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
pathway we're taking this glucose and

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.920 
pathway we're taking this glucose and
we're<00:02:25.849> actually<00:02:26.000> splitting<00:02:26.569> it<00:02:26.660> up<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:26.900> I

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
we're actually splitting it up and I

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.020 
we're actually splitting it up and I
mentioned<00:02:27.200> just<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.500> moment<00:02:27.590> ago<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:28.519> glucose

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
mentioned just a moment ago that glucose

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.949 
mentioned just a moment ago that glucose
is<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:30.500> six<00:02:31.040> carbon<00:02:31.370> molecule<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:32.030> in<00:02:32.330> one<00:02:32.720> in

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
is a six carbon molecule so in one in

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.140 
is a six carbon molecule so in one in
one<00:02:33.140> round<00:02:33.290> of<00:02:33.470> glycolysis<00:02:33.890> we<00:02:34.670> take<00:02:34.849> one

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
one round of glycolysis we take one

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.350 
one round of glycolysis we take one
glucose<00:02:35.569> molecule<00:02:36.400> which<00:02:37.400> is<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.670> six<00:02:38.120> carbon

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
glucose molecule which is a six carbon

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.670 
glucose molecule which is a six carbon
molecule<00:02:38.569> and<00:02:39.319> we<00:02:39.980> turned<00:02:40.220> it<00:02:40.340> into<00:02:41.110> two<00:02:42.110> three

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
molecule and we turned it into two three

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.800 
molecule and we turned it into two three
carbon<00:02:42.709> molecules<00:02:43.519> called<00:02:44.330> pyruvate<00:02:46.810> these

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
carbon molecules called pyruvate these

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.740 
carbon molecules called pyruvate these
are<00:02:47.959> three<00:02:48.230> carbon<00:02:48.560> molecules<00:02:49.069> okay<00:02:49.910> so

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
are three carbon molecules okay so

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.350 
are three carbon molecules okay so
knowing<00:02:51.200> this<00:02:51.530> is<00:02:51.890> this<00:02:52.370> an<00:02:52.549> oxidative<00:02:53.060> or

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
knowing this is this an oxidative or

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.300 
knowing this is this an oxidative or
reductive<00:02:53.720> pathway<00:02:54.340> well<00:02:55.750> or<00:02:56.750> as<00:02:56.989> n-digit

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
reductive pathway well or as n-digit

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.890 
reductive pathway well or as n-digit
anabolic<00:02:58.310> or<00:02:58.400> catabolic<00:02:58.459> process<00:02:59.239> well<00:02:59.810> if

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
anabolic or catabolic process well if

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.809 
anabolic or catabolic process well if
you<00:02:59.989> watch<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.290> last<00:03:00.440> video<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:01.099> probably

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
you watch the last video you probably

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.420 
you watch the last video you probably
remember<00:03:02.360> that<00:03:02.810> anabolism<00:03:03.470> is<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.010> building

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
remember that anabolism is the building

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.190 
remember that anabolism is the building
of<00:03:04.569> macromolecules<00:03:05.569> or<00:03:05.780> building<00:03:06.140> a

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
of macromolecules or building a

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.600 
of macromolecules or building a
molecules<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.769> catabolic<00:03:07.099> means<00:03:07.459> the

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
molecules and catabolic means the

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.390 
molecules and catabolic means the
breaking<00:03:07.910> down<00:03:08.060> of<00:03:08.090> molecules<00:03:09.220> so<00:03:10.220> in<00:03:10.340> this

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
breaking down of molecules so in this

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.619 
breaking down of molecules so in this
case<00:03:10.579> we're<00:03:10.760> taking<00:03:10.819> glucose<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:11.510> we're

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
case we're taking glucose and we're

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.330 
case we're taking glucose and we're
making<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:11.989> into<00:03:12.200> two<00:03:12.349> pyruvate<00:03:12.530> two<00:03:12.980> smaller

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
making it into two pyruvate two smaller

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.600 
making it into two pyruvate two smaller
components<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:14.329> this<00:03:14.480> will<00:03:14.569> definitely<00:03:14.720> be<00:03:14.989> a

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
components so this will definitely be a

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.920 
components so this will definitely be a
catabolic<00:03:16.610> pathways<00:03:17.329> because<00:03:17.780> we're

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
catabolic pathways because we're

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.050 
catabolic pathways because we're
breaking<00:03:18.200> something<00:03:18.769> down<00:03:19.010> now<00:03:19.819> if<00:03:19.970> you

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
breaking something down now if you

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.650 
breaking something down now if you
recall<00:03:20.359> I<00:03:20.420> mentioned<00:03:20.690> Arco<00:03:21.590> right<00:03:22.310> and<00:03:22.660> Arco

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
recall I mentioned Arco right and Arco

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.420 
recall I mentioned Arco right and Arco
is<00:03:23.900> just<00:03:24.410> a<00:03:24.500> short<00:03:24.709> acronym<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.220> help<00:03:25.370> you

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
is just a short acronym to help you

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.160 
is just a short acronym to help you
remember<00:03:25.609> that<00:03:25.850> an<00:03:26.000> anabolic<00:03:26.450> process<00:03:26.989> is

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
remember that an anabolic process is

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.990 
remember that an anabolic process is
reductive<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:27.889> a<00:03:27.980> catabolic<00:03:28.400> process<00:03:28.880> is

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
reductive and a catabolic process is

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.020 
reductive and a catabolic process is
oxidative<00:03:29.630> so<00:03:30.079> this<00:03:30.319> this<00:03:30.980> process<00:03:31.730> is<00:03:31.910> an

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
oxidative so this this process is an

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.360 
oxidative so this this process is an
oxidative<00:03:32.540> pathway<00:03:33.170> it's<00:03:33.709> an<00:03:33.799> oxidative

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
oxidative pathway it's an oxidative

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.520 
oxidative pathway it's an oxidative
catabolic<00:03:34.910> process<00:03:35.450> okay<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.410> it's

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
catabolic process okay and it's

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.839 
catabolic process okay and it's
catabolic<00:03:36.859> because<00:03:37.190> we're<00:03:37.310> taking<00:03:37.549> glucose

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
catabolic because we're taking glucose

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:38.860 
catabolic because we're taking glucose
and<00:03:37.940> we're<00:03:38.030> breaking<00:03:38.359> it<00:03:38.480> down<00:03:38.599> into<00:03:38.660> a

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
and we're breaking it down into a

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.069 
and we're breaking it down into a
simpler<00:03:39.260> component<00:03:40.120> now<00:03:41.120> if<00:03:41.420> we<00:03:41.690> start<00:03:41.930> off

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
simpler component now if we start off

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.140 
simpler component now if we start off
with<00:03:42.410> one<00:03:42.709> glucose<00:03:43.069> molecule<00:03:43.099> in<00:03:43.700> glycolysis

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
with one glucose molecule in glycolysis

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.789 
with one glucose molecule in glycolysis
and<00:03:44.480> that<00:03:44.660> got<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:44.959> white<00:03:45.139> out<00:03:45.290> one<00:03:45.470> glucose

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
and that got a white out one glucose

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.530 
and that got a white out one glucose
molecule<00:03:45.829> goes<00:03:46.310> all<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.489> way<00:03:46.639> through<00:03:46.849> what

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
molecule goes all the way through what

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.960 
molecule goes all the way through what
do<00:03:47.660> we<00:03:47.780> net<00:03:47.959> in<00:03:48.139> terms<00:03:48.319> of<00:03:48.500> products<00:03:48.859> so<00:03:49.760> what

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
do we net in terms of products so what

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.670 
do we net in terms of products so what
are<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.120> products<00:03:50.480> of<00:03:50.540> glycolysis<00:03:50.870> given<00:03:51.470> one

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
are the products of glycolysis given one

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.089 
are the products of glycolysis given one
glucose<00:03:52.099> molecule<00:03:52.870> well<00:03:53.950> one<00:03:54.950> of<00:03:55.040> our

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
glucose molecule well one of our

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.250 
glucose molecule well one of our
products<00:03:55.430> is<00:03:55.519> of<00:03:55.609> course<00:03:55.849> is<00:03:56.090> that<00:03:56.359> we<00:03:56.450> get<00:03:56.630> two

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
products is of course is that we get two

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.970 
products is of course is that we get two
pyruvates

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.909 

excuse<00:04:00.980> me<00:04:01.160> we<00:04:01.970> get<00:04:02.150> two<00:04:02.329> pyruvates<00:04:02.870> okay<00:04:03.590> and

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
excuse me we get two pyruvates okay and

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:08.830 
excuse me we get two pyruvates okay and
we<00:04:04.340> net<00:04:04.609> two<00:04:04.970> ATP<00:04:05.950> in<00:04:07.540> addition<00:04:08.540> we<00:04:08.690> also

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
we net two ATP in addition we also

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.479 
we net two ATP in addition we also
create<00:04:09.380> two<00:04:10.040> NADH<00:04:10.790> ha's<00:04:11.349> okay<00:04:12.349> so<00:04:13.130> what's<00:04:13.340> the

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
create two NADH ha's okay so what's the

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.920 
create two NADH ha's okay so what's the
point<00:04:13.639> of<00:04:13.790> all<00:04:13.849> these<00:04:13.970> different<00:04:14.090> things<00:04:14.450> the

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
point of all these different things the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.349 
point of all these different things the
pyruvate<00:04:15.139> has<00:04:15.919> a<00:04:16.599> different<00:04:17.599> possible<00:04:18.019> fates

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
pyruvate has a different possible fates

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.740 
pyruvate has a different possible fates
let<00:04:20.359> me<00:04:20.479> note<00:04:20.690> that<00:04:20.870> here<00:04:21.200> the<00:04:22.659> depending<00:04:23.659> on

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
let me note that here the depending on

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.630 
let me note that here the depending on
whether<00:04:23.900> or<00:04:24.050> not<00:04:24.110> there's<00:04:24.409> oxygen<00:04:24.919> available

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
whether or not there's oxygen available

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.010 
whether or not there's oxygen available
which<00:04:26.570> I'll<00:04:26.780> get

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
which I'll get

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.960 
which I'll get
to<00:04:27.139> later<00:04:27.410> there<00:04:28.310> are<00:04:28.430> many<00:04:28.580> different<00:04:29.229> fates

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
to later there are many different fates

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.950 
to later there are many different fates
possible<00:04:31.970> not<00:04:32.300> fat<00:04:33.009> fates<00:04:34.419> possible<00:04:35.419> for

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
possible not fat fates possible for

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.850 
possible not fat fates possible for
pyruvate<00:04:37.300> it<00:04:38.300> can<00:04:38.449> go<00:04:38.569> onto<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.870> TCA<00:04:39.169> cycle<00:04:39.259> or

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
pyruvate it can go onto the TCA cycle or

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.399 
pyruvate it can go onto the TCA cycle or
it<00:04:40.280> can<00:04:40.520> be<00:04:40.699> fermented<00:04:41.419> which<00:04:41.870> again<00:04:42.139> we'll

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:42.409 
it can be fermented which again we'll

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:44.290 
it can be fermented which again we'll
talk<00:04:42.530> about<00:04:42.650> later<00:04:42.770> to<00:04:43.550> ATP<00:04:43.819> which<00:04:44.150> of<00:04:44.270> course

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
talk about later to ATP which of course

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.290 
talk about later to ATP which of course
can<00:04:44.720> be<00:04:44.810> used<00:04:44.990> for<00:04:45.169> energy<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:46.550> nadh<00:04:47.090> --is

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
which are supposed to go to the electron

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.730 
which are supposed to go to the electron
transport<00:04:57.110> chain<00:04:57.349> the<00:04:58.129> electron<00:04:59.740> transport

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
transport chain the electron transport

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:08.499 
transport chain the electron transport
chain<00:05:04.150> okay<00:05:05.150> to<00:05:05.720> be<00:05:05.930> re<00:05:06.500> oxidized<00:05:07.159> to<00:05:07.580> generate

energy<00:05:09.349> again<00:05:10.280> we'll<00:05:10.430> talk<00:05:10.520> more<00:05:10.580> about<00:05:10.759> that

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:10.909 
energy again we'll talk more about that

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:12.370 
energy again we'll talk more about that
later<00:05:11.030> but<00:05:11.599> hopefully<00:05:11.900> that<00:05:12.050> was<00:05:12.169> a<00:05:12.199> good

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
later but hopefully that was a good

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.020 
later but hopefully that was a good
little<00:05:12.530> introduction<00:05:13.130> as<00:05:13.340> far<00:05:13.520> as<00:05:13.639> what

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
little introduction as far as what

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.999 
little introduction as far as what
glycolysis<00:05:14.630> is<00:05:14.930> all<00:05:15.080> about<00:05:15.319> thanks<00:05:15.919> for

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
glycolysis is all about thanks for

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.280 
glycolysis is all about thanks for
