it's<00:01:37.480> been<00:01:37.630> nine<00:01:37.870> years<00:01:37.900> since<00:01:38.350> Maxis<00:01:38.740> made

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
it's been nine years since Maxis made

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.350 
it's been nine years since Maxis made
less<00:01:39.070> m-city<00:01:39.430> and<00:01:39.610> computers<00:01:39.910> gotten<00:01:40.090> so

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
less m-city and computers gotten so

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.850 
less m-city and computers gotten so
powerful<00:01:40.930> that<00:01:41.170> we<00:01:41.260> can<00:01:41.380> do<00:01:41.470> all<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.680> things

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
powerful that we can do all the things

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.260 
powerful that we can do all the things
that<00:01:42.010> we're<00:01:42.130> dreaming<00:01:42.400> of<00:01:42.610> with<00:01:42.730> Sim<00:01:42.880> City<00:01:43.000> for

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
that we're dreaming of with Sim City for

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.000 
that we're dreaming of with Sim City for
things<00:01:43.840> like<00:01:43.900> make<00:01:44.200> a<00:01:44.230> full<00:01:44.530> bottom-up

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
things like make a full bottom-up

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.700 
things like make a full bottom-up
simulation<00:01:45.550> where<00:01:45.700> every<00:01:46.060> Sim<00:01:46.720> every<00:01:47.470> vehicle

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
simulation where every Sim every vehicle

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.210 
simulation where every Sim every vehicle
every<00:01:48.010> building<00:01:48.310> is<00:01:48.400> a<00:01:48.460> real<00:01:48.730> simulation

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
every building is a real simulation

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.280 
every building is a real simulation
so<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:51.910> look<00:01:52.060> of<00:01:52.180> this<00:01:52.300> game<00:01:52.510> is<00:01:52.780> really

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
so the look of this game is really

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.510 
so the look of this game is really

where<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:55.090> take<00:01:55.360> footage<00:01:55.750> of<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.050> real<00:01:56.290> city

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
where you take footage of a real city

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.590 
where you take footage of a real city
and<00:01:56.830> you<00:01:57.460> filter<00:01:57.850> it<00:01:57.880> so<00:01:58.090> that<00:01:58.210> it<00:01:58.300> looks<00:01:58.330> like

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
and you filter it so that it looks like

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.240 
and you filter it so that it looks like
a<00:01:58.720> miniature<00:01:59.200> world<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.770> know<00:01:59.890> a<00:01:59.920> world<00:02:00.100> that

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
a miniature world you know a world that

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.520 
a miniature world you know a world that
you<00:02:00.340> could<00:02:00.490> reach<00:02:00.670> into<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.240> touch<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.350> world

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
you could reach into and touch the world

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.470 
you could reach into and touch the world
that<00:02:02.860> is<00:02:02.980> smaller<00:02:03.490> than<00:02:03.580> you<00:02:03.820> that<00:02:04.210> you<00:02:04.300> can

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
that is smaller than you that you can

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.750 
that is smaller than you that you can
control<00:02:05.010> so<00:02:06.010> here<00:02:06.160> you<00:02:06.250> can<00:02:06.340> see<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.580> checked

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
control so here you can see the checked

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.190 
control so here you can see the checked
ility<00:02:07.090> of<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.210> building<00:02:07.510> so<00:02:07.690> we're<00:02:07.930> gonna<00:02:08.020> let

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
ility of the building so we're gonna let

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.810 
ility of the building so we're gonna let
you<00:02:08.229> just<00:02:08.470> plop<00:02:08.890> them<00:02:09.070> into<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.310> world<00:02:09.460> as<00:02:09.670> if

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
you just plop them into the world as if

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.030 
you just plop them into the world as if
they're<00:02:09.940> physical<00:02:10.330> objects<00:02:10.650> you<00:02:11.650> can<00:02:11.830> build

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
they're physical objects you can build

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.770 
they're physical objects you can build
specialized<00:02:12.670> cities<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.510> attract

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
specialized cities that attract

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.180 
specialized cities that attract
different<00:02:13.870> sims<00:02:14.290> have<00:02:14.680> different<00:02:14.950> sorts<00:02:15.130> of

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
different sims have different sorts of

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.530 
different sims have different sorts of
buildings<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.640> them<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.270> might<00:02:16.390> have<00:02:16.480> a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
buildings in them so you might have a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.360 
buildings in them so you might have a
city<00:02:16.810> that's<00:02:17.110> based<00:02:17.350> around<00:02:17.620> culture<00:02:18.280> and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
city that's based around culture and

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.710 
city that's based around culture and
education<00:02:18.790> that's<00:02:19.180> going<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.420> attract<00:02:19.660> a

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
education that's going to attract a

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.600 
education that's going to attract a
bunch<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:19.930> educated<00:02:20.350> Sims<00:02:20.590> or<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.370> might<00:02:21.490> have

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
bunch of educated Sims or you might have

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.100 
bunch of educated Sims or you might have
another<00:02:21.760> city<00:02:22.000> that's<00:02:22.180> built<00:02:22.390> around<00:02:22.480> heavy

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
another city that's built around heavy

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.540 
another city that's built around heavy
industry<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.560> manufacturing<00:02:24.160> that's<00:02:24.370> going

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
industry and manufacturing that's going

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.310 
industry and manufacturing that's going
to<00:02:24.610> track<00:02:24.760> all<00:02:24.880> these<00:02:25.000> blue-collar<00:02:25.420> Sims<00:02:25.690> your

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
to track all these blue-collar Sims your

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.810 
to track all these blue-collar Sims your
city's<00:02:26.560> going<00:02:26.710> to<00:02:26.770> look<00:02:27.100> different<00:02:27.250> instant

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
city's going to look different instant

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.700 
city's going to look different instant
behave<00:02:28.090> differently<00:02:28.390> this<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.500> first

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
behave differently this is the first

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.830 
behave differently this is the first
truly<00:02:29.980> multiplayer<00:02:30.550> Sim<00:02:30.790> City<00:02:31.000> what<00:02:31.630> makes

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
truly multiplayer Sim City what makes

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.510 
truly multiplayer Sim City what makes
the<00:02:31.960> multi<00:02:32.230> play<00:02:32.410> unique<00:02:32.770> is<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.190> cities<00:02:33.400> are

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
the multi play unique is that cities are

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.340 
the multi play unique is that cities are
actually<00:02:33.880> connected<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.930> choices<00:02:35.140> that

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
actually connected so the choices that

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.930 
actually connected so the choices that
you're<00:02:35.590> making<00:02:35.740> at<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.130> city<00:02:36.340> level<00:02:36.550> have<00:02:36.910> a

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
solve the power outage they're gonna

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.540
