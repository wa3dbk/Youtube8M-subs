camera on high streak and I get the jump
on<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> enemy<00:00:42.890> i'm<00:00:43.890> also<00:00:44.100> using<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> beam

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
on the enemy i'm also using you a beam

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.680 
on the enemy i'm also using you a beam
system<00:00:45.329> heck<00:00:45.690> only<00:00:46.520> speed<00:00:47.520> extended<00:00:48.149> time<00:00:48.360> and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
system heck only speed extended time and

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.690 
system heck only speed extended time and
drive<00:00:49.500> detection<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> text<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.550> like

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
drive detection so it's a text just like

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.100 
drive detection so it's a text just like
see<00:00:50.879> him<00:00:50.969> through<00:00:51.120> walls<00:00:51.360> speed<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.079> it

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
see him through walls speed so it

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.660 
see him through walls speed so it
happens<00:00:52.530> more<00:00:52.559> frequently<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.309> next<00:00:53.550> end

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
happens more frequently in the next end

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.240 
happens more frequently in the next end
of<00:00:53.760> time<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.120> lasts<00:00:54.449> longer<00:00:54.660> obviously

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
of time so it lasts longer obviously

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.709 
of time so it lasts longer obviously
it's<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> maximum<00:00:56.940> double<00:00:57.329> extended

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
it's just the maximum double extended

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.990 
it's just the maximum double extended
times<00:00:57.930> was<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:59.010> know<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.340> last<00:00:59.550> stubble
