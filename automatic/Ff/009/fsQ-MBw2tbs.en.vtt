00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
Russian medium and that's not the first

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.370 
Russian medium and that's not the first
t54<00:00:26.760> variant<00:00:27.300> they<00:00:27.390> have<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.960> game<00:00:28.170> here

but<00:00:28.650> first<00:00:29.640> things<00:00:29.849> first<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.359> mouse<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.199> I

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
but first things first the mouse and I

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.900 
but first things first the mouse and I
guess<00:00:31.800> that's<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.009> pronounced<00:00:32.279> at<00:00:32.399> mouse<00:00:32.610> chin

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
guess that's a pronounced at mouse chin

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.020 
guess that's a pronounced at mouse chin
notion<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.309> what<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.430> probably<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.969> be

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
notion the what is probably going to be

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.240 
notion the what is probably going to be

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.590 
were probably possibly going to do that
but<00:01:11.340> they<00:01:11.460> also<00:01:11.580> remove<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.060> penetration

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
but they also remove the penetration

thinly armored it is a tr7 tank
destroyer<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:41.070> well<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.000> better<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.329> a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
destroyer so it if well I better have a

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.429 
destroyer so it if well I better have a
good<00:01:42.509> gun<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.750> make<00:01:42.869> up<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.110> armor

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
good gun to make up for this armor

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.780 
good gun to make up for this armor
according<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.040> has<00:01:44.100> one<00:01:44.399> millimeter

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
according to this it has one millimeter

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.420 
according to this it has one millimeter
armor<00:01:45.210> all<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> way<00:01:45.540> around<00:01:45.600> I'm<00:01:46.590> not<00:01:46.950> sure<00:01:47.009> if

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
armor all the way around I'm not sure if

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.969 
armor all the way around I'm not sure if
that's<00:01:47.549> correct<00:01:47.820> or<00:01:48.119> not<00:01:48.530> but<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.560> think<00:01:49.649> that

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that's correct or not but I think that

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.700 
that's correct or not but I think that
if<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.189> isn't<00:01:50.549> correct<00:01:51.299> then<00:01:52.259> it's<00:01:52.439> not<00:01:52.590> going

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
if it isn't correct then it's not going

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.560 
if it isn't correct then it's not going
to<00:01:52.799> be<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> whole<00:01:53.189> lot<00:01:53.220> more<00:01:53.670> than<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.329> one

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
to be a whole lot more than that but one

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.959 
to be a whole lot more than that but one
millimeter<00:01:54.960> that's<00:01:55.159> your<00:01:56.159> car<00:01:56.399> probably<00:01:56.790> has

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
millimeter that's your car probably has

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.370 
millimeter that's your car probably has
more<00:01:57.000> than<00:01:57.240> one<00:01:57.360> millimeter<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.780> armor<00:01:58.079> on<00:01:58.200> it

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
more than one millimeter of armor on it

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.940 
more than one millimeter of armor on it
so<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.850> will<00:02:00.119> see<00:02:00.329> about<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.799> if<00:02:01.920> that's

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
so we will see about that and if that's

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.249 
so we will see about that and if that's
correct<00:02:02.340> or<00:02:02.579> if<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.729> gets<00:02:02.850> changed<00:02:03.090> both<00:02:04.020> gets

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
correct or if it gets changed both gets

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.179 
correct or if it gets changed both gets
premium<00:02:04.530> vehicles<00:02:04.799> i<00:02:04.829> should<00:02:04.979> point<00:02:05.070> out

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.940 
this vehicle plays out and we'll see
just<00:03:24.750> how<00:03:24.900> scared<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.290> have<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.470> be<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.709> them<00:03:25.829> on

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
just how scared I have to be of them on

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.800 
just how scared I have to be of them on
the<00:03:26.010> battlefield<00:03:26.489> will<00:03:26.730> have<00:03:27.299> to<00:03:27.420> get<00:03:27.540> used<00:03:27.600> to

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
the battlefield will have to get used to

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.330 
the battlefield will have to get used to
it<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.140> we'll<00:03:28.440> see<00:03:28.590> if<00:03:28.650> they<00:03:28.739> actually<00:03:28.769> make

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
it and we'll see if they actually make

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.979 
it and we'll see if they actually make
it<00:03:29.489> into<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:30.470> full<00:03:31.470> release<00:03:31.950> in<00:03:32.220> 9.7<00:03:33.120> here<00:03:33.329> but

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
it into the full release in 9.7 here but

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.020 
it into the full release in 9.7 here but
moving<00:03:34.230> on<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.620> other<00:03:34.950> vehicle<00:03:35.370> because<00:03:36.000> I

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
moving on to the other vehicle because I

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.199 
moving on to the other vehicle because I
don't<00:03:36.209> want<00:03:36.239> us<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.510> take<00:03:36.630> forever<00:03:36.950> we<00:03:37.950> have

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
don't want us to take forever we have

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.729 
don't want us to take forever we have
Russian<00:03:39.209> tech<00:03:39.360> tree<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:40.380> always<00:03:40.560> have<00:03:40.650> to

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
Russian tech tree you always have to

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.949 
Russian tech tree you always have to
scroll<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.010> Russian<00:03:41.250> tech<00:03:41.400> tree<00:03:41.579> I<00:03:41.959> don't

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
scroll the Russian tech tree I don't

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.640 
scroll the Russian tech tree I don't
remember<00:03:43.049> anyway<00:03:43.500> here's<00:03:44.340> t54<00:03:44.850> mod<00:03:45.390> mod<00:03:46.170> 1<00:03:46.440> the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
remember anyway here's t54 mod mod 1 the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.640 
remember anyway here's t54 mod mod 1 the
prototype<00:03:47.100> first<00:03:47.760> prototype<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.480> let's<00:03:49.440> see

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
prototype first prototype and let's see

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.550 
prototype first prototype and let's see
here<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.340> c-54<00:03:50.549> is<00:03:51.060> normally<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.540> tier<00:03:52.290> nine

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
here so the c-54 is normally a tier nine

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.259 
here so the c-54 is normally a tier nine
tank<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.519> was<00:03:53.640> hoping<00:03:53.790> that<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.090> wouldn't

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
tank and I was hoping that it wouldn't

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.150 
tank and I was hoping that it wouldn't
be<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.450> premium<00:03:54.870> tank<00:03:55.140> in<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.530> game<00:03:55.709> because<00:03:55.950> I

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
be a premium tank in the game because I

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.210 
be a premium tank in the game because I
like<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.640> have<00:03:56.760> another<00:03:57.450> option<00:03:57.720> add<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:59.100> the

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
like to have another option add to the

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.650 
like to have another option add to the
t54<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.910> go<00:04:00.030> through<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.230> t54<00:04:02.010> itself

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
t54 to go through to the t54 itself

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.390 
t54 to go through to the t54 itself
other<00:04:03.660> than<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.959> lightweight<00:04:04.290> but<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.250> looks

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
other than the lightweight but it looks

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.520 
other than the lightweight but it looks
like<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.670> 416<00:04:06.239> is<00:04:06.450> there<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:06.930> didn't<00:04:07.260> realized

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
like the 416 is there I didn't realized

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.880 
like the 416 is there I didn't realized
the<00:04:07.620> 416<00:04:08.070> connect<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.579> t54<00:04:09.150> did<00:04:10.049> that<00:04:10.739> get

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
the 416 connect to the t54 did that get

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.300 
the 416 connect to the t54 did that get
changed<00:04:11.340> probably<00:04:12.209> not<00:04:12.390> but<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:14.040> don't

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
changed probably not but I don't

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.349 
changed probably not but I don't
remember<00:04:14.400> that<00:04:14.640> being<00:04:14.760> an<00:04:14.880> option<00:04:15.090> when<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.239> got

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
remember that being an option when I got

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.699 
remember that being an option when I got
my<00:04:15.480> teeth<00:04:15.660> before<00:04:15.900> which<00:04:16.229> is<00:04:16.350> a<00:04:16.380> while<00:04:16.530> back

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
my teeth before which is a while back

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.469 
my teeth before which is a while back
now<00:04:16.950> so<00:04:17.220> but<00:04:17.760> let's<00:04:17.910> check<00:04:18.030> out<00:04:18.150> this<00:04:18.239> TV

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
now so but let's check out this TV

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:19.580 
now so but let's check out this TV
before<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.780> haven't<00:04:18.930> actually<00:04:19.049> looked<00:04:19.289> at<00:04:19.440> one

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
before I haven't actually looked at one

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.610 
before I haven't actually looked at one
myself<00:04:19.940> so<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.209> does<00:04:21.450> have<00:04:21.720> it<00:04:22.229> looks<00:04:22.380> more

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
myself so it does have it looks more

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.120 
myself so it does have it looks more
like<00:04:22.740> a<00:04:22.770> t44<00:04:23.640> than<00:04:23.820> t54<00:04:24.539> actually

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
like a t44 than t54 actually

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.120 
like a t44 than t54 actually
do<00:04:25.340> have<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.640> t44<00:04:26.210> here<00:04:26.390> that's<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.140> t44<00:04:27.800> this

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
do have the t44 here that's the t44 this

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.450 
do have the t44 here that's the t44 this
is<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.340> t54<00:04:28.970> prototype<00:04:29.950> so<00:04:30.950> there's<00:04:31.220> not<00:04:31.430> a

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
is the t54 prototype so there's not a

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.090 
is the t54 prototype so there's not a
whole<00:04:31.640> lot<00:04:31.700> of<00:04:31.850> difference<00:04:32.060> really<00:04:33.100> other

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
whole lot of difference really other

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.130 
whole lot of difference really other
than<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.490> fact<00:04:34.610> that<00:04:34.760> the<00:04:34.910> 54<00:04:35.390> is<00:04:35.510> in<00:04:35.600> HD<00:04:35.930> and

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
than the fact that the 54 is in HD and

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.780 
than the fact that the 54 is in HD and
the<00:04:37.010> 44<00:04:37.730> is<00:04:37.910> not<00:04:38.560> but<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.680> 54<00:04:40.160> it<00:04:40.280> looks<00:04:40.520> like

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
the 44 is not but the 54 it looks like

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.480 
the 44 is not but the 54 it looks like
it's<00:04:41.300> going<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:41.660> miss<00:04:41.990> be<00:04:42.650> missing<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.310> one

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
it's going to miss be missing the one

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.550 
it's going to miss be missing the one
feature<00:04:43.730> of<00:04:43.850> the<00:04:43.970> t54<00:04:44.780> I<00:04:44.810> like<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.200> most<00:04:45.380> which

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
feature of the t54 I like the most which

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.790 
feature of the t54 I like the most which
is<00:04:45.590> that<00:04:45.800> super<00:04:46.250> round<00:04:46.810> awesome<00:04:47.810> bounces

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
is that super round awesome bounces

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.530 
is that super round awesome bounces
almost<00:04:49.070> every<00:04:49.340> shell<00:04:49.520> off<00:04:49.700> of<00:04:49.850> it<00:04:50.030> turret<00:04:50.390> and

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
almost every shell off of it turret and

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.930 
almost every shell off of it turret and
the<00:04:51.050> t54<00:04:51.650> does<00:04:51.800> not<00:04:51.980> have<00:04:52.220> that<00:04:52.250> although<00:04:52.820> it

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
the t54 does not have that although it

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.610 
the t54 does not have that although it
does<00:04:53.120> have<00:04:53.150> a<00:04:53.390> a<00:04:53.810> decent<00:04:54.140> amount<00:04:54.230> hundred

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
does have a a decent amount hundred

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.920 
does have a a decent amount hundred
eighty<00:04:54.830> millimeters<00:04:55.130> of<00:04:55.340> armor<00:04:55.850> which<00:04:56.630> is

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
eighty millimeters of armor which is

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.670 
eighty millimeters of armor which is
more<00:04:57.830> than<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.580> t44<00:04:59.360> has<00:04:59.540> so<00:05:00.260> I<00:05:00.290> think<00:05:00.440> that

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
more than the t44 has so I think that

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.150 
more than the t44 has so I think that
will<00:05:00.950> be<00:05:00.980> a<00:05:01.130> pretty<00:05:01.520> good<00:05:01.640> turret<00:05:03.160> regardless

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
will be a pretty good turret regardless

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.650 
will be a pretty good turret regardless
even<00:05:04.400> though<00:05:04.790> it<00:05:04.880> might<00:05:05.000> not<00:05:05.120> be<00:05:05.180> as<00:05:05.390> good<00:05:05.510> as

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
even though it might not be as good as

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.170 
even though it might not be as good as
the<00:05:05.720> t-54s<00:05:06.320> even<00:05:06.800> though<00:05:06.860> it<00:05:07.010> doesn't<00:05:07.820> have<00:05:08.060> as

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
the t-54s even though it doesn't have as

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.340 
the t-54s even though it doesn't have as
much<00:05:08.240> armor<00:05:08.630> doesn't<00:05:08.720> have<00:05:08.930> that<00:05:09.020> bouncy

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
much armor doesn't have that bouncy

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.350 
much armor doesn't have that bouncy
shape<00:05:09.560> as<00:05:09.740> much<00:05:09.980> but<00:05:10.220> it's<00:05:10.430> still<00:05:11.060> got<00:05:11.210> those

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
shape as much but it's still got those

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.790 
shape as much but it's still got those
cheeks<00:05:11.660> that<00:05:11.810> should<00:05:11.990> be<00:05:12.050> pretty<00:05:12.230> bouncy<00:05:12.470> and

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
cheeks that should be pretty bouncy and

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.320 
cheeks that should be pretty bouncy and
we'll<00:05:13.370> have<00:05:13.550> to<00:05:13.670> see<00:05:13.820> just<00:05:14.030> how<00:05:14.090> much<00:05:14.120> what

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
we'll have to see just how much what

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.890 
we'll have to see just how much what
weak<00:05:14.450> spot<00:05:14.630> that<00:05:14.750> gun<00:05:14.900> mail<00:05:15.080> it<00:05:15.260> is<00:05:16.690> but<00:05:17.690> it

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
weak spot that gun mail it is but it

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.840 
weak spot that gun mail it is but it
looks<00:05:18.050> pretty<00:05:18.110> nice<00:05:18.410> itself<00:05:18.950> looking<00:05:19.730> at

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
looks pretty nice itself looking at

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.850 
looks pretty nice itself looking at
engine<00:05:20.180> power<00:05:20.390> it<00:05:20.720> does<00:05:21.080> have<00:05:21.260> less<00:05:21.500> engine

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
engine power it does have less engine

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.480 
engine power it does have less engine
power<00:05:22.040> than<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:22.690> 44<00:05:23.690> and<00:05:24.010> it<00:05:25.010> does<00:05:25.160> weigh<00:05:25.460> a

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
power than the 44 and it does weigh a

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.180 
power than the 44 and it does weigh a
little<00:05:25.850> bit<00:05:26.060> more<00:05:26.240> as<00:05:26.360> well<00:05:26.770> but<00:05:27.770> as<00:05:27.950> far<00:05:28.130> as

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
little bit more as well but as far as

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.750 
little bit more as well but as far as
armor<00:05:28.640> goes<00:05:28.820> it<00:05:29.120> does<00:05:30.110> have<00:05:30.920> more<00:05:31.280> in<00:05:31.550> every

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
armor goes it does have more in every

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.380 
armor goes it does have more in every
way<00:05:31.940> so<00:05:32.000> that's<00:05:32.390> good<00:05:32.690> and<00:05:33.970> 120<00:05:34.970> millimetres<00:05:35.330> a

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
way so that's good and 120 millimetres a

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.790 
way so that's good and 120 millimetres a
hull<00:05:35.540> armor<00:05:35.720> let's<00:05:36.020> see<00:05:36.140> how<00:05:36.260> the<00:05:36.320> angle<00:05:36.740> is

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
hull armor let's see how the angle is

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.760 
hull armor let's see how the angle is
compared<00:05:37.070> to<00:05:37.130> the<00:05:37.190> 54<00:05:37.640> it's<00:05:38.210> about<00:05:38.360> the<00:05:38.480> same

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
compared to the 54 it's about the same

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.350 
compared to the 54 it's about the same
so<00:05:39.770> the<00:05:39.800> hull<00:05:40.040> armor<00:05:40.250> in<00:05:40.430> the<00:05:40.460> 54<00:05:40.910> prototype

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
so the hull armor in the 54 prototype

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.840 
so the hull armor in the 54 prototype
here<00:05:41.630> is<00:05:41.780> going<00:05:42.260> to<00:05:42.380> be<00:05:42.650> pretty<00:05:43.370> nice<00:05:43.610> too

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
here is going to be pretty nice too

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.300 
here is going to be pretty nice too
because<00:05:44.030> it<00:05:44.270> was<00:05:44.390> almost<00:05:44.720> reliable<00:05:45.530> in<00:05:45.590> 54<00:05:46.160> at

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
because it was almost reliable in 54 at

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.260 
because it was almost reliable in 54 at
tier<00:05:46.550> nine<00:05:46.790> but<00:05:47.510> the<00:05:47.570> thief<00:05:47.750> of<00:05:48.170> the<00:05:48.590> prototype

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
tier nine but the thief of the prototype

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.130 
tier nine but the thief of the prototype
headed<00:05:50.270> to<00:05:50.330> your<00:05:50.450> eighth<00:05:50.630> it<00:05:50.870> should<00:05:51.050> be

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
headed to your eighth it should be

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.990 
headed to your eighth it should be
pretty<00:05:51.320> nice<00:05:51.560> so<00:05:51.950> we'll<00:05:52.340> see<00:05:52.490> how<00:05:52.520> it<00:05:52.640> goes<00:05:52.760> i

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
pretty nice so we'll see how it goes i

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
pretty nice so we'll see how it goes i
think<00:05:53.150> this<00:05:53.210> will<00:05:53.300> be<00:05:53.360> a<00:05:53.450> pretty<00:05:53.660> good<00:05:53.750> vehicle

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
think this will be a pretty good vehicle

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.570 
think this will be a pretty good vehicle
to<00:05:54.200> have<00:05:54.380> it<00:05:54.890> might<00:05:55.040> be<00:05:55.160> a<00:05:55.190> little<00:05:55.310> bit<00:05:55.460> more

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
to have it might be a little bit more

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.940 
to have it might be a little bit more
sluggish<00:05:55.880> than<00:05:56.030> t54<00:05:56.690> or<00:05:56.900> maybe<00:05:57.620> even<00:05:57.710> more

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
sluggish than t54 or maybe even more

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.530 
sluggish than t54 or maybe even more
than<00:05:58.010> the<00:05:58.220> thief<00:05:58.370> 44<00:05:58.880> but<00:05:59.060> those<00:05:59.180> are<00:05:59.360> pretty

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
than the thief 44 but those are pretty

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.240 
than the thief 44 but those are pretty
maneuver<00:05:59.930> will<00:06:00.050> be<00:06:00.170> pretty<00:06:00.530> mobile<00:06:00.740> vehicles

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
maneuver will be pretty mobile vehicles

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.640 
maneuver will be pretty mobile vehicles
they're<00:06:01.430> on<00:06:01.580> their<00:06:02.000> own<00:06:02.030> so<00:06:02.780> I<00:06:02.810> think<00:06:03.050> it'll<00:06:03.500> be

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
they're on their own so I think it'll be

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.080 
they're on their own so I think it'll be
pretty<00:06:03.830> nice<00:06:04.040> to<00:06:04.220> see<00:06:04.430> but<00:06:04.790> as<00:06:04.880> far<00:06:05.030> as

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
pretty nice to see but as far as

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.590 
pretty nice to see but as far as
everything<00:06:05.510> else<00:06:05.570> goes<00:06:05.780> 100<00:06:06.080> millimetres

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
everything else goes 100 millimetres

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.590 
everything else goes 100 millimetres
7.41<00:06:08.600> rounds<00:06:09.350> per<00:06:09.500> minute<00:06:09.590> 200<00:06:10.280> amateu<00:06:10.600> 175

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
7.41 rounds per minute 200 amateu 175

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.870 
7.41 rounds per minute 200 amateu 175
bila<00:06:11.840> meters<00:06:12.080> penetration<00:06:12.620> and<00:06:14.740> that's<00:06:15.880> we'll

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
bila meters penetration and that's we'll

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.550 
bila meters penetration and that's we'll
see<00:06:17.060> oh<00:06:17.090> that<00:06:17.300> is<00:06:17.450> we'll<00:06:17.930> see<00:06:17.960> how<00:06:18.140> the<00:06:18.260> whole

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
see oh that is we'll see how the whole

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.600 
see oh that is we'll see how the whole
vehicle<00:06:18.800> plays<00:06:19.070> out<00:06:19.280> but<00:06:19.400> I'm<00:06:19.520> very

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
vehicle plays out but I'm very

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.340 
vehicle plays out but I'm very
interested<00:06:20.150> to<00:06:20.390> see<00:06:20.600> this<00:06:20.690> one<00:06:20.900> and<00:06:21.080> this<00:06:21.170> is

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
interested to see this one and this is

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.100 
interested to see this one and this is
almost<00:06:21.710> one<00:06:21.980> that<00:06:22.220> I<00:06:22.640> would<00:06:23.480> consider<00:06:23.780> buying

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
almost one that I would consider buying

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.950 
almost one that I would consider buying
myself<00:06:24.490> we'll<00:06:25.490> see<00:06:25.700> how<00:06:25.730> it<00:06:25.970> plays<00:06:26.120> out<00:06:26.510> seeing

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
myself we'll see how it plays out seeing

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.330 
myself we'll see how it plays out seeing
it<00:06:27.050> as<00:06:27.140> a<00:06:27.170> Russian<00:06:27.560> medium<00:06:27.950> so<00:06:28.040> it's<00:06:28.130> probably

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
it as a Russian medium so it's probably

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.800 
it as a Russian medium so it's probably
gonna<00:06:28.460> have<00:06:28.550> terrible<00:06:29.000> gun<00:06:29.150> depression<00:06:29.360> and

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
gonna have terrible gun depression and

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.690 
gonna have terrible gun depression and
it's<00:06:30.500> probably<00:06:30.650> going<00:06:30.920> to<00:06:31.010> get<00:06:31.100> a<00:06:31.160> more<00:06:31.400> act<00:06:31.580> a

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700 
it's probably going to get a more act a

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.050 
it's probably going to get a more act a
lot<00:06:31.850> and<00:06:32.120> catch<00:06:32.270> on<00:06:32.420> fire<00:06:32.630> quite<00:06:33.080> a<00:06:33.110> bit<00:06:33.350> and

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
lot and catch on fire quite a bit and

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.820 
lot and catch on fire quite a bit and
but<00:06:35.060> I<00:06:35.300> think<00:06:35.870> overall<00:06:36.229> it'll<00:06:36.560> be<00:06:36.650> a<00:06:36.680> pretty

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
but I think overall it'll be a pretty

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.020 
but I think overall it'll be a pretty
nice<00:06:37.010> vehicle<00:06:37.190> and<00:06:37.430> I<00:06:37.460> hope<00:06:37.580> to<00:06:37.610> see<00:06:37.729> it<00:06:37.880> around

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
nice vehicle and I hope to see it around

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.920 
nice vehicle and I hope to see it around
the<00:06:38.120> battlefield

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
the battlefield

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.290 
the battlefield
but<00:06:39.830> thank<00:06:40.370> you<00:06:40.490> everyone<00:06:40.669> for<00:06:40.759> watching<00:06:40.940> oh

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
but thank you everyone for watching oh

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.960 
but thank you everyone for watching oh
and<00:06:41.539> one<00:06:41.750> more<00:06:41.780> note<00:06:42.440> Northwest<00:06:43.340> has<00:06:43.490> removed

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
and one more note Northwest has removed

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.170 
and one more note Northwest has removed
from<00:06:44.180> random<00:06:44.539> battle<00:06:44.900> mode<00:06:45.110> so<00:06:45.710> you<00:06:46.070> the<00:06:47.000> map

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
from random battle mode so you the map

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.370 
from random battle mode so you the map
will<00:06:47.330> probably<00:06:47.780> still<00:06:48.020> be<00:06:48.050> in<00:06:48.169> the<00:06:48.350> game

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.380
