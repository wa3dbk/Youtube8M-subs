00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
distress but you can fix that you can go

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.590 
distress but you can fix that you can go
in<00:02:37.760> with<00:02:37.970> an<00:02:38.150> eraser<00:02:38.450> tool<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:41.390> know

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
in with an eraser tool and you know

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.050 
in with an eraser tool and you know
touch<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.680> up<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:43.040> bit<00:02:43.070> or<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:44.870> can<00:02:45.670> expand<00:02:46.670> the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
touch it up a bit or you can expand the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:56.840 
touch it up a bit or you can expand the
distress<00:02:47.600> layer<00:02:49.030> sometimes<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.299> helps

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.540 

so<00:02:58.100> that's<00:02:59.100> how<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.700> make<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.120> distress<00:03:00.750> layer

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.280 
so that's how you make a distress layer
let's<00:03:02.550> play<00:03:02.790> with<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.150> I'm<00:03:04.050> going<00:03:04.230> to
