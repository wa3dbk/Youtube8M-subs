00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.029
 hey people more here and in the video 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.520
 I'm super exciting again 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.720
 new call of duty big and it works 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.610
 in the video not around the multiplayer 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.780
 but the singleplayer and her 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.430
 all know, I am only or 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.440
 multiplayer type but I think the 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.209
 campaign of call of duty ghost easy 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.410
 I am so thrilled about it now 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.420
 me right and I would 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.490
 I advise you to watch this video 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.650
 and do not be afraid it will not be big 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.300
 give spoiler because we have the reason newspaper 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.640
 from the call of duty, big table and canon 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.679
 with the apocalypse and demonstrated 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.720
 there is an attack on america today 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.210
 just more detailed information 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.829
 first story missions by cod ghosts 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.350
 and the interesting thing is that it is not 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.750
 as boring as modern warfare 2 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.500
 or mp3 the whole lot is a lot 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.539
 more exciting 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.309
 previously it was in the infinity ward am 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.269
 yes always so that you can aim on a few 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.980
 then shot the 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.600
 has selected difficulty level and 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.969
 then only to the first mission to 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.829
 answer is now a whole lot 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.329
 there will be more exciting because now there is 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.399
 a correct treatment and a 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.719
 frame handling treatment that is the 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.789
 technical term for the actual 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.649
 history and framework so to speak 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.020
 for the story around so in 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.640
 the case eg the pri story now has the 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.780
 first mission ten years earlier 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.970
 occur 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.130
 he plays an astronaut on one 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.080
 to be exact on the 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.880
 space station where also the order carrier 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.470
 be kept and then you will 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.570
 from the federation of the federation 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.700
 the evil in call of duty ghosts 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.560
 attacked and you have to try that 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.250
 to defend whole and no matter how good 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.720
 we play 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.430
 you can not do that by any means 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.170
 be killed and the federation 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.910
 takes over the space station 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.950
 of course, then it flows all the same 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.900
 watch shrek rockets directly on america 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.600
 And you can see how the US is doing 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.030
 within seconds with their own 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.290
 completely destroyed weapons and that was 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.800
 then actually the first one 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.060
 mission 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.010
 but we can already say how 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.570
 it will continue for you then ten years 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.400
 after that, that will be done 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.350
 played and there is a time jump 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.000
 and we see how the whole thing 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.100
 has evolved naturally then the 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.870
 usa no major power more complete 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.700
 suppressed and you play on yours 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.350
 main character, however, the whole story 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.030
 they will have to play long 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.860
 They said they want a particular band too 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.180
 build up the character and there it is 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.920
 important that you do not so often between 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.660
 the character changes and really 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.280
 has a band to another team aids 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.319
 and to the dog, for example, in a hurry 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.760
 why should there really no big 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.400
 Being confused like the others 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.200
 infinity was and 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.510
 Anyway , you're ten years after 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.519
 the stop in america and wears the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.780
 two brothers lied and hess the goods 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.689
 at that time still children is the whole 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.860
 happened and then are in this 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.689
 grown up post-apocalyptic world 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.750
 you step in your special unit 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.939
 called co2 and just want to join 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.989
 count on them at the federation and 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.519
 to fight against 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.769
 the interesting thing is with the others 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.870
 Infinity was titled at the mono free 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.569
 had the big army and keeps the 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.519
 great great power the strong usa and the 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.200
 time quite a few people the 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.489
 against this new great power the 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.750
 fight federation 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.459
 therefore could not with ob 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.590
 very much helicopters and equipment 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.299
 Simply armor in the slums before rapid 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.639
 and slaughter the people 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.480
 It will be quite a lot of tactical world 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.459
 give missions 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.810
 I also find cool is you 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.519
 really the choice and that was in 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.530
 interviews confirmed but you can 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.480
 just let the rainbow out and with 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.709
 talk around your lmg and try 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.810
 to get the opponents like that 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.069
 but I'm only eleven players and me 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.870
 I'm looking forward to the more tactical 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.519
 Missions and I think that cool 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.379
 the freedom simply remains that everyone 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.849
 can keep his own style of play 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.769
 And you can decide for yourself how he does that 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.419
 Story plays through it will also 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.889
 Giving sequences was simply freedom 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.780
 hate and not the hose line or 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.430
 must follow the red thread as well as that 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.199
 otherwise in the call of duty stories is 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.970
 and that is not an assumption and then 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.500
 really confirmed in an interview 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.299
 And that makes me happy in any case 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.980
 Now I think that's it now 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.389
 my opinion that it will be like that 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.579
 so for example at night from the 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.079
 tumor ejects and then a headquarter 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.579
 you may have to take 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.840
 through the underground you can come 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.729
 maybe climb on top of that 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.500
 you can come on the part of any 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:48.599
 use tactical equipment 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.370
 night vision device reilly you can do 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.750
 what you want that will definitely be one 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.340
 bring new beginnings and I believe 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.319
 even that's the first time that I am 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.030
 me right on the campaign on the 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.659
 story mode of a call of duty game 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.280
 looking forward 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.419
 what is actually looking forward to it? 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.280
 already on the campaign of call of duty 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.750
 go or will you turn left again 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.549
 let lie and immediately only the 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.780
 Play multiplayer and the campaign 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.609
 then maybe in the last or in 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.530
 the penultimate week before the next 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.760
 call of duty that really comes out 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.440
 every case is very interesting then if 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.489
 have any questions for me 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.690
 I 'll definitely go down to the 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.849
 answer comments 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.079
 you can send me also like your xbox live 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.560
 gamertag and if the comments 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.760
 write 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.740
 and he just writes a message 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.840

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.330

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.919
 gta 5 server finally switched online 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.569
 I hope everything works great 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.520
 if i love it with my subscribers 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.900

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.639
 So I would be happy if we were today 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.380
 Everyone can play together 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.240
 Playstation can play their names 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.130
 Of course, write down then too 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.569
 can you end each other and yes 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.250
 You can also play together because you 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.870
 no one has or no full lobby 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.949
 I do not know exactly how 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.900
 everything will work 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.639
