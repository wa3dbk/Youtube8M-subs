00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.300
 the wavy hair gives an impression 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.250
 fun and voluminous however to the 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.010
 time to make hairstyles can become a 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.230
 little complicated in this video I'm going to 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.090
 show three hairstyles that work to the 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.090
 perfection with this type of hair 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.330
 the secret is not to comb it so you can 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.279
 keep your waves intact the first 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.710
 hairstyle is completely based on 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.140
 twist the whole hair to a lock of 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.739
 hair next to your head and start to 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.380
 roll back then add more hair to 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:38.350
 that the lock and keeps twisting 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.500
 Repeat this step over and over again 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.020
 get to the other side of your head 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.390
 by twisting the wavy hair not only 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.010
 defined more your ways but also 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.320
 you will have a hairstyle that will not be disarmed 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.359
 when you get to the other end follow 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.370
 twisting all your hair up 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.370
 and forms a kind of headband 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.100
 [Music] 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.200
 surely you will be left lumpy 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.090
 some sides but that gets fixed 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.169
 easily with forks 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.169
 [Music] 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.680
 if you want you can add any type 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.100
 of accessory you want to give it a 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.100
 special touch 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.740
 and 8 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.020
 the next hairstyle consists only 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.230
 of knots takes a lock at the side of your 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.270
 head and divide it in two then up 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.910
 you make them like a tie and add 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.570
 each strand a little more hair of his 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.610
 respective side then re-tie them and 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.340
 again add more hair to each 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.280
 Tuft repeats this until you have 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.569
 come to the other side of your head 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.569
 [Music] 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.300
 i 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.300
 whoever 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.970
 when you get to the other side keep walking 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.370
 the remaining strand until you reach 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.030
 the tip and secure it with a garter 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.500
 [Music] 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.600
 [Applause] 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.600
 the morning 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.160
 [Applause] 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.010
 the last hairstyle is a recreation of 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.200
 a braid but rolled with all your 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.570
 hair to the side and divide it into 2 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.840
 then twist every million in 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.939
 [Music] 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.939
 [Applause] 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.340
 once twisted next to them and returns 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.880
 to separate them in two 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.760
 [Music] 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.200
 and what 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.310
 [Music] 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.040
 again roll them in 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.040
 next to them and divide them again 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.920
 h 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.840
 [Music] 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.930
 Repeat this until you reach the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.510
 tips and tie the braid with a garter 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.430
 this way you can wear braids and then 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.560
 have hair loose without ruining 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.610
 waves of your hair 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.610
 [Music] 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.870
 Finally if you have no loose hairs 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.310
 hesitate to secure them like those 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.290
 [Music] 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.959
 I hope the finados liked it 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.190
 and that they are encouraged to recreate some of us 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.570
 we see in the next video 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.570
 [Music] 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.610
 [Music] 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.570
 now 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.570
 bye 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.010
 or not
