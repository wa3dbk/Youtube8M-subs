lurker<00:03:56.690> aspect<00:03:57.140> I<00:03:57.260> think<00:03:57.290> Laura<00:03:57.980> aspect<00:03:58.250> would

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
lurker aspect I think Laura aspect would

help though robotics facility up now for
backhoe<00:04:02.180> I<00:04:02.209> think<00:04:02.540> this<00:04:02.810> game<00:04:03.020> has<00:04:03.200> gotten<00:04:03.740> a

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
backhoe I think this game has gotten a

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.560 
backhoe I think this game has gotten a
lot<00:04:03.950> closer<00:04:04.220> because<00:04:04.610> of<00:04:04.850> that<00:04:04.970> loss<00:04:05.240> there

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
lot closer because of that loss there

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.390 
lot closer because of that loss there
that<00:04:06.140> back<00:04:06.320> that<00:04:06.650> back<00:04:06.830> we'll<00:04:07.040> manage<00:04:07.190> to

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
that back that back we'll manage to

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.300 
that back that back we'll manage to
inflict<00:04:07.989> vako<00:04:08.989> should<00:04:09.350> be<00:04:09.500> thinking<00:04:10.070> about<00:04:10.130> an

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
inflict vako should be thinking about an

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.010 
inflict vako should be thinking about an
expansion<00:04:10.850> or<00:04:11.000> an<00:04:11.090> attack<00:04:11.360> at<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.600> top<00:04:11.810> though

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
expansion or an attack at the top though

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.229 
expansion or an attack at the top though
he<00:04:12.500> needs<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:12.830> try<00:04:13.070> to<00:04:13.130> maintain<00:04:13.459> parity<00:04:13.880> here

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
he needs to try to maintain parity here

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.270 
he needs to try to maintain parity here
there's<00:04:14.660> a<00:04:14.750> lot<00:04:14.989> of<00:04:15.020> hydras<00:04:15.500> they're<00:04:15.680> all<00:04:16.010> it's

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
three oh very nice work this time around

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.550 
three oh very nice work this time around
and<00:04:35.610> hoja<00:04:36.000> is<00:04:36.180> just<00:04:36.389> just<00:04:36.990> by<00:04:37.080> doing<00:04:37.139> that<00:04:37.379> he's

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
and hoja is just just by doing that he's

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.619 
and hoja is just just by doing that he's
single-handedly<00:04:37.889> um<00:04:38.490> well<00:04:39.060> those<00:04:39.389> those

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:39.629 
single-handedly um well those those

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.059 
single-handedly um well those those
mutants<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.050> pretty<00:04:40.289> much<00:04:40.379> just<00:04:40.650> change<00:04:40.949> the

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069 
mutants to pretty much just change the

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:42.770 
mutants to pretty much just change the
tide<00:04:41.220> of<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.430> battle<00:04:41.460> I<00:04:41.940> don't<00:04:42.479> think<00:04:42.569> the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
tide of the battle I don't think the

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.939 
tide of the battle I don't think the
ground<00:04:42.990> force<00:04:43.199> was<00:04:43.319> the<00:04:43.379> only<00:04:43.530> gonna<00:04:43.680> be<00:04:43.800> real

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
ground force was the only gonna be real

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.010 
ground force was the only gonna be real
win<00:04:44.129> although<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:45.479> looks<00:04:45.659> like<00:04:45.750> they've<00:04:45.870> do

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
win although it looks like they've do

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.439 
win although it looks like they've do
force<00:04:46.289> the<00:04:46.440> zerg<00:04:46.620> to<00:04:46.770> retreat<00:04:47.159> still<00:04:48.150> I<00:04:48.389> think

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
force the zerg to retreat still I think

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.899

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.869 
and backhoe driven back to his base Hojo
should<00:04:55.889> be<00:04:55.949> think<00:04:56.099> about<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.280> fourth<00:04:56.639> oh<00:04:56.819> I

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.930 
think we're a hive tech or both or both
usually<00:05:01.050> be<00:05:01.139> doing<00:05:01.319> both<00:05:01.500> at<00:05:01.650> this<00:05:01.740> point<00:05:01.979> but

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
guess it that that number their high

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.510 
guess it that that number their high
numbers<00:05:36.090> there<00:05:36.990> is<00:05:37.259> a<00:05:37.289> high<00:05:37.860> templar<00:05:38.219> there

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
numbers there is a high templar there

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.790 
numbers there is a high templar there
and<00:05:38.789> that's<00:05:39.120> gonna<00:05:39.270> get<00:05:39.479> oh<00:05:39.630> no<00:05:40.409> it<00:05:40.590> doesn't

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800

get tonight close one though definitely
smart<00:05:43.319> therefore<00:05:43.650> hoja<00:05:43.979> to<00:05:44.190> keep<00:05:44.580> backhoe<00:05:45.000> on

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
smart therefore hoja to keep backhoe on

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.779 
smart therefore hoja to keep backhoe on
his<00:05:45.330> toes<00:05:46.169> there<00:05:46.500> you<00:05:47.159> know<00:05:47.279> just<00:05:47.550> try<00:05:47.729> to

snipe them and and back who should lose
the<00:05:49.949> game<00:05:50.069> then<00:05:50.310> basically<00:05:50.490> would<00:05:50.819> he

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:51.029 
the game then basically would he

the game then basically would he
seriously<00:05:51.300> would<00:05:51.479> without<00:05:51.750> high<00:05:51.900> templar<00:05:52.349> I

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
seriously would without high templar I

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.010 
seriously would without high templar I
mean<00:05:52.560> zergs<00:05:53.130> a<00:05:53.639> facing<00:05:54.360> Protoss<00:05:54.659> is<00:05:54.810> without

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
mean zergs a facing Protoss is without

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
high temp are in a long game pretty much

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.980 
high temp are in a long game pretty much
should<00:05:56.819> always<00:05:57.090> win<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.360> game<00:05:57.569> just<00:05:57.840> by

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
should always win the game just by

should always win the game just by
economy<00:05:58.500> oh<00:05:58.759> look<00:05:59.759> at<00:05:59.880> that<00:06:00.080> manage<00:06:01.080> the

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
economy oh look at that manage the

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.290 
economy oh look at that manage the
pickoff<00:06:01.560> I<00:06:01.860> believe<00:06:02.279> one<00:06:02.520> or<00:06:02.610> two<00:06:02.759> more<00:06:02.969> there

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
pickoff I believe one or two more there

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.420 
pickoff I believe one or two more there
and<00:06:03.509> this<00:06:03.960> is<00:06:04.110> going<00:06:04.259> to<00:06:04.319> be<00:06:04.380> a<00:06:04.409> Bruno<00:06:04.830> here<00:06:05.279> I

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
and this is going to be a Bruno here I

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.830 
and this is going to be a Bruno here I
don't<00:06:05.789> see<00:06:05.880> a<00:06:05.909> single<00:06:06.090> high<00:06:06.330> time<00:06:06.509> but<00:06:06.630> I<00:06:06.690> think

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
don't see a single high time but I think

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.180 
don't see a single high time but I think
one<00:06:07.050> might<00:06:07.199> be<00:06:07.380> approaching<00:06:07.889> but<00:06:07.979> look<00:06:08.130> at

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
one might be approaching but look at

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.089 
one might be approaching but look at
that<00:06:08.340> wall<00:06:08.699> of<00:06:09.000> Hydra<00:06:09.779> list<00:06:09.990> I<00:06:10.139> think<00:06:10.319> oh<00:06:10.500> man<00:06:11.069> I

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
that wall of Hydra list I think oh man I

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:12.439 
that wall of Hydra list I think oh man I
think<00:06:11.400> hoja<00:06:11.729> is<00:06:11.789> just<00:06:11.940> going<00:06:12.060> to<00:06:12.150> brute-force

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
think hoja is just going to brute-force

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.719 
think hoja is just going to brute-force
this<00:06:12.930> one<00:06:13.110> and<00:06:13.380> he<00:06:13.590> just<00:06:13.770> brute<00:06:13.949> forces<00:06:14.340> uses<00:06:14.580> a

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
this one and he just brute forces uses a

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.059 
this one and he just brute forces uses a
moving<00:06:15.060> right<00:06:15.180> now<00:06:15.240> no<00:06:15.840> micro<00:06:16.289> just<00:06:16.590> attacks

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:17.069 
moving right now no micro just attacks

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:19.580 
moving right now no micro just attacks
and<00:06:17.340> uh<00:06:17.460> oh<00:06:17.490> man<00:06:18.000> the<00:06:18.509> last<00:06:18.750> high<00:06:18.900> templar<00:06:19.319> IC

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
and uh oh man the last high templar IC

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.140 
and uh oh man the last high templar IC
gets<00:06:19.770> taken<00:06:19.949> down<00:06:20.130> Ling's<00:06:20.550> all<00:06:20.789> over<00:06:21.060> the

gets taken down Ling's all over the

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.600 
gets taken down Ling's all over the
place<00:06:21.389> that<00:06:21.419> this<00:06:21.719> is<00:06:21.930> why<00:06:22.080> I<00:06:22.110> was<00:06:22.289> meaning<00:06:22.610> if

imbalance now of forces this is just

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.639 
imbalance now of forces this is just
absolutely<00:06:36.120> the<00:06:36.570> absence<00:06:37.050> of<00:06:37.080> high<00:06:37.229> templar
