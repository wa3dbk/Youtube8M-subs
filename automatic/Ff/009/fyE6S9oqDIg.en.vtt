00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.350
 speaks guys welcome to another video 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.710
 of the channel links paper this time the subject 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.600
 is different metal materials 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.550
 steel carabiners aluminum brake the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.460
 steel brake along with the cards 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.050
 why not use this one 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.939
 equipment together 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.740
 many people ask me why not 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.770
 use a steel carabiner with brake 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.480
 in this case, the steel mosquito netting 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.469
 the cold of aluminum are the necessities 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.540
 many different 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.430
 the star has a much higher density 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.460
 than aluminum when you 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.920
 are using this friction that causes 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.480
 between frei an issue will end 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.239
 causing the carabiner as 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.340
 suffering from aluminum is and vice versa if 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.190
 you 're using a question of a 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.140
 steel brake and an aluminum carabiner 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.850
 will crush your brake under the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.859
 aluminum carabiner if you can 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.830
 ask what material I think the most 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.570
 sure I think the steel though 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.290
 there are great equipment made in 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.970
 aluminum 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.640
 in this case the boat is made of aluminum 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.170
 iran the paper is made of aluminum with 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.979
 opposition but two primaries 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.040
 already the thimble glock lift is made of steel 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.250
 the anchoring athletes are made in 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.680
 Steel together with the pins that parabocz 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.140
 people put on the floor made of steel 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.729
 I also believe that steel then 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.400
 resistance much greater than the volume 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.900
 however the equipment 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.240
 aluminum are usually cheaper than 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.159
 steel equipment but do not fail to 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.990
 be safe too so this is it 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.970
 reason not to mix equipment 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.180
 of steel with aluminum equipment is only 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.340
 matter of city ​​hardness of material 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.850
 the material but this one is harder 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.830
 end up as eating the most 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.830
 fine and 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.960
 with less harshness if the dunga was 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.820
 answered and you liked this video did not 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.810
 forget to give a couple and sign up 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.810
 in the channel thanks
