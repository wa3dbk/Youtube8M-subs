our cable to be 132 inches end to end so

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.590 
our cable to be 132 inches end to end so
we<00:05:06.350> divide<00:05:06.680> 132<00:05:07.670> by<00:05:07.910> the<00:05:07.970> number<00:05:08.300> of<00:05:08.330> panels

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
we divide 132 by the number of panels

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.820 
we divide 132 by the number of panels
six<00:05:09.410> and<00:05:09.710> get<00:05:10.280> 22<00:05:10.820> inches<00:05:11.290> this<00:05:12.290> is<00:05:12.350> how<00:05:12.620> much

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
six and get 22 inches this is how much

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.770 
six and get 22 inches this is how much
each<00:05:13.070> section<00:05:13.640> must<00:05:13.820> open<00:05:14.240> so<00:05:14.510> we<00:05:14.630> have

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
each section must open so we have

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.590 
each section must open so we have
uniform<00:05:15.260> panels<00:05:15.680> and<00:05:15.890> to<00:05:16.010> end<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:17.150> dots<00:05:17.390> in

the control tape are approximately one
inch<00:05:19.610> apart<00:05:19.790> so<00:05:20.360> we<00:05:20.450> count<00:05:20.660> 22<00:05:21.200> dots<00:05:21.440> and<00:05:21.710> mark
