00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
as well and he's tasted that power maybe

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.250 
as well and he's tasted that power maybe
he's<00:00:56.489> teaching<00:00:56.879> them<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.030> bring<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.510> out<00:00:57.660> but

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
he's teaching them to bring it out but

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.660 
he's teaching them to bring it out but
they<00:00:58.350> can't<00:00:58.530> bring<00:00:58.739> out<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> full<00:00:59.219> gut<00:00:59.460> power

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
they can't bring out the full gut power

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.189 
they can't bring out the full gut power
they<00:00:59.850> can<00:01:00.000> only<00:01:00.090> bring<00:01:00.329> up<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.570> tiny<00:01:00.780> bit<00:01:00.899> right

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
they can only bring up a tiny bit right

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.410 
they can only bring up a tiny bit right
now<00:01:01.350> that's<00:01:01.980> my<00:01:02.219> speculation<00:01:03.000> anyway<00:01:03.270> they

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
now that's my speculation anyway they

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.570 
now that's my speculation anyway they
can<00:01:03.449> bring<00:01:03.629> up<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.870> tiny<00:01:04.110> part<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.860> that's<00:01:05.400> why

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
can bring up a tiny part and that's why

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.670 
can bring up a tiny part and that's why
when<00:01:05.729> they<00:01:05.820> go<00:01:05.909> super<00:01:06.210> saiyan<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.720> mixes<00:01:07.530> with

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
when they go super saiyan it mixes with

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.770 
when they go super saiyan it mixes with
the<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:08.159> know<00:01:08.280> normal<00:01:08.640> key<00:01:08.850> while<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> super

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780

the<00:01:49.680> God<00:01:49.829> form<00:01:50.070> i<00:01:50.220> think<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.670> might<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.119> bit

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the God form i think that might be a bit

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.020 
the God form i think that might be a bit
you<00:01:51.540> know<00:01:51.680> it<00:01:52.680> seems<00:01:53.040> unlikely<00:01:53.189> i<00:01:53.579> don't<00:01:53.850> think

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you know it seems unlikely i don't think

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.170 
you know it seems unlikely i don't think
vegeta<00:01:54.360> will<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.659> get<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.930> boost<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:55.710> to

for this sort of power house because i'm

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.899 
for this sort of power house because i'm
pretty<00:02:04.619> sure<00:02:04.770> that's<00:02:04.950> what<00:02:05.040> shampoo<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.549> for

anyway<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.750> stage<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.530> pure

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
anyway this stage this is just pure

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.859 
anyway this stage this is just pure
speculation<00:02:07.950> because<00:02:08.479> we're<00:02:09.479> only<00:02:09.569> up<00:02:09.690> to

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
speculation because we're only up to

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.510 
speculation because we're only up to

Episode three orthogonal super at this

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.670 
Episode three orthogonal super at this
stage<00:02:11.700> but<00:02:12.239> what<00:02:12.420> I'm<00:02:12.510> trying<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.750> say<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:12.959> I

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
stage but what I'm trying to say is I

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.470

that<00:02:13.920> champers<00:02:14.280> there<00:02:14.489> for<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.849> sole<00:02:15.239> reason

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
that champers there for that sole reason

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.530 
that champers there for that sole reason
arm<00:02:16.700> it's<00:02:17.700> probably<00:02:17.849> gonna<00:02:18.090> show<00:02:18.299> up<00:02:18.390> the

super<00:03:19.979> cell<00:03:20.129> phone<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.459> what<00:03:20.579> I<00:03:20.690> speculate

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
super cell phone so what I speculate

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.809 
super cell phone so what I speculate
again<00:03:22.019> this<00:03:22.260> is<00:03:22.319> heavy<00:03:22.680> speculation<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.669> if

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
again this is heavy speculation and if

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.219 
again this is heavy speculation and if
you<00:03:23.879> want<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.090> go<00:03:24.150> with<00:03:24.329> this<00:03:24.419> go<00:03:24.659> ahead<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.169> if

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:25.229 
you want to go with this go ahead and if

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:27.170 
you want to go with this go ahead and if
you<00:03:25.290> don't<00:03:25.440> want<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.620> go<00:03:25.799> ahead<00:03:25.889> as<00:03:26.400> well<00:03:26.699> but<00:03:27.120> I

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
you don't want to go ahead as well but I

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.899 
you don't want to go ahead as well but I
just<00:03:28.109> think<00:03:28.199> that<00:03:28.379> there<00:03:28.590> was<00:03:28.680> an<00:03:28.909> imperfect

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
just think that there was an imperfect

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.280 
just think that there was an imperfect
Super<00:03:30.150> Saiyan<00:03:30.329> God<00:03:30.449> Super<00:03:30.510> sent<00:03:30.930> form<00:03:31.169> right

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
Super Saiyan God Super sent form right

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.409 
Super Saiyan God Super sent form right
there<00:03:31.349> that<00:03:32.340> was<00:03:32.430> really<00:03:32.639> strong<00:03:32.909> super<00:03:33.120> sent

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
there that was really strong super sent

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:38.089 
there that was really strong super sent
form<00:03:33.659> and<00:03:35.419> something<00:03:36.419> interesting<00:03:36.900> we<00:03:37.769> said

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
form and something interesting we said

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.649 
form and something interesting we said
in<00:03:38.340> resurrection<00:03:38.669> of<00:03:38.879> he<00:03:39.000> said<00:03:39.209> that<00:03:39.359> if<00:03:39.510> they

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
in resurrection of he said that if they

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.240 
in resurrection of he said that if they
both<00:03:39.870> came<00:03:40.079> up<00:03:40.139> they<00:03:40.470> might<00:03:40.650> be<00:03:40.769> able<00:03:40.859> to<00:03:41.069> take

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
both came up they might be able to take

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.999 
both came up they might be able to take
that<00:03:41.400> barrister<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.750> know<00:03:42.870> even<00:03:43.590> as<00:03:43.829> strong

because<00:04:34.940> obviously<00:04:35.300> we've<00:04:35.750> seen<00:04:35.960> that<00:04:36.139> in

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
because obviously we've seen that in

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.220 
because obviously we've seen that in
resurrection<00:04:36.950> F<00:04:37.190> so<00:04:38.030> yeah<00:04:38.419> that's<00:04:38.660> just<00:04:38.750> the

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
resurrection F so yeah that's just the

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.870 
resurrection F so yeah that's just the
only<00:04:39.290> way<00:04:39.530> it<00:04:39.620> could<00:04:39.740> possibly<00:04:40.130> happen<00:04:40.310> now<00:04:40.700> if

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
only way it could possibly happen now if

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.850 
only way it could possibly happen now if
it<00:04:41.000> happens<00:04:41.360> a<00:04:41.480> different<00:04:41.810> way<00:04:41.930> then<00:04:42.110> I<00:04:42.410> guess

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
it happens a different way then I guess

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.409 
it happens a different way then I guess
that's<00:04:43.100> just<00:04:43.160> my<00:04:43.460> luck<00:04:43.700> I<00:04:43.880> don't<00:04:44.090> know<00:04:44.180> I<00:04:44.389> just

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
that's just my luck I don't know I just

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.030 
that's just my luck I don't know I just
don't<00:04:44.690> see<00:04:44.840> it<00:04:44.870> happening<00:04:44.930> any<00:04:45.410> different<00:04:45.889> way

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
don't see it happening any different way

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.280 
don't see it happening any different way
because<00:04:46.790> that's<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.300> only<00:04:47.330> way<00:04:47.660> for<00:04:48.110> them<00:04:48.230> to

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
because that's the only way for them to

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.409 
because that's the only way for them to
achieve<00:04:49.070> Super<00:04:49.669> Saiyan<00:04:49.880> God<00:04:50.030> that's<00:04:50.270> what

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
achieve Super Saiyan God that's what

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.330 
achieve Super Saiyan God that's what
