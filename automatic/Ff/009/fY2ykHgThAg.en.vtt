00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.789
 personal beauty today the tip today is the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.919
 first car purchase 

00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:11.719
 if you are thinking of buying a 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.809
 car is your first car was a 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.599
 first time without emotions from side of 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.640
 its excitement aside the focus because 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.550
 you make a high investment 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.980
 if it is not to sight or even stop location 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.589
 but only long-term investment will 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.660
 to be a long- term place only 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:34.580
 beyond the page of the car will have the pv 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.280
 ensureed operative thinking 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:41.040
 control and we will see there is with the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.550
 car insurance and future maintenance 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.490
 so you have to be perfect everything 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.280
 this before buying the car 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.480
 according to you have to be a customer 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.070
 boring the strict client you have to 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.250
 ask everything to the seller about the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.030
 car and ask to analyze the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.350
 car came back does not end just to call day 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:11.460
 saw the only alloy the engine warm up 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.679
 I hope with oil, after all, he is 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:20.960
 off 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:23.700
 the car also signs that thing script 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:29.700
 When the engine heats up the final hour goes 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.689
 only one other than 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.929
 euros 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.380
 call the mechanic if possible ask the 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:40.229
 car look all car all month 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.109
 rear to front engine shift 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.590
 everything everything all you can be 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:49.530
 boring because you doing this has 150 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.460
 certainty still works for the mechanic in the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.700
 Car is fine there yes you can buy and 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.399
 Finally after spent part of 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.440
 mechanic everything everything right be that 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.400

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.650
 Are You Looking At Car Mileage 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.970
 You're the only one owner is single 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.970
 very important too 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:21.510
 another thing is more financial part looks 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.900
 the rates have to get the best possible 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:31.860
 of an entry thing that I did not do with 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:33.900
 the national today have an entrance fees 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.600
 between the improvements try to always seek the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.820
 better because after you 're with 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.330
 the car would then be increased to plot 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:47.160
 is lower and less months of the year with 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:50.430
 insurance and taxes falls approved the intention 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.370
 will stay smooth so you can keep 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.890
 this car until you drop by 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.220
 another lost 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.900
