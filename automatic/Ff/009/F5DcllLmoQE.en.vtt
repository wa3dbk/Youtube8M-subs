00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
it's pretty easy it's pretty fun I must

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.990 
it's pretty easy it's pretty fun I must
say<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.560> pretty<00:02:19.770> fun<00:02:19.950> it's<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.490> good<00:02:20.640> reward

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
say it is pretty fun it's a good reward

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.190 
say it is pretty fun it's a good reward
you<00:02:21.150> get<00:02:21.240> all<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.450> gems<00:02:21.630> back<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:22.110> you

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
you get all the gems back that you

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.500 
you get all the gems back that you
borrowed<00:02:22.500> from<00:02:22.590> him<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:22.950> if<00:02:23.790> let's<00:02:24.150> say<00:02:24.180> we<00:02:24.360> did

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
borrowed from him so if let's say we did

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.660 
borrowed from him so if let's say we did
all<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> levels<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.170> we<00:02:25.230> took<00:02:26.190> more<00:02:26.430> gems

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
all the levels and we took more gems

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.070 
all the levels and we took more gems
from<00:02:26.820> us<00:02:26.970> would<00:02:27.120> actually<00:02:27.360> have<00:02:27.450> less<00:02:27.810> gems

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
from us would actually have less gems

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.750 
from us would actually have less gems
and<00:02:28.290> then<00:02:28.380> would<00:02:28.500> accumulate<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.220> back<00:02:29.400> up<00:02:29.580> at

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
and then would accumulate it back up at

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.120 
and then would accumulate it back up at
this<00:02:29.880> point<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.870> yeah<00:02:31.170> because<00:02:31.320> remember<00:02:31.950> we

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
this point so yeah because remember we

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.920 
this point so yeah because remember we
skipped<00:02:32.490> we<00:02:32.700> did<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.180> boss<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:33.660> we<00:02:33.780> didn't

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
skipped we did the boss so we didn't

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.180 
skipped we did the boss so we didn't
have<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.230> actually<00:02:34.350> pay<00:02:34.740> in<00:02:35.070> this<00:02:35.700> level<00:02:35.910> or<00:02:36.270> in

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
have to actually pay in this level or in

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.600 
have to actually pay in this level or in
or<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.220> desert<00:02:39.210> desert<00:02:39.750> ruins<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.800> now<00:02:41.370> it's

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
or in desert desert ruins so now it's

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.760 
or in desert desert ruins so now it's
time<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.790> get<00:02:42.000> some<00:02:42.210> more<00:02:42.260> remaining<00:02:43.260> skill

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
time to get some more remaining skill

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.870 
time to get some more remaining skill

can't<00:03:45.360> skip<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:45.780> level<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.050> haven't<00:03:46.320> been

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
can't skip to a level you haven't been

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.650 
can't skip to a level you haven't been
to<00:03:46.680> yet<00:03:46.860> just<00:03:47.010> let<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.310> know<00:03:47.459> but<00:03:48.270> you<00:03:48.540> know

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
to yet just let you know but you know

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.750 
to yet just let you know but you know
for<00:03:48.780> example<00:03:48.840> if<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.200> were<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.440> go<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.760> some

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
for example if I were to go to some

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.430 
for example if I were to go to some
level<00:03:51.090> farm<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.540> go<00:03:51.630> these<00:03:51.750> ones<00:03:52.020> you<00:03:52.110> can<00:03:52.140> by

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
level farm to go these ones you can by

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.120 
level farm to go these ones you can by
pressing<00:03:52.770> square<00:03:53.900> C<00:03:54.900> yep<00:03:55.080> there<00:03:55.739> we<00:03:55.830> go<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:56.070> we

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
pressing square C yep there we go so we

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.680 
pressing square C yep there we go so we
got<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.310> still<00:03:56.489> got<00:03:56.640> two<00:03:56.880> levels<00:03:57.330> remaining

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
got to still got two levels remaining

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.850 
got to still got two levels remaining
