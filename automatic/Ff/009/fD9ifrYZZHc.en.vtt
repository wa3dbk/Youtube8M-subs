00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.690 

okay<00:00:01.079> here<00:00:01.230> we<00:00:01.260> have<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.500> X<00:00:01.800> button<00:00:02.040> and<00:00:02.220> v2

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
okay here we have the X button and v2

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.820 
okay here we have the X button and v2
orbit<00:00:03.300> set<00:00:03.570> and<00:00:03.959> what<00:00:04.080> I'm<00:00:04.170> going<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.319> do<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.680> to

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
orbit set and what I'm going to do is to

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.470 
orbit set and what I'm going to do is to
explain<00:00:05.190> all<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.520> part<00:00:05.759> you've<00:00:05.970> got<00:00:06.000> inside

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
explain all the part you've got inside

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.720 
explain all the part you've got inside
and<00:00:06.750> why<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:06.930> think<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:07.589> small<00:00:08.040> set<00:00:08.460> is

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
and why I think that this small set is

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.430 
and why I think that this small set is
actually<00:00:08.849> very<00:00:09.179> good<00:00:09.389> value<00:00:09.630> first<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.320> all

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
actually very good value first of all

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.980 
actually very good value first of all
you<00:00:10.590> get<00:00:10.740> two<00:00:11.240> curves<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.509> these<00:00:12.719> are<00:00:12.929> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
you get two curves and these are the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.390 
you get two curves and these are the
tight<00:00:13.230> curves<00:00:13.530> through<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> lots<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.250> other

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
tight curves through a lots of other

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.150 
tight curves through a lots of other
types<00:00:14.670> occurs<00:00:15.000> in<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> X<00:00:15.540> but<00:00:15.750> nano<00:00:15.929> v2n<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
types occurs in the X but nano v2n the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.800 
types occurs in the X but nano v2n the
Tzar<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.640> other<00:00:17.850> type<00:00:18.119> where<00:00:18.330> they're<00:00:18.510> bigger

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
Tzar the other type where they're bigger

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.170 
Tzar the other type where they're bigger
and<00:00:19.050> as<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.890> can<00:00:20.039> see<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.250> takes<00:00:20.460> four<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.880> make

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
and as you can see it takes four to make

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.140 
and as you can see it takes four to make
a<00:00:21.210> full<00:00:21.539> 360<00:00:22.410> circle<00:00:22.890> where<00:00:23.130> with<00:00:23.670> these<00:00:23.880> it

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
a full 360 circle where with these it

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.470 
a full 360 circle where with these it
don't<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.359> take<00:00:24.539> two<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.199> make<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> full<00:00:26.010> circle

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
don't you take two to make a full circle

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.509 
don't you take two to make a full circle
addition<00:00:27.480> inside<00:00:27.840> here<00:00:28.109> you've<00:00:28.289> got<00:00:28.529> two<00:00:29.279> of

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
addition inside here you've got two of

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.510 
addition inside here you've got two of
these<00:00:29.609> short<00:00:29.970> pieces<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.599> track<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.040> time<00:00:32.430> you

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
these short pieces of track so time you

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.660 
these short pieces of track so time you
buy<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> Hexbug<00:00:33.149> v2<00:00:33.750> bug<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.620> get<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> very<00:00:35.430> nice

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
buy a Hexbug v2 bug you get a very nice

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.410 
buy a Hexbug v2 bug you get a very nice
length<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.590> plastic<00:00:37.590> tube<00:00:38.370> I'll<00:00:38.969> take<00:00:39.180> one

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
length of plastic tube I'll take one

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.950 
length of plastic tube I'll take one
that's<00:00:40.290> already<00:00:40.500> out<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> box<00:00:41.040> here<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
that's already out of a box here and

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.119 
that's already out of a box here and
this<00:00:42.960> length<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.530> can<00:00:43.649> see<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.070> about

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
this length as you can see is about

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.090 
this length as you can see is about
twice<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.270> length<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:46.379> shorter<00:00:46.920> piece

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
twice the length of this shorter piece

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.220 
twice the length of this shorter piece
in<00:00:47.250> here<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.579> strangely<00:00:48.090> enough<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:49.020> is

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
in here and strangely enough this is

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.690 
in here and strangely enough this is
actually<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.980> short<00:00:50.219> piece<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.579> actually

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
actually the short piece is actually

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.000 
actually the short piece is actually
more<00:00:51.539> useful<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.110> harder<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.559> get<00:00:52.710> hold<00:00:52.860> up

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
more useful and harder to get hold up

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.139 
more useful and harder to get hold up
and<00:00:53.160> you'll<00:00:53.250> see<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.520> other<00:00:53.640> sets<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.030> my

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and you'll see in other sets of my

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.689 
and you'll see in other sets of my
videos<00:00:54.449> where<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.710> type<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.039> curve<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.610> this

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
videos where this type of curve and this

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.400 
videos where this type of curve and this
table<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.090> strength<00:00:57.360> straight<00:00:57.870> length<00:00:58.140> is

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
table of strength straight length is

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.229 
table of strength straight length is
actually<00:00:58.829> really<00:00:59.129> important<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.850> make<00:01:00.030> some

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
actually really important to make some

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.869 
actually really important to make some
fantastic<00:01:00.859> mazes<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.070> options<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
fantastic mazes and options with the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.090 
fantastic mazes and options with the
other<00:01:03.149> larger<00:01:03.809> sets<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> reason<00:01:04.890> why

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
other larger sets and the reason why

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.530 
other larger sets and the reason why
this<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.280> such<00:01:05.549> great<00:01:05.760> value<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.299> also

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
this is such great value is this also

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.420 
this is such great value is this also
has<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> bug<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.710> there's<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> black<00:01:08.159> bug

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
has a bug in it so there's a black bug

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.880 
has a bug in it so there's a black bug
just<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> top<00:01:09.330> there<00:01:09.540> okay<00:01:10.350> let's<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.770> go

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
just in the top there okay let's just go

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.640 
just in the top there okay let's just go
through<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.220> white<00:01:11.820> linkers<00:01:12.479> there<00:01:13.409> are<00:01:13.500> two

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
through the white linkers there are two

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.130 
through the white linkers there are two
types<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.670> standard<00:01:15.360> white<00:01:15.600> linker

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
types you get the standard white linker

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.830 
types you get the standard white linker
but<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.500> get<00:01:16.759> with<00:01:17.759> every<00:01:17.970> hex<00:01:18.360> bug<00:01:18.540> none<00:01:18.720> of

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
but you get with every hex bug none of

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.280 
but you get with every hex bug none of
e2<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:20.100> allows<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.700> simply<00:01:21.290> connect

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
e2 and this allows you to simply connect

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.070 
e2 and this allows you to simply connect
and<00:01:22.560> click<00:01:22.860> together<00:01:23.390> whether<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> curve

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and click together whether it be a curve

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.080 
and click together whether it be a curve
or<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> straight<00:01:25.619> section<00:01:25.890> attract<00:01:26.369> multiple

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
or a straight section attract multiple

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.530 
or a straight section attract multiple
pieces<00:01:27.600> together<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.210> okay<00:01:30.210> there's

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
pieces together like this okay there's

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.480 
pieces together like this okay there's
another<00:01:30.600> piece<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.290> here<00:01:31.470> you've<00:01:32.009> got<00:01:32.159> two<00:01:32.369> of

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
another piece in here you've got two of

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.890 
another piece in here you've got two of
them<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.820> where<00:01:33.810> they're<00:01:34.320> actually

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
them in this where they're actually

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.030 
them in this where they're actually
split<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.049> two<00:01:37.320> they're<00:01:37.710> actually<00:01:37.950> am

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
split in two they're actually am

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.880 
split in two they're actually am
Aphrodite<00:01:38.340> connectors<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.329> they<00:01:40.259> allow<00:01:40.470> when

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
Aphrodite connectors and they allow when

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.590 
Aphrodite connectors and they allow when
they<00:01:40.979> connected<00:01:41.400> together<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.939> behave<00:01:42.180> just

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
they connected together to behave just

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.960 
they connected together to behave just
like<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:43.590> connector<00:01:44.100> here<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.490> hex<00:01:44.640> mode<00:01:44.790> on

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
like this connector here so hex mode on

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.999 
like this connector here so hex mode on
a<00:01:45.030> right-click<00:01:45.240> design<00:01:45.750> feature<00:01:46.020> here<00:01:46.259> like

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
a right-click design feature here like

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.920 
a right-click design feature here like
this<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.520> again<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.240> keep<00:01:48.420> linking

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
this and again you can keep linking

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.700 
this and again you can keep linking
tubes<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.780> are<00:01:51.869> out<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.110> this

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
tubes to this so if you are out of this

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.929 
tubes to this so if you are out of this
type<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:52.979> connector<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.610> use<00:01:53.700> two<00:01:53.909> of

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
type of connector you can use two of

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.639 
type of connector you can use two of
these<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.930> important<00:01:55.380> thing<00:01:55.409> about

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
these but the important thing about

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.190 
these but the important thing about
these<00:01:56.040> connectors<00:01:56.579> here<00:01:56.880> these<00:01:57.600> two<00:01:57.990> half

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
these connectors here these two half

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.630 
these connectors here these two half
connectors<00:01:58.680> here<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.100> allows<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.490> to

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
now is included in the set I'm going to

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.720 
now is included in the set I'm going to
quickly<00:02:45.860> pop<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.430> bug<00:02:46.610> into<00:02:46.850> his<00:02:47.570> arena<00:02:48.460> so<00:02:49.460> as

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
quickly pop the bug into his arena so as

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.100 
quickly pop the bug into his arena so as
you<00:02:49.850> can<00:02:49.940> see<00:02:50.090> I've<00:02:50.210> just<00:02:50.240> quickly<00:02:50.690> separated

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
you can see I've just quickly separated

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.600 
you can see I've just quickly separated
these<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.710> do<00:02:51.830> that<00:02:51.980> by<00:02:52.070> pinching<00:02:52.550> the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
these and you do that by pinching the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.050 
these and you do that by pinching the
white<00:02:53.510> sides<00:02:54.160> now<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:55.220> need<00:02:55.490> to<00:02:55.610> pop<00:02:55.790> them<00:02:55.940> in

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
white sides now you need to pop them in

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.880 
white sides now you need to pop them in
and<00:02:56.240> quickly<00:02:56.900> close<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.380> because<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.680> course

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
and quickly close it because of course

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.310 
and quickly close it because of course
he's<00:02:58.100> going<00:02:58.280> to<00:02:58.370> climb<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:58.990> I've<00:02:59.990> not<00:03:00.140> done<00:03:00.230> a

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
he's going to climb and I've not done a

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.660 
he's going to climb and I've not done a
very<00:03:00.380> good<00:03:00.500> job<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.830> closing<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.280> there<00:03:01.430> we<00:03:01.550> go

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
very good job of closing it there we go

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.550 
very good job of closing it there we go
much<00:03:01.850> better<00:03:02.150> now<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.900> fun<00:03:03.170> thing<00:03:03.200> about<00:03:03.350> this

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
much better now the fun thing about this

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.810 
much better now the fun thing about this
is<00:03:03.710> of<00:03:03.830> course<00:03:03.980> cutting<00:03:04.280> flooding<00:03:04.730> all

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
is of course cutting flooding all

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.850 
is of course cutting flooding all
orientations<00:03:05.420> I<00:03:05.660> can<00:03:05.960> whilst<00:03:06.380> he's<00:03:06.590> running

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
orientations I can whilst he's running

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.250 
orientations I can whilst he's running
around<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.190> circles<00:03:07.810> move<00:03:08.810> this<00:03:09.080> around

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
around the circles move this around

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.190 
around the circles move this around
myself<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.070> can<00:03:10.280> actually<00:03:10.370> try<00:03:11.360> to<00:03:11.390> pretend

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
myself so I can actually try to pretend

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.480 
myself so I can actually try to pretend
he's<00:03:12.590> not<00:03:12.860> moving

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
he's not moving

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.920 
he's not moving
and<00:03:13.970> I'm<00:03:14.090> not<00:03:14.240> doing<00:03:14.390> a<00:03:14.420> very<00:03:14.450> good<00:03:14.600> job<00:03:14.720> of

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
and I'm not doing a very good job of

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.570 
and I'm not doing a very good job of
that<00:03:14.960> as<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.260> make<00:03:15.410> my<00:03:15.560> arms<00:03:15.770> on<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:15.920> twist<00:03:16.160> but

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
that as I make my arms on the twist but

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.610 
that as I make my arms on the twist but
you<00:03:16.670> get<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:16.970> idea<00:03:17.360> so<00:03:17.959> although<00:03:18.230> this<00:03:18.410> set

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
you get the idea so although this set

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.680 
you get the idea so although this set
isn't<00:03:18.770> in<00:03:18.950> itself<00:03:19.100> a<00:03:19.690> particularly

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
isn't in itself a particularly

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.570 
isn't in itself a particularly
interesting<00:03:21.050> play<00:03:21.440> piece<00:03:21.680> it's<00:03:21.980> very<00:03:22.130> good

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
interesting play piece it's very good

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.720 
interesting play piece it's very good
for<00:03:22.640> parts<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.410> again<00:03:24.410> don't<00:03:24.650> dismay<00:03:25.130> so<00:03:25.400> even

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
for parts and again don't dismay so even

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.160

able to by using these corners and these

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.830 
able to by using these corners and these
straight<00:04:09.020> small<00:04:09.350> sections<00:04:09.830> make<00:04:10.670> more<00:04:11.390> fun

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
straight small sections make more fun

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.320 
straight small sections make more fun
more<00:04:12.080> interesting<00:04:12.680> challenging<00:04:13.340> setups<00:04:13.760> with

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
more interesting challenging setups with

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.630 
more interesting challenging setups with
a<00:04:14.360> bigger<00:04:14.660> a<00:04:14.750> number<00:04:15.170> on<00:04:15.320> arrangement<00:04:16.130> of<00:04:16.280> bugs

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
a bigger a number on arrangement of bugs

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.300 
a bigger a number on arrangement of bugs
so<00:04:17.330> just<00:04:17.540> one<00:04:17.660> last<00:04:17.780> thing<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:18.109> end<00:04:18.290> this<00:04:18.770> piece

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
so just one last thing to end this piece

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.950 
so just one last thing to end this piece
of<00:04:19.430> track<00:04:19.640> was<00:04:20.000> absolutely<00:04:20.510> room<00:04:20.660> inside<00:04:20.900> for

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:20.960 
of track was absolutely room inside for

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.590 
of track was absolutely room inside for
to<00:04:21.289> let<00:04:21.799> me<00:04:21.859> just<00:04:22.070> try<00:04:22.460> to

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
to let me just try to

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.420 
to let me just try to
we<00:04:23.780> love<00:04:23.960> it<00:04:24.050> quick<00:04:24.350> because<00:04:24.560> he's<00:04:25.220> going<00:04:25.340> to

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
we love it quick because he's going to

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.310 
we love it quick because he's going to
fall<00:04:25.610> out<00:04:25.790> so<00:04:26.030> let's<00:04:26.510> just<00:04:26.660> get<00:04:26.840> two<00:04:27.110> of<00:04:27.140> these

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
fall out so let's just get two of these

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.710 
fall out so let's just get two of these
guys<00:04:27.530> running<00:04:27.950> around<00:04:28.010> and<00:04:28.760> they<00:04:28.910> can<00:04:29.060> go<00:04:29.240> head

guys running around and they can go head

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.270 
guys running around and they can go head
to<00:04:29.870> head<00:04:29.900> then<00:04:30.290> I<00:04:30.320> have<00:04:30.560> to<00:04:30.710> go<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:30.950> same<00:04:31.130> way

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
to head then I have to go the same way

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.940 
to head then I have to go the same way
so<00:04:31.340> I'm<00:04:31.520> going<00:04:31.670> to<00:04:31.700> have<00:04:31.850> him<00:04:32.120> go<00:04:32.420> this<00:04:33.290> way<00:04:33.560> him

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
so I'm going to have him go this way him

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.420

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
go this way let's see so let's try and

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.730 
go this way let's see so let's try and
get<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.670> end<00:04:37.790> of<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:37.940> four<00:04:38.180> way<00:04:38.410> right<00:04:39.410> on<00:04:39.500> track

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
get the end of a four way right on track

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.110 
get the end of a four way right on track
