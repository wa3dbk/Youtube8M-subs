00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
long time and I wasn't sure at first how

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.729

when<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.430> first<00:01:05.640> started<00:01:05.939> playing<00:01:06.030> multiplayer

when I first started playing multiplayer

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.630 
when I first started playing multiplayer
the<00:01:07.470> connections<00:01:07.890> were<00:01:08.010> really<00:01:08.250> bad<00:01:08.460> because

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
the connections were really bad because

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.120 
the connections were really bad because
I<00:01:08.850> was<00:01:08.970> always<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.479> red<00:01:09.810> bar<00:01:10.049> which<00:01:10.950> is

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
I was always on like a red bar which is

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.530 
I was always on like a red bar which is
to<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.280> expected<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.939> you're<00:01:12.060> playing<00:01:12.240> across

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
to be expected if you're playing across

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.630 
to be expected if you're playing across
these<00:01:12.900> hosts<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.530> that's<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.070> one<00:01:14.220> downside

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
these hosts and that's the one downside

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.730 
these hosts and that's the one downside
to<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.240> took<00:01:15.420> me<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> while<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.290> kind<00:01:16.650> of

to it is it took me a while to kind of

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.710 
to it is it took me a while to kind of
adjust<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.340> realize<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:18.090> hey<00:01:18.330> I'm<00:01:18.570> not

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.190 
connection and that took me a while to
kind<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.590> sit<00:01:28.799> down<00:01:28.950> adjust<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.820> but<00:01:30.630> I'll

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
kind of sit down adjust to that but I'll

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.630

first<00:01:34.110> because<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.650> game<00:01:34.970> runs<00:01:35.970> awesome<00:01:36.479> on

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
first because this game runs awesome on

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.710 
first because this game runs awesome on
PC<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.770> mean<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.250> runs<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.060> gate<00:01:39.299> you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
PC I mean it runs out of the gate you

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.330 
PC I mean it runs out of the gate you
don't<00:01:39.900> even<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.290> change<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.950> much<00:01:41.070> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
don't even have to change that much and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.100 
don't even have to change that much and
it'll<00:01:41.520> run<00:01:41.820> super<00:01:42.060> smooth<00:01:42.420> now<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> did<00:01:42.810> tweak

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
it'll run super smooth now I did tweak

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.870 
it'll run super smooth now I did tweak
it<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.409> few<00:01:43.590> areas<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.399> for<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.610> most<00:01:44.790> part

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880

the gameplay is solid and I do

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.030 
the gameplay is solid and I do
like<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.260> way<00:02:14.470> they<00:02:14.800> kind<00:02:15.070> of<00:02:15.190> captured<00:02:15.730> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
like the way they kind of captured the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.140 
like the way they kind of captured the
kind<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.190> feeling<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.760> what<00:02:18.970> they<00:02:19.090> were

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
kind of the feeling of what they were

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.610 
kind of the feeling of what they were
going<00:02:19.360> for<00:02:19.480> it<00:02:19.720> definitely<00:02:20.140> feels<00:02:20.260> like<00:02:20.440> it

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
going for it definitely feels like it

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.380 
going for it definitely feels like it
has<00:02:20.770> character<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:21.460> give<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.880> our<00:02:22.000> credit

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
has character and I give to our credit

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.790 
has character and I give to our credit
for<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.630> because<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:22.990> game<00:02:23.170> doesn't<00:02:23.440> feel

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
for that because this game doesn't feel

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.500 
for that because this game doesn't feel
like<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.160> other<00:02:24.310> ones<00:02:24.550> i<00:02:24.760> think<00:02:25.210> if<00:02:25.270> you<00:02:25.360> took

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
like the other ones i think if you took

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.390 
like the other ones i think if you took
this<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.110> put<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.290> next<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.620> mine<00:02:26.830> warfare<00:02:27.040> 3

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
this and put it next to mine warfare 3

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.970 
this and put it next to mine warfare 3
in<00:02:27.490> black<00:02:27.730> ops<00:02:27.970> 1<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:29.230> would<00:02:29.710> see<00:02:29.890> it

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
in black ops 1 you would see it

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.590 
in black ops 1 you would see it
completely<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:30.760> know<00:02:30.880> three<00:02:31.180> completely

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
completely you know three completely

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.870 
completely you know three completely
different<00:02:31.690> games<00:02:32.230> which<00:02:32.500> is<00:02:32.680> kind<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.340> kind<00:02:33.730> of

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
different games which is kind of kind of

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.220

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.260 
them ended up being absolutely horrible
the<00:02:53.410> other<00:02:53.530> one<00:02:53.739> ended<00:02:54.160> up<00:02:54.280> being<00:02:54.489> a<00:02:54.670> noob<00:02:54.940> tube

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
the other one ended up being a noob tube

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.990 
the other one ended up being a noob tube
mass<00:02:55.600> murderer<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:57.130> think<00:02:57.670> Treyarch<00:02:57.940> has

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
mass murderer and I think Treyarch has

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.750 
mass murderer and I think Treyarch has
done<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.239> good<00:02:58.420> job<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.720> staying<00:02:59.170> away<00:02:59.650> from

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
done a good job of staying away from

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.790 
done a good job of staying away from
feeling<00:03:00.760> like<00:03:00.940> black<00:03:01.510> ops<00:03:01.750> 1<00:03:01.840> but<00:03:02.500> in<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.650> same

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
feeling like black ops 1 but in the same

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.940 
feeling like black ops 1 but in the same
respect<00:03:03.190> having<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:03.940> feeling<00:03:04.180> of<00:03:04.480> black<00:03:04.720> ops

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
respect having that feeling of black ops

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.170 
respect having that feeling of black ops
you<00:03:05.950> know<00:03:06.010> that<00:03:06.190> black<00:03:06.459> ops<00:03:06.700> feeling<00:03:07.060> because

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
you know that black ops feeling because

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.090 
you know that black ops feeling because
it<00:03:07.360> does<00:03:07.510> feel<00:03:07.720> like<00:03:07.870> an<00:03:08.020> up-tempo<00:03:08.440> version<00:03:09.010> of

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
it does feel like an up-tempo version of

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.710 
it does feel like an up-tempo version of
black<00:03:09.280> ops<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.760> do<00:03:09.820> respect<00:03:10.060> them<00:03:10.480> for<00:03:10.510> that

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
black ops and I do respect them for that

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.870 
black ops and I do respect them for that
so<00:03:11.050> one<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:11.830> cool<00:03:12.040> things<00:03:12.250> though<00:03:12.489> is<00:03:12.670> now

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
so one of the cool things though is now

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.610 
so one of the cool things though is now
in<00:03:13.090> domination<00:03:13.540> there's<00:03:13.900> actually<00:03:14.230> half<00:03:14.410> time

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
in domination there's actually half time

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.410 
in domination there's actually half time
so<00:03:14.860> after<00:03:15.160> you<00:03:15.250> play<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.760> first<00:03:15.970> round<00:03:16.180> you

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
so after you play the first round you

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.759 
so after you play the first round you
get<00:03:16.600> you<00:03:16.720> go<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:16.959> certain<00:03:17.140> point<00:03:17.410> you<00:03:17.620> play

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
get you go to a certain point you play

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.860 
get you go to a certain point you play
your<00:03:17.920> time<00:03:18.100> limit<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.880> didn't<00:03:19.150> switch<00:03:19.510> sides

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
your time limit you didn't switch sides

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.509 
your time limit you didn't switch sides
after<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.260> while<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.799> then<00:03:20.890> you<00:03:21.010> play<00:03:21.220> from<00:03:21.400> the

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
after a while and then you play from the

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.860 
after a while and then you play from the
other<00:03:21.640> side<00:03:21.880> so<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.150> actually<00:03:22.269> gives<00:03:22.510> you<00:03:22.660> two

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
other side so it actually gives you two

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.229 
other side so it actually gives you two
opportunities<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.709> kind<00:03:23.920> of<00:03:24.010> play<00:03:24.910> it<00:03:25.000> from

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
opportunities to kind of play it from

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.720 
opportunities to kind of play it from
each<00:03:25.450> each<00:03:25.720> little<00:03:26.160> attacking<00:03:27.160> side<00:03:27.400> and

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
each each little attacking side and

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.460 
each each little attacking side and
that's<00:03:28.000> interesting<00:03:28.510> to<00:03:28.630> me<00:03:28.750> because<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.200> kind

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
that's interesting to me because it kind

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.780 
that's interesting to me because it kind
of<00:03:29.500> adds<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.739> new<00:03:29.860> dynamic<00:03:30.100> to<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.549> game

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
of adds a new dynamic to the game

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.150 
of adds a new dynamic to the game
because<00:03:31.030> I've<00:03:31.540> got<00:03:31.840> into<00:03:32.260> one<00:03:32.560> side<00:03:32.799> where<00:03:33.040> we

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
because I've got into one side where we

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.830 
because I've got into one side where we
were<00:03:33.250> just<00:03:33.400> absolutely<00:03:33.580> dominating<00:03:34.540> a<00:03:34.660> team

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
were just absolutely dominating a team

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.289 
were just absolutely dominating a team
and<00:03:35.019> we<00:03:35.200> were<00:03:35.680> up<00:03:35.799> by<00:03:35.980> like<00:03:36.160> I<00:03:36.310> think<00:03:36.519> like<00:03:36.640> 75

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
and we were up by like I think like 75

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.030 
and we were up by like I think like 75
points<00:03:37.540> going<00:03:37.870> into<00:03:38.019> halftime<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.890> we

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
points going into halftime and we

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.410 
points going into halftime and we
actually<00:03:39.160> ended<00:03:39.400> up<00:03:39.489> losing<00:03:39.910> and<00:03:40.120> I'm<00:03:40.239> like

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
actually ended up losing and I'm like

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.030 
actually ended up losing and I'm like
well<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.780> know<00:03:40.900> it's<00:03:41.200> disappointing<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.950> lose

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
well you know it's disappointing to lose

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.699 
well you know it's disappointing to lose
no<00:03:42.850> doubt<00:03:43.030> about<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.480> but<00:03:43.540> it<00:03:44.110> was<00:03:44.200> it<00:03:44.590> was

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
no doubt about that but it was it was

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.310 
no doubt about that but it was it was
strange<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:45.280> me<00:03:45.430> just<00:03:45.700> how<00:03:45.880> different<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.780> game

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
strange to me just how different a game

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.080 
strange to me just how different a game
can<00:03:47.560> feel<00:03:47.769> when<00:03:47.980> you<00:03:48.070> flip<00:03:48.340> side<00:03:48.579> so<00:03:48.820> it<00:03:48.940> does

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
can feel when you flip side so it does

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.520 
can feel when you flip side so it does
give<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.329> team<00:03:49.570> a<00:03:49.600> chance<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:50.049> kind<00:03:50.230> of<00:03:50.260> get<00:03:50.350> that

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
give a team a chance to kind of get that

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.800 
give a team a chance to kind of get that
last<00:03:50.769> ditch<00:03:51.010> effort<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.850> it<00:03:52.000> keeps<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.450> spawn

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
last ditch effort and it keeps the spawn

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.660 
last ditch effort and it keeps the spawn
trap<00:03:53.110> mechanic<00:03:53.590> kind<00:03:53.860> of<00:03:53.980> tone<00:03:54.160> back<00:03:54.400> a<00:03:54.430> little

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
trap mechanic kind of tone back a little

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.490 
trap mechanic kind of tone back a little
bit<00:03:54.850> and<00:03:55.000> that's<00:03:55.120> kind<00:03:55.360> of<00:03:55.420> cool<00:03:55.600> now<00:03:56.170> spawns

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
bit and that's kind of cool now spawns

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.990 
bit and that's kind of cool now spawns
are<00:03:56.709> something<00:03:56.980> I<00:03:57.070> am<00:03:57.220> a<00:03:57.250> little<00:03:57.459> bit<00:03:57.700> worried

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
are something I am a little bit worried

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.610 
are something I am a little bit worried
about<00:03:58.150> in<00:03:58.299> this<00:03:58.390> game<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:59.019> spawns<00:03:59.350> are

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
about in this game the spawns are

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.890 
about in this game the spawns are
horrible<00:04:00.220> right<00:04:00.400> now<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:01.450> one<00:04:01.750> thing

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
horrible right now and the one thing

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.539 
horrible right now and the one thing
I'll<00:04:02.079> say<00:04:02.110> about<00:04:02.290> that<00:04:02.709> though<00:04:02.920> is<00:04:03.100> even

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
I'll say about that though is even

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.330 
I'll say about that though is even
though<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.880> spawns<00:04:04.150> are<00:04:04.329> bad<00:04:04.450> even<00:04:04.840> though<00:04:05.019> I

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
though the spawns are bad even though I

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.550 
though the spawns are bad even though I
want<00:04:06.340> to<00:04:06.489> complain<00:04:06.820> about<00:04:06.970> them<00:04:07.350> triarch<00:04:08.350> has

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
want to complain about them triarch has

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.140 
want to complain about them triarch has
already<00:04:08.739> kind<00:04:09.250> of<00:04:09.310> addressed<00:04:09.670> them<00:04:09.850> because

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
already kind of addressed them because

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.449 
already kind of addressed them because
they<00:04:11.019> have<00:04:11.200> implemented<00:04:11.680> this<00:04:12.010> theme<00:04:12.250> it's

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
they have implemented this theme it's

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.520 
they have implemented this theme it's
like<00:04:12.579> a<00:04:12.610> long<00:04:12.970> term<00:04:13.239> evolution<00:04:13.420> spawn<00:04:14.260> system

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
like a long term evolution spawn system

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.159 
like a long term evolution spawn system
so<00:04:14.920> essentially<00:04:15.430> it<00:04:15.730> records<00:04:16.329> all<00:04:16.510> the<00:04:16.780> quote

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
so essentially it records all the quote

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.140 
so essentially it records all the quote
bad<00:04:17.530> spawns<00:04:18.010> in<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.310> game<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:18.760> every<00:04:19.000> time

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
bad spawns in the game and every time

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.880 
bad spawns in the game and every time
there's<00:04:19.359> a<00:04:19.450> bad<00:04:19.630> spot<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:19.959> they<00:04:20.140> log<00:04:20.410> that<00:04:20.709> and

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
there's a bad spot and they log that and

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.980 
there's a bad spot and they log that and
they<00:04:21.220> address<00:04:21.609> it<00:04:21.789> so<00:04:22.000> let's<00:04:22.599> say<00:04:22.780> that<00:04:22.930> you

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
they address it so let's say that you

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.810 
they address it so let's say that you
spawn<00:04:23.260> behind<00:04:23.410> someone<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:24.190> they<00:04:24.610> turn

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
spawn behind someone and they turn

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.339 
spawn behind someone and they turn
around<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:25.120> kill<00:04:25.330> you<00:04:25.450> instantly<00:04:25.780> that'll<00:04:26.229> be

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
around and kill you instantly that'll be

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.180 
around and kill you instantly that'll be
recorded<00:04:26.890> as

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
recorded as

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.400 
recorded as
bad<00:04:27.340> spawn<00:04:27.670> they<00:04:28.240> use<00:04:28.480> that<00:04:28.510> data<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:29.050> kind<00:04:29.320> of

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
bad spawn they use that data to kind of

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.530 
bad spawn they use that data to kind of
address<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.950> spawns<00:04:30.280> over<00:04:30.820> over<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.390> length

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
address the spawns over over the length

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.820 
address the spawns over over the length
of<00:04:31.690> time<00:04:31.750> so<00:04:32.110> they're<00:04:32.230> always<00:04:32.410> going<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.800> be

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
of time so they're always going to be

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.410 
of time so they're always going to be
constantly<00:04:33.370> changing<00:04:33.790> constantly<00:04:34.090> going

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420

constantly changing constantly going
into<00:04:35.160> better<00:04:36.270> stages<00:04:37.270> I<00:04:37.390> guess<00:04:37.570> and<00:04:37.750> you<00:04:37.810> can

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
into better stages I guess and you can

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.930 
into better stages I guess and you can
see<00:04:38.080> me<00:04:38.200> that<00:04:38.380> died<00:04:38.710> back<00:04:38.980> there<00:04:39.220> too<00:04:39.460> with<00:04:39.790> the

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
war machine that things interesting it's

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.400 
war machine that things interesting it's
not<00:04:42.730> really<00:04:43.270> that<00:04:43.420> good<00:04:43.660> it<00:04:43.780> kind<00:04:43.990> of<00:04:44.050> reminds

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
not really that good it kind of reminds

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.020 
not really that good it kind of reminds
me<00:04:44.470> of<00:04:44.560> like<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.770> china<00:04:45.190> lake<00:04:45.460> in<00:04:45.670> terms<00:04:45.880> of

me of like the china lake in terms of
power<00:04:46.210> you<00:04:46.360> see<00:04:46.600> it<00:04:46.690> takes<00:04:46.870> three<00:04:47.200> hit<00:04:47.830> markers

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
power you see it takes three hit markers

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.560 
power you see it takes three hit markers
to<00:04:48.340> finally<00:04:48.640> kill<00:04:48.820> that<00:04:48.970> guy<00:04:49.150> and<00:04:49.240> those<00:04:49.360> guys

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.400 
I mean it's just I can't believe that
Treyarch<00:05:47.410> was<00:05:47.650> so<00:05:48.840> it<00:05:49.840> just<00:05:50.050> seems<00:05:50.200> like<00:05:50.290> they

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
Treyarch was so it just seems like they

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.500 
Treyarch was so it just seems like they
didn't<00:05:50.770> really<00:05:50.950> pay<00:05:51.250> attention<00:05:51.280> to<00:05:51.820> the<00:05:52.300> gun

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
didn't really pay attention to the gun

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.210 
didn't really pay attention to the gun
balancing<00:05:52.990> on<00:05:53.140> the<00:05:53.169> SMGs<00:05:53.650> because<00:05:53.860> they<00:05:53.980> have

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
balancing on the SMGs because they have

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.950 
balancing on the SMGs because they have
such<00:05:54.580> long<00:05:54.850> range<00:05:55.210> I<00:05:55.360> think<00:05:55.510> it<00:05:55.630> kind<00:05:55.840> of

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
such long range I think it kind of

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.720 
such long range I think it kind of
combos<00:05:56.350> with<00:05:56.500> the<00:05:56.590> fact<00:05:56.830> that<00:05:56.950> the<00:05:57.520> rate<00:05:57.700> of

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
combos with the fact that the rate of

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.310 
combos with the fact that the rate of
fire<00:05:58.000> is<00:05:58.030> on<00:05:58.270> these<00:05:58.419> things<00:05:58.630> are<00:05:58.780> so<00:05:58.960> great

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
fire is on these things are so great

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.640 
fire is on these things are so great
that<00:05:59.700> the<00:06:00.700> range<00:06:01.000> seems<00:06:01.419> better<00:06:01.780> when<00:06:02.410> really

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
that the range seems better when really

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.290 
that the range seems better when really
it's<00:06:02.860> not<00:06:03.010> doing<00:06:03.400> that<00:06:03.430> much<00:06:03.700> damage<00:06:03.940> just

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
it's not doing that much damage just

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.600 
it's not doing that much damage just
that<00:06:04.900> they<00:06:05.020> have<00:06:05.169> such<00:06:05.410> low<00:06:05.650> recoil<00:06:05.919> and<00:06:06.280> the

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
that they have such low recoil and the

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.220 
that they have such low recoil and the
rate<00:06:06.790> of<00:06:06.820> fire<00:06:07.090> is<00:06:07.120> so<00:06:07.450> easy<00:06:07.660> to<00:06:07.780> kind<00:06:07.960> of<00:06:08.080> hold

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.230 
rate of fire is so easy to kind of hold

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.830 
rate of fire is so easy to kind of hold
on<00:06:08.410> to<00:06:08.590> that<00:06:08.770> it<00:06:08.919> seems<00:06:09.190> like<00:06:09.400> it's<00:06:09.580> doing<00:06:09.840> you

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
on to that it seems like it's doing you

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.450 
on to that it seems like it's doing you
know<00:06:10.960> it<00:06:11.200> seems<00:06:11.500> like<00:06:11.560> it's<00:06:11.770> doing<00:06:12.010> more

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
know it seems like it's doing more

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.800 
know it seems like it's doing more
damage<00:06:12.640> than<00:06:12.910> it<00:06:13.060> actually<00:06:13.210> is<00:06:13.419> because

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
damage than it actually is because

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.000 
damage than it actually is because
you're<00:06:13.930> getting<00:06:14.110> more<00:06:14.230> bullets<00:06:14.530> on<00:06:14.650> target

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
you're getting more bullets on target

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.940 
you're getting more bullets on target
but<00:06:15.220> you<00:06:16.000> see<00:06:16.120> me<00:06:16.240> pop<00:06:16.510> into<00:06:16.750> the<00:06:16.780> dragon<00:06:17.200> fire

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
but you see me pop into the dragon fire

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.710 
but you see me pop into the dragon fire
thingy<00:06:18.400> here<00:06:18.730> or<00:06:18.910> whatever<00:06:19.180> it's<00:06:19.360> called<00:06:19.419> the

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
thingy here or whatever it's called the

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.870 
thingy here or whatever it's called the
roto<00:06:19.960> copter<00:06:20.530> what<00:06:21.430> is<00:06:21.520> this<00:06:21.669> thing<00:06:21.820> called

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
roto copter what is this thing called

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.970 
roto copter what is this thing called
dragon<00:06:22.419> fire<00:06:22.720> roto<00:06:23.140> copter<00:06:23.560> it's<00:06:23.740> actually

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:23.980 
dragon fire roto copter it's actually

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.470 
dragon fire roto copter it's actually
kind<00:06:24.160> of<00:06:24.220> cool<00:06:24.400> it's<00:06:24.610> really<00:06:24.940> easy<00:06:25.120> to<00:06:25.240> shoot

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
kind of cool it's really easy to shoot

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.850 
kind of cool it's really easy to shoot
down<00:06:25.690> but<00:06:25.930> if<00:06:25.990> you<00:06:26.080> catch<00:06:26.350> people<00:06:26.710> off<00:06:26.830> guard

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
down but if you catch people off guard

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.500 
down but if you catch people off guard
you<00:06:27.220> can<00:06:27.340> actually<00:06:27.640> get<00:06:27.730> some<00:06:27.910> good<00:06:28.060> runs<00:06:28.300> with

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
you can actually get some good runs with

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.420 
you can actually get some good runs with
this<00:06:28.660> thing<00:06:28.900> and<00:06:29.710> it's<00:06:29.890> kind<00:06:30.070> of<00:06:30.100> fun<00:06:30.280> they

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
this thing and it's kind of fun they

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.950 
this thing and it's kind of fun they
kill<00:06:30.610> streaks<00:06:30.850> in<00:06:30.970> the<00:06:31.060> game<00:06:31.240> pretty<00:06:31.870> much

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
kill streaks in the game pretty much

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.480 
kill streaks in the game pretty much
standard<00:06:32.440> I<00:06:32.590> mean<00:06:32.740> there's<00:06:32.919> no<00:06:33.070> really

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
standard I mean there's no really

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.430 
standard I mean there's no really
surprises<00:06:34.060> there<00:06:34.270> but<00:06:34.750> they're<00:06:34.900> fun<00:06:35.080> and<00:06:35.140> I

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
surprises there but they're fun and I

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.170 
surprises there but they're fun and I
will<00:06:35.590> give<00:06:35.770> them<00:06:35.919> credit<00:06:36.039> for<00:06:36.220> that<00:06:36.430> so<00:06:36.669> that's

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
will give them credit for that so that's

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.640 
will give them credit for that so that's
kind<00:06:37.419> of<00:06:37.479> my<00:06:37.600> first<00:06:37.780> impressions<00:06:38.320> of<00:06:38.380> the<00:06:38.470> game

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
kind of my first impressions of the game

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.380 
kind of my first impressions of the game
it's<00:06:38.860> a<00:06:38.950> solid<00:06:39.190> title<00:06:39.669> there<00:06:39.789> are<00:06:39.970> some<00:06:40.210> things

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
it's a solid title there are some things

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.830 
it's a solid title there are some things
that

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
that

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.390 
that
don't<00:06:40.960> really<00:06:41.320> like<00:06:41.530> about<00:06:41.710> it<00:06:41.889> that<00:06:42.100> I<00:06:42.130> think

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
don't really like about it that I think

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.950 
don't really like about it that I think
needs<00:06:42.580> to<00:06:42.669> be<00:06:42.730> addressed<00:06:43.030> but<00:06:43.600> for<00:06:43.750> the<00:06:43.810> most

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
needs to be addressed but for the most

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.900 
needs to be addressed but for the most
part<00:06:44.080> if<00:06:44.380> they<00:06:44.530> call<00:06:44.800> a<00:06:44.830> duty<00:06:45.070> title<00:06:45.520> that

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910 
part if they call a duty title that

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.700 
part if they call a duty title that
doesn't<00:06:46.300> have<00:06:46.419> a<00:06:46.449> lot<00:06:46.720> of<00:06:46.750> BS<00:06:47.169> things<00:06:47.470> like

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
doesn't have a lot of BS things like

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.710 
doesn't have a lot of BS things like
second<00:06:48.100> chance<00:06:48.310> dead<00:06:48.730> man's<00:06:48.970> hand<00:06:49.150> stuff<00:06:49.540> like

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
second chance dead man's hand stuff like

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.510 
second chance dead man's hand stuff like
that<00:06:49.750> so<00:06:50.169> hopefully<00:06:50.740> you<00:06:50.800> guys<00:06:50.860> did<00:06:51.100> enjoy<00:06:51.220> it

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
that so hopefully you guys did enjoy it

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.490 
that so hopefully you guys did enjoy it
though<00:06:51.669> if<00:06:52.270> you<00:06:52.360> missed<00:06:52.540> my<00:06:52.720> last<00:06:52.750> videos<00:06:53.260> that

though if you missed my last videos that

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.510 
though if you missed my last videos that
was<00:06:53.590> a<00:06:53.620> chance<00:06:53.830> to<00:06:53.949> catch<00:06:54.100> up<00:06:54.130> did<00:06:54.490> a

that we did a halo game place a little

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.520 
that we did a halo game place a little
bit<00:06:58.240> of<00:06:58.330> variety<00:06:58.419> there<00:06:58.840> check<00:06:59.139> either<00:06:59.290> those

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
bit of variety there check either those

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.970 
bit of variety there check either those
out<00:06:59.710> I'll<00:06:59.860> see<00:06:59.979> you<00:07:00.010> guys<00:07:00.070> next<00:07:00.310> time<00:07:00.490> peace
