00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.190
 So welcome dear users 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.070
 Internet resource mega review dot com 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.559
 our own review and testing 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.560
 DVR Leksand model med2000 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.810
 this registrar costs 6500 rubles and 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.179
 Now we will try to justify this 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.970
 high relative cost for 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.730
 this device is first 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.169
 representative of the so-called class 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.029
 hybrids here in one 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.950
 device combines three 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.489
 devices this first 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.850
 DVR radar detector and gps then 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.050
 have it used first for fixing 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.640
 locations and naturally for 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.720
 camera definitions arrow by advance 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.160
 flooded base on a memory card 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.190
 here is such a box comes here 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.030
 posted a photo device 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.620
 Naturally model name 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.810
 information that he record video 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.760
 only hd format ie full hd to 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.280
 Unfortunately there is no set on this side 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.720
 characteristics of this model with this 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.680
 parties 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.240
 photos of the device itself and 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.810
 actually all let's see us 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:20.800
 There is a set in the set there is such 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:23.550
 Here is the fastener cable for mini usb for 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.550
 connect computer 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.560
 user's manual 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:39.200
 bear warranty card 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.909
 here we have advertising other models from 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.450
 Aleksand companies, that is, we are paper 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:48.610
 manufacturer did not stint information 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.200
 on the navigator another ad booklet 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.689
 a full set of advertising is offered to us 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.100
 information dad urban by the way one of 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.570
 these powerbank we have already detailed 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.360
 tested the model quite good you can 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.399
 see the test in our laboratory can 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.479
 whether 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.720
 let's interest this registrar 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.410
 let's take a look at the tests so before us 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.180
 model alexandr lrd 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.010
 there is also a car 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.290
 charger 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.549
 we have it here such a form in the cable 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.500
 long enough to allow 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.130
 hidden wiring on the side stand 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.840
 the car 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.310
 the remote device has such a button 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.480
 What is it useful for? 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.190
 need to turn off for example for a while 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.040
 DVR and you don't want 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.299
 constantly pull this charger out 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.060
 the connector is so small 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.220
 small such a bonus let's look at 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.450
 the recorder itself is performed on such 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.910
 case is sufficient 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.900
 massive due to the fact that the top 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.220
 parts we own 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.410
 DVR and at the bottom 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.239
 radar detector unlike most 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.690
 models which positions itself so 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.030
 hybrid of radar and dvr here 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.799
 really full radar which 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.000
 defines our cameras by radio and 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.680
 the waves that is to say it will separately mention 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.079
 what ranges does it support and 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.090
 naturally we have a so-called 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.940
 gps radar benefit of it certainly not 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.100
 so big but maybe cities like 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.890
 Moscow where cameras do not carry from place 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.549
 in place of some kind of benefit will be but here 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.350
 Kazan 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.170
 better still use full 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.269
 radar to not become the recipient of letters 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.910
 happiness and not get on big fines 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.709
 but in general of course it is better not to drive and so 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.590
 Here is such a class of housing here with 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.870
 2 and 4 inch tft sides 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.430
 here we have control buttons 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.160
 not very logical and you will need to 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.930
 get used to and most likely recommend 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.180
 all the same, study the excursion before 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.680
 start of use as you can see 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.019
 fastener allows you to turn 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.390
 video recorder 350 degrees that is 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.960
 if you need to remove a DPS officer 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.350
 just wrap the register 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.820
 on the glass and he takes off what we have 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.380
 here on optics despite the fact that 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.260
 the registrar would seem new to 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.070
 Unfortunately, his viewing angle is only 90 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.330
 degrees, that is, although of course enough for 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.220
 shooting and the opposite lane all the same 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.140
 I would like more results as we 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.820
 if you follow our tests could 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.660
 notice that the curtains of the DVRs 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.910
 now already possess 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.370
 viewing angle of 120 degrees here 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.340
 Unfortunately this is not here our blog from 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.480
 radar detector and one more minus 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.190
 given the radar while I'm right this moment 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.570
 touched 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.820
 register ai radar also with us 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.310
 supports regret about catching in 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.560
 around 180 degrees i.e. if the camera 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.360
 will beat you in the back about this and to 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.270
 Sorry not to get to know us exactly 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.000
 there are no sensors on the back side 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.290
 further here is our micro usb port mini usb 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.930
 and it connects to 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.270
 naturally charging and computer here 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.980
 micro sd card slot is all 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.020
 traditionally for these liksart and button 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.300
 reset for all time, it is not us 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.480
 needed and let's offer this 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.500
 recorder connect network now this 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.680
 did further we need to connect 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.060
 power of our memory card is installed 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.710
 while the recorder is connected let's 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.710
 let's see well now 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:08.520
 greeted and here we have a few 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.930
 modes and this is one of the advantages of this hell 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.460
 then so that you can switch that is 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.710
 between menus 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.630
 radar itself and sit on the record bye 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.570
 information is kept active 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.160
 radar detector select mode and not very 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.930
 enough descent of the gray screen after all 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.870
 for the amount of 6500 rubles may have been 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.030
 still put at least a sensor here and 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.310
 here naturally shooting itself goes shooting 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.810
 There is a farm not format hd 30 frames in 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.880
 give me a sec 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.720
 viewing angle of 90 degrees in the form of spelled 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.150
 avi format 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.250
 here an unusual move is possible for 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.590
 you will be useful video can not be called 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.750
 the best of us now 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.370
 how are the obscure features you now 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.440
 just it worked very well then 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.060
 we have a registrar is very 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.400
 often falsely trigger precisely on 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.380
 the arrow, that is, it can be disabled but 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.060
 This feature is, and judging by 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.700
 information which I studied and on 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.620
 forums and interrogated the owners of this 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.020
 devices we use the recorder already 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.330
 almost a month and only now are ready 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.100
 publish this test just after also 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:12.270
 notices false positives precisely on 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:12.270
 arrow on something which x-range 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:19.630
 I immediately connected the recorder to the satellite 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:23.080
 work is already underway so he determines them 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:26.550
 clip to k to good and laser range 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.810
 that is, actually as usual 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.640
 radar detector but the only one 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.770
 feature 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.740
 video examples can be viewed here 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.440
 link in the description for this video 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.900
 personal opinion still models hybrids 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.060
 has its own specific buyer 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.920
 wanting to save when you buy two 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.720
 devices at current cost 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.090
 the expediency of buying it 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.620
 radar detector is a big question all 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.390
 you can buy two for this price 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.090
 separate full devices and 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.260
 get better recording quality 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.020
 the only thing that will take more 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.450
 places on your windshield need this 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.880
 whether or not you decide of course but in 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:07.810
 hybrid plan after all the model 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.400
 still have their drawbacks and completely 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.470
 You combine perfect devices right away. 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.310
 functional somewhat still qi life 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:16.840
 No, but I think the streets are all prerequisites 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.000
 I thought to wake up all the wishes after 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.610
 this model and the future we see more 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.200
 perfect model for such here 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:27.600
 turned out the registrar lexand lr 200 

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.400
 content answer all your questions on 

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:35.190
 This model is signed by our channel. 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.190
 likes everyone thank you all bye
