00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.350
 hello to all dear viewers with you 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.450
 Yevgeha welcome to maykravt 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.820
 six months ago I did a review on the temple in 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.290
 jungle and today made a review on the temple 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.250
 in the desert but why not review 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.949
 to the temple in the desert means I am in the description 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.960
 leave the world sid that's it that's why you 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.609
 You can go see this temple yourself 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.140
 and there is a review and so the temples are in 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.869
 mostly sandstone yes only 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.910
 priest they are temple may be 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.370
 covered in sand like in this case 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.360
 may not be covered with sand 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.899
 and at the temple the temple looks like a pyramid but with 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.780
 two turrets with orange wool 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:51.870
 Here is the entrance to the crane itself , it is filled up of course 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.500
 now we enter the temple we have passages 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.890
 these towers 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.879
 we can climb the roof go in 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.109
 inside the pyramid fall in here in the center 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.699
 the room inside the temple is nothing 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.479
 noteworthy but used here 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:10.409
 Now blocks generally teksturpake the blocks 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:12.240
 conventional scrapers here it is we have a block 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.700
 sandstone is enlightenment to this unit 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.930
 sandstone is the trick of this temple in that 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.189
 that there can be the first one must be 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.540
 orange wool and still have their own 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.450
 trap she's right here we are 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.280
 we break this one block of blue wool and 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.100
 see below the pressure plate and four 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.320
 chest 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.640
 when when we fall down best 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.750
 I recommend to go down as follows 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.360
 that is, we take and roll in this 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.640
 case is a cry in creativity because I donâ€™t 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.579
 I want to spend your and my time to 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.509
 digging an ordinary pickax we are with you when 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.509
 down here down here 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.830
 we break this plate we break all the blocks 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.650
 who are here are here 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.100
 dynamite first we take away all of 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.440
 chests 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.050
 chests can lie either iron or 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.940
 gold or bone or rotten flesh and 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.940
 mirolds also lie and can diamond than 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.120
 come across but very rarely 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.800
 here and the world for emeralds lie and below 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.700
 can pick up 9 pieces tnt 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.010
 Here basically I consider this temple 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.840
 noteworthy only this and more 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.140
 does he have it not remarkable 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.580
 that is, before it has its own secret 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.950
 small can be produced 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:37.020
 archaeological excavations can be it 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:40.170
 something to adapt and for something well 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.670
 can get hold of your imagination and 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.820
 Now I will show you one wonderful 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.120
 chip and look please on f3 you 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.570
 can you see my world 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.570
 not visible here 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:59.410
 Well, look here, I'll leave the description seed 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:02.020
 first you create a world with a big type 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.470
 biomes you will create a world you will appear 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:09.810
 right in front of this temple here somewhere 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:12.490
 Here are the coordinates of the temple - 210 and 80 plus 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.710
 what if we do without large volumes 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.610
 then in this place will be the following I already 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:21.820
 created before the world then at this place 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.340
 there will be this temple temple in the jungle 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:28.630
 there are the same coordinates practically 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.420
 the same ones here but the jungle temple 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.270
 that is, you can choose to say so 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.720
 what do you like and I understand for myself 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.190
 a chip that big biomes is a world of it 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.110
 the same they are just generated 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.940
 a little bit different so well about the temple in 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.570
