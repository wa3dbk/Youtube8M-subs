to<00:00:25.090> present<00:00:25.270> my<00:00:25.570> second<00:00:25.960> project<00:00:26.140> which<00:00:26.890> is

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
to present my second project which is

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.920 
to present my second project which is
about<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.490> family<00:00:27.970> relationships<00:00:28.660> and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.540 

so<00:00:43.510> this<00:00:43.810> is<00:00:43.990> the<00:00:44.200> first<00:00:44.440> part<00:00:44.860> of<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.310> project

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
so this is the first part of the project

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.330 
so this is the first part of the project
is<00:00:46.330> called<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.960> general<00:00:47.590> issues<00:00:48.100> of

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
is called the general issues of

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.580 
is called the general issues of
generation<00:00:48.940> gap<00:00:48.970> I'm<00:00:49.660> going<00:00:50.200> to<00:00:50.350> talk<00:00:50.560> about

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
generation gap I'm going to talk about

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.000 
generation gap I'm going to talk about
some<00:00:51.160> facts<00:00:51.490> and<00:00:51.850> their<00:00:52.150> consequences<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.800> the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
some facts and their consequences so the

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.430 
some facts and their consequences so the
first<00:00:54.280> fact<00:00:54.640> is<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:55.180> difference<00:00:55.660> of<00:00:55.900> ages

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
first fact is the difference of ages

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.460 
first fact is the difference of ages
between<00:00:57.100> family<00:00:57.730> members<00:00:57.810> this<00:00:58.810> has<00:00:59.110> an

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
between family members this has an

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.400 
between family members this has an
effect<00:00:59.710> on<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.300> relations<00:01:01.300> like<00:01:01.960> children

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
effect on the relations like children

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.760 
effect on the relations like children
and<00:01:02.620> parents<00:01:03.160> don't<00:01:03.610> share<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:04.690> same<00:01:04.770> likings

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
and parents don't share the same likings

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.640 
and parents don't share the same likings
same<00:01:06.250> activities<00:01:06.880> same<00:01:07.240> tastes<00:01:07.810> they<00:01:08.410> don't

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
same activities same tastes they don't

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.430 
same activities same tastes they don't
have<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.040> same<00:01:09.310> way<00:01:09.550> of<00:01:09.580> thinking<00:01:10.440> parents

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
have the same way of thinking parents

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.070 
have the same way of thinking parents
are<00:01:11.590> more<00:01:11.890> mature<00:01:12.280> which<00:01:13.150> can<00:01:13.480> cause<00:01:13.750> some

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
are more mature which can cause some

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.270 
are more mature which can cause some
problems<00:01:14.619> like<00:01:14.800> arguments<00:01:15.610> fights<00:01:15.820> etc

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
problems like arguments fights etc

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.740 
problems like arguments fights etc
second<00:01:18.280> is<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.640> fact<00:01:18.850> that<00:01:19.030> parents<00:01:19.570> were

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
second is the fact that parents were

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.240 
second is the fact that parents were
raised<00:01:20.020> in<00:01:20.260> a<00:01:20.410> different<00:01:20.830> way

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
raised in a different way

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.969 
raised in a different way
for<00:01:21.700> example<00:01:22.119> some<00:01:22.330> parents<00:01:22.900> were<00:01:23.170> raised<00:01:23.710> in

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
for example some parents were raised in

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.859 
for example some parents were raised in
a<00:01:24.100> very<00:01:24.130> strict<00:01:24.670> way<00:01:24.790> there<00:01:25.540> are<00:01:25.660> sometimes

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
a very strict way there are sometimes

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.500 
a very strict way there are sometimes
beaten<00:01:26.500> by<00:01:26.710> their<00:01:26.920> parents<00:01:27.369> so<00:01:27.940> what<00:01:28.300> they<00:01:28.450> do

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
beaten by their parents so what they do

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.570 
beaten by their parents so what they do
is<00:01:28.930> that<00:01:28.960> they<00:01:29.200> want<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:29.590> be<00:01:29.800> more<00:01:30.070> lenient

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
is that they want to be more lenient

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.270 
is that they want to be more lenient
with<00:01:30.700> their<00:01:31.090> children<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:31.810> that's<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:33.040> main

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
with their children and that's the main

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.960 
with their children and that's the main
cause<00:01:33.640> of<00:01:33.990> spoiled<00:01:34.990> children<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:36.310> third<00:01:36.610> fact

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
cause of spoiled children the third fact

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.910 
cause of spoiled children the third fact
is<00:01:37.150> that<00:01:37.390> parents<00:01:37.869> have<00:01:38.050> responsibilities

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
is that parents have responsibilities

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.230 
is that parents have responsibilities
towards<00:01:39.430> their<00:01:39.640> kids

towards their kids

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.880 
towards their kids
whereas<00:01:40.840> kids<00:01:41.140> don't<00:01:41.470> have<00:01:41.680> any

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
whereas kids don't have any

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.400 
whereas kids don't have any
responsibilities<00:01:42.759> which<00:01:43.570> makes<00:01:43.869> parents

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
responsibilities which makes parents

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.250 
responsibilities which makes parents

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
sometimes too much conservative and that

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.220 
sometimes too much conservative and that
noise<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:48.160> kids<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.640> lot<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.570> fourth<00:01:49.900> and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
noise the kids a lot and the fourth and

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.620 
noise the kids a lot and the fourth and
final<00:01:50.470> fact<00:01:50.920> is<00:01:51.130> that<00:01:51.730> children<00:01:52.120> start

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
final fact is that children start

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.870 
final fact is that children start
building<00:01:53.080> their<00:01:53.280> personalities<00:01:54.280> at<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.700> age

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
building their personalities at the age

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.720 
building their personalities at the age
of<00:01:55.120> let's<00:01:55.840> say<00:01:56.170> 6<00:01:56.500> they<00:01:57.130> hate<00:01:57.370> that<00:01:57.400> the

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
of let's say 6 they hate that the

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.850 
of let's say 6 they hate that the
parents<00:01:58.150> don't<00:01:58.390> allow<00:01:58.600> them<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.870> do<00:01:59.320> some<00:01:59.620> kind

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
parents don't allow them to do some kind

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.030 
parents don't allow them to do some kind
of<00:01:59.950> activities<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.790> they<00:02:01.390> don't<00:02:01.800> they<00:02:02.800> don't

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
of activities and they don't they don't

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.190 
of activities and they don't they don't
like<00:02:03.250> how<00:02:03.490> much<00:02:03.670> parents<00:02:04.210> are<00:02:04.450> caring<00:02:04.960> for

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
like how much parents are caring for

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.260 
like how much parents are caring for
them<00:02:05.380> that's<00:02:05.980> because<00:02:06.430> they<00:02:06.670> usually<00:02:06.909> want<00:02:07.180> to

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
them that's because they usually want to

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.940 
them that's because they usually want to
do<00:02:07.420> things<00:02:07.690> alone<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.550> these<00:02:10.450> were<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:11.470> the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
do things alone so these were the the

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.479 
do things alone so these were the the
main<00:02:12.280> issues<00:02:12.790> of<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.739> generation<00:02:14.739> gap<00:02:14.890> and

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
main issues of the generation gap and

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:33.479 
main issues of the generation gap and
now<00:02:15.820> let's<00:02:16.360> move<00:02:16.540> on<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.989> next<00:02:17.230> part

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.070 

now<00:02:34.489> for<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.909> evolution<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.540> family

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
now for the evolution of family

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.110 
now for the evolution of family
relationships<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.340> period<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.970> evolution

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
relationships the period of evolution

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.020 
relationships the period of evolution
mainly<00:02:38.989> started<00:02:39.440> thirty<00:02:39.680> years<00:02:40.069> ago<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.519> this

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
mainly started thirty years ago and this

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.300 
mainly started thirty years ago and this
thirty<00:02:41.420> years<00:02:41.780> period<00:02:42.409> is<00:02:42.590> divided<00:02:43.159> into

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
thirty years period is divided into

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.240 
thirty years period is divided into
three<00:02:43.670> parts<00:02:43.700> part<00:02:44.690> one<00:02:44.989> is<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.440> first<00:02:45.799> ten

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
three parts part one is the first ten

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.059 
three parts part one is the first ten
years<00:02:46.280> of<00:02:46.909> the<00:02:47.030> thirty<00:02:47.360> years<00:02:47.690> period<00:02:48.379> back

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
years of the thirty years period back

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.280 
years of the thirty years period back
then<00:02:49.340> families<00:02:49.879> were<00:02:50.090> really<00:02:50.390> big<00:02:50.629> with<00:02:51.170> an

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
then families were really big with an

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.069 
then families were really big with an
average<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.860> five<00:02:52.159> children<00:02:52.670> per<00:02:53.000> family<00:02:53.079> so

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079
