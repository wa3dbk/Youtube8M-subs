every other day throughout the entire

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.390 
every other day throughout the entire
Olympics<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:09.840> we're<00:02:09.989> training<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.590> mean<00:02:11.250> we're

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
Olympics so we're training I mean we're

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.949 
Olympics so we're training I mean we're
playing<00:02:11.670> at<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.910> two<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.330> half<00:02:12.480> week<00:02:12.720> almost

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
playing at a two and a half week almost

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.850 
playing at a two and a half week almost
three<00:02:13.260> week<00:02:13.440> period

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
three week period

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.200 
three week period
so<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.100> can<00:02:14.340> actually<00:02:14.370> get<00:02:14.700> out<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.970> shape

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
so you can actually get out of shape

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.820 
so you can actually get out of shape
during<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.600> time<00:02:15.840> because<00:02:16.020> some<00:02:16.410> guys<00:02:16.560> maybe

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
during this time because some guys maybe

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.070 
during this time because some guys maybe
only<00:02:17.070> play<00:02:17.340> maybe<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.090> quarter<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.540> game<00:02:18.780> and

only play maybe a quarter a game and

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.540 
only play maybe a quarter a game and
that's<00:02:19.320> not<00:02:19.470> enough<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:19.920> mean<00:02:20.070> we<00:02:20.130> only<00:02:20.160> get<00:02:20.430> an

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
that's not enough I mean we only get an

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.910 
that's not enough I mean we only get an
hour<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.850> pool<00:02:21.120> time<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.390> day<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.020> water<00:02:22.230> so

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
hour of pool time a day in the water so

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.440 
hour of pool time a day in the water so

24<00:02:24.840> hour<00:02:24.930> fitness<00:02:25.110> has<00:02:25.470> how<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.740> worked<00:02:25.980> with

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
24 hour fitness has how it worked with

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.950 
24 hour fitness has how it worked with
the<00:02:26.220> usoc<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.910> making<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:27.720> high-performance

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
the usoc of making this high-performance

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.630 
the usoc of making this high-performance
training<00:02:28.650> center<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> place<00:02:29.130> where<00:02:29.280> we<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.490> go

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
training center a place where we can go

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.490 
training center a place where we can go
and<00:02:29.670> work<00:02:30.030> hard<00:02:30.420> for<00:02:30.660> two<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.930> half<00:02:31.080> hours
