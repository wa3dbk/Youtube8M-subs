about two to three minutes so let's go

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.700 
about two to three minutes so let's go
through<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> dots<00:00:39.180> we'll<00:00:39.390> be<00:00:39.480> using<00:00:39.710> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
through the dots we'll be using the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.560 
through the dots we'll be using the
highest<00:00:41.129> damage<00:00:41.399> dot<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.300> is

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
highest damage dot that you have is

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.869 
highest damage dot that you have is
vampiric<00:00:43.020> touch<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.620> you'll<00:00:44.520> want<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> keep

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
vampiric touch and you'll want to keep

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.600 
vampiric touch and you'll want to keep
that<00:00:45.030> up<00:00:45.270> as<00:00:45.390> much<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:46.340> you<00:00:47.340> want<00:00:47.520> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
that up as much as you can you want to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.810 
that up as much as you can you want to
recast<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.390> essentially<00:00:49.050> when<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.640> down<00:00:50.640> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
recast it essentially when it's down to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.810 
recast it essentially when it's down to
about<00:00:50.969> one<00:00:51.180> second<00:00:51.510> left<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.989> target<00:00:52.820> then

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
about one second left on the target then

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.430 
about one second left on the target then
there's<00:00:54.030> devouring<00:00:54.420> plague<00:00:54.539> which<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.140> believe

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
there's devouring plague which I believe

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.350 
there's devouring plague which I believe
is<00:00:55.680> actually<00:00:55.829> more<00:00:56.219> damage<00:00:56.520> than<00:00:56.760> shadow<00:00:57.210> word

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
is actually more damage than shadow word

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.049 
is actually more damage than shadow word
pain<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.960> could<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.260> wrong<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.059> then

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
pain but it could be wrong and then

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.450 
pain but it could be wrong and then
there's<00:01:00.420> shadow<00:01:00.660> word<00:01:00.840> pain<00:01:01.129> these<00:01:02.129> are<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
there's shadow word pain these are the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.889 
there's shadow word pain these are the
three<00:01:02.670> dots<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:03.690> worry

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
three dots that you have to really worry

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.770 
three dots that you have to really worry
about<00:01:04.129> shadow<00:01:05.129> word<00:01:05.280> pain<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.670> actually<00:01:05.820> not

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
about shadow word pain is actually not

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.859 
about shadow word pain is actually not
really<00:01:07.080> something<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:08.869> concern

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
really something that is a concern

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.270 
really something that is a concern
because<00:01:10.350> if<00:01:10.470> you're<00:01:10.590> mind<00:01:10.830> playing<00:01:11.070> that

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
because if you're mind playing that

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.740 
because if you're mind playing that
target<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> will<00:01:11.970> automatically<00:01:12.390> refresh

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
target it will automatically refresh

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.999 
target it will automatically refresh
shadow<00:01:13.590> work<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:15.259> so<00:01:16.259> after<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> three<00:01:16.860> dots

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
shadow work in so after the three dots

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.010 
shadow work in so after the three dots
are<00:01:17.220> applied<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.759> want<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.150> mind<00:01:18.420> blast<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
are applied you want to mind blast and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.710 
are applied you want to mind blast and
then<00:01:19.680> basically<00:01:20.549> as<00:01:20.670> your<00:01:20.820> filler<00:01:21.090> spell<00:01:21.479> when

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
then basically as your filler spell when

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.039 
then basically as your filler spell when
everything<00:01:22.080> else<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.939> not<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.210> danger<00:01:24.900> of

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
everything else is not in danger of

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.350 
everything else is not in danger of
blowing<00:01:25.290> off<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:26.009> want<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.189> mind<00:01:26.400> play<00:01:26.640> mind

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
blowing off you want to mind play mind

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
blowing off you want to mind play mind
play<00:01:27.570> apply<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.080> slow<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> target<00:01:29.220> as

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
play apply is a slow to the target as

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.550 
play apply is a slow to the target as
well<00:01:29.790> as<00:01:30.180> reduces<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.810> cooldown<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.200> shadow

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
well as reduces the cooldown on shadow

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.090 
well as reduces the cooldown on shadow
fiend<00:01:31.860> which<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.280> one<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.520> your<00:01:32.610> DPS<00:01:33.000> cooldowns

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
fiend which is one of your DPS cooldowns

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.280 
fiend which is one of your DPS cooldowns
so<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.130> typical<00:01:35.369> fight<00:01:35.790> for<00:01:36.479> me<00:01:36.630> starts<00:01:36.990> off<00:01:37.140> by

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
so a typical fight for me starts off by

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.249 
so a typical fight for me starts off by
popping<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.710> volcanic<00:01:38.070> potion<00:01:38.990> then<00:01:39.990> putting

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
popping a volcanic potion then putting

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.679 
popping a volcanic potion then putting
up<00:01:40.439> vampiric<00:01:40.920> touch<00:01:40.950> followed<00:01:41.790> by<00:01:41.909> devouring

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
up vampiric touch followed by devouring

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.770 
up vampiric touch followed by devouring
plague<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.229> then<00:01:43.770> shadow<00:01:44.549> word<00:01:44.729> pain<00:01:45.000> at<00:01:45.570> this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
plague and then shadow word pain at this

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.740 
plague and then shadow word pain at this
point<00:01:46.049> I'll<00:01:46.229> usually<00:01:46.500> mind<00:01:47.340> blast<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.970> begin

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
point I'll usually mind blast and begin

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.620 
point I'll usually mind blast and begin
mind<00:01:49.020> playing<00:01:49.729> when<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.759> get<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.060> about<00:01:51.180> five

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
mind playing when I get to about five

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.749 
mind playing when I get to about five
stacks<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.140> evangelists<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.829> evangelism

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
stacks of evangelists that evangelism

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.179 
stacks of evangelists that evangelism
which<00:01:54.030> allows<00:01:54.299> me<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.600> use<00:01:54.950> archangel<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.070> its

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
which allows me to use archangel to its

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.300 
which allows me to use archangel to its
full<00:01:56.399> potential<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.060> will<00:01:57.899> use<00:01:58.140> archangel<00:01:58.740> like

shows my dots above the target now this
is<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:20.709> great<00:03:20.860> for<00:03:21.040> any<00:03:21.130> fight<00:03:21.340> where<00:03:21.580> you<00:03:21.670> have

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
roll dots on because it's easy enough

roll dots on because it's easy enough
with<00:03:26.500> two<00:03:26.739> targets<00:03:27.070> can<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.280> just<00:03:27.459> use<00:03:27.580> your

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
with two targets can you just use your

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.330 
with two targets can you just use your
focus<00:03:28.030> frame<00:03:28.209> but<00:03:28.690> free<00:03:29.050> or<00:03:29.140> more<00:03:29.320> you<00:03:30.040> want<00:03:30.280> to

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
focus frame but free or more you want to

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.970 
focus frame but free or more you want to
be<00:03:30.430> using<00:03:30.640> a<00:03:30.910> mod<00:03:31.450> like<00:03:31.480> coyote<00:03:32.170> plates<00:03:32.470> which

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
be using a mod like coyote plates which

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.110 
be using a mod like coyote plates which
will<00:03:33.220> show<00:03:33.550> you<00:03:33.870> exactly<00:03:34.870> what<00:03:35.880> dots<00:03:36.880> are

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
will show you exactly what dots are

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.960 
will show you exactly what dots are
being<00:03:37.300> held<00:03:37.510> on<00:03:37.630> what<00:03:38.140> targets<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:39.700> this<00:03:39.880> is

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
being held on what targets so this is

being held on what targets so this is

hole<00:04:22.610> pool<00:04:22.910> I<00:04:23.090> would<00:04:23.360> do<00:04:23.450> something<00:04:23.660> like<00:04:23.810> this

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
hole pool I would do something like this

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.980 
hole pool I would do something like this
I<00:04:24.380> would<00:04:24.620> start<00:04:25.040> casting<00:04:25.850> dots<00:04:26.600> on<00:04:26.840> that

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
I would start casting dots on that

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.340 
I would start casting dots on that
target<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:29.000> depending<00:04:29.330> up<00:04:29.390> on<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:29.630> priority

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
target and depending up on the priority

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.870 
target and depending up on the priority
of<00:04:30.380> killing<00:04:30.890> it<00:04:31.010> or<00:04:31.190> if<00:04:31.310> it's<00:04:31.430> just<00:04:31.610> something

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
of killing it or if it's just something

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.340 
of killing it or if it's just something
that<00:04:31.910> has<00:04:32.180> to<00:04:32.330> die<00:04:32.480> eventually<00:04:32.630> but<00:04:33.110> we're<00:04:33.260> not

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
that has to die eventually but we're not

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.300 
that has to die eventually but we're not
focusing<00:04:33.830> on<00:04:33.980> it

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
focusing on it

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.210 
focusing on it
for<00:04:34.550> instance<00:04:35.110> throw<00:04:36.110> a<00:04:36.140> lien<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:36.710> valley<00:04:37.010> ona

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
for instance throw a lien and valley ona

and<00:04:37.550> dashing<00:04:38.300> of<00:04:38.360> Twilight<00:04:38.720> is<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.770> good

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
and dashing of Twilight is a good

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.620 
and dashing of Twilight is a good
example<00:04:40.040> of<00:04:40.340> losses<00:04:40.700> in<00:04:40.730> which<00:04:40.970> I<00:04:41.150> would<00:04:41.390> use

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
example of losses in which I would use

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.020 
example of losses in which I would use
focus<00:04:42.590> frames<00:04:42.950> because<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:43.640> can<00:04:43.760> keep<00:04:43.880> the

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
focus frames because you can keep the

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.450 
focus frames because you can keep the
dots<00:04:44.210> on<00:04:44.420> both<00:04:44.750> both<00:04:45.590> dragons<00:04:45.920> pretty<00:04:46.310> much

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
dots on both both dragons pretty much

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.350 
dots on both both dragons pretty much
the<00:04:46.610> entire<00:04:46.850> fight<00:04:48.490> at<00:04:49.490> lower<00:04:49.760> gear<00:04:50.060> levels

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
the entire fight at lower gear levels

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.780 
the entire fight at lower gear levels
you<00:04:50.720> may<00:04:50.870> want<00:04:51.080> to<00:04:51.170> include<00:04:51.920> shadow<00:04:52.340> or<00:04:52.520> death

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
you may want to include shadow or death

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.250 
you may want to include shadow or death
in<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.060> rotation<00:04:53.600> right<00:04:53.750> before<00:04:54.080> you<00:04:54.170> would

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
in the rotation right before you would

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.230 
in the rotation right before you would
mind<00:04:54.500> play<00:04:54.710> because<00:04:55.580> when<00:04:55.730> you<00:04:55.820> shadow<00:04:56.060> or

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
mind play because when you shadow or

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.870 
mind play because when you shadow or
death<00:04:56.480> you'll<00:04:57.260> see<00:04:57.440> that<00:04:57.560> I<00:04:57.620> gain<00:04:57.890> ten<00:04:58.580> percent

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
death you'll see that I gain ten percent

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.840 
death you'll see that I gain ten percent
of<00:04:58.940> my<00:04:58.970> mana<00:04:59.240> back<00:04:59.500> as<00:05:00.500> soon<00:05:00.650> as<00:05:00.740> I<00:05:00.830> cast<00:05:01.010> it<00:05:01.220> so

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
of my mana back as soon as I cast it so

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.250 
of my mana back as soon as I cast it so
what<00:05:02.060> you<00:05:02.090> would<00:05:02.270> do<00:05:02.390> is<00:05:02.510> you'd<00:05:02.630> put<00:05:02.660> dots<00:05:03.020> up

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
what you would do is you'd put dots up

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.590 
what you would do is you'd put dots up
and<00:05:03.410> then<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:04.760> would<00:05:04.910> be<00:05:05.060> off<00:05:05.180> pull<00:05:05.420> them

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
and then it would be off pull them

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.900 
and then it would be off pull them
initially<00:05:06.530> you<00:05:06.800> would<00:05:06.920> use<00:05:07.040> shadow<00:05:07.280> or<00:05:07.490> death

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
initially you would use shadow or death

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.390 
initially you would use shadow or death
to<00:05:08.330> get<00:05:08.450> that<00:05:08.600> mana<00:05:08.810> back

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
to get that mana back

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.380 
to get that mana back
you<00:05:10.400> shouldn't<00:05:10.700> really<00:05:10.790> have<00:05:10.970> too<00:05:11.240> much

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
you shouldn't really have too much

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.760 
you shouldn't really have too much
problem<00:05:11.840> in<00:05:11.930> raids<00:05:12.170> because<00:05:12.560> you're<00:05:12.680> getting

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
problem in raids because you're getting

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.130 
problem in raids because you're getting
replenishment<00:05:13.550> and<00:05:13.790> you<00:05:14.720> have<00:05:14.840> all<00:05:14.990> those

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
replenishment and you have all those

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.390 
replenishment and you have all those
sorts<00:05:15.530> of<00:05:15.620> buffs<00:05:15.920> and<00:05:17.860> your<00:05:18.860> your<00:05:19.160> shadow

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
sorts of buffs and your your shadow

fiend<00:05:19.610> will<00:05:19.730> be<00:05:19.820> off<00:05:19.940> cooldown<00:05:20.180> pretty

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
fiend will be off cooldown pretty

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.000 
fiend will be off cooldown pretty
frequently<00:05:21.320> because<00:05:21.590> every<00:05:21.770> time<00:05:21.890> you

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
frequently because every time you

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.320

already<00:05:23.630> it<00:05:24.290> reduces<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.920> cooldown<00:05:26.320> not

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
already it reduces the cooldown not

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.710 
already it reduces the cooldown not
significantly<00:05:27.950> but<00:05:28.220> enough<00:05:28.580> that<00:05:28.910> you<00:05:29.510> want
