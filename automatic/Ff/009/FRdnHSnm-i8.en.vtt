make an infinite water source and a
little<00:01:57.840> bit<00:01:57.930> about<00:01:58.110> these<00:01:58.320> frames<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.979> have

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
little bit about these frames I have

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.670 
little bit about these frames I have
around<00:01:59.579> here<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.420> first<00:02:00.630> off<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.140> my<00:02:01.380> fort

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
scrap iron and you know all that fun

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.830 
scrap iron and you know all that fun
stuff<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.100> make<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.370> bucket<00:02:27.760> get<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.660> water

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
stuff and make a bucket get the water

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.949 
stuff and make a bucket get the water
and<00:02:29.459> then<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:31.360> want<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.600> build<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.810> little

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
and then you want to build a little

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.180 
and then you want to build a little
frame<00:02:32.230> like<00:02:32.440> this<00:02:32.620> it's<00:02:32.890> five<00:02:33.370> on<00:02:33.790> each<00:02:34.270> side

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
frame like this it's five on each side

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.860 
frame like this it's five on each side
so<00:02:36.190> there's<00:02:36.489> enough<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.270> run<00:02:37.570> around<00:02:37.690> the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
so there's enough to run around the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.270 
so there's enough to run around the
center<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.200> we're<00:02:38.440> going<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.620> take<00:02:38.770> another

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
center and we're going to take another

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.030 
center and we're going to take another
set<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.700> frames<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.840> we're<00:02:41.470> going<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.680> stack

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
set of frames and we're going to stack

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.030 
set of frames and we're going to stack
them<00:02:42.190> too<00:02:42.370> high<00:02:42.660> one<00:02:43.660> here<00:02:43.870> one<00:02:44.080> here<00:02:44.680> this<00:02:44.980> is

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
them too high one here one here this is

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.680 
them too high one here one here this is
what<00:02:45.340> your<00:02:45.520> filing<00:02:45.940> should<00:02:46.150> look<00:02:46.270> like<00:02:46.300> for<00:02:46.600> an

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
what your filing should look like for an

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.199 
what your filing should look like for an
infinite<00:02:47.020> water<00:02:47.200> source<00:02:47.670> now<00:02:48.670> that<00:02:48.940> we<00:02:49.060> got

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
infinite water source now that we got

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.120 
infinite water source now that we got
this<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.810> want<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.050> take<00:02:50.140> your<00:02:50.230> bucket<00:02:50.620> only

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
this you want to take your bucket only

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.510 
this you want to take your bucket only
need<00:02:51.310> one<00:02:51.489> bucket<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.090> mind<00:02:52.300> you<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:53.430> put<00:02:54.430> it

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
need one bucket and mind you and put it

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.150 
need one bucket and mind you and put it
right<00:02:54.580> here<00:02:55.680> right<00:02:56.680> in<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:56.830> top<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.010> the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
right here right in the top of the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.040 
right here right in the top of the
center<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.640> it's<00:02:57.970> slow<00:02:58.330> like<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.720> lava<00:02:58.930> and

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
center and it's slow like the lava and

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.620 
center and it's slow like the lava and
minecraft<00:02:59.580> so<00:03:00.580> it<00:03:00.670> takes<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:00.970> couple<00:03:01.120> seconds

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
minecraft so it takes a couple seconds

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.920 
minecraft so it takes a couple seconds
but<00:03:02.670> that's<00:03:03.670> about<00:03:04.000> all<00:03:04.060> there<00:03:04.330> is<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.450> it<00:03:04.750> this

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
but that's about all there is to it this

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.140 
but that's about all there is to it this
little<00:03:05.080> aerial<00:03:05.440> fill-in<00:03:05.850> grab<00:03:06.850> from<00:03:07.030> the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
little aerial fill-in grab from the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.570 
little aerial fill-in grab from the
corner<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:07.660> there<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.620> go<00:03:08.830> look<00:03:09.040> how<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.340> look

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
corner and there you go look how it look

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.560 
corner and there you go look how it look
how<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:09.880> works<00:03:10.030> out

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
how that works out

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.380 
how that works out
nice<00:03:10.900> little<00:03:11.049> imminent<00:03:11.410> water<00:03:11.560> source<00:03:11.890> and

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
nice little imminent water source and

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.729 
nice little imminent water source and
the<00:03:13.390> reason<00:03:13.600> I'm<00:03:13.690> using<00:03:13.840> frames<00:03:14.230> is<00:03:14.410> because

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
the reason I'm using frames is because

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.350 
the reason I'm using frames is because
they<00:03:14.830> are<00:03:14.890> quick<00:03:15.100> to<00:03:15.160> use<00:03:15.430> or<00:03:15.730> them<00:03:15.910> all<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.180> do

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
they are quick to use or them all you do

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.690 
they are quick to use or them all you do
is<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:16.630> take<00:03:16.870> your<00:03:17.230> log<00:03:18.010> from<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.340> top<00:03:18.549> down

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
is you take your log from a top down

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.670 
is you take your log from a top down
tree<00:03:18.940> place<00:03:19.810> one<00:03:20.049> here<00:03:20.640> get<00:03:21.640> yourself<00:03:21.760> some

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
tree place one here get yourself some

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.990 
tree place one here get yourself some
wood<00:03:23.680> planks<00:03:24.930> put<00:03:25.930> your<00:03:26.049> wood<00:03:26.170> planks<00:03:26.470> here<00:03:27.000> go

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
wood planks put your wood planks here go

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.850 
wood planks put your wood planks here go
around<00:03:28.090> in<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.540> perfect<00:03:28.989> little<00:03:29.320> circle<00:03:29.739> like

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
around in a perfect little circle like

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.720 
around in a perfect little circle like
so<00:03:30.600> kind<00:03:31.600> of<00:03:31.630> like<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.780> square<00:03:32.140> a<00:03:32.519> circle<00:03:33.519> but

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
so kind of like a square a circle but

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.880 
so kind of like a square a circle but
and<00:03:34.480> you<00:03:34.750> craft<00:03:35.049> that<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:35.500> get<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.680> wood

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
and you craft that and you get a wood

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.320 
and you craft that and you get a wood
frame<00:03:37.140> from<00:03:38.140> that<00:03:38.350> wood<00:03:38.530> frame<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.910> take<00:03:40.150> it

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
frame from that wood frame you take it

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.150 
frame from that wood frame you take it
and<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:40.690> place<00:03:40.930> it<00:03:41.170> around<00:03:41.290> like<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:41.709> did<00:03:41.890> here

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
and you place it around like I did here

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.600 
and you place it around like I did here
and<00:03:43.080> this<00:03:44.080> is<00:03:44.230> an<00:03:44.350> upgradeable<00:03:44.890> frame<00:03:45.160> what

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
and this is an upgradeable frame what

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.280 
and this is an upgradeable frame what
you<00:03:45.730> do<00:03:45.850> is<00:03:46.060> with<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:46.450> pond<00:03:46.570> with<00:03:46.780> planks<00:03:47.200> in

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
you do is with the pond with planks in

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.740 
you do is with the pond with planks in
your<00:03:47.410> inventory<00:03:47.620> like<00:03:47.920> I<00:03:48.040> have<00:03:48.250> here<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:49.600> just

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
your inventory like I have here you just

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.509 
your inventory like I have here you just
right-click<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.440> frame<00:03:50.739> with<00:03:50.980> your<00:03:51.160> hammer

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
right-click the frame with your hammer

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.850 
right-click the frame with your hammer
and<00:03:51.790> you<00:03:52.329> start<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:52.840> upgrade<00:03:53.350> your<00:03:53.500> frames

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
and you start to upgrade your frames

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.960 
and you start to upgrade your frames
like<00:03:54.670> so<00:03:56.130> this<00:03:57.130> is<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.310> good<00:03:57.489> idea<00:03:57.519> if<00:03:57.880> you're

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
like so this is a good idea if you're

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.310 
like so this is a good idea if you're
just<00:03:58.150> trying<00:03:58.360> to<00:03:58.390> build<00:03:58.570> a<00:03:58.630> quick<00:03:58.810> base<00:03:59.079> and

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
just trying to build a quick base and

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.840 
just trying to build a quick base and
then<00:03:59.410> you<00:03:59.500> want<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.739> you<00:04:00.250> know<00:04:00.370> add<00:04:00.579> to<00:04:00.760> it

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
then you want to you know add to it

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.900 
then you want to you know add to it
later<00:04:01.030> on<00:04:01.120> in<00:04:01.329> the<00:04:01.420> future

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
later on in the future

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.880 
later on in the future
I<00:04:02.940> know<00:04:03.360> these<00:04:03.810> are<00:04:03.870> upgradeable<00:04:04.500> even<00:04:04.650> more

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
I know these are upgradeable even more

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.150 
I know these are upgradeable even more
if<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.100> have<00:04:05.280> like<00:04:05.490> scraps<00:04:05.970> or<00:04:06.240> whatever<00:04:06.600> like

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
if you have like scraps or whatever like

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.110 
if you have like scraps or whatever like
it<00:04:08.160> keeps<00:04:08.340> eating<00:04:08.460> away<00:04:08.580> at<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.850> wood<00:04:08.970> at

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
it keeps eating away at the wood at

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.370 
it keeps eating away at the wood at
first<00:04:09.330> but<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:09.600> think<00:04:09.810> if<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.020> have<00:04:10.110> scrap

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
first but I think if you have scrap

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.330 
first but I think if you have scrap
metal<00:04:10.620> or<00:04:10.680> something<00:04:10.860> like<00:04:10.920> that<00:04:11.130> you<00:04:11.220> can

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
metal or something like that you can

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.150 
metal or something like that you can
upgrade<00:04:11.460> it<00:04:11.640> more<00:04:12.020> but<00:04:13.020> yeah<00:04:13.710> that's<00:04:13.920> how<00:04:14.130> easy

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
upgrade it more but yeah that's how easy

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.930 
upgrade it more but yeah that's how easy
it<00:04:14.580> is<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:15.000> start<00:04:15.750> off<00:04:16.040> if<00:04:17.040> you<00:04:17.190> need<00:04:17.400> water<00:04:17.580> for

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
it is to start off if you need water for

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.370 
it is to start off if you need water for
whatnot<00:04:18.330> but<00:04:19.340> that's<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.780> tada

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
whatnot but that's that tada

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.560 
whatnot but that's that tada
and<00:04:22.470> over<00:04:23.190> here<00:04:23.400> I<00:04:23.430> have<00:04:23.550> my<00:04:23.730> farm<00:04:24.120> going<00:04:24.360> with
