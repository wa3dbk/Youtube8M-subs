00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.880
Before coming here, I researched various agencies and found the Wice in a search engine.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.640
I joined this community and began to ask
how it was all the service.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.160
And they also have an office
not only here, as in SÃ£o Paulo.

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:26.580
So I decided to go there to be checking
all the positives and negatives.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.200
And there was that they gave me confidence.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:38.560
They offered a whole support, since the visa issue, employment, Wice offers to us.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:46.160
What I asked them is that they offered me the best school in a matter of value for money.

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:52.141
Many people search me for an affordable package without sacrificing quality.

00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:54.540
Is it possible? I say yes.

00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:56.462
And now we will know the Academic Bridge.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.420
Wice
Leading expert on exchanges in Ireland

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.920
Subscribe to our channel

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.700
My class has 15 students, I believe.
Teachers are there the whole time.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.200
If you need help, they help you. If you have a question, just ask them to explain.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.340
In addition to explaining in English, he too knows the history, not only in Ireland but in Europe. 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.400
Then he uses several examples of things that have happened here to tell us.

00:01:51.401 --> 00:01:59.681
Besides training English, we get somewhat
more culturally rich, right?

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.420
So in the first part we have 'listen in vocabulary'.
It is a more grammar part.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.740
And after the brake we do some activities.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.500
Come the speaking and we talk
with the students of the class.

00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:50.561
Here at school I have colleagues from Mexico, Venezuela, Korea, Spain, France.

00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:54.401
There are people who use the notebook,
some people use the book.

00:02:54.402 --> 00:02:58.460
And teachers also give copies to you,
homework and you're always there,

00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:01.461
you have stuff all the time.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.920
And it has a monthly calendar of activities
that the school offers,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.920
a kind of extra activity with students like
walking in parks, museums, other cities.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.140
School staff also offer a lot
to help the students.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.120
There are three periods: 8 am to 11 am, 11 am to 2 pm and 3 pm to 6 pm.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.500
The school structure here is good.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.880
It has a kitchen that there are people
who eat lunch here,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:01.580
a library that we can relax, read, watch movies
and can study too.

00:04:01.581 --> 00:04:07.601
It also has wi-fi in the whole school.
We will practically living here.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.400
The school's location is very central and close to everything, 10 minutes or less from Spire,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.160
which is a reference point,
talking about the center.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.640
We have the market on the street, has shopping, here we have the Dublin Bike, which is near the school,

00:04:24.642 --> 00:04:26.602
has the Luas that we can use.

00:04:26.602 --> 00:04:30.300
It is very close to my house.
So I do not spent with the bus.

00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:33.581
I've been walking and I spend seven minutes.

00:04:33.582 --> 00:04:36.182
Sometimes I wake up delayed
and I get time yet.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.640
Today I see the need to do an exchange
in search of learning

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.300
not only the language
but also as personal growth.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.400
Because I think the experience of living abroad
matures you very much.
