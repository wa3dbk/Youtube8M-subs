00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.010
 know that there are people who have had worse 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.840
 but 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.120
 and 100000 credit are very far from being 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.150
 reimbursed is currently and that makes 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.150
 badly it hurts a lot badly
