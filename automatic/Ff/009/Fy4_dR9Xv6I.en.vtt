00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.000
 complicated that before we have been to our 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.820
 king as you probably know and 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.780
 it was really a killing and 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.070
 I'm back 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.619
 I am clearly not at las vegas 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.619

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.470
 healthy up so at I'm like I 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.789
 said i'm back in montreal and 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.650
 the laziness of talking for 14 years 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.120
 okay at this twenty days I'm 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.079
 on the road I'm trying to 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.700
 to make blogs etc 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.550
 I 'm coming back I can not wait to 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.809
 play arches resume rust ago 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.070
 so much stuff I missed I had 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.899
 look forward to returning to the gaming 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.879
 go back to play and that's so we're not going 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.340
 to have had to stay too long but has 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.579
 grosso merdo what has happened is when we 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.129
 was three tries but huge 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.960
 exactly as I imagined it is a 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.809
 dream for me dallas on August 3rd where you 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.879
 do I adore the 3 and it is the fact of there 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.800
 to have been that it was such a good 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.879
 year as many new games etc 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.070
 it's just grandiose that you 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.950
 to show some pictures it was just 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.810
 awesome but eventually has the end of 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.010
 the e3 actually I got sick I 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.299
 caught a little flu 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.100
 I told myself I think it's a 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.740
 sign it's time for me to come back 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.170
 and Montreal has spent 20 days and where I 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.640
 do not make me do too much 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.560
 to consider ourselves lucky we will take our 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.080
 Clicks do not slap back to the house 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.729
 so that's been three days since I 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.650
 I'm surprised it's a little sick I 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.299
 not too moved from the 10/01 it feels good 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.540
 to be back from just sleeping 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.820
 all day and so it's 7.3 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.860
 as I say was really great 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.049
 I have a lot of pictures to show you but 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.790
 globally already my first 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.570
 impressions is that the living room was 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.189
 really huge 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.320
 there were several there were two 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.240
 young adults there was there there yeah 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.450
 it was the fall I think west and south 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.979
 is there was pretty much every box 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.079
 video games that we can imagine 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.610
 from the largest to the smallest 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.469
 it was impressive had traits 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.840
 their debt by all we could test 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.670
 demos I could go to test mirror's edge 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.380
 to mirror's edge that what I wanted 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.110
 test the fact of having taken it in hand 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.580
 said to have played and it was just sublime 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.289
 we could also try to be more 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.060
 accessible pfff it's something that never 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.190
 well because 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.849
 fan of flying the new steering wheel 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.200
 logitech g9 120 i think about forza that 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.220
 I never agreed, but it was 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.310
 cool because it is a setup 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.500
 sick and or the chair that moves them 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.180
 three screens 50 billion push 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.470
 everything is actually I could you in 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.550
 talk for an hour and a half that's 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.970
 for that I'm doing 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.980
 quick 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.390
 not because I'm in a hurry up that I 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.769
 do not have the time it's just that 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.300
 would really take just too much time 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.890
 to talk to you all this it would take to 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.450
 less an hour or an hour or two 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.800
 hours to talk to you all that so I 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.269
 will do it live simply one of 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.040
 these 4 where I will maybe make a video 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.239
 briefings sitting just not a thing 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.950
 that I can bring in ten or 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.299
 fifteen or even 20 minutes of videos I 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.709
 could you sloppy tasty star wars 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.390
 was like that it was like that etc 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.730
 but it should really have happened 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.030
 hour or two at this root once I 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.239
 say it 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.040
 for all you summarize so I 'll do 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.390
 probably another video debrief etc 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.590
 I'm going to talk a little bit more about 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.819
 journey a lot of people have put me 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.440
 a lot of questions I think that's what 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.840
 interested a lot of people it was at 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.950
 road trip level 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.360
 what is there to do that this case does not 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.599
 not do how much it cost and that's 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.880
 keep the little north fruit there hello 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.340
 Hello how are you 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.090
 they come to wake up a young 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.410
 monitor 1 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.940
 there are also a lot of people who 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.220
 asked me if we had been sponsored 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.870
 for the 3 for the purpose we went with 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.720
 our own ways for the whole trip 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.970
 and or neck at this no worse because 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.769
 we could test just about anything 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.280
 that there was at e3 without too much 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.620
 restrictions 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.850
 and then to be worse besides being 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.859
 sponsored I mean it allows 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.280
 to have exclusive access to different games 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.150
 etc. 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.489
 maybe we'll do it year 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.720
 next we'll go with a box with who 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.069
 will interest us although there will be 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.260
 games that will interest us for the 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.700
 next E3 we'll see it was not 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.220
 sponsored by an application 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.209
 who followed us all the way 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.220
 who followed me personally all through 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.590
 along the trip I used it's 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.480
 is frantic it is by chance because 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.769
 that it's to be partner twitch is 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.660
 an application as I said that 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.799
 I personally use I see too much 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.450
 complicated I think to tell you about it 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.609
 for two hours is very simple one 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.310
 is actually a personal test for 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.780
 see where we are physically and after 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.160
 it gives us a program 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.630
 personal coach training 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.269
 dependent on our performance 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.700
 personal to be able to train 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.989
 everyday 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.370
 you do not know by week 4 times by 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.359
 week three a week actually this is 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.139
 you who choose 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.770
 what will be your pace and 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.110
 especially liked this application 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.130
 because as a gamer I have 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.460
 found actually a big step 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.800
 thing 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.480
 the shot apart play a lot played 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.889
 play the stream make videos etc 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.419
 and then every time it's time 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.800
 to sleep I'm in the book I 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.610
 tell me it should be like them 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.720
 start exercising 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.150
 I would have to start training 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.260
 and that's only where I think about 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.510
 to train is when I resume 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.979
 sleep but the app is cool 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.120
 precisely because he refuses unless 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.560
 to have two gyms there is no 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.430
 need to have material and not 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.680
 need to have spaces 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.450
 you launch the application registration 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.320
 is free can try it 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.210
 exercises etc 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.860
 if you are motivated if you are hot 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.880
 to practice do not hesitate to you 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.710
 enter the link in the description 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.940
 could follow me on 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.600
 the app to see the exercises 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.580
 that I do etc 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.860
 and then we will draw a name of 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.320
 coach for someone randomly 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.960
 so that's like I said ah I 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.919
