00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
once again she doesn't want a big giant

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.240 
once again she doesn't want a big giant
tree<00:01:22.050> and<00:01:22.230> she's<00:01:22.350> always<00:01:22.740> kept<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> like<00:01:23.220> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
tree and she's always kept it like a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.580 
tree and she's always kept it like a
bush<00:01:23.550> which<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.420> okay<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.470> you

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
bush which is okay you can do that you

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.710 
bush which is okay you can do that you
can<00:01:25.740> keep<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.010> sheared<00:01:26.280> down<00:01:26.550> it<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.600> was

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
can keep it sheared down it if it was

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.170 
can keep it sheared down it if it was
left<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.080> its<00:01:28.620> own<00:01:28.800> demise<00:01:29.400> or<00:01:29.820> its<00:01:30.030> own

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
left to its own demise or its own

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.410 
left to its own demise or its own
devices<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.290> would<00:01:31.410> get<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.890> no<00:01:32.280> 18<00:01:32.910> 20<00:01:33.240> feet

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
devices it would get to be no 18 20 feet

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.560 
devices it would get to be no 18 20 feet
tall<00:01:33.690> but<00:01:34.410> she<00:01:34.860> doesn't<00:01:35.160> want<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.430> huge<00:01:36.210> orange

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
tall but she doesn't want a huge orange

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.310 
tall but she doesn't want a huge orange
tree<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:36.990> we'll<00:01:37.170> keep<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.830> more<00:01:38.010> compact

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
tree so we'll keep it more compact

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.140 
tree so we'll keep it more compact
another<00:01:40.320> thing<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.710> understand<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.760> that<00:01:41.790> when

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
another thing to understand is that when

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.520 
another thing to understand is that when
this<00:01:42.300> tree<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.690> in<00:01:42.840> bloom

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
this tree is in bloom

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.780 
this tree is in bloom
be<00:01:43.650> very<00:01:43.860> careful<00:01:44.250> when<00:01:44.370> you<00:01:44.460> prune<00:01:44.670> it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
be very careful when you prune it

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.820 
be very careful when you prune it
because<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:45.840> act<00:01:46.050> of<00:01:46.230> pruning<00:01:46.530> you'll

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
because just the act of pruning you'll

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.770 
because just the act of pruning you'll
knock<00:01:47.070> off<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.370> lot<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.730> the<00:01:47.910> blossoms<00:01:48.420> which<00:01:48.600> in

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
knock off a lot of the blossoms which in

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.950 
knock off a lot of the blossoms which in
turn<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.230> affect<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.680> crop<00:01:50.240> now<00:01:51.240> when<00:01:51.870> you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
turn can affect the crop now when you

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.020 
turn can affect the crop now when you
have<00:01:52.140> lots<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.800> lots<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.100> oranges<00:01:53.580> on<00:01:53.730> here

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
have lots and lots of oranges on here

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.000 
have lots and lots of oranges on here
you<00:01:54.150> have<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.480> remember<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.500> if<00:01:55.650> you<00:01:55.800> don't

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
you have to remember that if you don't

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.400
