bunch<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.170> piles<00:00:55.500> off<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.790> load<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.239> up<00:00:57.390> but

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
bunch I piles off like load it up but

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.360 
bunch I piles off like load it up but
they<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.410> different<00:00:58.440> settings<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.309> can

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
they have different settings you can

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.109 
they have different settings you can
change<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:01.610> zoom<00:01:02.610> in<00:01:02.820> right<00:01:02.940> here<00:01:05.119> scroll

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
change it to zoom in right here scroll

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.870 
change it to zoom in right here scroll
down<00:01:06.560> grab<00:01:07.560> your<00:01:07.710> board<00:01:08.009> I<00:01:10.070> got<00:01:11.070> settings<00:01:11.610> and

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
down grab your board I got settings and

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.020 
down grab your board I got settings and
finger<00:01:12.180> my<00:01:12.300> own<00:01:12.450> gravity<00:01:13.160> gravity<00:01:14.160> I'll<00:01:14.670> go<00:01:14.970> to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
finger my own gravity gravity I'll go to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.790 
finger my own gravity gravity I'll go to
the<00:01:15.420> moon<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:19.080> hold<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:21.500> everything's<00:01:22.500> going

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
the moon and hold it everything's going

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.029 
the moon and hold it everything's going
to<00:01:22.860> move<00:01:23.039> super<00:01:23.850> slow<00:01:24.530> cuz<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.649> weigh<00:01:25.800> a<00:01:25.830> lot

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
to move super slow cuz you weigh a lot

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:42.750 
to move super slow cuz you weigh a lot
less<00:01:26.100> than<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.429> moon<00:01:27.259> let's<00:01:28.259> go<00:01:28.410> to<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.619> new<00:01:28.740> one

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:52.050 

go<00:01:43.660> to<00:01:43.720> 0<00:01:44.050> gravity<00:01:44.160> so<00:01:45.160> should<00:01:45.550> float<00:01:51.060> just

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
go to 0 gravity so should float just

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.660 
go to 0 gravity so should float just
stay<00:01:52.270> there<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:53.830> can<00:01:54.040> do<00:01:54.130> whatever<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.520> want

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
stay there you can do whatever you want

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.990 
stay there you can do whatever you want
one<00:01:54.820> swing<00:01:55.180> them<00:01:55.330> around<00:01:56.460> great<00:01:57.460> effects<00:01:57.820> you

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
one swing them around great effects you

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.320 
one swing them around great effects you
can<00:01:58.030> just<00:01:58.300> roll<00:01:58.510> around<00:01:58.630> with<00:01:58.950> and<00:02:03.120> run<00:02:04.120> out

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
can just roll around with and run out

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.820 
can just roll around with and run out
and<00:02:04.750> get<00:02:04.900> it<00:02:05.050> in<00:02:05.230> cydia<00:02:05.830> it's<00:02:06.490> not<00:02:06.700> very<00:02:06.880> much

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
and get it in cydia it's not very much

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:15.510 
and get it in cydia it's not very much
so<00:02:08.830> yeah<00:02:13.200> well<00:02:14.200> every<00:02:14.860> time<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:15.160> took<00:02:15.220> something

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
so yeah well every time I took something

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.980 
so yeah well every time I took something
to<00:02:15.670> make<00:02:15.820> another<00:02:16.030> video<00:02:16.300> guys<00:02:16.600> I've<00:02:16.930> been
