00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello here's how to do it yourself 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.519
 a hair lotion for 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.460
 start it will take you a little 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.040
 spray bottle so I get them back and 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.760
 of an ancient styling products precisely 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.960
 this one is 125 milliliters 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.980
 then you will need a little 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:28.260
 funnel 5 centilitres of almond oil 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:33.620
 sweet then 5 centilitres of vinegar 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.969
 of alcohol and 210 liters of olive oil 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.850
 I will start by preparing my 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.480
 mix in a small glass I start 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.660
 by putting white vinegar and oil 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.660
 olive 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:55.559
 so white vinegar has a side 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:59.039
 degreasing so he'll act right away and 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.910
 olive oil has a nourishing side 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.309
 so it's mostly for spikes 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:11.159
 you can also use it on 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:14.100
 roots but it will be necessary to let ask 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.330
 add the sweet almond oil that has 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:24.180
 also a nourishing power 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:31.710
 moisturizing I mix my preparation with 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.490
 a spoon and then using a 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.939
 funnel 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.939
 I will put it in our little vapo 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.100
 ap 1 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.670
 once you have put your 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:03.740
 preparation in the little vapo you 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.960
 complete up with water to 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.130
 present malaise is over I can 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.910
 redo my monsters and and I 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.860
 apply it 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.040
 after each shampoo on hair 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:20.930
 wet I shake before each 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.540
 use and I keep in a 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.150
 dry place 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.970
 so I especially recommend this lotion 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.370
 for dry hair that needs 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.080
 of brilliance 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.480
 if you use it daily at 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.739
 after two weeks you should already 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.890
 see the nourishing and 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:46.069
 softening of olive oil is 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.980
 also sweet almond it is a 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.400
 Grandma's remedy very easy to 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.049
 prepare and very inexpensive I would say 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.620
 a little lotion like this 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:59.329
 does not even return a euro while 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.790
 in supermarkets they cost 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.420
 much more expensive 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.420
 There it is, thanks
