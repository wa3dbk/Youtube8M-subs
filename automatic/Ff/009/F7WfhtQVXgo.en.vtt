00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.320
 information about the next 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.240
 updates for minecraft console 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.070
 as well as minecraft ps vita 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.750
 so I hope you are doing well in 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.849
 anyway me it's going very very very very 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.300
 well and in this video will speak a 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.040
 little bit of history and end of what 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.300
 has happened since last time there 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.160
 because there have been some 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.840
 tusa upheavals concerning minecraft 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.840
 consoles and so we will discuss 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.149
 now so first of all so we're going 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.190
 start with minecraft psg table then 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:46.690
 as you know as you know 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.420
 minecraft ps vita is not released yet 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.789
 but cathy studio wanted to make you 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.449
 get out at the same time minecraft ps4 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:58.089
 and xbox world together with minecraft ps 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.440
 vita which time medium market 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.499
 which worked moderately for 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.590
 minecraft xbox one and ps4 where there was I 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:07.780
 believe two or three days of no one day 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.360
 even a day of 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.540
 2 what is called letting go one more day 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.009
 between here is here and so for 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.650
 minecraft results so it's not 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.600
 still out there so you have to know 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.759
 that minecraft makes a studio caddy 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.899
 rather is not going to focus for 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.550
 the moment on the next updates 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.270
 day consoles ie for 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.740
 holding 10.9 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.009
 I will come back to why there is 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.409
 politis of the site so they will get 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.750
 devote more precisely to minecraft 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.009
 ps vita for the moment they want 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.950
 really finish it to be able to 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.560
 go out and so there will be no 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.170
 next update for now no 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.140
 big update forgiveness for mac 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.929
 for minecraft xbox one ps3 ps 4 as well 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.280
 that 360 so here they are really going to get 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.619
 dedicate for minecraft ps vita for 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.060
 to be able to take it out and then 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:03.020
 devote to console updates not 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.649
 so as you know the latte and 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.050
 u17 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.110
 Tunisia has gone out for 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.429
 minecraft xbox one as well as for for 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.280
 minecraft xbox one as well as for 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.989
 minecraft 360 I repeat the end of June 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.850
 maybe I'll say it again but 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.290
 mike ladd and u17 was an update 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.970
 in order to actually transfer these 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.709
 worlds from 360 to xbox live on ps3 I 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.049
 do not think she's out or finally 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.950
 I do not know anymore salty 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.980
 directly a comment I do not know 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.150
 no more the one was out or if they 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.320
 are going to release it here and so on ps3 they 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.109
 are going to get her out that we can actually 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.540
 transfer maps from ps3 to ps4 it 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.760
 seems to me that at ten o'clock you 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.329
 telly 18 she's already out on xbox one 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.160
 on xbox 360 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.120
 I do not think she's out but 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.480
 I know she's out on xbox 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.670
 world this is the trumpet 18 came out only on 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.960
 xbox one for the moment and not on ps3 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.390
 as well as on ps4 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.160
 simply because television 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.410
 what was actually an update 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.290
 to make a bug fix in 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.300
 made to fix it bugs that which 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.640
 was made by joining in 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.140
 multiplayer a world with friends and 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.510
 good they just guide me and 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.510
 a few measures finally some few 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.710
 other bugs about the game more 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.210
 precisely here is then the atl 18 is 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.390
 not finally she's not out on xbox 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.990
 360 because there was no update 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.450
 except defeat so that's normally 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.310
 the xbox 360 as well as the xbox world makes 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.970
 directly evolved into an update you are 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.450
 u18 so minecraft xbox one of 360 are 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.830
 in 2008 regarding minecraft ps3 as well 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.680
 that ps because they are all the time 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.530
 finally they are still in 1.07 21 17 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.850
 it's what you want and so they go 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.580
 stay for the moment enteritis i7 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.020
 until he finds some bugs and 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.780
 they will do an update for 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:00.200
 able to reach the telus 18 so he 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.820
 will be at the same state as the xbox 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.430
 one and that the 360 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.570
 knowing that before doing TV 18 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.850
 all this they will have to finish 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.380
 minecraft ps vita 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.890
 then they will devote themselves to that 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.930
 come to the best subject at the d19 so the 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.200
 head 19 in my opinion it will be a very very 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.900
 big update the update 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.200
 common normal of 14 where they added 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.240
 golems of cats there all this is to 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.840
 my opinion this update there will be a 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.670
 very very big 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.250
 which has not been confirmed forever 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.740
 by kddi studio so maybe in the 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.500
 week they will confirm this for 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.820
 can then work on it 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.130
 so that was all small 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.200
 information that I had to tell you 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.700
 so I repeat they are not going out 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.700
 of update for the moment they are going 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.080
 to really focus on 100% 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.669
 minecraft ps vita 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.860
 so that's it so do not ask me is 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.229
 what you know about updates all this 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.180
