00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.330 

so<00:00:36.480> I'm<00:00:36.899> going<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.110> start<00:00:37.380> off<00:00:37.500> with<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.010> body

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
so I'm going to start off with the body

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.119 
so I'm going to start off with the body
first<00:00:38.840> you're<00:00:39.840> going<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.079> need<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.530> battle

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
first you're going to need a battle

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.540 
first you're going to need a battle
droid<00:00:41.309> body<00:00:42.710> all<00:00:43.710> right<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.219> then<00:00:44.399> make

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
droid body all right but you then make

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.910 
droid body all right but you then make
it<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:45.000> way<00:00:45.239> with<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.480> whatever<00:00:46.289> they<00:00:46.860> see
