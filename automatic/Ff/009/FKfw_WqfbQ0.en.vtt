00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
it in a minute but I just replaced it

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.609 
it in a minute but I just replaced it
today<00:01:13.710> with<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.920> Remo<00:01:14.990> ambassadors<00:01:15.990> 14-inch

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
hundred dollar snare drum and then this

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:33.679 
hundred dollar snare drum and then this
sounds<00:01:24.390> pretty<00:01:24.750> bad<00:01:24.990> right<00:01:25.350> now<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:32.689> little

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
sounds pretty bad right now a little

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.749 
sounds pretty bad right now a little
ring<00:01:34.530> at<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> end<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.460> other<00:01:35.579> than

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
ring at the end of it but other than

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.569 
ring at the end of it but other than
that<00:01:35.880> sounds<00:01:36.360> pretty<00:01:36.509> good<00:01:37.400> one<00:01:38.400> way<00:01:38.549> to

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
that sounds pretty good one way to

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.590 
that sounds pretty good one way to
dampen<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.420> drum<00:01:39.960> gum<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.500> don't<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.520> a

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
dampen it is drum gum I don't have a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.469 
dampen it is drum gum I don't have a
demo<00:01:42.619> for<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.799> I'll<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.759> demo<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:45.270> drum

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
demo for that I'll have a demo for drum

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.429 
demo for that I'll have a demo for drum
gun<00:01:45.689> but<00:01:45.899> what<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.829> do<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.659> you<00:01:48.659> would<00:01:51.439> choose

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
gun but what you do is you would choose

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.289 
gun but what you do is you would choose
your<00:01:52.680> drum<00:01:53.960> you<00:01:54.960> would<00:01:55.110> put<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:56.299> right

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
your drum you would put it right

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.690 
your drum you would put it right
somewhere<00:01:57.899> around<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.229> edges<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:59.310> right

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
somewhere around the edges like right

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.740 
somewhere around the edges like right
here<00:02:00.240> around<00:02:00.750> these<00:02:00.960> edges<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:02.570> that<00:02:03.570> would

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
here around these edges and that would

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.830 
here around these edges and that would
it<00:02:04.680> will<00:02:05.009> take<00:02:05.219> up<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.520> vibrations<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:06.659> when

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
it will take up the vibrations of when

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.160 
it will take up the vibrations of when
you<00:02:06.960> hit<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.950> would<00:02:08.129> decay<00:02:08.520> quicker<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.539> it

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
you hit it it would decay quicker and it

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.380 
you hit it it would decay quicker and it
would

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
would

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.650 
would
actually<00:02:10.990> get<00:02:11.110> rid<00:02:11.319> of<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.500> ring<00:02:11.740> it<00:02:11.860> then

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
actually get rid of that ring it then

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.050 
actually get rid of that ring it then
when<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:13.690> do<00:02:13.870> for<00:02:14.530> all<00:02:14.650> my<00:02:15.010> Tom<00:02:15.340> drums<00:02:16.020> are<00:02:18.060> three

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
when I do for all my Tom drums are three

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.930 
when I do for all my Tom drums are three
Mose<00:02:19.980> these<00:02:20.980> are<00:02:21.190> sound<00:02:22.180> deepening<00:02:23.940> plastic

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
Mose these are sound deepening plastic

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.090 
Mose these are sound deepening plastic
rings<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.450> just<00:02:25.600> plop<00:02:26.530> on<00:02:26.740> your<00:02:26.860> drum

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
rings that you just plop on your drum

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:42.090 
rings that you just plop on your drum
just<00:02:27.880> like<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.680> now<00:02:29.680> listen<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:39.420> think<00:02:41.100> it

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
just like that now listen I think it

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.860 
just like that now listen I think it
sounds<00:02:42.489> better<00:02:42.670> when<00:02:42.880> it's<00:02:43.060> on<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.360> rack<00:02:43.570> on

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
sounds better when it's on the rack on

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.470 
sounds better when it's on the rack on
the<00:02:43.959> bass<00:02:44.590> drum<00:02:44.830> it's<00:02:45.700> probably<00:02:46.180> just<00:02:46.390> because

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
the bass drum it's probably just because

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:55.979 
the bass drum it's probably just because
the<00:02:47.320> way<00:02:47.440> I'm<00:02:47.560> holding<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:54.600> well<00:02:55.600> that's<00:02:55.840> how

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
the way I'm holding it well that's how

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.970 
the way I'm holding it well that's how
it<00:02:56.019> sounds<00:02:56.380> with<00:02:56.440> remo<00:02:58.410> mess<00:02:59.410> without<00:02:59.680> the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
it sounds with remo mess without the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.000 
it sounds with remo mess without the
remote<00:03:02.880> got<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:03.910> little<00:03:04.090> bounce<00:03:04.800> bounce<00:03:05.800> e

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
remote got a little bounce bounce e
