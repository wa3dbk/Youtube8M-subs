 welcome to the cooking with mo academy 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.830
 I am them and I will leave you today 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.289
 see how to make a simple one 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.020
 makes torsion with potatoes 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:24.310
 don't really go wrong 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.900
 and this should be the result for 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.900
 this dish and we needed potatoes 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.879
 two small tomatoes for the waist 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.230
 a tomato for on top of the earth plus 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.219
 trucks 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.640
 two small onions 1 clove of garlic and 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:45.699
 a bunch of parsley and herbs 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.039
 half a teaspoon pepper 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.100
 teaspoon of cumin 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:54.159
 little saffron 1 teaspoon 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.319
 ginger powder 2 tablespoons tomato powder 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.319
 and one and a half teaspoons of salt 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:03.690
 first thing we are going to do is put olive oil in it 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.690
 the waist 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.430
 then we put the sauce in the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.430
 olive oil 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.250
 Yes 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.520
 then you also want the garlic immediately 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.520
 there 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.250
 and now we put the bag on a layer 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.250
 fire 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.860
 on the fire 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.860
 after the bag on the fire in five minutes 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.360
 stood 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.860
 once it looks like oil is hot on one 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.860
 drink you immediately add the onions 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.590
 equal is the sitting out of the ornament 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.000
 you don't want to point that out nicely 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.000
 can fruit together 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.560
 the 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.430
 after the potatoes are in and you 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.400
 have stirred 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.170
 right from there also occasionally on 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.170
 become and was three after 10 minutes 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:57.640
 when you take the bag and make sure you check it out 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.640
 you put it in the boat and or almost get it 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.640
 everybody 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:17.140
 yes let 10 minutes might be something 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.140
 onions are cooked 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.310
 To do this you also get equally good so 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.310
 there is tomato everywhere 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.360
 and then you can learn to see five there 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.360
 let it rest for minutes 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.099
 then fill a tea glass with warm 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.750
 water 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.290
 just out of the tap and there you do all your 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.290
 herbs with 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.090
 And this is more convenient to prevent 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.480
 you all the pieces of herbs go 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.480
 your time 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.890
 and then mix well and if there is none 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:28.300
 You can get lumps in the loan 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:36.220
 you do as the herbs in the water well 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:40.960
 mixed and then gradually over the whole 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.760
 pouring into the garden 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.470
 Well naturally you see excess water 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.200
 friend her never again but 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.340
 that still pulls away 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.340
 parsley flush the tube 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.020
 finely chopped 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:10.759
 and then release the waist again for a while 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:12.470
 rest after you reach the waist in 10 minutes 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:15.520
 we let go the tomatoes 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.520
 put on top 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.720
 how you do that really doesn't matter 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.990
 in addition, the tongs in about ten 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.410
 minutes like fifteen minutes 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.000
 so that they are cooked and the 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.680
 Potato and you can check it through 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.680
 with his people and year the big feathers 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.620
 We will see if the potatoes 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:51.440
 to be 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.960
 with a fork and then you actually have to 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.840
 just check different 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.780
 he is not good for me yet so no 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.270
 I give the globe a little more time 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:05.990
 with a lid 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.820
 church as much as a bag in 3 p.m. 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.040
 about an hour and a half on the fire is too 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.070
 and you have checked whether the 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.190
 potatoes are cooked then it's time to 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.190
 to eat
