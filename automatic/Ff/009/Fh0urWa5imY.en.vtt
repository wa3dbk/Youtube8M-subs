00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
levels can be taken down pretty easily

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.479 
levels can be taken down pretty easily
so<00:00:47.750> just<00:00:48.750> fast<00:00:49.110> forward<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> video<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.100> bit

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
so just fast forward the video a bit

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.209 
so just fast forward the video a bit
after<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.750> final<00:00:52.050> level<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.379> gone<00:00:52.649> lower

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
after the final level is gone lower

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.310 
after the final level is gone lower
zombie<00:00:53.789> gate<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.180> now<00:00:54.329> be<00:00:54.510> opened<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.079> the
