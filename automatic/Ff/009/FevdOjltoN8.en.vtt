it's kind of a dual rate Expo type of

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.090 
it's kind of a dual rate Expo type of
thing<00:01:14.200> that<00:01:14.230> is<00:01:14.500> set<00:01:14.680> in<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:14.890> flight

thing that is set in the flight
controller<00:01:15.750> by<00:01:16.750> hardware<00:01:17.230> and<00:01:17.410> from<00:01:17.620> there

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
controller by hardware and from there

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.730 
controller by hardware and from there
wise<00:01:18.010> so<00:01:18.610> using<00:01:19.150> the<00:01:19.450> sticks<00:01:19.810> now<00:01:20.020> channel<00:01:20.560> 1

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
wise so using the sticks now channel 1

your copter will be very agile very
sensitive<00:01:45.580> to<00:01:45.700> stick<00:01:45.970> movements<00:01:46.210> and<00:01:46.660> super

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
sensitive to stick movements and super

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.400 
sensitive to stick movements and super
fast<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.880> this<00:01:49.180> was<00:01:49.390> very<00:01:49.690> easy<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:50.080> set<00:01:50.230> dual

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
fast so this was very easy to set dual

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.140 
fast so this was very easy to set dual
