00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:25.240 
smooth cut right down if you can see
that<00:01:22.280> but<00:01:23.050> that's<00:01:24.050> a<00:01:24.140> pretty<00:01:24.259> smooth<00:01:24.649> cut<00:01:25.069> and

that but that's a pretty smooth cut and

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.740 
that but that's a pretty smooth cut and
this<00:01:25.700> piece<00:01:25.970> here<00:01:26.209> is<00:01:26.270> going<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.539> be<00:01:26.630> the

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
this piece here is going to be the

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.219 
this piece here is going to be the
backbone<00:01:26.959> of<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.880> fuselage<00:01:28.880> this<00:01:29.750> is<00:01:29.959> I<00:01:30.110> think

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
backbone of the fuselage this is I think

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.100 
backbone of the fuselage this is I think
37<00:01:31.009> inches<00:01:31.520> long<00:01:31.759> and<00:01:34.630> this<00:01:35.630> is<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.899> backbone

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
37 inches long and this is the backbone

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.650 
37 inches long and this is the backbone
or<00:01:36.649> keel<00:01:37.610> of<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.849> a<00:01:38.599> 300<00:01:39.410> s<00:01:39.500> fuselage<00:01:40.539> so<00:01:41.539> I'll

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
or keel of the a 300 s fuselage so I'll

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.749 
or keel of the a 300 s fuselage so I'll
do<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.899> same<00:01:42.080> thing<00:01:42.259> on<00:01:42.349> the<00:01:42.440> other<00:01:42.470> side<00:01:42.759> I'll

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
do the same thing on the other side I'll

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.760 
do the same thing on the other side I'll
move<00:01:44.060> this<00:01:44.240> wood<00:01:44.509> over<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:45.020> that<00:01:45.140> side<00:01:45.170> cut

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
move this wood over to that side cut

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.010 
move this wood over to that side cut
straight<00:01:46.640> down<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.179> do<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.690> same<00:01:47.869> thing

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
straight down and do the same thing

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.749 
straight down and do the same thing
again<00:01:48.259> to<00:01:48.440> make<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:49.420> flush<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:51.289> know<00:01:51.410> peace<00:01:51.759> so
