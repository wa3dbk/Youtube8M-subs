00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
three o'clock in the morning I wake up

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.680 
three o'clock in the morning I wake up
and<00:02:06.409> I<00:02:06.470> make<00:02:06.680> notes<00:02:06.950> on<00:02:07.130> my<00:02:07.310> phone<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:08.209> so<00:02:08.479> one

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
and I make notes on my phone and so one

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.540 
and I make notes on my phone and so one
night<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:09.020> just<00:02:09.050> strum<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:09.890> should<00:02:10.369> take<00:02:10.489> a

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
night you just strum I should take a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.160 
night you just strum I should take a
blow<00:02:10.729> torch<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.090> those<00:02:11.360> ribs<00:02:11.630> you<00:02:11.870> know<00:02:11.989> we

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
blow torch to those ribs you know we

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.460 
blow torch to those ribs you know we
think<00:02:12.319> of<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.590> as<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.739> brulee<00:02:13.569> so<00:02:14.569> it's<00:02:15.110> kind<00:02:15.380> of

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
think of it as a brulee so it's kind of

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.940 
think of it as a brulee so it's kind of
like<00:02:15.620> you<00:02:15.800> would<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.870> caramelize<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.590> sugars

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
like you would to caramelize the sugars

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.309 
like you would to caramelize the sugars
on<00:02:19.160> top<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:20.209> actually<00:02:20.630> opens<00:02:20.870> up<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.020> pores

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
on top and actually opens up the pores

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:28.570 
on top and actually opens up the pores
and<00:02:21.680> allows<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.160> go<00:02:22.310> into<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.700> meat

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.820
