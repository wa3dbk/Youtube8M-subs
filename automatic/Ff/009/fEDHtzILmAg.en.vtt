00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
comes into and it's like it made it

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.660 
comes into and it's like it made it
makes<00:02:02.439> better<00:02:03.439> than<00:02:03.560> I<00:02:03.649> laugh<00:02:03.859> really<00:02:04.039> hard

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
but yeah the person who first told was

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.020 
but yeah the person who first told was
like<00:03:43.989> is<00:03:44.680> that<00:03:44.829> your<00:03:44.980> wish<00:03:45.219> list<00:03:45.250> because

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.900 

the<00:03:52.370> whole<00:03:52.580> process<00:03:53.000> of<00:03:53.420> making<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:54.620> and

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
the whole process of making it and

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.070 
the whole process of making it and
seeing<00:03:55.910> it<00:03:56.060> from<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.210> start<00:03:56.600> all<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.930> way<00:03:56.960> to

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
seeing it from the start all the way to

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.310 
seeing it from the start all the way to
the<00:03:57.290> end<00:03:57.440> was<00:03:57.830> so<00:03:58.100> wildly<00:03:59.030> fun<00:03:59.360> like<00:04:00.020> it<00:04:00.200> was

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
the end was so wildly fun like it was

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.640 
the end was so wildly fun like it was
just<00:04:00.530> it's<00:04:00.740> a<00:04:00.950> I<00:04:01.510> don't<00:04:02.510> know<00:04:02.750> like<00:04:03.080> every<00:04:03.500> day

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.560 
just it's a I don't know like every day
I<00:04:03.680> thought<00:04:03.980> I<00:04:04.010> would<00:04:04.250> be<00:04:04.370> more<00:04:04.820> nervous<00:04:05.090> or<00:04:05.480> I
