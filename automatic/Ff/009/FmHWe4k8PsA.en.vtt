an example of imagine a child running
out<00:00:16.309> in<00:00:16.430> front<00:00:16.580> of<00:00:16.699> the<00:00:16.789> vehicle<00:00:16.970> and<00:00:17.390> you<00:00:17.900> need

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
out in front of the vehicle and you need

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.230

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
position and with the brake what we want

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.959 
position and with the brake what we want
to<00:00:47.210> do<00:00:47.329> is<00:00:47.690> imagine<00:00:48.530> like<00:00:48.829> a<00:00:48.860> sponge<00:00:49.399> and<00:00:49.820> you

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
to do is imagine like a sponge and you

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:51.729 
to do is imagine like a sponge and you
want<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.239> squeeze<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.110> water<00:00:51.260> out<00:00:51.530> of<00:00:51.590> that

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
want to squeeze the water out of that

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.560 
want to squeeze the water out of that
sponge<00:00:52.010> that's<00:00:52.430> how<00:00:52.610> we<00:00:52.670> want<00:00:52.940> to<00:00:53.000> apply<00:00:53.210> it<00:00:53.450> on

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
sponge that's how we want to apply it on

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.869 
sponge that's how we want to apply it on
the<00:00:53.660> brakes<00:00:53.899> so<00:00:54.590> we<00:00:54.739> want<00:00:54.920> to<00:00:55.010> be<00:00:55.070> quite<00:00:55.309> prompt

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
the brakes so we want to be quite prompt

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.209 
the brakes so we want to be quite prompt
but<00:00:56.360> we<00:00:56.540> also<00:00:56.690> want<00:00:57.020> to<00:00:57.079> squeeze<00:00:57.680> that<00:00:57.950> water

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
but we also want to squeeze that water

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.279 
but we also want to squeeze that water
out<00:00:58.640> of<00:00:58.760> that<00:00:59.000> sponge<00:00:59.270> imagine<00:00:59.809> that<00:00:59.960> imagine

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
out of that sponge imagine that imagine

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.350 
out of that sponge imagine that imagine
a<00:01:00.350> squeezing<00:01:00.920> motion<00:01:01.070> on<00:01:01.340> the<00:01:01.430> brake<00:01:01.610> and<00:01:01.820> then

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
a squeezing motion on the brake and then

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.539 
a squeezing motion on the brake and then
at<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.600> last<00:01:02.629> moment<00:01:03.020> we<00:01:03.440> dip<00:01:03.649> the<00:01:03.770> clutch<00:01:04.009> to

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
at the last moment we dip the clutch to

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.120

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
stopped we apply the handbrake and we

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.800 
stopped we apply the handbrake and we
put<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.070> car<00:01:10.310> into<00:01:10.580> neutral<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:11.270> then<00:01:11.570> we<00:01:11.659> can
