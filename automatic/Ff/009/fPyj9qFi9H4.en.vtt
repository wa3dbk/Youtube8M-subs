00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 Hello everyone, finally doing something for the sake of 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.170
 what it all started 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.570
 I already showed my previous videos about 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.160
 how i was doing 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:16.379
 panels of 6 cells now I have connected them to 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.430
 140 single solar battery 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:26.310
 watt means voltage at idle 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:31.759
 Approximately 20 volts of passport current 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:35.450
 8 amps for these elements 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.500
 seamstress of me so so apparently as for 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.070
 personal use think 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.149
 fit means the elements are attached to 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.399
 fabrics with a glue gun and 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.620
 liquid glue 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:54.530
 now try for testing now 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.530
 how much will she give out on such a sun 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:38.670
 7 and 7 amps and this is for the elements and 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:42.539
 for the spring sun is not at its zenith 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.740
 still pretty decent talk here 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.780
 I would like to note more about 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.859
 operation of this solar battery 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.929
 then a current of 7 amps 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.439
 charging 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:02:03.000
 12 volt lead battery 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:05.189
 capacity of about 70 ampere hours but in 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.190
 hike is clear what is seventy five 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.269
 hours it's hard 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.370
 choose or battery life 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:18.989
 or 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:22.260
 how would weight and transport fit 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.760
 and I would like to say that yes at the maximum 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:30.030
 This panel will issue a passport eat well 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.959
 I think the current 85 summer will give but need 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.769
 to be prepared for the fact that even 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:41.910
 small cloud current with 8 amps will fall 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.590
 to two two and a half that's why 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.989
 when you buy a solar battery and 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.569
 it says only one amp and 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.760
 voltage is 5 volts up if you live 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.790
 somewhere in the Crimea where it rains infrequent 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.530
 then no problem you can charge your 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.750
 phone and smartphone but if you want 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:06.930
 constantly every day charge your 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.769
 smartphone and you need a stable like 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.310
 charging 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.560
 it is better to take stock as if 5 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.980
 volt 1 amp and 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:21.389
 for example there will be at least the slightest haze on 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:26.880
 the sky then the current will fall from one ampere to 0 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:28.730
 2 0 1 amperes ie 100 milliamps or 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.459
 200 milliamps no more 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.840
 that's why be prepared for this here 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:40.610
 would like to say something the shorter 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.459
 the wires are better about the wires here 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.769
 such here are Chinese connectors with such here 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.459
 wires like charging my my 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.819
 laptop 90 watts can not stand here 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.510
 had to be replaced by some thicker 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:04:04.160
 the wires are good 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:08.620
 for example, here's car audio audio 2 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:12.310
 on the current 8 empire one 22 and a half 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:17.600
 a millimeter square will be enough 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.930
 That's all actually so finally 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.460
 we waited for cloudy weather 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.860
 mean what about understand what 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.410
 Now I will say that the sun 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.639
 you can watch just unprotected 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:35.840
 eyes without glasses now try 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:41.260
 measure our voltage and amperage solar 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.260
 batteries like 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.630
 circulation 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:10.040
 two worlds depending on cloudiness then 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:18.190
 have voltage amperage dropped at four 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:18.190
 cloud cover times like this and 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.400
 voltage 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.940
 2121 volts
