00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.390 
these electronic and pop songs now the
only<00:00:16.020> reason<00:00:16.289> why<00:00:16.410> I'm<00:00:16.500> making<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:16.890> tutorial

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
only reason why I'm making this tutorial

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.580 
only reason why I'm making this tutorial
is<00:00:17.580> because<00:00:18.060> when<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:18.869> was<00:00:19.020> younger<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.529> would

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
is because when I was younger I would

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.939 
is because when I was younger I would
listen<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.039> electronic<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.480> pop<00:00:21.900> music<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.590> I

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
listen to electronic and pop music and I

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.540 
listen to electronic and pop music and I
would<00:00:23.100> notice<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:24.180> drum<00:00:24.840> fill<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.550> I

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
would notice this drum fill and I

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.960 
would notice this drum fill and I
absolutely<00:00:27.080> loved<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.949> way<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.160> sounded<00:00:29.310> and

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
absolutely loved the way it sounded and

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.450 
absolutely loved the way it sounded and
I've<00:00:30.840> been<00:00:31.050> trying<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> recreate<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.130> sound

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
I've been trying to recreate that sound

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.740 
I've been trying to recreate that sound
for<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.180> long<00:00:33.420> time<00:00:33.690> now<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:35.360> guess<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.570> was

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
for a long time now and I guess it was

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.639 
for a long time now and I guess it was
maybe<00:00:37.879> like<00:00:38.879> just<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.780> couple<00:00:39.989> months<00:00:40.260> ago<00:00:40.500> I

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
maybe like just a couple months ago I

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.549 
maybe like just a couple months ago I
figured<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.399> out<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.940> know<00:00:42.930> I'm<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.200> little<00:00:43.320> bit

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
beat I am going to add a kick so there

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.030 
beat I am going to add a kick so there
you<00:01:50.580> go<00:01:50.729> that's<00:01:51.450> basically<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.440> mean<00:01:52.920> that's

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
you go that's basically it I mean that's

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.490 
you go that's basically it I mean that's
all<00:01:53.310> there<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.300> it

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
all there is to it

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.340 
all there is to it
I<00:01:55.610> can't<00:01:56.610> imagine<00:01:56.729> why<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.240> didn't<00:01:58.050> figure<00:01:58.229> it

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
I can't imagine why I didn't figure it

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.440 
I can't imagine why I didn't figure it
out<00:01:58.560> sooner<00:01:58.729> but<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.790> guess<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.240> thing<00:02:00.390> that

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
out sooner but I guess the thing that

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.620 
out sooner but I guess the thing that
tripped<00:02:00.869> me<00:02:00.960> up<00:02:01.080> so<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.130> bad<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.970> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
tripped me up so so bad was that the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.040 
tripped me up so so bad was that the
fact<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.160> drum<00:02:05.430> fill<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:06.509> very

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
fact that in this drum fill it's very

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.469 
fact that in this drum fill it's very
very<00:02:07.410> very<00:02:07.649> common<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.340> have<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.910> drum<00:02:09.450> roll

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
very very common to have a drum roll

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.370 
very very common to have a drum roll
right<00:02:10.440> before<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.520> tome<00:02:11.760> hit<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.930> let's<00:02:13.260> go

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
right before the tome hit so let's go

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.620 
right before the tome hit so let's go
ahead<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.709> add<00:02:13.830> some<00:02:13.860> snare<00:02:14.819> hits<00:02:17.450> make<00:02:18.450> sure

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
ahead and add some snare hits make sure

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.070 
ahead and add some snare hits make sure
to<00:02:18.980> fiddle<00:02:19.980> with<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.459> velocity<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.569> this

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
to fiddle with the velocity so that this

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.940 
to fiddle with the velocity so that this
tone<00:02:22.470> I'm<00:02:22.950> sorry<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.459> snare<00:02:24.330> hit<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.950> a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
tone I'm sorry this snare hit is a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.650 
tone I'm sorry this snare hit is a
little<00:02:26.430> bit<00:02:26.520> quieter<00:02:26.940> than<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.270> one<00:02:27.480> right

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
little bit quieter than this one right

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.860 
little bit quieter than this one right
here<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:29.190> is<00:02:29.250> what<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:29.580> sounds<00:02:29.819> like<00:02:31.550> and

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
here this is what it sounds like and

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.600 
here this is what it sounds like and
that's<00:02:33.870> basically<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:35.280> might<00:02:35.459> go<00:02:35.580> a
