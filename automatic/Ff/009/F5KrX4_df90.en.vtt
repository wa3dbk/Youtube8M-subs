and we'll take a look at this and see

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.710 
and we'll take a look at this and see
how<00:00:16.290> it<00:00:16.529> works<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.090> I'll<00:00:18.090> give<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.419> all<00:00:18.450> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
how it works and I'll give you all the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.140 
how it works and I'll give you all the
specifications<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> joke<00:00:20.670> as<00:00:20.910> in

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
specifications on this is a joke as in

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.060 
specifications on this is a joke as in
I've<00:00:21.330> placed<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.960> dollar<00:00:22.260> bill<00:00:22.560> precise

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
I've placed it on a dollar bill precise

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.009 
I've placed it on a dollar bill precise
perspective<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.240> see<00:00:24.390> how<00:00:24.539> large<00:00:24.750> it

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
perspective so you can see how large it

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.570 
perspective so you can see how large it
is<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> Leatherman<00:00:26.670> squirt

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
is and this is a Leatherman squirt

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.530 
is and this is a Leatherman squirt
jackknife<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:30.420> more<00:00:30.570> perspective<00:00:32.420> now<00:00:33.420> to

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
jackknife for more perspective now to

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.490 
jackknife for more perspective now to
operate<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.199> so<00:00:35.780> relatively<00:00:36.780> simple<00:00:37.350> you

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
operate this so relatively simple you

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.890 
operate this so relatively simple you
simply<00:00:37.890> pull<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> top<00:00:38.430> off<00:00:38.670> cuz<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.720> hose

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
simply pull the top off cuz the hose

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.320 
simply pull the top off cuz the hose
inside<00:00:40.790> you<00:00:41.790> take<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> hose<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:43.879> push<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.150> on

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
inside you take the hose and push in on

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.899 
inside you take the hose and push in on
it<00:00:45.479> it<00:00:45.870> has<00:00:46.350> an<00:00:46.530> angle<00:00:46.830> cut<00:00:46.979> on<00:00:47.159> it<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.460> push<00:00:47.699> in

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
it it has an angle cut on it you push in

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.840 
it it has an angle cut on it you push in
on<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.299> twist<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.780> like<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.699> until<00:00:50.699> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
on it and twist it like this until the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.390 
on it and twist it like this until the
angle<00:00:51.180> cut<00:00:51.390> gets<00:00:51.659> inside<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.409> hole<00:00:52.619> so<00:00:53.369> you

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
angle cut gets inside of the hole so you

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.299 
angle cut gets inside of the hole so you
have<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> seal<00:00:54.000> all<00:00:54.299> the<00:00:54.330> way<00:00:54.449> around<00:00:55.250> do<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
have a seal all the way around do the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.710 
have a seal all the way around do the
same<00:00:56.640> thing<00:00:56.909> on<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.119> other<00:00:57.150> end<00:00:59.720> relatively

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
same thing on the other end relatively

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.450 
same thing on the other end relatively
easy<00:01:00.930> thing<00:01:01.290> to<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:03.710> then<00:01:04.710> take<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> two<00:01:05.250> ends

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
easy thing to do then take the two ends

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.750 
easy thing to do then take the two ends
and<00:01:05.640> spin<00:01:06.479> them<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> hose<00:01:07.190> until<00:01:08.190> they

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and spin them on the hose until they

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.080 
and spin them on the hose until they
both<00:01:08.970> lay<00:01:09.270> flat<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.700> that's<00:01:11.700> all<00:01:11.940> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
both lay flat and that's all the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.620 
both lay flat and that's all the
assembly<00:01:12.540> now<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.770> take<00:01:13.980> the<00:01:14.160> stove<00:01:15.350> and

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
assembly now if you take the stove and

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.270 
assembly now if you take the stove and
put<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.660> pot<00:01:18.870> stand<00:01:19.230> over<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.620> and<00:01:19.740> put<00:01:19.920> your<00:01:20.070> pot

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
put a pot stand over it and put your pot

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.970 
put a pot stand over it and put your pot
on<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.930> then<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.080> take<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.440> reserve<00:01:22.740> and

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
on and then you take the reserve and

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.030 
on and then you take the reserve and
keep<00:01:23.160> it<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.550> something<00:01:24.360> higher<00:01:24.720> than<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
keep it on something higher than the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.360 
keep it on something higher than the
stove<00:01:26.370> itself<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.240> gravity<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.840> take<00:01:28.050> over

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
stove itself so gravity can take over

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.400 
stove itself so gravity can take over
put<00:01:29.370> your<00:01:29.520> alcohol<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.930> will<00:01:31.200> run

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
put your alcohol in here it will run

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.110 
put your alcohol in here it will run
down<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> holes<00:01:31.950> which<00:01:32.190> is<00:01:32.370> clearing<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
down the holes which is clearing and

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.899 
down the holes which is clearing and
into<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.510> stove<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.230> as<00:01:35.190> you<00:01:35.340> fill<00:01:35.580> this<00:01:35.700> up

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
into the stove and as you fill this up

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.930 
into the stove and as you fill this up
the<00:01:36.330> stove<00:01:36.630> will<00:01:37.140> come<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.100> about<00:01:38.310> half<00:01:38.580> full

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
the stove will come to about half full

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.180 
the stove will come to about half full
so<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.270> see<00:01:39.600> alcohol<00:01:40.050> just<00:01:40.260> above<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.830> carbon

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
so you see alcohol just above the carbon

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.770 
so you see alcohol just above the carbon
felt<00:01:41.430> wick<00:01:41.700> which<00:01:41.940> is<00:01:42.120> a<00:01:42.150> piece<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.600> inside<00:01:44.780> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
have any alcohol in it because it'll

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.480 
have any alcohol in it because it'll
always<00:01:49.200> run<00:01:49.500> down<00:01:49.650> to<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:49.920> stove<00:01:50.159> if<00:01:50.340> you're

choke<00:03:14.680> hazard<00:03:15.189> and<00:03:15.370> a<00:03:15.849> little<00:03:16.120> 4-ounce<00:03:16.450> bottle

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
choke hazard and a little 4-ounce bottle

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.490 
choke hazard and a little 4-ounce bottle
of<00:03:17.169> alcohol<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:19.269> could<00:03:19.479> continue<00:03:20.049> cooking<00:03:20.229> a

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500

it's worth it to say that this is worth

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.719

my newest prototype the second one this
is<00:03:47.859> the<00:03:47.979> first<00:03:48.340> in<00:03:48.639> the<00:03:48.729> original<00:03:49.209> I've<00:03:49.810> made

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
is the first in the original I've made

is the first in the original I've made
the<00:03:50.139> room<00:03:50.379> wider<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:52.150> put<00:03:52.419> a<00:03:52.449> groove<00:03:52.720> in<00:03:52.930> it

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
the room wider and I put a groove in it

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.349 
the room wider and I put a groove in it
to<00:03:53.560> lighten<00:03:54.159> it<00:03:54.220> up<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.790> make<00:03:54.940> up<00:03:55.120> for<00:03:55.299> the

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
to lighten it up to make up for the

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.920 
to lighten it up to make up for the
wider<00:03:55.569> rim<00:03:56.400> now<00:03:57.400> some<00:03:57.699> people<00:03:58.030> have<00:03:58.120> asked<00:03:58.479> why

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
wider rim now some people have asked why

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.199 
wider rim now some people have asked why
I<00:03:58.959> don't<00:03:59.379> put<00:04:00.040> a<00:04:00.069> series<00:04:00.459> of<00:04:00.489> holes<00:04:00.819> in<00:04:01.090> the

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
I don't put a series of holes in the

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.309 
I don't put a series of holes in the
floor<00:04:01.659> of<00:04:01.810> this<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:03.370> save<00:04:03.729> some<00:04:04.000> weight<00:04:04.239> and<00:04:04.780> my

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
floor of this to save some weight and my

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.860 
floor of this to save some weight and my
thought<00:04:05.590> trained<00:04:05.889> on<00:04:06.040> it<00:04:06.069> is<00:04:06.310> if<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.359> silicone

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
thought trained on it is if the silicone

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.140 
thought trained on it is if the silicone
ever<00:04:08.079> leaked<00:04:08.349> or<00:04:08.829> you<00:04:09.250> accidentally

ever leaked or you accidentally

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.890 
ever leaked or you accidentally
overfilled<00:04:10.780> it<00:04:10.930> on<00:04:11.079> some<00:04:11.349> dark<00:04:11.620> night<00:04:12.900> right

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
overfilled it on some dark night right

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.080 
overfilled it on some dark night right
now<00:04:14.109> it<00:04:14.409> would<00:04:14.560> just<00:04:14.590> pool<00:04:15.220> in<00:04:15.549> here<00:04:15.819> and<00:04:15.939> burn

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
now it would just pool in here and burn

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.370 
now it would just pool in here and burn
off<00:04:16.329> and<00:04:16.539> it<00:04:16.659> would<00:04:16.720> be<00:04:16.870> fine

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
off and it would be fine

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.409 
off and it would be fine
whereas<00:04:17.769> if<00:04:17.919> I<00:04:18.070> put<00:04:18.340> a<00:04:18.370> series<00:04:18.729> of<00:04:18.759> holes<00:04:19.060> in<00:04:19.329> it

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
whereas if I put a series of holes in it

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.390 
whereas if I put a series of holes in it
which<00:04:19.599> will<00:04:19.750> probably<00:04:19.959> save<00:04:20.470> me<00:04:20.680> less<00:04:20.889> than

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
which will probably save me less than

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.120 
which will probably save me less than
because<00:04:22.400> this<00:04:22.520> is<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:22.730> very<00:04:22.970> thin<00:04:23.270> bottle<00:04:24.130> then

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
because this is a very thin bottle then

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.740 
because this is a very thin bottle then
the<00:04:25.310> alcohol<00:04:25.460> could<00:04:25.880> run<00:04:26.060> down<00:04:26.270> through<00:04:26.480> and

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
the alcohol could run down through and

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.480 
the alcohol could run down through and
if<00:04:26.840> you're<00:04:26.990> using<00:04:27.200> it<00:04:27.470> say<00:04:27.770> inside<00:04:28.280> of<00:04:28.430> the

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
if you're using it say inside of the

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.390 
if you're using it say inside of the
tent<00:04:28.760> it<00:04:29.360> could<00:04:29.660> pose<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:30.320> problem<00:04:30.350> so<00:04:31.040> for<00:04:31.250> my

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400
