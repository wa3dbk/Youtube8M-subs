00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.030
 I was so fast, I was very fast. 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.770
 well trained yes we were very 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.140
 confident the team was all gathered 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.360
 this half hour now I will show you everything 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.700

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.640
 pupil has the power to knock his 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.659
 main weapon the trainings made the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.310
 difference 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.930
 we are doing an average of three to 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.420
 four hours a day during the 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.460
 training and the struggle in which he worked 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.130
 the errors defends health that would have to 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.860
 improve it now further intensifies the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.869
 rhythm workout gets stronger by training 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.580
 especially the part of his hand that is 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.049
 very heavy very heavy must have a 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.450
 power has to have a job 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.400
 isometric to ensure the fighter 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.409
 you are physically physically will not be 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.350
 well demonstrating its quality 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:08.320

 write your own story if in 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.310
 in front of me growing up more I think 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.989
 every athlete who trains strong enough to 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.329
 fight gets easier than the juninho case 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.140
 so it's a job so aggressive and 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:27.290
 very explosive 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:30.280
 fear is is that God is something bigger and I 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.280
 have not included in it 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.170
