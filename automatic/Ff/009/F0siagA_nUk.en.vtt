You just need rigid collodion, lipliner, concealer and some powder to create these scars.

00:00:52.434 --> 00:01:17.634
First draw the shape of your scar with your lipliner. White for old scars, reddish tones for fresh or healing scars.

00:01:18.114 --> 00:02:12.114
Now apply the rigid collodion to this area. every layer has to be dry. if the alcohol evaporates, your skin tightens. Apply as many layers as you want. The more layers, the deeper the scar.

00:02:23.954 --> 00:02:35.954
Note: try to get the same area as before for each layer.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:04:07.760
Now apply some concealer and after this some powder to get rid of the shine.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.360
