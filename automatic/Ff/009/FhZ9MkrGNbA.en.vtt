00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.500
 Today we are shaking a series of Fedor photon 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.660
 bro 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.840
 treshka white up to 40 grams joy 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.740
 athlete 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.740
 we load 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.440
 almost parabolic build close 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.400
 treshka light medium up to 60 grams mine 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:37.379
 great figure joy is probably the most 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.970
 The best of what I have seen is loading 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.850
 so she works on 2 and a half 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:50.809
 pound carp or similar liss 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:52.829
 Bunny 360 medium up to 80 grams 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.270
 perfect universal fishing pole 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.760
 almost this one fishing rod 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:08.580
 most of the needs are covered 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:11.190
 fisher amateur loading system close 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:19.410
 to perfect perfect throwing pass 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:21.960
 muddy build 360 to 100 grams more 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.970
 hard counterpart medium if required 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.259
 heavier feeders or some 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:33.060
 difficult fishing conditions 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:34.890
 can use this fishing rod under 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.100
 load immediately shows that it works 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.100
 differently 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:50.640
 and the last in the line is 390 medium 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.090
 heavy bit softer than I would like her 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.280
 see 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:04.830
 but quite a working fishing rod on medium 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:07.310
 distances we load works fine on 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.310
 any fish
