 next web app is against ajax 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.170
 this will be a very difficult one 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.600
 but I am the basis so that is 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.600

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.320

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:03.100

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.770
 deeply given 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.410
 Ajax from us in the attack kit kats 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.340
 pimples now shot in so that it out 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.980

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.890
 I mean there was a lift almost me 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.350
 unfortunately 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.490
 but the government is already within that 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.030
 ball 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.200
 the valves are going to shoot oh they will 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:31.320
 more 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.320
 exchange choice rests my backlog 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.090
 wanted nothing 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.220
 almost 200 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.680

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.340
 hell her had the deep to solo 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.320
 this ball can be deep and so can be 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.650
 I'm back and I'm not that fast I'm going 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:00.120
 shoot and disguise xvi 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:09.060
 goal against ajax 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:11.520
 a one what an important moment with 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.770
 old glassman games completely dead 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.919
 no breathability left but me 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:19.889
 I feel I am now more peaceful 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:22.620
 sprint sprint is printing the utility room 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:25.400
 that giant capital letters god and that 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.669
 goes from and i started nations you 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.669
 one one 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.690
 and after making the equalizer some 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:41.319
 you also removed it immediately 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:45.949
 this is oh and then let's lead 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:53.840
 for ajax to play through that separately 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:55.389
 wow wow really nice just before end 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.860
 natural and winning goal 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:59.120
 retailers have a pool's subscribers 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.180
 the session of 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.520
 why a lot less possession was 29 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.789
 are at 71% so ajax has oh 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:11.810
 deservedly won but what a pity this 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:15.590
 hear the ice look now 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.790
