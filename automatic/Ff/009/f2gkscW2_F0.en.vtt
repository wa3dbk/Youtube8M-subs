 the hold 2 so I find you 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.700
 today with a new video that 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.429
 is a video you had asked me 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.280
 somehow since it's one of 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.259
 survey results that I received so 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.750
 I'm the poll that you receive when 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.670
 you sign up for my blog koaci.com 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.539
 at the same time as the free ibook on the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.850
 day makeup 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.230
 so here I thank you for having 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.699
 asked for this are by chance I can 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.070
 you make videos that interest you 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.050
 really precisely so do not hesitate 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.910
 to answer the survey puts you in the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.180
 info bar if you're interested in 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.710
 that I can best meet your 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.700
 requests actually in May that there is this 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.380
 video i 'm going to show you how 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.300
 hide your greenhouse but really how 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.100
 hide them well so that's it 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.989
 not necessarily but I have dark circles 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.910
 I would even say services this is a 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.800
 horrible thing I actually posted a 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.260
 picture on instagram completely 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.890
 cleansing sgd simple right now 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.390
 rotten 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.370
 but I tell them not much is 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.600
 for that and fortunately it's not 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.129
 something would say but there more than 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.930
 makeup can help hide 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.120
 the sands so I showed you that all 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.980
 immediately with color correction 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.359
 I had also done an article on the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.460
 blog about that which I put you 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.500
 all this will be fake and stay 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.790
 connected to see the tutorial all of 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.220
 next and do not forget to subscribe 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.540
 kisses so the only thing I have 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.979
 used for now it's my bottom 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.780
 of themes so I used the background of 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.280
 dyed and hydrated fur that is 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.990
 super and who already has a little power 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.509
 covering a small answer we will have a 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.189
 good covering power so it's not bad 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.200
 at all it's really one of my 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.000
 favorite you 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.219
 so many times is there for 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.780
 really hide the Serbs you can 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.390
 see that I still have his greenhouses have 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.189
 however it's unbearable so I 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.539
 will use this palette from 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.259
 Catherine, so it's far from being the 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.750
 best in the world 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.819
 but hey it'll listen to 3.0 and she 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.159
 do not create too bad and I will 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.759
 actually use this coral color 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.850
 because actually the top salmon anjou 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.829
 like that is the complementary color 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.450
 blue so it'll be able to erase in 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.920
 does that will neutralize the blue color 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.229
 sabers and after one time we will have 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.240
 applied a concealer over a 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.189
 illuminator we will see them more so 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.349
 I used this brush at 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.270
 eradicate we do not really know how important 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:07.310
 it's all about fibers not being 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.929
 natural that is synthetic like that 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.970
 we are sure that the heavyweights will 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.900
 absorb products so I take a little 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.239
 700 and we will put it where we have the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.510
 blue so of course we only put where 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.730
 we are blue we do not put to others 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.030
 places otherwise it will be seen from me I 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.530
 am double here and especially we 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.959
 do not forget the corner of the eye 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.870
 here like that because there is a vein 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.079
 who pass here so necessarily it's done 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.079
 bang 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.240
 and now you are waiting for yourself 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.700
 look forward to it and it's over 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.709
 good kisses then 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.900
 once you come to that you 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.610
 are quite special I have to say so 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.100
 tight you can be afraid that it does not 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.260
 not work but it works so 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.820
 there I will use my anti-dark circles 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.800
 at nars which is really great 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.090
 in addition they illuminate whose agent 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.370
 is almost no longer unfortunately 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.020
 danger of seeing another use when 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.820
 it still seems more but if you 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.980
 I 'm here in one layer 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.480
 perfect so I'm here it's theirs 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.150
 Eden price but when you go home ns 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:16.250
 and I'm going to spades so is on my 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.830
 dark circles to make it all in the skin 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.400
 I used my little blender a video 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.140
 on common to use that interests you 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.480
 This is the easiest way 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.500
 really to get in to do 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.500
 penetrate into mac os 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.069
 and so the banter that we do not see 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.860
 you can not see the blue of the rings or the 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.790
 pink so like as I write you I 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.959
 did not have enough 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.810
 I am going to use this fine stroll of 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.130
 at mac which is also a cms tool which 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.780
 eliminates more and that's great 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.360
 it's a little bit orange 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.350
 so he contributes once more to 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.810
 to hide the Serbs 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.430
 spagnou an indispensable step me I 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.980
 do it because I have almost more 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.290
 the concealer but also you albert is 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.480
 really stubborn rings we're going to say 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.320
 it's also a good step because it's 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.459
 allows to illuminate still pocket 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.110
 and so you see we do not see 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.150
 the more Serbs and the more the red no 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.519
 more so there as usual I'm going 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.650
 apply my translucent powder from 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:25.020
 mac to avoid that all that in 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:28.000
 folds and I advise you to use 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.860
 another powder powder not quiet 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.580
 like that if you have you had to be 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.320
 taking a picture 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.889
 because it's going to make some marks 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.630
 white on the eyes so use a 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.150
 powder for example at banana browser she 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.680
 is really 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.080
 niall so I hope this video you 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.970

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.070
