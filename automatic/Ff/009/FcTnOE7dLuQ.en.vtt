00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
anymore but I do want to talk about

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.969 
anymore but I do want to talk about
black<00:01:50.399> ops<00:01:50.579> 2<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:52.079> noticed<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.799> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
black ops 2 and I noticed that in the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.569 
black ops 2 and I noticed that in the
first<00:01:53.220> black<00:01:53.520> ops<00:01:53.790> they<00:01:54.329> made<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.869> kimbo

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
first black ops they made the kimbo

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.880 
first black ops they made the kimbo
really<00:01:56.579> shitty<00:01:57.000> compared<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.560> modern

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
really shitty compared to the modern

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.620 
really shitty compared to the modern
warfare<00:01:59.009> series<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.119> lot<00:02:00.299> weaker

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
warfare series like it's a lot weaker

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.870 
warfare series like it's a lot weaker
and<00:02:00.960> more<00:02:01.229> inaccurate<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:02.009> not<00:02:02.159> as<00:02:02.280> strong<00:02:02.610> I

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
and more inaccurate it's not as strong I

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.959 
and more inaccurate it's not as strong I
guess<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.840> real<00:02:04.020> question<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.649> for<00:02:05.520> black<00:02:05.700> ops

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
guess the real question is for black ops

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.219 
guess the real question is for black ops
2<00:02:06.240> are<00:02:06.390> they're<00:02:06.540> going<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.719> keep<00:02:06.930> these

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
2 are they're going to keep these

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
that I'm not expecting much like I

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.520 
that I'm not expecting much like I

of online and play through the campaign

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.199 
of online and play through the campaign
which<00:02:50.410> took<00:02:50.560> me<00:02:50.769> maybe<00:02:50.890> like<00:02:51.190> four<00:02:51.640> hours<00:02:51.670> or

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.509 
which took me maybe like four hours or
some<00:02:52.420> crap<00:02:52.660> like<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.519> apparently

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
some crap like that and apparently

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.800 
some crap like that and apparently
they're<00:02:54.790> going<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:54.970> make<00:02:55.060> black<00:02:55.269> ops<00:02:55.480> into<00:02:55.780> a

really excited for Call of Duty series
in<00:03:11.049> general<00:03:11.260> until<00:03:11.859> they<00:03:12.069> make<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:12.849> next

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.690 
in general until they make the the next
generation<00:03:13.599> consoles<00:03:14.230> which<00:03:14.980> probably<00:03:15.400> will

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
generation consoles which probably will

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.940 
generation consoles which probably will
force<00:03:16.090> Activision<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:17.019> make<00:03:17.349> a<00:03:17.380> new<00:03:17.680> engine

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
they've been using the same engine for

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.819 
they've been using the same engine for
like<00:03:22.329> the<00:03:22.480> last<00:03:22.630> six<00:03:22.989> years<00:03:23.319> or<00:03:23.560> something

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
like the last six years or something

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.229 
like the last six years or something
like<00:03:24.010> that<00:03:24.450> whatever<00:03:26.669> so<00:03:27.669> what<00:03:27.880> would<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.030> like

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
like that whatever so what would I like

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.809

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
to see for black ops 2 I would like to

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.500 
to see for black ops 2 I would like to
see<00:03:31.209> them<00:03:31.620> expand<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.919> campaign<00:03:33.549> storyline<00:03:34.299> I

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
see them expand the campaign storyline I

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.379 
see them expand the campaign storyline I
really<00:03:34.840> thought<00:03:35.349> that<00:03:35.650> black<00:03:36.280> ops<00:03:36.549> was<00:03:36.880> the

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
really thought that black ops was the

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.960 
really thought that black ops was the
best<00:03:37.660> Call<00:03:38.049> of<00:03:38.079> Duty<00:03:38.410> series<00:03:38.650> in<00:03:39.549> terms<00:03:39.790> of

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
best Call of Duty series in terms of

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.970 
best Call of Duty series in terms of
campaign<00:03:40.329> storyline<00:03:41.230> had<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.769> best

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
campaign storyline had the best

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.339 
campaign storyline had the best
storyline<00:03:42.519> so<00:03:43.000> I<00:03:43.030> hope<00:03:43.239> they<00:03:43.450> will<00:03:43.750> continue

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
storyline so I hope they will continue

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.599 
storyline so I hope they will continue
the<00:03:44.470> story<00:03:44.650> line<00:03:44.859> from<00:03:45.130> black<00:03:45.340> ops<00:03:45.579> 2<00:03:45.819> and<00:03:46.030> 3<00:03:46.349> I
