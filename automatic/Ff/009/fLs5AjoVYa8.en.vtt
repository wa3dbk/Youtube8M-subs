00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.969 
don't know but anyway so let's get to
out<00:01:52.750> this<00:01:52.930> one<00:01:53.110> first<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.439> share<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.680> back<00:01:53.829> of

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
out this one first and share the back of

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.499 
out this one first and share the back of
the<00:01:54.070> package<00:01:54.369> so<00:01:54.399> we<00:01:54.520> don't<00:01:54.729> get<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:55.000> addresses

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
the package so we don't get to addresses

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:56.670

thing I can't turn this one around

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.670
