 Hi there, this is me Felix 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.720
 and I created a new channel called 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.990
 live steel and 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.700
 robot to look at this channel I will 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.730
 lay out videos that will 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.590
 to be told 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.050
 all the experiments that wrote save is 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.630
 both in the film and in the video mortal 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.420
 xbox and in game on 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:34.109
 on ios and android well let's get started 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:40.059
 the first robot in question is 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:43.210
 but in the winter this one got in the movie 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:47.309
 quite by accident at first instead 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:51.670
 should have been present on either a 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:55.269
 blockbuster since the author does not 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.839
 liked not like the look but because 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.609
 He wanted something more strange and 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.199
 blockbuster as unpacked as u 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.059
 he has a very small head and big 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.829
 hands but they will fall majesty 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:12.369
 triangles video of the nose and you fit all 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:14.170
 all the same add due to the fact that god 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.140
 Boston very fit voice 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.690
 management and he shouldn't have 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.990
 and 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.330
 maidas could not destroy him so 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.530
 blockbuster 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.500
 Well, as you know , the video game was 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.870
 invented before his weaknesses 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.630
 is settled above my diss 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:40.830
 on a robot tale purple adorn it 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.630
 Japanese sindom in the movie it was the second 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.730
 may which was in the hands of 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.570
 the protagonist he composed he was maidasa 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.570
 in underground battles 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.040
 built it destroyed it 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.660
 voice control switched to atom 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.780
 which will be discussed in the next video 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:10.220
 so what else to say about him was like 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.790
 and nothing more to say and can not 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:17.150
 the robot was coined to pull 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.150
 film producer 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.400
 no i don't remember the name but he came up with it 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.620
 the very first and at first did not want him 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.230
 add as I said later 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.510
 I did add a movie 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.110
 set the cut scene from the movie as 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.670
 Maidasa broke up blockbusters but matisse 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.209
 won there 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.400
 but it was a band and they had this scene you 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.940
 ran away decided to do everything on 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.250
 any but in general it's all thanks to all
