00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
here chai burst and chai wave I now use

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.339 
here chai burst and chai wave I now use
chai<00:04:31.199> wave<00:04:31.699> /<00:04:32.699> chai<00:04:32.939> burst<00:04:33.240> when<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:33.900> did<00:04:34.199> all<00:04:34.319> my

chai wave / chai burst when I did all my
challenge<00:04:34.800> modes<00:04:34.979> though<00:04:35.220> I<00:04:35.460> use<00:04:35.909> chai<00:04:36.210> burst

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
challenge modes though I use chai burst

challenge modes though I use chai burst
the<00:04:37.020> reason<00:04:37.379> being<00:04:37.500> is<00:04:37.710> when<00:04:37.860> I<00:04:37.889> was<00:04:38.069> reading

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
the reason being is when I was reading

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.119 
the reason being is when I was reading
up<00:04:38.520> about<00:04:38.669> it<00:04:38.849> what<00:04:39.300> I<00:04:39.330> found<00:04:39.840> was<00:04:40.169> Chivers<00:04:40.740> did

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 
up about it what I found was Chivers did

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:43.820 
up about it what I found was Chivers did
more<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.550> OE<00:04:41.729> damage<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:43.050> chai<00:04:43.349> wave<00:04:43.590> was

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
more I OE damage and chai wave was

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.399 
more I OE damage and chai wave was
better<00:04:44.039> on<00:04:44.129> a<00:04:44.250> single<00:04:44.729> target<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:46.110> biggest

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:46.409 
better on a single target the biggest

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:47.570 
better on a single target the biggest
thing<00:04:46.560> in<00:04:46.650> challenge<00:04:46.979> mode<00:04:47.009> is<00:04:47.280> obviously

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
thing in challenge mode is obviously

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.450 
thing in challenge mode is obviously
trash<00:04:47.939> pack<00:04:48.180> so<00:04:48.389> i<00:04:48.569> went<00:04:48.870> with<00:04:49.050> chai<00:04:49.409> burst<00:04:49.710> but

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
trash pack so i went with chai burst but

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.520 
trash pack so i went with chai burst but
I<00:04:50.520> do<00:04:50.580> now<00:04:50.879> use<00:04:51.090> char<00:04:51.389> wave<00:04:51.569> but<00:04:51.750> I<00:04:51.870> Rancho<00:04:52.379> Oso

Lucy<00:05:09.539> brew<00:05:09.690> is<00:05:09.810> really<00:05:10.110> powerful<00:05:10.319> in

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
Lucy brew is really powerful in

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.589 
Lucy brew is really powerful in
challenge<00:05:10.919> mode<00:05:10.949> so<00:05:11.280> chai<00:05:11.580> brew<00:05:11.819> works<00:05:12.060> really

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
challenge mode so chai brew works really

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.320 
challenge mode so chai brew works really
well<00:05:12.780> with<00:05:13.110> that<00:05:13.349> I<00:05:14.129> now<00:05:14.550> actually<00:05:14.940> play<00:05:15.150> with

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
well with that I now actually play with

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.129 
well with that I now actually play with
power<00:05:15.629> strikes<00:05:16.080> and<00:05:16.409> I<00:05:16.800> love<00:05:17.159> power<00:05:17.490> strikes

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
power strikes and I love power strikes

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.830 
power strikes and I love power strikes
so<00:05:19.139> realistically<00:05:20.270> anything<00:05:21.270> on<00:05:21.419> this<00:05:21.509> third

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
so realistically anything on this third

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.320 
so realistically anything on this third
line<00:05:22.169> is<00:05:22.469> viable<00:05:22.979> I<00:05:23.340> ran<00:05:23.789> with<00:05:24.000> ascension

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
line is viable I ran with ascension

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.999 
line is viable I ran with ascension
though<00:05:24.509> so<00:05:24.810> that<00:05:25.020> is<00:05:25.169> what<00:05:25.349> I<00:05:25.379> am<00:05:25.500> showing<00:05:25.620> you

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
though so that is what I am showing you

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.029 
though so that is what I am showing you
from<00:05:26.819> a<00:05:26.969> learner<00:05:27.180> perspective<00:05:27.750> I<00:05:27.900> think

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
from a learner perspective I think

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.279 
from a learner perspective I think
ascension<00:05:29.039> was<00:05:29.189> a<00:05:29.219> really<00:05:29.580> good<00:05:29.759> choice<00:05:30.289> but

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
ascension was a really good choice but

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.740 
ascension was a really good choice but
that<00:05:31.409> is<00:05:31.529> what<00:05:31.680> I<00:05:31.710> ran<00:05:31.979> with<00:05:32.159> next<00:05:32.969> line<00:05:33.180> level

that is what I ran with next line level

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.110 
that is what I ran with next line level
