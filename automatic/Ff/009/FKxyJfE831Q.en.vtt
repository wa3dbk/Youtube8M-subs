00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
difficult but this is where a lot of it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.030 
difficult but this is where a lot of it
happened<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.470> in<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> wards<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:10.979> were

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
happened and in the wards that were

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.800 
happened and in the wards that were
going<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.549> little<00:01:11.790> while<00:01:11.939> he<00:01:14.810> probably

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
going to in a little while he probably

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.469 
going to in a little while he probably
was<00:01:16.140> very<00:01:16.470> angry<00:01:17.430> with<00:01:17.580> what<00:01:17.790> had<00:01:17.939> happened<00:01:18.299> to

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.539 
was very angry with what had happened to
him<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.500> think<00:01:19.560> he<00:01:19.740> used<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.979> go<00:01:20.100> angry<00:01:20.400> with

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
him and I think he used to go angry with

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.880 
him and I think he used to go angry with
us<00:01:20.700> because<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:21.240> couldn't<00:01:21.540> really<00:01:22.259> understand

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
us because we couldn't really understand

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.219

him as far as she could see the trouble

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.080 
him as far as she could see the trouble
was<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.770> Ian's<00:01:29.040> nerves<00:01:29.369> were<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.610> badly

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
was that Ian's nerves were so badly

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.240 
was that Ian's nerves were so badly
damaged<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.840> no<00:01:31.290> one<00:01:31.439> had<00:01:31.560> odd<00:01:31.650> stock<00:01:31.979> really

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250

move his limbs but without
proprioception<00:01:42.450> he<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.200> couldn't<00:01:43.439> tell

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
proprioception he just couldn't tell

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.300 
proprioception he just couldn't tell
them<00:01:43.920> what<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.220> do

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.300 

ian<00:01:52.310> was<00:01:52.520> determined<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.180> walk<00:01:53.390> again<00:01:54.130> he<00:01:55.130> knew

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
ian was determined to walk again he knew

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.920 
ian was determined to walk again he knew
he<00:01:55.460> could<00:01:55.640> never<00:01:55.820> rebuild<00:01:56.360> his<00:01:56.570> damaged

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
he could never rebuild his damaged

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.410 
he could never rebuild his damaged
nerves<00:01:57.340> so<00:01:58.340> somehow<00:01:58.640> he<00:01:58.850> would<00:01:59.119> have<00:01:59.300> to

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
nerves so somehow he would have to

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.870 
nerves so somehow he would have to
bypass<00:01:59.720> them<00:02:02.770> if<00:02:03.770> he<00:02:03.979> was<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.250> regain<00:02:04.640> any

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
bypass them if he was to regain any

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.810 
bypass them if he was to regain any
control<00:02:05.390> over<00:02:05.600> his<00:02:05.750> limbs<00:02:06.049> he<00:02:06.950> had<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.250> forge<00:02:07.580> a

control over his limbs he had to forge a

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.239 
control over his limbs he had to forge a
new<00:02:07.850> link<00:02:08.270> between<00:02:08.630> mind<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.289> muscle<00:02:09.819> but<00:02:10.819> how

frustrating I've been sitting up for my

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.890 
frustrating I've been sitting up for my
life<00:02:34.650> until<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.040> point<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.639> suddenly<00:02:36.569> I<00:02:36.840> was

sitting up eventually
Ian<00:02:43.560> began<00:02:43.889> to<00:02:44.069> sense<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:44.669> solution

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
Ian began to sense that the solution

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.149 
Ian began to sense that the solution
might<00:02:45.419> lie<00:02:45.719> in<00:02:45.750> some<00:02:46.260> hidden<00:02:46.650> part<00:02:46.919> of<00:02:47.010> his

I was so euphoric I lost all control and
almost<00:03:22.259> fell<00:03:22.409> out<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.620> bed<00:03:22.769> again<00:03:23.009> because<00:03:23.370> I

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
almost fell out the bed again because I

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.490 
almost fell out the bed again because I
just<00:03:24.000> lost<00:03:24.389> control<00:03:24.479> about<00:03:24.959> keeping<00:03:25.409> the

now have to tell his brain what his

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.110 
now have to tell his brain what his
limbs<00:05:45.099> were<00:05:45.220> doing<00:05:45.639> I<00:05:47.340> could<00:05:48.340> move<00:05:48.490> my<00:05:48.550> hands<00:05:49.030> a

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
limbs were doing I could move my hands a

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.149 
limbs were doing I could move my hands a
bit<00:05:49.150> but<00:05:49.690> only<00:05:49.990> if<00:05:50.259> they<00:05:50.349> were<00:05:50.530> in<00:05:50.650> vision<00:05:51.009> and

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
bit but only if they were in vision and

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.339 
bit but only if they were in vision and
I<00:05:51.849> could<00:05:52.000> control<00:05:52.330> them<00:05:52.539> if<00:05:52.810> I<00:05:52.930> could<00:05:53.110> see<00:05:53.229> them

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
I could control them if I could see them

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:54.779 
I could control them if I could see them
but<00:05:53.440> as<00:05:53.530> soon<00:05:53.710> as<00:05:53.800> I<00:05:53.889> looked<00:05:54.099> away<00:05:54.280> they<00:05:54.639> would

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
but as soon as I looked away they would

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:57.149 
but as soon as I looked away they would
float<00:05:55.000> off<00:05:55.270> and<00:05:55.599> they<00:05:56.169> would<00:05:56.349> do<00:05:56.500> really

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:57.159 
float off and they would do really

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:58.890 
float off and they would do really
strange<00:05:57.520> things<00:05:57.819> I<00:05:57.940> mean<00:05:58.120> people<00:05:58.599> would<00:05:58.659> sit

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
strange things I mean people would sit

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.330 
strange things I mean people would sit
beside<00:05:59.259> me<00:05:59.409> might<00:05:59.590> be<00:05:59.620> turning<00:05:59.889> to<00:06:00.070> some<00:06:00.250> on

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
beside me might be turning to some on

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
the other side of the bed and the arm

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.450 
the other side of the bed and the arm
would<00:06:02.139> wander<00:06:02.349> off<00:06:02.590> and<00:06:02.620> hit<00:06:02.949> someone<00:06:03.310> or

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
would wander off and hit someone or

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.170 
would wander off and hit someone or
would<00:06:04.060> knock<00:06:04.270> something<00:06:04.539> off<00:06:04.750> the<00:06:04.900> cabinet

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
would knock something off the cabinet

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.399 
would knock something off the cabinet
but<00:06:07.180> it<00:06:07.240> was<00:06:07.330> very<00:06:07.509> frustrating<00:06:07.690> I<00:06:08.169> just

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409 
but it was very frustrating I just

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:10.830 
but it was very frustrating I just
