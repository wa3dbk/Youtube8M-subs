00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
I think that's that's basically it it's

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.960 
I think that's that's basically it it's
it's<00:05:07.860> not<00:05:08.040> going<00:05:08.190> to<00:05:08.250> have<00:05:08.340> any<00:05:08.460> other<00:05:08.670> content

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
it's not going to have any other content

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.080 
it's not going to have any other content
but<00:05:09.120> gaming<00:05:09.420> content<00:05:10.370> people<00:05:11.370> already<00:05:11.970> are

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
but gaming content people already are

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.090 
but gaming content people already are
streaming<00:05:12.480> on<00:05:12.690> justin.tv<00:05:13.170> and<00:05:13.650> you<00:05:14.010> know

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100
