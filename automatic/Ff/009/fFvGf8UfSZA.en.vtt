00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:14.170
 we have not felt quite well 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:18.070
 it opens it can go much more to much the 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:21.970
 I work the ball work and it has not been 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.770
 so strong and the issue of reinforcement is a 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.110
 subject that we do not handle ourselves 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.430
 we worry the people who are not only 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.169
 to arrive in the best way championship and 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.790
 then I the leaders and they see when 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.340
 reinforcements arrive that theme totally 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.170
 if they are obviously all very good 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.420
 players 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.039
 apart from that we end up folders 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.230
 past with a lot of confidence because 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.400
 we improve quite and obviously 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.770
 they wanted to play is to contribute 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.060
 too much equipment so hopefully it 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.450
 concrete then not to the subject the 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:54.320
 reinforcements also has not yet signed 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:56.060
 almost that we do not think about that subject 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.910
 the last game that I felt quite 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.140
 well and I think it's already a subject of 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.090
 process is that it decides who plays and 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.920
 who does not but while the 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.449
 games reinforcements 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.979
 but you deserve a good player and 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.119
 obviously it's going to be better because 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.740
 something has played quite some time in italy 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.940
 so 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.750
 It would be very good for you 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.060
 I think so with those players are 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.860
 all very good players 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.900
 apart from that we speak that champion 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.300
 has passed we finished in a very good way 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.680
 last games games with which 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.960
 they were hitting divisive championships 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.520
 to see quite badly in their little hole 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.580
 matches so we're very much 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.350
 confidence that you are seeing that is coming is going to 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.330
 be fighting up if we 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.330
 we have a very good group 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.460
 never mine there is bad milk everything always 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.960
 in good and obviously that in this 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.159
 time of long time of concentration 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.490
 we have to be more united than ever and 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.280
 and nothing good like a week more so 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.619
 you have to be with much encouragement and much 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.090
 companionship to avoid problems 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.659
 I personally have felt me pretty 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.659
 all right 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.100
 apart from another function they have been based 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.250
 a lot on the ball so that's very 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.570
 well and the teacher does not stress us that it is 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.520
 trans but we have to be the champion 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.500
 whatever it is and we are all working 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.560
 for that and we had clear equal 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.690
 but it is what improves the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.580
 trust in the team 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.470
 again all these trainings to 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.130
 every time it is stressed that the most 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.260
 important 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.410
 is the champion since it takes a long time 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.810
 without any title so for that 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.570
 We are working day by day and we want 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.230
 fight the championship or whatever the 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.230
 next year
