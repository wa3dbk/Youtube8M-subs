when you're inverting and when you're
doing<00:04:30.030> straddle<00:04:30.540> back

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
doing straddle back

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.310 
doing straddle back
try<00:04:32.310> not<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.520> place<00:04:33.300> your<00:04:33.480> arms<00:04:33.540> over<00:04:34.290> your
