00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.619

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.170
 to make keychains that can do this 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.509

 where you stand you see the team 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.520
 it's still what gives us what 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.479
 entrust the team is thin milk that 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.459
 takes shape pretty funny but then it's done 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.170
 a little flat we must admit that it 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:01.890
 3d may need to orient it a 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.189

 it costs not expensive at all busy 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:11.160

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.170
