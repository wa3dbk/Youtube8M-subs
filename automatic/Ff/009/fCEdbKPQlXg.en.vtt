first of all we look at some of the apps
and<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.360> do<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.810> I'm<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.770> put<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.490> iPad

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
and to do that I'm going to put the iPad

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.760 
and to do that I'm going to put the iPad
into<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> desk<00:01:12.600> might<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.140> make<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.409> easier<00:01:13.710> for

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
into a desk might to make it easier for

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
me to show you how do they work now

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.190 
me to show you how do they work now
we're<00:01:20.880> going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> look<00:01:21.540> at<00:01:21.750> some<00:01:22.049> of

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
we're going to have a look at some of

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.050 
we're going to have a look at some of
the<00:01:22.350> apps<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.890> we've<00:01:23.040> developed<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the apps that we've developed for the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.320 
the apps that we've developed for the
iPad<00:01:24.689> people<00:01:25.380> musicians<00:01:25.909> will<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> look

iPad people musicians will have a look

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.920 
iPad people musicians will have a look
at<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.799> idea<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.390> encourage

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
at and the idea of this is to encourage

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.920 
at and the idea of this is to encourage
somebody<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.710> look<00:01:32.100> around<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.700> screen<00:01:33.090> wait

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
somebody to look around the screen wait

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.020 
somebody to look around the screen wait
for<00:01:34.259> something<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.710> appear<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.460> then<00:01:35.700> touch

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
for something to appear and then touch

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.000 
for something to appear and then touch

one<00:01:43.010> of<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.280> important<00:01:43.850> features<00:01:44.300> of<00:01:44.450> this

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
one of the important features of this

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.540 
one of the important features of this
particular<00:01:45.020> up<00:01:45.380> is<00:01:45.710> actually<00:01:46.130> getting<00:01:46.370> the

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
particular up is actually getting the

particular up is actually getting the
children<00:01:46.940> used<00:01:47.330> to<00:01:47.480> waiting<00:01:47.750> I'm<00:01:48.380> not<00:01:48.650> just

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
children used to waiting I'm not just

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.130 
children used to waiting I'm not just
touching<00:01:49.370> the<00:01:49.460> screen<00:01:49.700> anywhere<00:01:50.210> it's<00:01:50.750> also<00:01:50.960> a

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
touching the screen anywhere it's also a

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.260 
touching the screen anywhere it's also a
really<00:01:51.350> valuable<00:01:51.680> assessment<00:01:52.550> tool<00:01:52.760> and<00:01:52.790> that

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
really valuable assessment tool and that

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.570 
really valuable assessment tool and that
we<00:01:53.420> can<00:01:53.690> help<00:01:53.990> decide<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:55.040> somebody's<00:01:55.430> able

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
we can help decide that somebody's able

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.490 
we can help decide that somebody's able
to<00:01:55.850> look<00:01:56.000> at<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.480> targets<00:01:56.930> on<00:01:57.080> different

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
to look at the targets on different

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:05.260 
to look at the targets on different
parts<00:01:57.800> of<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.040> screen<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:58.700> then<00:01:59.000> get<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.600> them

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.010 

we're<00:02:06.270> going<00:02:06.480> to<00:02:06.540> have<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.690> look<00:02:06.900> at

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
we're going to have a look at

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.219

and<00:02:10.590> ideas<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:11.550> how<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.790> are<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.990> look<00:02:13.170> at

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
and ideas on how you are and to look at

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.240 
and ideas on how you are and to look at
ways<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:15.150> expressing<00:02:15.540> those<00:02:15.959> so<00:02:16.920> we<00:02:17.070> can

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
ways of expressing those so we can

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.960 
ways of expressing those so we can
choose<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.490> character<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:19.590> we<00:02:19.860> get<00:02:20.070> symbols<00:02:20.670> of

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
choose a character and we get symbols of

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.870 
choose a character and we get symbols of
different<00:02:21.750> kinds<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.560> feelings<00:02:23.040> we<00:02:23.520> can<00:02:23.730> move

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
different kinds of feelings we can move

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.610 
different kinds of feelings we can move
through<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.390> symbols<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.990> look<00:02:25.170> for<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.470> one

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
through the symbols to look for the one

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.190 
through the symbols to look for the one
that<00:02:25.650> we<00:02:26.040> might<00:02:26.250> be<00:02:26.459> feeling<00:02:27.330> at<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.750> moment
