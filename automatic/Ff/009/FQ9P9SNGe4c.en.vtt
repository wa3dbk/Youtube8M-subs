opaque color which you can kind of see
here<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:30.000> these<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.320> some<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.650> these<00:00:31.710> images<00:00:32.160> I

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
here on these on some of these images I

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.770 
here on these on some of these images I
personally<00:00:35.070> like<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.850> clear<00:00:36.180> colors<00:00:36.540> better

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
personally like the clear colors better

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.090 
personally like the clear colors better
everything<00:00:37.410> looks<00:00:37.649> sort<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.860> like<00:00:37.920> you're

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
everything looks sort of like you're

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.040 
everything looks sort of like you're
building<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.460> stained<00:00:38.700> glass<00:00:38.809> which<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.930> which

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
building in stained glass which it which

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.770 
building in stained glass which it which
is<00:00:40.170> kind<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.410> neat<00:00:40.910> but<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.239> know<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.360> think<00:00:42.600> I

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
is kind of neat but you know I think I

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.779 
is kind of neat but you know I think I
think<00:00:42.840> price-wise<00:00:43.500> they're<00:00:44.040> similar<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.700> may

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
think price-wise they're similar it may

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:45.950 
think price-wise they're similar it may
actually<00:00:44.940> be<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> little<00:00:45.360> bit<00:00:45.450> cheaper<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.930> you

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
actually be a little bit cheaper if you

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.310 
actually be a little bit cheaper if you
buy<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.520> opaque<00:00:47.520> colored<00:00:48.059> pieces<00:00:48.750> which<00:00:49.200> they

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
buy the opaque colored pieces which they

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.750 
buy the opaque colored pieces which they
also<00:00:49.500> offer<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:51.199> there<00:00:52.199> are<00:00:52.379> also<00:00:52.530> other

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
also offer and there are also other

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.180 
also offer and there are also other
brands<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:54.059> are<00:00:54.300> very<00:00:54.539> similar<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.190> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
brands that are very similar to the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.970 
brands that are very similar to the
valve<00:00:56.489> tech<00:00:56.760> McIntyre's<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:58.559> some<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.859> them

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
valve tech McIntyre's and some of them

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.500 
valve tech McIntyre's and some of them
are<00:00:59.070> compatible<00:00:59.460> with<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.120> particular

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
are compatible with this particular

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.439 
are compatible with this particular
particular<00:01:01.350> set<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.520> haven't<00:01:03.000> actually<00:01:03.239> used

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
particular set I haven't actually used

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.630 
particular set I haven't actually used
any<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.989> those<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.260> can't<00:01:04.470> really<00:01:04.769> comment<00:01:05.369> on

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
any of those I can't really comment on

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.370 
any of those I can't really comment on
whether<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> construction<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.810> better<00:01:07.020> worse

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
whether the construction is better worse

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.780 
whether the construction is better worse
different<00:01:08.900> you<00:01:09.900> know<00:01:09.990> than<00:01:10.380> these<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:11.010> but

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
different you know than these but but

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.219 
different you know than these but but
but<00:01:12.060> certainly<00:01:12.299> these<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.630> been<00:01:12.750> very

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
but certainly these have been very

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.100 
but certainly these have been very
popular<00:01:13.470> thus<00:01:14.010> far<00:01:14.189> since<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:14.490> bought<00:01:14.670> them<00:01:15.110> we

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
popular thus far since we bought them we

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.960 
popular thus far since we bought them we
actually<00:01:16.259> saw<00:01:16.650> these<00:01:16.860> initially<00:01:17.490> at<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
actually saw these initially at the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.240 
actually saw these initially at the
Tulsa<00:01:18.240> Children's<00:01:18.840> Museum<00:01:19.259> about<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> month

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
Tulsa Children's Museum about a month

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.730 
Tulsa Children's Museum about a month
ago<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.729> then<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.270> looked<00:01:21.479> online<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.200> bought

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
ago and then I looked online and bought

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.280 
ago and then I looked online and bought
this<00:01:23.210> from<00:01:24.210> Amazon<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:24.930> about<00:01:25.049> one<00:01:25.259> hundred

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
this from Amazon for about one hundred

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.080 
this from Amazon for about one hundred
and<00:01:25.560> twenty<00:01:25.799> dollars<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.610> certainly<00:01:26.970> it's

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and twenty dollars and so certainly it's

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.330 
and twenty dollars and so certainly it's
not<00:01:27.150> it's<00:01:27.420> not<00:01:27.540> cheap<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.900> buy<00:01:28.200> these<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
not it's not cheap to buy these and the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.550 
not it's not cheap to buy these and the
reason<00:01:29.460> they<00:01:30.240> are<00:01:30.270> expensive<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.200> because

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
reason they are expensive is because

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.149 
reason they are expensive is because
these<00:01:31.829> tiles<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.729> fact<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.829> you<00:01:34.829> know

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
these tiles do in fact have you know

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.310 
these tiles do in fact have you know
considerable<00:01:35.579> number<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.320> rare-earth

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
considerable number of rare-earth

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.560 
considerable number of rare-earth
magnets<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.100> are<00:01:38.250> lined<00:01:39.090> along<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
magnets that are lined along the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.230 
magnets that are lined along the
perimeter<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.320> these<00:01:40.530> tiles<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.310> that

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
perimeter of all these tiles and that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.819 
perimeter of all these tiles and that
obviously<00:01:42.780> as<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.320> expense<00:01:43.710> now<00:01:44.340> if<00:01:45.439> this<00:01:46.439> box

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
obviously as the expense now if this box

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.249 
obviously as the expense now if this box
has<00:01:47.610> been<00:01:47.820> used<00:01:48.060> for<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.689> know<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> few

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
has been used for you know for a few

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.219 
has been used for you know for a few
weeks<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> packaging<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:52.140> know

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
weeks and so the packaging is you know

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.289 
weeks and so the packaging is you know
it<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.590> not<00:01:52.740> all<00:01:53.250> completely<00:01:53.670> here<00:01:54.030> there<00:01:54.180> was

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
it is not all completely here there was

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.719 
it is not all completely here there was
more<00:01:55.229> packaging<00:01:55.740> involved<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.280> what<00:01:56.610> you're

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
more packaging involved and what you're

weren't<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:58.770> all<00:01:59.070> crammed<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.610> here<00:01:59.759> exactly

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
weren't just all crammed in here exactly

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.399 
weren't just all crammed in here exactly
like<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.719> see<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.170> there<00:02:01.259> wasn't

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
like it like you see but there wasn't

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.340 
like it like you see but there wasn't
certainly<00:02:01.950> very<00:02:02.340> much<00:02:02.610> box<00:02:03.060> bloat<00:02:03.420> everything

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
certainly very much box bloat everything

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.419 
certainly very much box bloat everything
was<00:02:04.469> packed<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.979> quite<00:02:05.310> tightly<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.220> but

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
was packed in quite tightly and so but

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.249 
was packed in quite tightly and so but
overall<00:02:08.819> packaging<00:02:09.360> job<00:02:09.509> over<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.929> was<00:02:10.050> pretty

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
overall packaging job over it was pretty

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.290 
overall packaging job over it was pretty
moved<00:02:10.590> on<00:02:10.739> pretty<00:02:10.979> well<00:02:11.009> now<00:02:11.730> these<00:02:12.000> these

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
moved on pretty well now these these

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.580 
moved on pretty well now these these

minutes he had four or five other kids
that<00:03:35.970> were<00:03:36.030> there<00:03:36.150> playing<00:03:36.569> with<00:03:36.780> him<00:03:37.160> you

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
that were there playing with him you

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.129 
that were there playing with him you
know<00:03:38.359> they<00:03:39.359> all<00:03:39.450> had<00:03:39.599> a<00:03:39.630> really<00:03:39.750> good<00:03:39.930> time

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
playing with them and I would certainly

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.879 
playing with them and I would certainly
recommend<00:03:42.359> taking<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.230> look<00:03:43.380> at<00:03:43.500> these<00:03:43.590> if<00:03:43.799> you

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
recommend taking a look at these if you

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.009 
recommend taking a look at these if you
haven't<00:03:44.250> already<00:03:44.430> seen<00:03:44.849> them<00:03:45.090> they<00:03:45.630> are<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.810> lot

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
haven't already seen them they are a lot

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.990 
haven't already seen them they are a lot
of<00:03:46.139> fun<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.380> play<00:03:46.440> with<00:03:46.669> again<00:03:47.669> the<00:03:47.700> main

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
of fun to play with again the main

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.780 
of fun to play with again the main
downside<00:03:48.269> is<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.780> there<00:03:49.139> is<00:03:49.380> certainly<00:03:49.950> a

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
downside is that there is certainly a

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.809 
downside is that there is certainly a
relatively<00:03:51.480> high<00:03:51.720> cost<00:03:52.380> involved<00:03:52.859> for<00:03:53.340> these

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
relatively high cost involved for these

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.000 
relatively high cost involved for these
I<00:03:54.000> do<00:03:54.120> offer<00:03:54.299> smaller<00:03:54.690> sets<00:03:55.079> on<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.560> order<00:03:55.859> of

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
I do offer smaller sets on the order of

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.210 
I do offer smaller sets on the order of
30<00:03:56.280> pieces<00:03:56.579> or<00:03:57.000> 60<00:03:57.359> or<00:03:57.389> whatever<00:03:57.660> that<00:03:58.440> cost

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
30 pieces or 60 or whatever that cost

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.629 
30 pieces or 60 or whatever that cost
less<00:03:59.579> but<00:04:00.109> you<00:04:01.109> know<00:04:01.590> it's<00:04:01.769> in<00:04:02.040> terms<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.430> you

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
less but you know it's in terms of you

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.550 
less but you know it's in terms of you
know<00:04:02.730> cost<00:04:03.000> per<00:04:03.450> piece<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:04.049> one<00:04:04.169> harder<00:04:04.410> piece

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
know cost per piece the one harder piece

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.650 
know cost per piece the one harder piece
that<00:04:04.829> is<00:04:04.980> is<00:04:05.220> more<00:04:05.489> economical<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.180> even<00:04:06.480> at<00:04:06.630> a

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
that is is more economical you even at a

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.629 
that is is more economical you even at a
higher<00:04:06.840> twenty<00:04:07.200> dollars<00:04:07.500> then<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.340> smaller

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
higher twenty dollars then the smaller

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.159 
higher twenty dollars then the smaller
sets<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.450> will<00:04:09.540> definitely<00:04:09.630> run<00:04:09.930> into<00:04:09.989> a

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
sets and you will definitely run into a

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.400 
sets and you will definitely run into a
problem<00:04:10.620> if<00:04:10.799> you<00:04:11.069> do<00:04:11.720> have<00:04:12.720> more<00:04:13.079> than<00:04:13.139> one

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
problem if you do have more than one

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.199 
problem if you do have more than one
child<00:04:13.620> playing<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:14.760> have<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:14.940> smaller

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
child playing and you have a smaller

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.779 
child playing and you have a smaller
size<00:04:15.540> because<00:04:15.690> certainly<00:04:16.320> these<00:04:17.010> tiles<00:04:17.489> you

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
size because certainly these tiles you

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.060 
size because certainly these tiles you
know<00:04:17.880> it's<00:04:18.389> so<00:04:18.599> easy<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:19.079> build<00:04:19.229> something<00:04:19.590> you

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
know it's so easy to build something you

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.649 
know it's so easy to build something you
know<00:04:20.160> very<00:04:20.190> large<00:04:20.669> they're<00:04:21.000> very<00:04:21.150> fast<00:04:21.359> with

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
know very large they're very fast with

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.570 
know very large they're very fast with
these<00:04:21.750> tiles<00:04:22.260> that<00:04:22.950> you're<00:04:23.250> going<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.430> have<00:04:23.550> a

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
these tiles that you're going to have a

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.560 
these tiles that you're going to have a
situation<00:04:23.760> we're<00:04:24.090> going<00:04:24.210> to<00:04:24.270> run<00:04:24.390> out<00:04:24.479> of

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
situation we're going to run out of

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.360 
situation we're going to run out of
tiles<00:04:24.780> in<00:04:25.050> a<00:04:25.140> very<00:04:25.320> short<00:04:25.620> order<00:04:25.770> if<00:04:26.520> you<00:04:26.580> have

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
tiles in a very short order if you have

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.560 
tiles in a very short order if you have
you<00:04:27.520> know<00:04:27.639> more<00:04:27.820> than<00:04:27.970> one<00:04:28.060> child<00:04:28.240> playing

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
you know more than one child playing

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.180 
you know more than one child playing
with<00:04:28.690> them<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.080> so<00:04:29.169> that<00:04:29.199> can<00:04:29.500> obviously<00:04:29.800> be<00:04:30.160> a

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
with them and so that can obviously be a

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.920 
with them and so that can obviously be a
problem<00:04:30.580> in<00:04:30.669> terms<00:04:30.699> of<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.600> know<00:04:31.660> fighting

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
problem in terms of you know fighting

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.960 
problem in terms of you know fighting
over<00:04:32.199> tiles<00:04:32.440> and<00:04:32.740> that<00:04:33.130> kind<00:04:33.340> of<00:04:33.370> thing

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
over tiles and that kind of thing

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.939 
over tiles and that kind of thing
and<00:04:34.449> so<00:04:34.750> it<00:04:34.870> is<00:04:34.960> worth<00:04:35.139> knowledge<00:04:35.500> of<00:04:35.590> a<00:04:35.650> larger

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
and so it is worth knowledge of a larger

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.580 
and so it is worth knowledge of a larger
set<00:04:36.990> did<00:04:37.990> you<00:04:38.020> know<00:04:38.110> just<00:04:38.260> because<00:04:38.440> of<00:04:38.560> that

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
set did you know just because of that

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.050 
set did you know just because of that
the<00:04:39.220> other<00:04:39.370> thing<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:39.550> have<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.669> watch<00:04:39.820> out

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
the other thing you have to watch out

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.700 
the other thing you have to watch out
for<00:04:40.090> again<00:04:40.600> they<00:04:40.750> use<00:04:40.900> these<00:04:41.080> tiles<00:04:41.380> do<00:04:41.650> you

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
for again they use these tiles do you

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.680 
for again they use these tiles do you
have<00:04:41.919> these<00:04:42.610> rare<00:04:42.850> earth<00:04:43.000> magnets<00:04:43.419> that<00:04:43.510> are

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
have these rare earth magnets that are

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.420 
have these rare earth magnets that are
that<00:04:43.900> are<00:04:44.050> very<00:04:44.080> powerful<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:44.889> line<00:04:45.160> the

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
that are very powerful that line the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.640 
that are very powerful that line the
perimeter<00:04:45.850> of<00:04:46.560> these<00:04:47.560> tiles<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:48.310> so<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:50.560> know

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
perimeter of these tiles and so you know

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.230 
perimeter of these tiles and so you know
you<00:04:50.710> have<00:04:50.919> to<00:04:51.040> be<00:04:51.160> very<00:04:51.400> careful<00:04:51.820> that<00:04:51.850> the

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
you have to be very careful that the

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.360 
you have to be very careful that the
tiles<00:04:52.600> don't<00:04:53.020> get<00:04:53.139> broken<00:04:53.560> every<00:04:53.860> time<00:04:54.070> these

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
tiles don't get broken every time these

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.909 
tiles don't get broken every time these
magnets<00:04:54.790> come<00:04:55.000> out<00:04:55.150> with<00:04:56.110> small<00:04:56.320> children<00:04:56.620> in

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
magnets come out with small children in

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.890 
magnets come out with small children in
case<00:04:57.130> you<00:04:57.340> might<00:04:57.760> have<00:04:57.820> situation<00:04:58.389> where<00:04:58.510> you

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
case you might have situation where you

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.600 
case you might have situation where you
know<00:04:58.960> someone<00:04:59.260> tries<00:04:59.440> to<00:04:59.470> swallow<00:04:59.979> these<00:05:00.310> as

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
know someone tries to swallow these as

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.060 
know someone tries to swallow these as
obviously<00:05:01.080> big<00:05:02.080> magnets<00:05:02.560> they<00:05:02.740> will<00:05:02.889> stick

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
obviously big magnets they will stick

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.700 
obviously big magnets they will stick
together<00:05:03.220> it<00:05:03.639> will<00:05:03.760> cause<00:05:03.970> all<00:05:04.270> types<00:05:04.539> of<00:05:04.710> of

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
together it will cause all types of of

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.290 
together it will cause all types of of
problems<00:05:06.190> in<00:05:06.280> the<00:05:06.340> digestive<00:05:06.760> system<00:05:07.060> if<00:05:07.180> I<00:05:07.240> do

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
problems in the digestive system if I do

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.379 
problems in the digestive system if I do
clump<00:05:07.870> together<00:05:08.020> and<00:05:08.550> clamp<00:05:09.550> on<00:05:09.789> to<00:05:10.030> you<00:05:10.300> know

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
clump together and clamp on to you know

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.150 
clump together and clamp on to you know
various<00:05:10.660> things<00:05:10.900> as<00:05:11.139> I<00:05:11.440> try<00:05:11.590> to<00:05:11.620> pass<00:05:11.860> through

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
various things as I try to pass through

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.850 
various things as I try to pass through
and<00:05:12.340> so<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:13.870> know<00:05:13.960> there<00:05:14.199> are<00:05:14.320> warnings<00:05:14.710> on<00:05:14.800> a

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
and so you know there are warnings on a

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.820 
and so you know there are warnings on a
box<00:05:15.070> about<00:05:15.340> that<00:05:15.550> and<00:05:15.850> these<00:05:16.750> tiles<00:05:17.380> do<00:05:17.590> have

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
box about that and these tiles do have

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.620 
box about that and these tiles do have
they<00:05:18.220> are<00:05:18.340> glued<00:05:18.639> and<00:05:18.940> you<00:05:19.090> have<00:05:19.240> riveting

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
they are glued and you have riveting

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.770 
they are glued and you have riveting
along<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:21.340> corner<00:05:21.699> as<00:05:21.820> the<00:05:21.850> bigger<00:05:22.120> tiles<00:05:22.389> in

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
along the corner as the bigger tiles in

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.480 
along the corner as the bigger tiles in
fact<00:05:22.990> everything<00:05:23.500> also<00:05:23.800> you<00:05:24.310> know<00:05:24.370> in<00:05:24.460> various

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
fact everything also you know in various

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.790 
fact everything also you know in various
points<00:05:25.000> in<00:05:25.090> between<00:05:25.180> and<00:05:25.990> so<00:05:26.530> they<00:05:26.650> are

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
points in between and so they are

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.159 
points in between and so they are
they're<00:05:27.130> very<00:05:27.160> durable<00:05:27.699> and<00:05:28.150> you<00:05:28.690> know<00:05:28.780> these

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
they're very durable and you know these

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.870 
they're very durable and you know these
have<00:05:29.350> been<00:05:29.470> abused<00:05:30.100> considerably<00:05:30.669> since

have been abused considerably since

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.670 
have been abused considerably since
we've<00:05:31.060> had<00:05:31.210> them<00:05:31.450> and<00:05:31.750> there's<00:05:31.960> been<00:05:32.139> no<00:05:32.320> signs

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
we've had them and there's been no signs

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.770 
we've had them and there's been no signs
of<00:05:32.860> cracking<00:05:33.130> or<00:05:33.460> anything<00:05:33.669> with<00:05:34.450> any<00:05:34.660> of

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
of cracking or anything with any of

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.050 
of cracking or anything with any of
these<00:05:34.840> tiles<00:05:35.320> and<00:05:35.470> so<00:05:35.620> I<00:05:35.650> do<00:05:35.950> thus<00:05:36.460> far<00:05:36.729> appear

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
these tiles and so I do thus far appear

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.450 
these tiles and so I do thus far appear
to<00:05:37.180> be<00:05:37.240> very<00:05:37.360> durable<00:05:37.740> but<00:05:38.740> again<00:05:38.950> you<00:05:39.160> have<00:05:39.310> to

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
to be very durable but again you have to

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.580 
to be very durable but again you have to
watch<00:05:39.639> these<00:05:39.880> carefully<00:05:40.450> to<00:05:40.990> make<00:05:41.110> sure<00:05:41.169> that

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
watch these carefully to make sure that

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.390 
watch these carefully to make sure that
you<00:05:42.070> aren't<00:05:42.310> uh<00:05:42.760> you<00:05:43.570> know<00:05:43.889> seeing<00:05:44.889> any<00:05:45.039> damage

that may be tempted to you know try to

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.629 
that may be tempted to you know try to

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
swallow these magnets you know at some

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.430 
swallow these magnets you know at some
point<00:06:06.699> in<00:06:06.880> time<00:06:07.060> but<00:06:07.389> otherwise<00:06:07.780> they<00:06:08.050> are<00:06:08.080> a

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
point in time but otherwise they are a

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.100 
point in time but otherwise they are a
great<00:06:08.740> building<00:06:09.160> toy<00:06:09.310> and<00:06:09.669> I<00:06:10.479> know<00:06:10.599> they've

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
great building toy and I know they've

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.730 
great building toy and I know they've
been<00:06:11.229> used<00:06:11.530> in<00:06:12.070> schools<00:06:12.729> as<00:06:12.940> well<00:06:13.060> and<00:06:13.510> so<00:06:14.410> it's

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
been used in schools as well and so it's

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.320 
been used in schools as well and so it's
definitely<00:06:14.949> a<00:06:15.220> fun<00:06:15.400> thing<00:06:15.520> to<00:06:15.580> look<00:06:15.729> into<00:06:16.060> if

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
definitely a fun thing to look into if

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.430 
definitely a fun thing to look into if
you're<00:06:16.539> looking<00:06:16.750> for<00:06:16.900> another<00:06:17.020> type<00:06:17.410> of

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
you're looking for another type of

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.920 
you're looking for another type of
building<00:06:17.889> toy<00:06:18.039> besides<00:06:18.520> Legos<00:06:18.970> or<00:06:19.210> that<00:06:19.750> kind

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
building toy besides Legos or that kind

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.980 
building toy besides Legos or that kind
of<00:06:19.960> thing<00:06:20.430> again<00:06:21.430> downside<00:06:21.940> is<00:06:22.060> is<00:06:22.270> the<00:06:22.780> cost

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
of thing again downside is is the cost

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.330 
of thing again downside is is the cost
but<00:06:24.090> certainly<00:06:25.090> thus<00:06:25.690> far<00:06:25.960> it's<00:06:26.320> turned<00:06:27.250> out

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
but certainly thus far it's turned out

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.370 
but certainly thus far it's turned out
to<00:06:27.430> be<00:06:27.490> useful<00:06:27.669> for<00:06:27.970> us<00:06:28.180> my<00:06:28.720> son<00:06:29.080> is<00:06:29.199> playing

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
to be useful for us my son is playing

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.710 
to be useful for us my son is playing
with<00:06:29.590> them<00:06:29.740> everyday<00:06:30.520> for<00:06:31.030> for<00:06:31.330> quite<00:06:31.479> a<00:06:31.510> long

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
with them everyday for for quite a long

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.310 
with them everyday for for quite a long
time<00:06:32.020> and<00:06:32.710> so<00:06:32.860> at<00:06:33.039> least<00:06:33.130> in<00:06:33.430> terms<00:06:33.550> of<00:06:34.050> of<00:06:35.050> use

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
time and so at least in terms of of use

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.170 
time and so at least in terms of of use
it's<00:06:35.620> been<00:06:35.770> worth<00:06:35.950> the<00:06:35.979> cost<00:06:36.310> for<00:06:36.580> us<00:06:36.669> thus<00:06:36.940> far

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
it's been worth the cost for us thus far

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.390 
it's been worth the cost for us thus far
but<00:06:37.810> certainly<00:06:38.590> look<00:06:38.740> around<00:06:39.010> see<00:06:39.159> if<00:06:39.190> you<00:06:39.280> can

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
but certainly look around see if you can

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.890 
but certainly look around see if you can
find<00:06:39.520> a<00:06:39.669> you<00:06:40.030> know<00:06:40.090> a<00:06:40.150> good<00:06:40.270> price<00:06:40.539> again<00:06:40.810> we

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
find a you know a good price again we

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.270
