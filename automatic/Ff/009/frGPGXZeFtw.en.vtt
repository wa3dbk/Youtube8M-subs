and but you're just gonna lay those down
on<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> table<00:01:00.420> next<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.859> each<00:01:01.859> other<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
on the table next to each other so that

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.370 
on the table next to each other so that
we<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.910> see<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.690> difference<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:05.040> them<00:01:05.460> and

we can see the difference in them and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.780 
we can see the difference in them and
we're<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> go<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.010> weave<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.580> is

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
we're going to go to the weave this is

we're going to go to the weave this is
the<00:01:08.970> weave<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.799> put<00:01:11.010> between

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the weave here and that is put between

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.950 
the weave here and that is put between
the<00:01:11.460> two<00:01:11.670> knots<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.090> as<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.479> see<00:01:12.540> there's
