00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.320
 butterfield 4 we are on the resort map 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.620
 of hainán or hajnal I do not know since I do not 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.629
 this the name is so weird and good is 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.190
 something very simple and it is not nonsense 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.900
 It is not nothing special either, I was 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.220
 around here taking a walk I did not get on 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.949
 what was the building from catacamas 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.019
 to see and when I was here as 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.299
 I just let myself fall worth this was 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.979
 the second time I try it because the 

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:56.640
 the first time was when I realized the 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:58.500
 good of equal pressure of the trick is 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.960
 say well this is xbox one I do not know 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.580
 if in other consoles it was the same but 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.229
 good is just on top of this 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.750
 fixed voucher poster and more or less where 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.210
 I go and it's in this part of here 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.970
 building ok we can go through here 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.130
 but just in this area is not 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.890
 solid and here is what happens that 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.040
 you can see 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.409
 inside of what is the inside of what 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.050
 what is the building what is happening 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.300
 we can be there or whether I escaqueado 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.740
 we just get inside the 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.890
 wall we have half a body inside 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.810
 body outside we can kill people 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.130
 Well, in principle those who are here 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.630
 inside where you are pointing now not 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.150
 we can kill them we can not cross the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.610
 wall but those that are outside if 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.259
 we can kill it I was here 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.700
 I realized this later as you see 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.400
 because it was a game I just for 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.630
 check how well quietly it is worth and 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.390
 The truth is that those who are outside 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.150
 you can kill me okay after a while 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.740
 it happened as in others 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.050
 failings of this is so in butterfield 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.730
 maps are mapped to the other maps that I 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.320
 chance meeting and after the 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.270
 while I realize that there are people who 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.000
 it 's getting worth it no longer means 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.980
 that this is not already known but that I 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.390
 but against chance but I've 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.509
 seen people who get in here or 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.280
 be that you know this this site not in 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.070
 other maps also in the same suit 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.520
 as I said this is xbox one I do not know 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.250
 if in 360 or in a play 3 I do not know if it is 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.840
 the same but we can get you 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.790
 in here and basically that's not and you 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.700
 you can defend a little and good for 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.150
 who wants to defend against this if you see 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.480
 in this area of ​​the building some campero 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.550
 Over there 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.470
 you know tucked inside the wall with ya 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.580
 you know how they get it worth so nothing 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.050
 it is simply this I hope that I have 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.820
 liked if you liked to vote I like it 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.900
