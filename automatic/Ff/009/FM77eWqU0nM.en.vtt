for a lot less cheaper than him so i was

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.420 
for a lot less cheaper than him so i was
stupidly<00:01:48.180> enough<00:01:48.630> putting<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:49.140> 15k<00:01:50.009> buying

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
for and so how much PK was going for

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.060 
for and so how much PK was going for
over<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.390> past<00:02:14.570> week<00:02:14.780> or<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:15.320> then<00:02:15.380> he's

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
over the past week or so and then he's

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.860 
over the past week or so and then he's
going<00:02:16.220> for<00:02:16.340> around<00:02:16.460> about<00:02:16.580> 28<00:02:17.090> k<00:02:17.240> bar<00:02:17.450> now<00:02:17.630> so

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
going for around about 28 k bar now so

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.900 
going for around about 28 k bar now so
if<00:02:17.990> I<00:02:18.110> could<00:02:18.260> pick<00:02:18.500> them<00:02:18.590> out<00:02:18.740> for<00:02:19.040> anyway<00:02:19.760> like

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
if I could pick them out for anyway like

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.030 
if I could pick them out for anyway like
25<00:02:20.330> k<00:02:20.600> which<00:02:21.050> is<00:02:21.080> going<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.440> be<00:02:21.500> cheapest<00:02:21.950> on

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
25 k which is going to be cheapest on

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.250 
25 k which is going to be cheapest on
the<00:02:22.070> market<00:02:22.160> I<00:02:22.430> could<00:02:22.610> list<00:02:22.760> them<00:02:22.850> over<00:02:23.260> 27,000

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
the market I could list them over 27,000

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.530 
the market I could list them over 27,000
similar<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.160> 50<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:25.700> then<00:02:25.760> people<00:02:26.000> buy<00:02:26.360> that

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
similar to 50 and then people buy that

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.330 
similar to 50 and then people buy that
instantly<00:02:27.020> so<00:02:27.680> it's<00:02:28.070> a<00:02:28.130> really<00:02:28.250> good

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
instantly so it's a really good

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.790 
instantly so it's a really good
technique<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:29.030> would<00:02:29.960> definitely<00:02:30.530> recommend
