00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:13.089
 Karabakh 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.089
 as a rule 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.210
 but 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.439
 however reactions 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.460
 when I 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.750
 finally gathered 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.240
 anyway when that came out compilation 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.360
 includes club headquarters 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.840
 partners have intense 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 training played so everything is in the past 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.250
 pieces of motives needed 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.760
 add now first 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.470
 I thought 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.330
 stability is not enough for us because it 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.900
 whatever you say but 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.700
 time of necessity 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.700
 we will feel a connection 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.860
 will there be a result i drew attention to 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.979
 the fact that you are very often shifted from the flank to 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.600
 center and not just what is called 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.450
 on the episode it is a whole piece of the game 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.020
 in our Putin's team 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.020
 active defenders and by and large 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.060
 my task is to 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.020
 paramushir shishkin as much as possible 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.020
 participated 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.830
 attacking actions 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.540
 for that no 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.200
 exempt flank 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.079
 and are you ready in principle to oblige 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.470
 yourself leading role in midfield 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.750
 I do not know how to answer I am ready 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.750
 why not 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.989
 just i'm never easy 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.459
 always hard plus a team I think that 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.049
 he 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.879
 good team argue but on them 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.949
 but not everything works 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:28.029
 we need 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:30.519
 comes north your football 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.009
 achieve results 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:33.519
 I want to 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.439
 start a new world series again 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.519
 going to 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.309
 grow well
