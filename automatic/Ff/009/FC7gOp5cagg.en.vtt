00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.300
 we are at the fair hyundai stand 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.650
 just a few words or better 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.279
 letter two numbers 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.650
 the winds that the real big news one 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.320
 if we want to be honest though 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.160
 certainly the main of all 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.529
 hyundai world 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.930
 what are the characteristics of this 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.369
 new car and what are its points of 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.260
 power 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.510
 then it is absolutely great 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.000
 news from the world each as last year 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.950
 I presented the new i10 this year 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.870
 we present the new i20 then the new one 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.260
 born of segment b 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.030
 this car is a car designed 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.570
 developed designed and produced in 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.160
 Europe for European consumers and has 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.600
 substantially three major points of 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.680
 strength for all the design and style 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.640
 that you can admire on the stand here in paris 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.149
 habitability at the top of the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.010
 category 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.359
 the space eventually becomes one 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.489
 key feature for 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.019
 the use of this car and then of the 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.689
 driving dynamic therefore a pleasure of 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.630
 guide this too of absolute 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.260
 excellence without neglecting quality e 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.570
 the attention to detail the quality of the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.979
 detail so I have to say that we are 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.320
 really satisfied and we think of 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.750
 being able to make a difference on this one 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.900
 on this machine 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.659
 however it is not only design and engines 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.520
 but it is also technology and comfort between 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.689
 the other I remember when I saw the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.909
 first official photos 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.920
 the interiors impressed me a lot 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.650
 are some very special goodies 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.299
 like the standard dashboard mount 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.659
 that I remember but I don't remember 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.610
 have never seen it on other cars are are 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.110
 important details because in the end there is 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.640
 an update on what it is 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.140
 the use that is made of it today 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.180
 technology obviously the car will have 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.350
 also a satellite navigator and yes 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.219
 they will be able to choose all the various 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.829
 options 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.090
 but we thought that today with i 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.399
 our smartphones 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.900
 almost everyone has a smartphone is a lot 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.550
 easier to have 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.350
 has a place to lodge in 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.640
 car ready away with all the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.290
 information at your fingertips 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.150
 so a little trick that can 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.860
 but here too the difference is 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.150
 absolutely yes the comfort of this 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.190
 machine I think it will surprise 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.130
 a large number of consumers 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.100
 drivers is a car where you don't need to 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.930
 make a sacrifice to fit in or to 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.760
 have daily use 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.080
 you can go with the family are 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.670
 five real places of great comfort 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.880
 this is now a little curiosity 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.560
 my if they can be honest 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.130
 we had the opportunity to try the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.080
 app mode which was one of the cars of 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.640
 your production more integrated 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.010
 with the world of smartphones and gods 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.670
 tablets that are now more or less widespread 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.520
 in the hands of anyone the i20 as follows 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.230
 this road this road aside like 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.270
 we have said for the support and for the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.740
 navigators around the beginning we will have 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.720
 in fact, we will focus on this 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.850
 but very simple thing of the fact that there 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.470
 we entrust the instrument that will already have the 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.150
 customer without asking him maybe one 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.990
 additional expense for a complicated one 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.970
 the technology that the car has, however, we will have 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.910
 we already have then then naturally 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.130
 available satellite doctor and in 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.770
 future obviously we have the possibility 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.390
 to surprise again in the sense of 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.590
 sias of the sound edition of the app 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.960
 fashions that are a little ours 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.760
 features lasts in the range of 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.130
 have other solutions with a maybe e 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.550
 of integrated technologies where you can 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.740
 surf the internet so many others 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.630
 surprises for our aficionados 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.400
 consumers 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.790
 then we close with one last detail 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.330
 this surprise when it comes then 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.400
 let's say this surprise comes 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.740
 at the end of November already in the concessions 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.780
 Italians we will have a very short month of 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.700
 presale which will be only December then at 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.190
 great audience in all 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.730
 dealerships we will launch at the beginning 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.850
 of January 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.920
 can you tell us why price still not but 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.730
 what I can say is that philosophy 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.230
 of hyundai is an accessibility and a 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.760
 we say product availability of 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.530
 this level of quality for the 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.150
 great public certainly will not be 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.860
 for an elite then what we want 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.200
 to position ourselves in the heart of the market 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.730
 that is the petrol segment both of the 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.310
 diesel engines 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:25.390
 obviously also in that gpl then 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.630
 we are sure our customers 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.430
 will have a price absolutely in the 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.090
 heart of the market without having to do 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.890
 excessive efforts and above all will have to 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.140
 arrangement as it was also for 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.970
 the i10 accessibility formulas that 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.320
 will make it very easy to sit e 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.320
 lead by the winds
