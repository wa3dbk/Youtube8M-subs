00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.180
 this tutorial shows briefly how 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.279
 draw a room and divide the 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.189
 surfaces in different areas for 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.230
 tile and color them in the design tool 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.200
 of the look this is done in the first 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.919
 two tables called room and dvd 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.919
 surfaces 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.260
 when you had the application then create 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.840
 the room using the creation vizard 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.720
 guided set at the height of the room 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.940
 and the basic shape to customize in 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.850
 then customize the size 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.570
 or change sides and corners to create 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.570
 more complex forms 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.940
 the last state of the villar allows you to 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.940
 insert windows or simple doors 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.050
 openings on the walls of your room 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.840
 select the type of opening you want 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.580
 enter size is set 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.680
 choose where to place the opening at 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.540
 center to the right or left 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.809
 enter the elevation value of the 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.809
 floor 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.090
 in the first tab you will see the room you have 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.310
 created up to this point there is a 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.830
 account pro you can continue to use 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.840
 functions that we will see now otherwise you can 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.460
 continue those next steps for 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.380
 tile placement e 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.360
 of the renault in the panel below a 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.119
 right you can move the 3d preview 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.280
 using the right click and select one 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.680
 surface to avoid once 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.509
 selected a surface this will come 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.860
 displayed in the 2d view on the 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.690
 left sheet 2 demonstrates the shape 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.299
 of the surface above a grid 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.789
 you can move the view by holding down 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.740
 mouse wheel and moving 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:58.920
 scrolling the wheel forward backwards 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:01.259
 you can also zoom in by dragging one 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.060
 blue clips can move a vertex a 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.630
 one side of the room 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.799
 by holding ctrl or cmd on all macs 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.750
 the movements will engage 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.880
 automatically the points in the grid 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.010
 below in order to be more 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.709
 precise 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.099
 then group more points so as to 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.140
 move them together with the mouse track 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.239
 a rectangle from left to right for 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.370
 select two or more points 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.750
 once selected the points yes 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.250
 they turn green and it is possible 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.250
 move them as a group 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.569
 to cancel the selection of prizes and lights 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.640
 on the keyboard when you change them 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.450
 room size sometimes you can 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.459
 make mistakes 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.829
 these are shown in red on the sheet 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.659
 2 of fans in these cases then cancel 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:51.750
 the last operation performed by pressing the 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:53.640
 button to nothing by clicking on one of the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.280
 filippo rossi opens a list of 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.260
 options then move a point, for example 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.720
 at a precise distance or 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.609
 remove it completely by acting on a 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.040
 side you can use many options for 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.239
 divide it into those segments take it o 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.519
 changing the length 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.720
 also then add niches or arches 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.720
 with specific dimensions 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.820
 for every surface of the room there are 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.590
 of the options at the top right for the 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.870
 floor then insert surfaces 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.280
 to create column stairs or any 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.230
 another positive element 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.730
 the new surface can be 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.190
 hooked to the center of the room 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.800
 maybe a wall after setting 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.690
 the elevation, width and height then 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.690
 modify it freely in view 2 of 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.510
 selects the surface of a wall 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.650
 in the 3d view over the surfaces you can 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.780
 add new openings 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.790
 this procedure is the same as seen in 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.400
 precedence during lizard thanks a 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.980
 room once positioned the opening 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.730
 then move it or modify it freely 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.730
 in the sight guide 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.510
 the next tab is called on DVD 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.860
 surfaces and works exactly in the 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.390
 same way 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.129
 in this section of the program you can 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.959
 create subdivision areas 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.359
 inside the floor of the walls 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.030
 these areas will be useful later 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.109
 during the insertion of the tiles 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.940
 follow us in the next video to see 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.180
 how to place tiles in your 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.180
 project
