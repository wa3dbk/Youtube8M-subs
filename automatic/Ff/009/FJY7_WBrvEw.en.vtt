00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
got fifteen iron eight gold which is you

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.020 
got fifteen iron eight gold which is you
know<00:02:18.269> good<00:02:18.480> enough<00:02:18.510> by<00:02:19.380> itself<00:02:20.130> but<00:02:20.790> if<00:02:20.910> we

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
know good enough by itself but if we

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.880 
know good enough by itself but if we
keep<00:02:21.239> going<00:02:21.450> down<00:02:21.720> almost<00:02:22.560> all<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.769> way<00:02:22.829> to

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
keep going down almost all the way to

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.110 
keep going down almost all the way to
bedrock<00:02:23.100> we<00:02:24.060> hit<00:02:24.269> this<00:02:24.510> massive<00:02:25.410> patch<00:02:25.709> of

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
bedrock we hit this massive patch of

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.270 
bedrock we hit this massive patch of
just<00:02:27.120> crazy<00:02:27.780> crazy<00:02:28.380> amounts<00:02:28.829> of<00:02:28.919> resources

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
just crazy crazy amounts of resources

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.809 
just crazy crazy amounts of resources
here<00:02:29.519> so

here so
even<00:02:30.450> more<00:02:30.629> iron<00:02:31.129> we're<00:02:32.129> now<00:02:32.370> 16<00:02:33.000> 17<00:02:33.569> 18<00:02:33.810> 19<00:02:34.109> 20

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
even more iron we're now 16 17 18 19 20

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.030 
even more iron we're now 16 17 18 19 20

diamonds so you know that's nothing
biggest<00:02:48.870> diamond<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.400> little<00:02:50.670> patch<00:02:51.120> in

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
biggest diamond and a little patch in

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.110 
biggest diamond and a little patch in
the<00:02:51.420> world<00:02:51.599> but<00:02:52.439> we<00:02:52.620> grabbed<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.819> many

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
the world but we grabbed so many

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.640 
the world but we grabbed so many
different<00:02:54.420> resources<00:02:54.689> throughout<00:02:55.530> this

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
different resources throughout this

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.809 
different resources throughout this
thing<00:02:55.859> and<00:02:56.040> there's<00:02:56.159> also<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.489> nice<00:02:56.760> little

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
thing and there's also a nice little

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.420 
thing and there's also a nice little
patch<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.180> coal<00:02:57.510> over<00:02:57.720> here<00:02:57.870> as<00:02:57.959> well<00:02:58.139> so<00:02:58.430> it's

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
patch of coal over here as well so it's

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.250 
patch of coal over here as well so it's
a<00:02:59.549> great<00:02:59.670> it's<00:02:59.969> just<00:03:00.269> absolutely<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.870> great<00:03:00.989> way

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
a great it's just absolutely a great way

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.679 
a great it's just absolutely a great way
to<00:03:01.290> start<00:03:01.739> off<00:03:01.889> a<00:03:02.129> let's<00:03:02.909> player<00:03:03.150> survival

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
to start off a let's player survival

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.280 
to start off a let's player survival
world<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.829> in<00:03:05.129> the<00:03:05.519> end<00:03:05.639> we<00:03:05.790> had<00:03:05.909> 24<00:03:06.540> iron<00:03:06.810> eight

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
world so in the end we had 24 iron eight

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.119 
world so in the end we had 24 iron eight
gold<00:03:07.739> four<00:03:08.609> diamonds<00:03:08.939> and<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:10.049> believe<00:03:10.439> eight

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
gold four diamonds and I believe eight

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.970 
gold four diamonds and I believe eight
redstone<00:03:11.760> maybe<00:03:12.030> maybe<00:03:12.419> less<00:03:12.720> maybe<00:03:13.500> six<00:03:13.799> it

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
redstone maybe maybe less maybe six it

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.119 
redstone maybe maybe less maybe six it
might<00:03:14.099> have<00:03:14.189> been<00:03:14.480> anyway<00:03:15.480> that<00:03:15.689> is<00:03:15.840> just<00:03:16.129> so

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
might have been anyway that is just so

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.539 
might have been anyway that is just so
Kranz<00:03:17.519> packed<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:18.900> crammed<00:03:19.109> packed<00:03:19.319> full<00:03:19.470> of

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
Kranz packed so crammed packed full of

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.250 
Kranz packed so crammed packed full of
amazing<00:03:20.549> amounts<00:03:21.450> of<00:03:21.540> resources<00:03:21.989> now<00:03:22.109> if<00:03:22.200> we

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
amazing amounts of resources now if we

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.619 
amazing amounts of resources now if we
look<00:03:22.409> at<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.709> rest<00:03:22.889> of<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.040> world<00:03:23.540> there's<00:03:24.540> a

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
look at the rest of the world there's a

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.929 
look at the rest of the world there's a
huge<00:03:25.230> mountain<00:03:25.859> right<00:03:25.980> here<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.819> know

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939 
huge mountain right here so you know

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.369 
huge mountain right here so you know
that's<00:03:27.209> not<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.540> that's<00:03:27.900> not<00:03:28.079> the<00:03:28.139> only

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
that's not the that's not the only

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.649 
that's not the that's not the only
aspect<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.919> the<00:03:28.980> seed<00:03:29.250> there's<00:03:29.430> out<00:03:29.609> also<00:03:29.819> some

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
aspect of the seed there's out also some

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.659 
aspect of the seed there's out also some
pretty<00:03:30.930> sweet-looking<00:03:31.260> terrain<00:03:31.829> around<00:03:32.370> the

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
pretty sweet-looking terrain around the

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.710 
pretty sweet-looking terrain around the
area<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.299> a<00:03:33.329> nice<00:03:33.870> little<00:03:34.879> mix<00:03:35.879> up<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.239> biomes

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
area and a nice little mix up of biomes

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.589 
area and a nice little mix up of biomes
there<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:36.989> guess<00:03:37.199> so<00:03:38.069> this<00:03:38.310> seed<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.449> would

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
there I guess so this seed I would

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.479 
there I guess so this seed I would
definitely<00:03:39.989> recommend<00:03:40.109> to<00:03:40.650> anybody<00:03:40.949> starting

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
definitely recommend to anybody starting

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.399 
definitely recommend to anybody starting
up<00:03:41.609> a<00:03:41.729> new<00:03:41.879> survival<00:03:42.239> world<00:03:42.359> or<00:03:42.720> let's<00:03:43.199> play

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
up a new survival world or let's play

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.949 
up a new survival world or let's play
world<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:44.489> jump<00:03:45.299> right<00:03:45.419> into<00:03:45.599> the<00:03:45.720> world<00:03:45.870> and

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
world to jump right into the world and

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.170 
world to jump right into the world and
get<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.109> ton<00:03:46.440> of<00:03:46.620> resources<00:03:47.310> right<00:03:47.729> off<00:03:47.909> the<00:03:48.060> bat

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
get a ton of resources right off the bat

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.409 
get a ton of resources right off the bat
so<00:03:48.449> you<00:03:49.440> know<00:03:49.560> creative<00:03:50.010> it's<00:03:50.280> not<00:03:50.549> as<00:03:50.819> good

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
so you know creative it's not as good

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.629 
so you know creative it's not as good
you<00:03:51.780> know<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:52.079> might<00:03:52.229> be<00:03:52.260> good<00:03:52.409> for<00:03:52.639> the

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
you know it might be good for the

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.599 
you know it might be good for the
terrain<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.359> things<00:03:54.659> but<00:03:54.979> that<00:03:55.979> the<00:03:56.340> extra
