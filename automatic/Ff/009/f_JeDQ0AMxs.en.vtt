off this this cylinder a little bit
using<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:20.960> flexing<00:00:23.539> from<00:00:24.539> brush<00:00:24.869> research<00:00:26.180> that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
using a flexing from brush research that

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.830 
using a flexing from brush research that
would<00:00:27.330> be<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.570> baby<00:00:27.840> right<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:29.660> they<00:00:30.660> come

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
from flex cone I keep it in like that so

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.290 
from flex cone I keep it in like that so
that<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.469> doesn't<00:00:43.469> get<00:00:43.590> too<00:00:43.710> messy<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.250> then<00:00:45.210> I
