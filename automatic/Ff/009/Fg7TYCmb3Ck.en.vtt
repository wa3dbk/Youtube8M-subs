which you would expect from a battery
like<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:33.989> then<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.200> becomes<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.590> design

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
like that but then it becomes a design

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.220 
like that but then it becomes a design
element<00:00:35.130> as<00:00:35.430> well<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:36.030> from<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> yoga<00:00:37.020> name

can<00:01:05.489> we<00:01:05.580> do<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.030> one<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
can we do with that one of the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.270 
can we do with that one of the
challenges<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:07.020> people<00:01:07.380> always<00:01:07.560> accessorize

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
challenges if people always accessorize

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.039 
challenges if people always accessorize
so<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> twist<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.970> little<00:01:09.000> bit<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.659> stand

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
so you twist a little bit and the stand

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.980 
so you twist a little bit and the stand
pops<00:01:10.380> right<00:01:10.650> out<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.610> gives<00:01:11.850> us<00:01:12.180> stand

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
pops right out so this gives us stand

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.700 
pops right out so this gives us stand
mode<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.560> then<00:01:14.010> tilt<00:01:14.460> mode<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:14.939> well<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.869> then

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
mode and then tilt mode as well so then

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.100
