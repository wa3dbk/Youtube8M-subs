the 25th anniversary line of the
Transformers<00:00:12.110> you<00:00:13.110> can<00:00:13.230> see<00:00:13.349> him<00:00:13.469> here<00:00:13.740> with

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
Transformers you can see him here with

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.109 
Transformers you can see him here with
universe<00:00:15.240> Inferno<00:00:16.460> he's<00:00:17.460> slightly<00:00:17.730> bigger

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
universe Inferno he's slightly bigger

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.400 
universe Inferno he's slightly bigger
than<00:00:18.210> Inferno<00:00:19.580> and<00:00:20.580> with<00:00:21.420> universe<00:00:21.869> onslaught

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
than Inferno and with universe onslaught

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.480 
than Inferno and with universe onslaught
he's<00:00:23.310> almost<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.939> same<00:00:24.119> size<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.750> girth<00:00:24.990> as

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
he's almost the same size and girth as

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.880 
he's almost the same size and girth as
onslaught<00:00:26.510> so<00:00:27.510> it's<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.900> pretty<00:00:28.080> big<00:00:28.380> boy<00:00:28.619> your

figure<00:00:29.300> ok<00:00:30.300> let's<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.840> these<00:00:30.960> two<00:00:31.109> out<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
figure ok let's get these two out of the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.720 
figure ok let's get these two out of the
way<00:00:32.510> and<00:00:33.510> focus<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.940> dr.<00:00:35.940> prime<00:00:37.399> he<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
way and focus on dr. prime he is the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.940 
way and focus on dr. prime he is the
repaint<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.719> Cybertron<00:00:40.260> vector<00:00:40.680> prime

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
repaint of the Cybertron vector prime

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.360 
repaint of the Cybertron vector prime
which<00:00:41.460> was<00:00:41.610> done<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.850> white<00:00:42.770> gold<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
which was done in white gold and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.139 
which was done in white gold and
metallic<00:00:45.300> turquoise<00:00:45.899> or<00:00:46.620> electric<00:00:47.579> blue<00:00:50.149> it's

metallic turquoise or electric blue it's

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.830 
metallic turquoise or electric blue it's
a<00:00:51.300> very<00:00:51.510> good<00:00:51.719> mold<00:00:52.100> exactly<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.250> same<00:00:53.460> mold

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
a very good mold exactly the same mold

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.810 
a very good mold exactly the same mold
as<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.590> original<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.370> has<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.640> same

articulation only difference is the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.000 
articulation only difference is the
color<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.030> paint<00:01:00.300> scheme<00:01:00.539> even<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.649> key<00:01:01.859> is

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
color the paint scheme even the key is

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.210 
color the paint scheme even the key is
different<00:01:03.019> it's<00:01:04.019> now<00:01:04.260> amber<00:01:04.799> instead<00:01:05.100> of

electric translucent blue the key still

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.750 
electric translucent blue the key still
does<00:01:08.189> nothing<00:01:09.560> just<00:01:10.560> get<00:01:10.740> stored<00:01:11.070> there<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.640> I

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
does nothing just get stored there but I

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.179 
does nothing just get stored there but I
prefer<00:01:12.090> him<00:01:12.240> her<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.409> key<00:01:13.590> him<00:01:13.890> without<00:01:14.010> the

gorgeous black and silver the only

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.359 
gorgeous black and silver the only
difference<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.659> material<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.590> made<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
difference is the material is made of a

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.980 
difference is the material is made of a
rubbery<00:01:23.880> plastic<00:01:24.150> material<00:01:26.330> perhaps<00:01:27.330> because

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
rubbery plastic material perhaps because

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.590 
rubbery plastic material perhaps because
of<00:01:28.140> safety<00:01:28.350> issues<00:01:29.270> compared<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.479> the

of safety issues compared to the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.399 
of safety issues compared to the
original<00:01:30.689> which<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.170> hard<00:01:31.500> plastic<00:01:32.119> ok

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
original which is hard plastic ok

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.399 
original which is hard plastic ok
the<00:01:34.890> wings<00:01:35.130> are<00:01:35.400> also<00:01:35.869> made<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.140> soft

the wings are also made of a soft
pliable<00:01:37.829> plastic<00:01:39.290> which<00:01:40.290> makes<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.710> very

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
pliable plastic which makes it very

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.249 
pliable plastic which makes it very
difficult<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.520> open<00:01:41.670> them<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.869> nevertheless

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
difficult to open them but nevertheless

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.260 
difficult to open them but nevertheless
it's<00:01:43.770> still<00:01:43.920> good<00:01:44.220> said<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> good<00:01:45.390> touch<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.840> it
