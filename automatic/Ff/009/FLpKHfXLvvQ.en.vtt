in<00:00:00.269> this<00:00:00.870> video<00:00:01.170> I'd<00:00:01.260> like<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.439> cover<00:00:01.740> writing

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
in this video I'd like to cover writing

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.630 
in this video I'd like to cover writing
to<00:00:02.520> an<00:00:02.610> ECU<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.780> first<00:00:04.020> step<00:00:04.290> is<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.830> connect

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
to an ECU the first step is to connect

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.550 
to an ECU the first step is to connect
your<00:00:05.700> wallet<00:00:06.450> tracing<00:00:06.810> interface<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.410> both

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
your wallet tracing interface to both

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.070 
your wallet tracing interface to both
the<00:00:07.740> ECU<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.730> your<00:00:08.849> computer<00:00:09.269> if<00:00:09.840> you're

you've been fall or open an existing bin

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.470 
you've been fall or open an existing bin
file<00:00:55.430> so<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.730> example<00:00:56.969> I'm<00:00:57.270> going<00:00:57.420> to

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
file so for this example I'm going to

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.430 
file so for this example I'm going to
open<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:58.020> Kawasaki<00:00:58.800> zx-10r<00:00:59.460> bin<00:01:00.180> file<00:01:00.440> once

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
open a Kawasaki zx-10r bin file once

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.049 
open a Kawasaki zx-10r bin file once
you've<00:01:01.590> done<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.100> right<00:01:02.280> ECU<00:01:02.789> button

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
you've done that the right ECU button

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.210 
you've done that the right ECU button
becomes<00:01:03.359> available<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.989> once<00:01:04.979> you've<00:01:05.070> gone

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
becomes available so once you've gone

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.670 
becomes available so once you've gone
through<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.760> made<00:01:06.180> various<00:01:06.540> changes<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
through and made various changes to the

through and made various changes to the
bin<00:01:07.860> file<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.510> you're<00:01:09.510> ready<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.840> write<00:01:10.260> to

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
bin file and you're ready to write to

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.370 
bin file and you're ready to write to
the<00:01:10.799> ECU<00:01:11.240> click<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.420> right<00:01:12.600> ECU<00:01:13.080> button

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the ECU click the right ECU button

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.289 
the ECU click the right ECU button
because<00:01:14.220> we've<00:01:14.340> made<00:01:14.520> changes<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.119> bin

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
because we've made changes to the bin

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.640 
because we've made changes to the bin
file<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.689> software<00:01:16.049> will<00:01:16.200> prompt<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.619> to

step is to read the serial number the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.929 
step is to read the serial number the
next<00:01:28.020> step<00:01:28.320> will<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.650> erase<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.759> contents
