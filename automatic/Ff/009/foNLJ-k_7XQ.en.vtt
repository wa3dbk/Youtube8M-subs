00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.200
 Hello how are you 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.929
 hoeness we will be a standard review without technique 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.879
 this center of the game carlos juárez poster 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.789
 developed by techland 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.419
 and second because I myself 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.419
 this second installment with the title carlos paz 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.630
 the story is simply the city argument that states 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.270
 united on the traffic and violence that exists in the border area between 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.859
 mexico and the united states this restart is an attack the agency 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.360
 federal government, which is why the fear of 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.890
 gringos of any attack they end up formulating that the members of 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.789
 that the poster 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.249
 They have infiltrated the agencies and, as always, they want to 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:45.950
 eliminate at all costs this evil 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.530
 the government takes action on the matter and as a last clear option that always 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.590
 I report 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.040
 a special force that the only one capable of ending the cartel is you and you 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.770
 team 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.710
 this took another of the main characters villegas set to travel the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.940
 zones to exterminate all the evil the gringo assumes if the story is not his 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.940
 strong or anything like that so we passed another point 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.340
 the game model is where everything stinks the control of them do not even slow down 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.400
 that inverted controls are a bad idea it feels like any sps 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.270
 without evolution without improvements there are times that your character only dedicates to shoot 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.820
 the first Mexican who looks like him and he loses all feelings of play 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.280
 coming to take a role too much of secondary 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.400
 the weapons are the same as any fpf in a few words at this point 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.400
 there is nothing important either, we pass to the other 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.090
 the theme of graphics mcguinness also but up there models two people 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.430
 they are very marked they do not have factions look square without movement 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.299
 envelope makes two pistols look square almost as if they were made by 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.299
 away and there is not anything proven the rich one another landscape can happen 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.299
 unnoticed 0 then nothing important 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.650
 in this game the music or the search does not exist as it does exist 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:19.039
 unnoticed are very poor tune that have nothing of idealization in the 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.789
 game or importance 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:25.829
 but more the sounds of guns and machine guns according to the voices 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:26.719
 they sound good 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:31.169
 however, the model occurs to them and they do not move their mouth when they talk a huge 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:34.169
 game failure 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:41.969
 is the typical online of any fps game has the same modalities not 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.689
 has a queue in exciting poser missions seriously what happens to people 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.689
 scallop 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:53.370
 in conclusion as I have noticed that parents assume play 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.790
 bad panamanian mamés is a little over the top do not have anything important 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.810
 mino value the mission are very clumsy has a pure game system and without 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.190
 importance we believe that people stress you cost more game for 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.679
 commitment that for want 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:10.719
 since we hope that the one that is thrown all orchard fire detailed and 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:12.929
 never said the parents there is going 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:17.009
 also bad because I see better that they are put to make worth more by instinct in 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:21.089
 instead of distributing mulero videojueguil mystic as this title was more 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:24.369
 away from the controversy within the game that the game itself 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.859
 If he wants to play we recommend you rent it or if you want it 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.449
 buy these warned 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:33.519
 this vote of about five streets hours depending on how many 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.989
 decades in the elections and I want to have fun with the online but for 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.089
 we are one more prize that joins the amount reached by koke min
