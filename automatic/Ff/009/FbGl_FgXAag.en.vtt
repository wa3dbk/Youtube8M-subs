00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
which is very important for this build

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.310 
which is very important for this build
then<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.670> retaliation<00:01:03.329> lasting<00:01:03.660> 25%

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
then you have retaliation lasting 25%

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.469 
then you have retaliation lasting 25%
longer<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.700> have<00:01:05.970> constant

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
longer so you can have constant

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.399 
longer so you can have constant
retaliation<00:01:07.049> uptime<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.479> let<00:01:09.479> people<00:01:09.630> just

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
retaliation uptime and let people just

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.560 
retaliation uptime and let people just
nail<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.280> if<00:01:11.400> they<00:01:11.520> want<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.180> they<00:01:12.240> will

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
nail on you if they want but they will

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.649

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
die too activating a virtue of resolved

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.120 
die too activating a virtue of resolved
removes<00:01:15.869> three<00:01:16.080> conditions<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.799> also

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
removes three conditions this is also

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.340 
removes three conditions this is also
very<00:01:17.220> important<00:01:17.640> because<00:01:17.930> this<00:01:18.930> doesn't<00:01:19.140> have

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
very important because this doesn't have

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.929 
very important because this doesn't have
as<00:01:19.470> much<00:01:19.590> condition<00:01:20.009> removal<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:20.580> some<00:01:20.820> other

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
as much condition removal as some other

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.039 
as much condition removal as some other
builds<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.049> need<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:24.049> pop

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
builds so you need to have this and pop

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.830 
let's just switch the hammer here
instead<00:03:04.040> we<00:03:04.340> have<00:03:04.489> some<00:03:04.760> extra<00:03:05.030> retaliation

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840

knock someone back and then put this
down<00:03:13.790> on<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:14.000> point<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.810> can<00:03:15.019> allow<00:03:15.140> us<00:03:15.350> to<00:03:15.470> cap

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
down on a point it can allow us to cap

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:16.990 
down on a point it can allow us to cap
it<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:15.980> then<00:03:16.070> we<00:03:16.190> switch<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.400> this<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:16.940> we

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
it and then we switch to this and we

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.060 
it and then we switch to this and we
have<00:03:17.120> another<00:03:17.299> knock<00:03:17.510> back<00:03:17.720> like<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.260> and<00:03:18.590> by

have another knock back like so and by

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.039 
have another knock back like so and by
that<00:03:19.220> time<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.760> can<00:03:19.910> often<00:03:20.180> actually<00:03:20.660> just

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
that time you can often actually just

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.240 
that time you can often actually just
cap<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.380> point<00:03:21.620> without<00:03:21.739> even<00:03:22.040> killing

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
cap the point without even killing

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.819 
cap the point without even killing
anyone<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:23.780> that's<00:03:23.959> very<00:03:24.079> useful<00:03:24.350> for<00:03:24.769> when

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
anyone so that's very useful for when

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.130 
anyone so that's very useful for when
you're<00:03:24.980> holding<00:03:25.280> points<00:03:25.640> but<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.510> normal

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
have stability for a long time but

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.009 
have stability for a long time but
otherwise<00:04:05.380> I'd<00:04:06.380> go<00:04:06.799> with<00:04:06.920> this<00:04:07.630> then<00:04:08.630> we<00:04:08.810> have

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
otherwise I'd go with this then we have

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.559 
otherwise I'd go with this then we have
this<00:04:09.380> stability<00:04:09.650> as<00:04:10.220> well<00:04:10.280> as<00:04:10.970> a<00:04:11.060> stun<00:04:11.299> break

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
this stability as well as a stun break

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.259 
this stability as well as a stun break
which<00:04:12.290> is<00:04:12.440> very<00:04:12.620> useful<00:04:13.040> for<00:04:13.069> stomping<00:04:13.819> or<00:04:14.060> all

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269

slot we already have some condition
removal<00:05:42.810> from<00:05:43.020> here<00:05:43.949> and<00:05:44.159> from<00:05:44.219> just<00:05:44.729> a

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
removal from here and from just a

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.779 
removal from here and from just a
passive<00:05:45.840> that<00:05:46.020> rose<00:05:46.680> conditions<00:05:47.070> from<00:05:47.460> us<00:05:47.639> for

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
passive that rose conditions from us for

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:49.100 
passive that rose conditions from us for
10<00:05:47.880> seconds<00:05:48.210> so<00:05:48.330> we<00:05:48.419> don't<00:05:48.599> need<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:48.960> other

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
10 seconds so we don't need the other

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.629 
10 seconds so we don't need the other
cygnet<00:05:49.620> we're<00:05:50.159> just<00:05:50.219> going<00:05:50.400> to<00:05:50.460> use<00:05:50.550> this

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
cygnet we're just going to use this

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.439 
cygnet we're just going to use this
block<00:05:50.940> to<00:05:51.690> keep<00:05:51.840> us<00:05:52.020> alive<00:05:52.229> longer<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:53.449> just

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:54.449 
block to keep us alive longer and just

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.770 
block to keep us alive longer and just
for<00:05:54.599> the<00:05:54.659> healing<00:05:54.919> and<00:05:55.919> I<00:05:56.880> believe<00:05:57.210> that<00:05:57.240> is

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
for the healing and I believe that is

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.399 
for the healing and I believe that is
the<00:05:58.050> whole<00:05:58.500> build<00:05:58.860> I<00:05:59.449> hope<00:06:00.449> you<00:06:00.750> find<00:06:01.259> it
