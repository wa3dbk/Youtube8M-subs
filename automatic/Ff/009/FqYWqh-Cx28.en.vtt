00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.669 
order to give themselves great chances
to<00:01:37.820> win<00:01:38.000> he<00:01:38.509> also<00:01:38.719> was<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.020> little<00:01:39.049> frustrated<00:01:39.619> a

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
to win he also was a little frustrated a

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.469 
to win he also was a little frustrated a
little<00:01:39.740> concerned<00:01:40.219> about<00:01:40.369> Evan<00:01:40.820> Turner<00:01:41.060> going

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
little concerned about Evan Turner going

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.630 
little concerned about Evan Turner going
down<00:01:41.689> but<00:01:42.560> I<00:01:42.590> think<00:01:42.619> he<00:01:42.950> understands<00:01:43.490> that's

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
down but I think he understands that's

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.919 
down but I think he understands that's
life<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.149> that's<00:01:44.210> what<00:01:44.390> happens<00:01:44.750> sometimes
