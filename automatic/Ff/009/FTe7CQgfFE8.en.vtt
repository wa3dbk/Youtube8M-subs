and<00:00:05.970> so<00:00:06.180> this<00:00:06.330> would<00:00:06.450> be<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.660> first<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.350> the

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
and so this would be the first of the

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.009 
and so this would be the first of the
three<00:00:07.830> installs<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.730> I'll<00:00:08.849> throw<00:00:09.059> up<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.840> is

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
three installs and I'll throw up this is

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.230 
three installs and I'll throw up this is
the<00:00:10.170> with<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.800> acoustic<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.400> first<00:00:11.670> in<00:00:11.910> video

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
the with the acoustic the first in video

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.490 
the with the acoustic the first in video
which<00:00:12.450> would<00:00:12.540> be<00:00:12.660> just<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.019> acoustic<00:00:13.170> liner

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
which would be just the acoustic liner

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.530 
which would be just the acoustic liner
and<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.130> second<00:00:14.429> will<00:00:14.519> be<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.700> doors<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
and the second will be the doors and the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.310 
and the second will be the doors and the
third<00:00:15.780> will<00:00:16.020> be<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.410> roof<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:18.180> not<00:00:19.050> really

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
third will be the roof but not really

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.960 
third will be the roof but not really
any<00:00:19.439> different<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:20.279> won't<00:00:20.490> make<00:00:20.609> much<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.820> a

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
any different this won't make much of a

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.910 
any different this won't make much of a
difference<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.330> my<00:00:21.570> bass<00:00:21.810> but<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.769> should

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
difference to my bass but this should

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.200 
difference to my bass but this should
make<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.100> difference<00:00:23.430> just<00:00:23.519> for<00:00:23.820> road<00:00:24.000> noise

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
make a difference just for road noise

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.779 
make a difference just for road noise

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.920 
and everything off in there so I got the
first<00:01:38.490> bit<00:01:38.670> here<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.060> I'm<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.540> gonna<00:01:39.630> cut<00:01:39.900> it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
first bit here so I'm just gonna cut it

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.840 
first bit here so I'm just gonna cut it
shape<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.860> had<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> little<00:01:41.220> bit<00:01:41.400> longer<00:01:41.640> there

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
shape just had a little bit longer there

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.420

and it comes down and I just mark it by

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.069 
and it comes down and I just mark it by
putting<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.729> knife<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.090> use<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.869> tape<00:01:46.049> measure

too<00:03:28.280> and<00:03:29.000> he<00:03:29.090> goes<00:03:29.269> right<00:03:29.570> back<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.989> seat

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
too and he goes right back to the seat

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.500 
too and he goes right back to the seat
on<00:03:30.859> both<00:03:31.070> sides<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:32.060> all<00:03:32.269> of<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.980> I've<00:03:33.980> used

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
on both sides and all of that I've used

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.890

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
all of that there's probably only about

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.800 
all of that there's probably only about
12<00:03:40.489> square<00:03:40.609> feet<00:03:42.010> so<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.040> have<00:03:43.459> 40<00:03:43.880> so<00:03:44.660> I've
