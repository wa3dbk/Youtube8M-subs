00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.630
 hi everyone in this new 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.790
 video I present you an accessory 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.920
 for your iphone 5 and 5 pieces 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.529
 it is a photo lens allowing you 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.050
 to vary the effects for your photos and 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.189
 videos 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.930
 that's how I received them in a 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.820
 little black pouch that you go 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.720
 ability to use to carry 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.880
 the goal everywhere with you so it's 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.520
 a goal 3 in a year you have on one side 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.020
 a fisheye lens with which you 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.940
 will be able to distort what you 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.100
 take a picture or what you're filming and 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.770
 on the other side you have and a goal 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.200
 wade so wide angle and a goal 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.390
 macro that will allow you to film or 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.710
 to take pictures with a lot of 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.059
 small details to apply the goal 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.160
 it's not complicated 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.050
 just slipped the accessory to the level of 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.050
 the camera of your iphone 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.040
 the goal that I have received and sympathize 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.540
 for iphone 5 is the fifth but 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.010
 not with the iphone 4 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.200
 if you want to have this accessory for 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.439
 your iphone 4 and 4s i will you 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.520
 let's look at the description 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.049
 thanks to this accessory you go 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.729
 able to do lots of different effects 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.830
 take pretty funny pictures with 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.150
 the fisheye that has a field of view of 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.150
 180 degrees approximately 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.860
 you can also take pictures 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.820
 with the wide-angle lens that double 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.890
 your field of vision 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:50.009
 look rather and I have not moved 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.079
 a hair 1 look at the difference between 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.549
 the normal purpose of the iphone and the 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.549
 objectives of the accessory 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.500
 look at the difference is really 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.030
 impressive anyway or you 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.670
 can take photos or videos 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.860
 really pretty with the macro lens that 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.610
 capture tiny details and that's 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.610
 really dazzling 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.909
 here you will be able to take full 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.040
 super funny pictures rather nice 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.959
 when you 're done using your 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.549
 objectives we do not forget to put 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.110
 small cash to avoid any 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.599
 dust or scratches 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.629
 if ever your lens is scratched and ben 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.890
 it's screwed and then we can put it 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.680
 in the small carrying pouch 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:37.480
 supplied with up 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.189
 attention we do not let escape 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.569
 closed 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.730
 and here you go so you can 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.129
 take the goal everywhere with you 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.690
 to make great pictures that's 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.010
 exactly the same as a hall at 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.959
 clip I do not know if you know 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.690
 except instead of having four goals 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.159
 different you only have three but 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.450
