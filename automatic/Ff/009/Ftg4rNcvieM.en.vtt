perspective one-point perspective is a
technique<00:00:12.240> artists<00:00:12.990> use<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.650> create<00:00:13.980> the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
technique artists use to create the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.210 
technique artists use to create the
illusion<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.910> three<00:00:15.599> dimensions<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.770> flat

illusion of three dimensions on a flat
piece<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.550> paper<00:00:18.470> when<00:00:19.470> you're<00:00:19.619> at<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.920> lake

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
piece of paper when you're at the lake

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.220 
piece of paper when you're at the lake
and<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.699> look<00:00:20.880> out<00:00:21.029> across<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.570> water<00:00:21.750> you

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
and you look out across the water you

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.410 
and you look out across the water you
notice<00:00:22.680> there's<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.010> place<00:00:23.340> where<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> sky<00:00:24.090> and

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
notice there's a place where the sky and

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.339 
notice there's a place where the sky and
the<00:00:24.510> water<00:00:24.750> meet<00:00:28.760> we<00:00:29.760> call<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.689> horizon

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
the water meet we call this the horizon

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.610 
the water meet we call this the horizon
line<00:00:31.579> the<00:00:32.579> horizon<00:00:33.149> line<00:00:33.360> represents<00:00:34.140> your

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
line the horizon line represents your

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.340 
line the horizon line represents your
eye<00:00:34.890> level<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:37.850> if<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.030> were<00:00:39.180> looking<00:00:39.570> at<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
eye level so if you were looking at the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.819 
eye level so if you were looking at the
horizon<00:00:40.890> from<00:00:41.070> way<00:00:41.309> up<00:00:41.340> high<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> tower

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
horizon from way up high like on a tower

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.860 
horizon from way up high like on a tower
you<00:00:43.829> would<00:00:43.950> see<00:00:44.190> more<00:00:44.489> water<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.210> less<00:00:45.510> sky

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
you would see more water and less sky

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.430 
you would see more water and less sky
because<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.620> horizon<00:00:47.190> goes<00:00:47.430> up<00:00:47.670> with<00:00:47.910> you

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
because the horizon goes up with you

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.560 
because the horizon goes up with you
when<00:00:49.440> objects<00:00:49.980> move<00:00:50.280> away<00:00:50.430> from<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.059> towards

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
when objects move away from you towards

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.420 
when objects move away from you towards
the<00:00:51.750> horizon<00:00:51.840> line<00:00:52.350> they<00:00:52.739> appear<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.280> get

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the horizon line they appear to get

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.209 
the horizon line they appear to get
smaller<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.210> smaller<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.140> smaller<00:00:58.219> when

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
smaller and smaller and smaller when

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.430 
smaller and smaller and smaller when
objects<00:00:59.760> reach<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.359> horizon<00:01:00.809> line<00:01:01.020> they

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
objects reach the horizon line they

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.549 
objects reach the horizon line they
disappear<00:01:02.190> we<00:01:02.820> call<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.930> vanishing

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.050 
disappear we call this the vanishing
point<00:01:06.560> where<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.770> vanishing<00:01:08.220> point<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.729> on

point where the vanishing point is on

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.270 
point where the vanishing point is on
the<00:01:09.180> horizon<00:01:09.689> line<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.799> center<00:01:11.250> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the horizon line is like the center of

around<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.720> vanishing<00:01:22.229> point<00:01:22.790> notice<00:01:23.790> that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
around the vanishing point notice that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.969 
around the vanishing point notice that
some<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.689> box<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.200> below<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.830> horizon

some of the box is below the horizon

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.819 
some of the box is below the horizon
line<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:27.180> most<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.140> above<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.770> horizon

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
this box is going to become the back

this box is going to become the back
wall<00:01:35.160> of<00:01:35.190> our<00:01:35.610> room<00:01:36.290> anything<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.410> draw<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.950> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.560 
wall such as a door or a window will be
flat<00:01:43.380> because<00:01:43.980> we're<00:01:44.370> looking<00:01:44.730> straight<00:01:45.270> at

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
flat because we're looking straight at

flat because we're looking straight at
them<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:47.510> this<00:01:48.510> is<00:01:48.690> true<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.020> anything<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.980> draw

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
them and this is true of anything I draw

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.730 
them and this is true of anything I draw
on<00:01:50.370> the<00:01:50.460> back<00:01:50.640> wall<00:01:50.940> such<00:01:51.450> as<00:01:51.750> floor<00:01:52.410> or

on the back wall such as floor or
ceiling<00:01:53.070> trim<00:01:54.440> now<00:01:55.440> I'm<00:01:55.800> going<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.220> draw<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
ceiling trim now I'm going to draw the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.390 
ceiling trim now I'm going to draw the
floor<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.810> ceiling<00:01:58.050> and<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.590> two<00:01:58.800> side<00:01:59.100> walls

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
floor the ceiling and the two side walls

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.790 
floor the ceiling and the two side walls
to<00:02:00.270> begin<00:02:00.660> I'm<00:02:00.960> going<00:02:01.230> to<00:02:01.350> line<00:02:01.590> up<00:02:01.620> my

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
to begin I'm going to line up my

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.030 
to begin I'm going to line up my
triangle<00:02:02.550> with<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.000> vanishing<00:02:03.330> point<00:02:03.750> and

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
triangle with the vanishing point and

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.109 
triangle with the vanishing point and
one<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.220> corners<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:06.150> that<00:02:06.210> back<00:02:06.660> wall

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
one of the corners of that back wall

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.110 
one of the corners of that back wall
then<00:02:09.119> using<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:09.929> line<00:02:10.380> up<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.860> draw<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.850> line

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
then using that line up I draw a line

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.150 
then using that line up I draw a line
from<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.720> corner<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.200> wall<00:02:13.230> out<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:14.040> the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
from the corner of the wall out to the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.500 
from the corner of the wall out to the
edge<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.940> paper

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.690 

then<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.870> do<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.440> same<00:02:19.470> thing<00:02:20.010> on<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.670> other

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
then I do the same thing on the other

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:33.339 
then I do the same thing on the other
corner

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.520 

and<00:02:34.349> on<00:02:34.859> the<00:02:35.129> two<00:02:35.280> bottom<00:02:35.700> corners<00:02:35.989> now<00:02:36.989> I<00:02:37.019> have

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
and on the two bottom corners now I have

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.190 
and on the two bottom corners now I have
my<00:02:37.920> room<00:02:38.219> with<00:02:38.609> a<00:02:38.639> floor<00:02:38.969> ceiling<00:02:39.719> and<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.019> two

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
my room with a floor ceiling and the two

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.410 
my room with a floor ceiling and the two

to draw a doorway on the other side I

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.650 
to draw a doorway on the other side I
make<00:04:07.349> another<00:04:07.680> vertical<00:04:08.040> line<00:04:08.360> this<00:04:09.360> time

make another vertical line this time

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.539 
make another vertical line this time
going<00:04:10.019> all<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.410> way<00:04:10.440> down<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.040> floor<00:04:11.190> line
