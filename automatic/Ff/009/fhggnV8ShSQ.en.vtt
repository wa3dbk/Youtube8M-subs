00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
here and I buckle them in they had a

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.800 
here and I buckle them in they had a
blast<00:01:37.829> riding<00:01:38.280> around<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> house<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.090> it's

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
blast riding around the house and it's

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.120 
blast riding around the house and it's
got<00:01:39.930> these<00:01:40.020> little<00:01:40.170> plastic<00:01:40.470> tabs<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.040> you

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
got these little plastic tabs that you

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.609 
got these little plastic tabs that you
kind<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:41.970> slide<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.390> up<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:43.140> could<00:01:43.259> take<00:01:43.470> them

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
kind of slide it up you could take them

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.380 
kind of slide it up you could take them
right<00:01:43.829> out<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.640> don't<00:01:44.820> want<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.119> enough

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
right out if you don't want this enough

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.840 
right out if you don't want this enough
I<00:01:45.509> guess<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.810> could<00:01:45.930> throw<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> drawer

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
I guess you could throw it in the drawer

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.179 
I guess you could throw it in the drawer
so<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.240> got<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.450> also<00:01:49.290> has<00:01:49.470> these<00:01:49.680> slots<00:01:50.009> in

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
so it's got that also has these slots in

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.819 
so it's got that also has these slots in
the<00:01:50.280> side<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:51.210> put<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> guardrail<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.350> you

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
the side to put a guardrail in if you

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.319 
the side to put a guardrail in if you
see<00:01:53.070> down<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.549> hole<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.790> know<00:01:54.000> if<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.149> make

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
see down in this hole I know if you make

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.940 
see down in this hole I know if you make
it<00:01:54.450> out<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:55.020> see<00:01:55.200> it's<00:01:55.320> kind<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.560> chewed<00:01:55.799> up

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
it out you see it's kind of chewed up

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.100 
it out you see it's kind of chewed up
there<00:01:56.790> was<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.939> piece<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.210> plastic<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.899> both

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
there was a piece of plastic on both

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.139 
there was a piece of plastic on both
sides<00:01:58.409> there<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.979> don't<00:01:59.700> know<00:01:59.790> what<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.030> was

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
sides there I don't know what that was

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.600 
sides there I don't know what that was
for<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.049> hindered<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.860> guide<00:02:02.040> rails<00:02:02.310> kind

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
for but it hindered the guide rails kind

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.219 
for but it hindered the guide rails kind
of<00:02:02.700> sitting<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.030> there<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.509> cut<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.840> out<00:02:03.990> and

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
of sitting in there so it cut it out and

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.310 
of sitting in there so it cut it out and
works<00:02:04.829> much<00:02:05.100> better<00:02:05.130> now<00:02:05.990> it's<00:02:06.990> got<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> nice

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
works much better now it's got a nice

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.040 
works much better now it's got a nice
handle<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.360> it's<00:02:09.360> got<00:02:09.479> these<00:02:09.599> little<00:02:09.720> plastic

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
handle and it's got these little plastic

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.850 
handle and it's got these little plastic
strips<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.770> back<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.239> guess<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.900> perfect

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
strips in the back so I guess to perfect

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.680 
strips in the back so I guess to perfect
stairs<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.610> all<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.940> good<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.330> one<00:02:15.540> we're

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
stairs and all that good this one we're

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.570 
stairs and all that good this one we're
going<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.080> we'll<00:02:16.380> show<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.830> in<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.370> brief

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
going and we'll show you that in a brief

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.200 
going and we'll show you that in a brief
second<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.570> let's<00:02:18.840> load<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.200> up<00:02:19.320> and<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.910> get

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
all right so my truck is at almost three

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.970 
all right so my truck is at almost three
