00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
they're ready to be planted so you kind

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.800 
they're ready to be planted so you kind
of<00:01:04.530> pinch<00:01:04.739> around<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> pot<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.939> helps

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
of pinch around the pot like this helps

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.380 
of pinch around the pot like this helps
release<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.860> plant<00:01:08.100> from<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.369> container<00:01:08.820> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
release the plant from the container and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.460 
release the plant from the container and
you<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.600> see<00:01:09.750> there's<00:01:09.930> all<00:01:10.110> these<00:01:10.229> roots

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
you can see there's all these roots

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.690 
you can see there's all these roots
bound<00:01:10.770> up<00:01:10.950> at<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.130> bottom<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.460> want<00:01:11.670> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
bound up at the bottom you just want to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.850 
bound up at the bottom you just want to
break<00:01:11.880> these<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.420> little<00:01:12.600> bit<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.710> what

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
break these up a little bit and what

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.710 
break these up a little bit and what
that<00:01:14.010> allows<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.880> roots<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.299> really

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
that allows is for the roots to really

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.840 
that allows is for the roots to really
go<00:01:16.229> well<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.740> container<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.310> spread<00:01:17.670> out

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
go well in this container and spread out

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.120 
go well in this container and spread out
so<00:01:18.780> after<00:01:18.990> breaking<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> roots<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.799> set

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
so after breaking up the roots just set

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.740 
so after breaking up the roots just set
that<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.460> there<00:01:22.520> sure<00:01:23.520> yeah<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.390> trick<00:01:24.600> is

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
that one there sure yeah the trick is

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.179 
that one there sure yeah the trick is
just<00:01:24.960> getting<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.259> nice<00:01:25.409> pinch<00:01:25.740> around<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
just getting a nice pinch around the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.080 
just getting a nice pinch around the
edges<00:01:26.430> they<00:01:26.490> come<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.820> lot<00:01:27.030> easier

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
edges they come out a lot easier

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.670 
edges they come out a lot easier
sometimes<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.930> notice<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.320> when<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.530> buy<00:01:28.650> a

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
sometimes you notice that when you buy a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.170 
sometimes you notice that when you buy a
plant<00:01:29.009> from<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.220> nursery<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.610> will<00:01:29.729> not<00:01:29.939> want

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
plant from the nursery you will not want

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.819 
plant from the nursery you will not want
to<00:01:30.270> come<00:01:30.390> out<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:30.900> work<00:01:31.439> your<00:01:31.590> way<00:01:31.650> around

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
to come out so just work your way around

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.800 
to come out so just work your way around
the<00:01:32.070> pot<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.909> comes<00:01:33.119> out<00:01:33.299> really<00:01:33.450> easily

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
the pot and that comes out really easily

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.690 
the pot and that comes out really easily
so<00:01:35.450> break<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> roots<00:01:36.780> up<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.290> as<00:01:37.470> well

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
so break the roots up on this as well

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.440 
so break the roots up on this as well
we're<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:38.729> going<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.030> evenly<00:01:39.329> distribute

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
we're just going to evenly distribute

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.139 
we're just going to evenly distribute
them<00:01:40.049> there<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:40.500> go<00:01:42.350> at<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.850> once<00:01:45.030> you

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
them there we go at that so once you

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.300 
them there we go at that so once you
have<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.450> place<00:01:45.479> we've<00:01:46.020> got<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> lot<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.710> area

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
have in place we've got a lot of area

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.830 
have in place we've got a lot of area
that<00:01:47.460> needs<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.790> be<00:01:47.820> filled<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.329> with<00:01:48.360> soil

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
that needs to be filled in with soil

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.550 
that needs to be filled in with soil
here<00:01:49.079> just<00:01:49.979> take<00:01:50.130> some<00:01:50.340> handfuls<00:01:51.350> fill<00:01:52.350> all

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
here just take some handfuls fill all

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.109 
here just take some handfuls fill all
the<00:01:52.680> way<00:01:52.710> around<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> edge<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.490> really<00:01:53.759> easy

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the way around the edge it's really easy

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.380 
the way around the edge it's really easy
mm-hmm<00:01:55.610> so<00:01:56.610> you're<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.759> filling<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
mm-hmm so you're just filling in the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.670 
mm-hmm so you're just filling in the
spots<00:01:57.659> you're<00:01:57.899> not<00:01:58.020> really<00:01:58.229> messing<00:01:58.590> around

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
spots you're not really messing around

you want to water it in so at least a
gallon<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.360> water<00:02:39.600> you're<00:02:39.840> gonna<00:02:39.959> fall<00:02:40.230> over

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
gallon of water you're gonna fall over

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.500 
gallon of water you're gonna fall over
top<00:02:40.650> until<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.250> pours<00:02:41.880> right<00:02:42.000> out<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.390> the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
top until it pours right out of the

top until it pours right out of the
bottom<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.020> what<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.620> allows<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:43.920> for<00:02:44.370> the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
bottom and what that allows is for the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.920 
bottom and what that allows is for the
soil<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.880> soak<00:02:45.060> around<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.480> roots<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.870> we

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
soil to soak around the roots that we

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.930 
soil to soak around the roots that we
just<00:02:46.080> broke<00:02:46.320> up<00:02:46.440> as<00:02:46.650> well<00:02:46.860> okay<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:47.910> just

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
just broke up as well okay so just

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.930 
just broke up as well okay so just
initially<00:02:48.720> water<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.830> in<00:02:49.980> then<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:50.670> go<00:02:50.790> by

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
initially water it in then just go by
