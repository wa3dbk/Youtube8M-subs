00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.820
 Talk to us , beauty guys. We got here. 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.460
 today bringing another video for you 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.309
 It's been a long time since you've had five 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.029
 appears on the channel where the reason is that 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.400
 I do not have a ps 4 and neither the xbox ball 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.410
 so I had to wait for the t6 version 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.990
 leave so I can go back to doing 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.630
 videos and gta5 on the channel 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.529
 well you are already bald to know that 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.410
 rockstar 31 gta5 several satire and 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.140
 references to mysteries and theories of 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.140
 conspiracy and often mysteries and 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.930
 I already did itaÃ­ videos on the channel 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.930
 in this video here I'll talk about the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.149
 Fifth trained with chemical traces 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.110
 if you do not know what I'm talking about I 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.899
 I'll show 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.960
 knows that smoke that an airplane a jet 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.090
 fish in the air that white trail I say 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.480
 actually not in the game this smoke 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.190
 white should dissipate rapidly 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.379
 but about 20 years ago 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.130
 some of these trails are delaying 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.400
 much and even days to dissipate what 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.689
 raised the curiosity of people 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.090
 they began to distrust 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.820
 these tracks are then called and 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.220
 chemical traces that were found to have 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.009
 their composition extremely 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.020
 toxic for people are used 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.689
 commercial aircraft to launch such 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.850
 stars with a type of spray bug 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.610
 equal to those they have on 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.380
 smoke squadron 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.960
 of course an airplane leaves a 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.869
 but dissipates quickly 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.970
 unlike the chemical trail 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.090
 Conspiracy theorists say that chem 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.939
 trails are used for handling the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:53.189
 climate and for that he works in 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.979
 set with rap rap the arp that was once 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.469
 proved that it is capable of doing damage 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.299
 in the atmosphere if they 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.840
 many already say that in future wars 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.940
 will use climate weapons but you 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.600
 Are you thinking ah? 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.580
 I 'm safe here in Brazil not 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.480
 there are these types of traces here 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.180
 also 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.130
 actually be in the whole world in the gt 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.430
 so it is possible to see in the sky several 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.530
 white risks that never dissipate 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.970
 satirizing the sky of los angeles that is 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.490
 full of these traces 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.340
 I recommend that you research the 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.370
 matter if you do not believe in this 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.770
 conspiracy to manipulate the climate 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.520
 if the world were more sensible ever 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:42.300
 would allow the construction of rap the arp or 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.370
 which can be used as a weapon or can 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.820
 screw the planet in 3 can be 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.410
 only theory but the arp is not go galera 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.410
 so this is what I hope you have 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.150
 liked and if you liked ex and I liked it 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.460
 sign in if possible channel for 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.890
 subscribed and shares the video for 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.980
 help in the channel's dissemination and also 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.970
 leave your comment beauty then thanks 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.970
 and spoke
