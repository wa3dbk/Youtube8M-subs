00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.099

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.519

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.090
 hi I am laura gulino the focaccia point 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.710
 com 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.820
 we are near carnival and there 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.820
 prepare to lie 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:33.600
 then first we put the flour le 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:36.000
 eggs the sugar we put cial e 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.450
 let's knead do it turn slowly 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.450
 plan 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:50.040
 add the lemon rind in the 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.040
 butter and we raise the speed a little 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:58.280
 add it to the wine when the pasta 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.480
 reached this consistency and kneaded 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.280
 let's do it a few times 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.560
 so we see it a little 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.560
 now we do it a little with our hands 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.110
 now that beautiful fine leaves 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:29.649
 rest at least a 20 of 20 always 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:31.830
 blanket now we think we crush 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.830
 a little 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.670
 we are just flour 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.610
 we pass in turn 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.660
 here are the few 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:58.080
 then I made a strip with a 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:02.130
 I cut in the middle and then I take it and I do 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.800
 like a buttonhole the others do 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:12.570
 just two ferries so the party there 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:15.690
 make a knot so the butterfly we have 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.890
 heat the oil from 180 200 degrees e 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.890
 now we believe in 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.480
 minute to part when they are colored 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.480
 that's enough 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.970
 and now that we get a fried background 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:00.020
