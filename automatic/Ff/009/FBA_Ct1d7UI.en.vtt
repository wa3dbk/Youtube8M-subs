just recently bought a home that was

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.900 
just recently bought a home that was
built<00:00:28.630> in<00:00:28.960> the<00:00:28.989> 70s<00:00:29.560> the<00:00:30.279> kitchens<00:00:30.640> been

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
built in the 70s the kitchens been

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.509 
built in the 70s the kitchens been
remodeled<00:00:31.599> probably<00:00:32.140> in<00:00:32.259> the<00:00:32.379> 80s<00:00:32.410> but<00:00:33.339> we're

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:33.519 
remodeled probably in the 80s but we're

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:35.250 
remodeled probably in the 80s but we're
both<00:00:33.640> cooks<00:00:34.000> and<00:00:34.269> so<00:00:34.390> what<00:00:34.540> we've<00:00:34.690> decided<00:00:35.110> to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
both cooks and so what we've decided to

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.979 
both cooks and so what we've decided to
do<00:00:35.500> is<00:00:35.610> remodel<00:00:36.610> it<00:00:36.730> again<00:00:37.030> we<00:00:37.629> thought<00:00:37.809> that

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
do is remodel it again we thought that

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.570 
do is remodel it again we thought that
would<00:00:38.080> be<00:00:38.230> a<00:00:38.260> great<00:00:38.500> way<00:00:38.650> to<00:00:38.680> demonstrate<00:00:38.980> the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
would be a great way to demonstrate the

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.820 
would be a great way to demonstrate the
process<00:00:40.059> that<00:00:40.300> you<00:00:40.420> use<00:00:40.660> in<00:00:40.930> designing<00:00:41.589> a

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
process that you use in designing a

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.670 
process that you use in designing a
backsplash<00:00:42.390> we've<00:00:43.390> already<00:00:43.600> selected<00:00:44.079> some

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
backsplash we've already selected some

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.130 
backsplash we've already selected some
of<00:00:44.829> our<00:00:44.949> products<00:00:45.550> for<00:00:46.059> example<00:00:46.600> what<00:00:46.780> we<00:00:46.930> know

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
of our products for example what we know

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.590 
of our products for example what we know
is<00:00:47.409> that<00:00:47.470> we're<00:00:48.339> going<00:00:48.550> to<00:00:48.640> keep<00:00:48.879> the<00:00:49.059> base<00:00:49.300> of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
is that we're going to keep the base of

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.709 
is that we're going to keep the base of
our<00:00:50.110> cabinets<00:00:50.680> the<00:00:51.520> lowers<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.360> uppers

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
our cabinets the lowers and the uppers

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.090 
our cabinets the lowers and the uppers
because<00:00:53.289> they're<00:00:53.440> really<00:00:53.680> in<00:00:53.770> pretty<00:00:53.949> good

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
because they're really in pretty good

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.639 
because they're really in pretty good
shape<00:00:54.160> will<00:00:55.000> be<00:00:55.030> refacing<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.989> cabinets<00:00:56.530> so

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
shape will be refacing the cabinets so

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.080 
shape will be refacing the cabinets so
that<00:00:56.800> means<00:00:57.010> that<00:00:57.129> we'll<00:00:57.309> put<00:00:57.550> on<00:00:57.699> new<00:00:57.850> door

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
that means that we'll put on new door

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.290 
that means that we'll put on new door
fronts<00:00:58.449> and<00:00:58.629> drawer<00:00:59.500> fronts<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.879> we<00:01:01.180> have

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
fronts and drawer fronts so we have

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.180 
fronts and drawer fronts so we have
selected<00:01:01.809> those<00:01:02.019> we<00:01:02.620> know<00:01:02.769> that<00:01:02.949> we're<00:01:03.100> going

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
selected those we know that we're going

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.670 
selected those we know that we're going
to<00:01:03.250> go<00:01:03.399> with<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.640> dark<00:01:03.879> stain<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:05.320> the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
to go with the dark stain for the

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.150 
to go with the dark stain for the
cabinets<00:01:06.190> and<00:01:06.430> we've<00:01:07.180> selected<00:01:07.420> our<00:01:07.810> granite

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
cabinets and we've selected our granite

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.710 
cabinets and we've selected our granite
so<00:01:09.160> those<00:01:09.399> two<00:01:09.610> things<00:01:09.789> we<00:01:10.210> already<00:01:10.360> have

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
so those two things we already have

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.160 
so those two things we already have
defined<00:01:11.550> what<00:01:12.550> we<00:01:12.640> don't<00:01:12.850> know<00:01:13.149> is<00:01:13.420> how<00:01:13.960> we're

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
defined what we don't know is how we're

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.650 
defined what we don't know is how we're
going<00:01:14.289> to<00:01:14.380> do<00:01:14.530> our<00:01:14.679> our<00:01:15.039> backsplash<00:01:15.660> let's

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
going to do our our backsplash let's

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.810 
going to do our our backsplash let's
take<00:01:16.929> an<00:01:17.050> overview<00:01:17.410> of<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:18.160> layout<00:01:18.520> of<00:01:18.550> the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820

influences the backsplash because

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.270 
influences the backsplash because
instead<00:01:58.869> of<00:01:58.929> stopping<00:01:59.050> at<00:01:59.530> this<00:01:59.739> point<00:02:00.069> now

instead of stopping at this point now
the<00:02:00.849> backsplash<00:02:01.300> will<00:02:01.660> go<00:02:01.780> all<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.170> way<00:02:02.200> up<00:02:02.379> to

the backsplash will go all the way up to

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.600 
the backsplash will go all the way up to
the<00:02:02.679> ceiling<00:02:02.920> on<00:02:03.959> this<00:02:04.959> wall<00:02:05.289> the<00:02:06.190> only<00:02:06.429> thing

the ceiling on this wall the only thing
that's<00:02:06.789> really<00:02:06.970> changing<00:02:07.509> other<00:02:07.720> than<00:02:07.959> the

that's really changing other than the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.469 
that's really changing other than the
position<00:02:08.379> of<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.770> dishwasher<00:02:09.369> is<00:02:09.520> this<00:02:10.179> sink

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
position of the dishwasher is this sink

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.600 
position of the dishwasher is this sink
the<00:02:10.929> sink<00:02:11.230> will<00:02:11.379> be<00:02:11.500> coming<00:02:11.830> into<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.220> center

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
the sink will be coming into the center

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.970 
the sink will be coming into the center
of<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.879> window<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.510> doesn't<00:02:14.110> influence<00:02:14.770> the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
of the window that doesn't influence the

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.020 
of the window that doesn't influence the
design<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.930> backsplash

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
design of the backsplash

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
design of the backsplash
the<00:02:19.030> other<00:02:19.210> thing<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.600> take<00:02:19.750> into

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
the other thing to take into

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.460 
the other thing to take into
consideration<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:22.690> distance<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.410> you

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
consideration is the distance that you

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.000 
consideration is the distance that you
have<00:02:24.090> from<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.180> countertop<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.590> overhead

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
have from the countertop to the overhead

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.980 
have from the countertop to the overhead
cabinets<00:02:27.750> where<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.930> outlets<00:02:29.430> are<00:02:30.990> situated

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
cabinets where the outlets are situated

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.780 
cabinets where the outlets are situated
and<00:02:32.880> then<00:02:33.880> also<00:02:34.320> how<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.380> backsplash<00:02:36.010> ends

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
and then also how the backsplash ends

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.850 
and then also how the backsplash ends
once<00:02:37.600> you<00:02:37.840> don't<00:02:37.960> have<00:02:38.260> any<00:02:38.470> overhead

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
once you don't have any overhead

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.430 
once you don't have any overhead
cabinets<00:02:39.310> anymore<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:40.480> let's<00:02:40.690> take<00:02:40.960> a<00:02:40.990> look<00:02:41.260> at

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
cabinets anymore so let's take a look at

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.350 
cabinets anymore so let's take a look at
three<00:02:42.070> areas<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.640> I'm<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.820> little<00:02:43.030> concerned

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
three areas that I'm a little concerned

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.600 
three areas that I'm a little concerned
about<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:44.470> can<00:02:44.650> see<00:02:44.830> one<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.070> them<00:02:45.370> right<00:02:45.580> here

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
about you can see one of them right here

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.790 
about you can see one of them right here
what<00:02:46.570> they've<00:02:46.750> chosen<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:47.290> do<00:02:47.500> with<00:02:47.680> the

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
what they've chosen to do with the

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.700 
what they've chosen to do with the
existing<00:02:48.340> backsplash<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.210> just<00:02:49.900> have<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.350> cut

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
existing backsplash is just have a cut

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.340 
existing backsplash is just have a cut
piece<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.190> tile<00:02:51.520> and<00:02:51.790> then<00:02:52.660> they've<00:02:52.840> done<00:02:53.110> a

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
piece of tile and then they've done a

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.800 
piece of tile and then they've done a
little<00:02:53.680> grouting<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.730> finish<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.270> edge<00:02:55.510> I

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
little grouting to finish that edge I

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.170 
little grouting to finish that edge I
don't<00:02:56.440> like<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.830> way<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.130> looks<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.150> I

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
don't like the way that looks so I

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.580 
don't like the way that looks so I
definitely<00:02:58.540> want<00:02:58.960> to<00:02:59.080> do<00:02:59.200> something

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
definitely want to do something

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.410 
definitely want to do something
different<00:02:59.740> here<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.370> they've<00:03:01.090> done<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.390> same

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
different here and they've done the same

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.230 
different here and they've done the same
treatment<00:03:02.200> over<00:03:02.350> on<00:03:02.830> this<00:03:03.010> side<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.580> don't<00:03:03.880> like

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
treatment over on this side I don't like

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.270 
treatment over on this side I don't like
either<00:03:04.540> one<00:03:04.660> of<00:03:04.810> those<00:03:05.050> solutions<00:03:05.410> I'm<00:03:05.950> not

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
either one of those solutions I'm not

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.830 
either one of those solutions I'm not
exactly<00:03:06.610> sure<00:03:06.820> what<00:03:06.970> we're<00:03:07.420> going<00:03:07.600> to<00:03:07.660> do

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
exactly sure what we're going to do

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.870 
exactly sure what we're going to do
there<00:03:08.080> but<00:03:08.680> when<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:08.890> go<00:03:09.100> shopping<00:03:09.550> for<00:03:09.580> the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
there but when I go shopping for the

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.760 
there but when I go shopping for the
product<00:03:10.270> that<00:03:10.390> I<00:03:10.420> use<00:03:10.660> for<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.960> backsplash<00:03:11.350> I

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
product that I use for the backsplash I

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.010 
product that I use for the backsplash I
want<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.250> keep<00:03:12.400> these<00:03:12.610> two<00:03:12.910> areas<00:03:13.390> in<00:03:13.570> mind

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
want to keep these two areas in mind

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.260 
want to keep these two areas in mind
this<00:03:14.890> is<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.190> third<00:03:15.430> area<00:03:15.820> I'm<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:16.030> little

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
this is the third area I'm a little

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.850 
this is the third area I'm a little
concerned<00:03:16.450> about<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.320> can<00:03:17.470> see<00:03:17.680> the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
concerned about and you can see the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.830 
concerned about and you can see the
current<00:03:18.220> treatment<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:18.940> backsplash<00:03:19.330> I

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
current treatment of the backsplash I

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.060 
current treatment of the backsplash I
think<00:03:20.740> this<00:03:20.950> looks<00:03:21.220> really<00:03:21.310> hokey<00:03:22.950> there<00:03:23.950> are

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
think this looks really hokey there are

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.590 
think this looks really hokey there are
a<00:03:24.100> couple<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.459> different<00:03:24.850> ways<00:03:24.940> to<00:03:25.270> do<00:03:25.420> this

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
a couple of different ways to do this

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.900 
a couple of different ways to do this
this<00:03:25.840> is<00:03:25.900> an<00:03:26.170> eating<00:03:26.500> bar<00:03:26.680> area<00:03:27.130> we'll<00:03:27.760> be

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
this is an eating bar area we'll be

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.970 
this is an eating bar area we'll be
bringing<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.660> new<00:03:28.810> granite<00:03:29.230> countertop<00:03:29.770> out

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
bringing the new granite countertop out

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.000 
bringing the new granite countertop out
two<00:03:30.370> inches<00:03:30.760> now<00:03:31.510> if<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:31.930> were<00:03:32.080> to<00:03:32.110> bring<00:03:32.350> the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
two inches now if I were to bring the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.640 
two inches now if I were to bring the
backsplash<00:03:33.700> all<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.209> way<00:03:34.330> out<00:03:34.540> for<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.410> full

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
backsplash all the way out for the full

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.820 
backsplash all the way out for the full
length<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.640> that<00:03:36.790> new<00:03:37.690> countertop<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:38.800> can

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
length of that new countertop you can

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.920 
length of that new countertop you can
see<00:03:39.220> what<00:03:39.430> would<00:03:39.550> happen<00:03:39.970> is<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.180> backsplash

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
see what would happen is the backsplash

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.170 
see what would happen is the backsplash
would<00:03:41.740> cut<00:03:41.950> right<00:03:41.980> through<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:42.610> electrical

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
would cut right through this electrical

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.520 
would cut right through this electrical
outlet<00:03:43.630> this<00:03:44.080> outlet<00:03:44.500> cannot<00:03:44.890> be<00:03:45.040> moved<00:03:45.250> on

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
outlet this outlet cannot be moved on

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.710 
outlet this outlet cannot be moved on
that's<00:03:47.530> not<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.400> good<00:03:48.670> solution<00:03:49.000> here<00:03:49.450> so<00:03:49.690> I

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
that's not a good solution here so I

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.060 
that's not a good solution here so I
have<00:03:49.959> to<00:03:49.990> come<00:03:50.260> up<00:03:50.290> with<00:03:50.470> something<00:03:50.709> pretty

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
have to come up with something pretty

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.090 
have to come up with something pretty
clever<00:03:51.370> here<00:03:51.820> I<00:03:51.940> may<00:03:52.690> bring<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.530> tile<00:03:53.800> down

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
clever here I may bring the tile down

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.790 
clever here I may bring the tile down
from<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.550> countertop<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.600> I'm<00:03:56.200> sorry<00:03:56.590> from

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
from the countertop to I'm sorry from

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.590 
from the countertop to I'm sorry from
the<00:03:56.920> overhead<00:03:57.220> cabinet<00:03:57.760> down<00:03:58.360> to<00:03:58.510> the

about<00:04:10.420> having<00:04:10.810> backsplash<00:04:11.560> on<00:04:11.770> this<00:04:12.010> wall<00:04:12.280> so

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
about having backsplash on this wall so

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.699 
about having backsplash on this wall so
I'm<00:04:13.120> sort<00:04:13.450> of<00:04:13.570> considering<00:04:14.020> at<00:04:14.230> this<00:04:14.380> point

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
I'm sort of considering at this point

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.070 
I'm sort of considering at this point
just<00:04:15.310> bringing<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.180> backsplash<00:04:16.600> down

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
just bringing the the backsplash down

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.050 
just bringing the the backsplash down
but<00:04:17.709> again<00:04:17.950> when<00:04:18.160> I<00:04:18.190> go<00:04:18.400> shopping<00:04:18.700> for<00:04:18.880> the

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
but again when I go shopping for the

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.970 
but again when I go shopping for the
material<00:04:19.510> that<00:04:19.660> I<00:04:19.690> use<00:04:19.780> for<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.230> backsplash<00:04:20.590> I

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
material that I use for the backsplash I

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.490 
material that I use for the backsplash I
want<00:04:21.580> to<00:04:21.669> keep<00:04:21.790> this<00:04:22.030> area<00:04:22.450> in<00:04:22.540> mind<00:04:22.780> as<00:04:22.990> well

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
want to keep this area in mind as well

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.730 
want to keep this area in mind as well
as<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.710> two<00:04:23.980> areas<00:04:24.220> by<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:24.730> window<00:04:25.180> now<00:04:25.810> we've

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
as the two areas by the window now we've

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.690 
as the two areas by the window now we've
looked<00:04:26.950> at<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.190> over

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
looked at the over

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.290 
looked at the over
you<00:04:28.020> we<00:04:29.020> know<00:04:29.260> that<00:04:29.830> we<00:04:30.310> have<00:04:30.520> three<00:04:30.760> problem

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
you we know that we have three problem

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.160 
you we know that we have three problem
areas<00:04:31.690> that<00:04:31.720> we<00:04:32.020> need<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:32.650> consider<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:34.170> the

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
areas that we need to consider and the

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.680 
areas that we need to consider and the
next<00:04:35.560> step<00:04:35.950> is<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.730> take<00:04:36.880> some<00:04:37.120> measurements

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
next step is to take some measurements

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.720 
next step is to take some measurements
what<00:04:38.440> we<00:04:38.560> want<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:38.830> do<00:04:38.950> is<00:04:39.160> draw<00:04:39.400> what's<00:04:39.640> called

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
what we want to do is draw what's called

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.600 
what we want to do is draw what's called
an<00:04:40.030> elevation<00:04:40.750> and<00:04:40.930> that's<00:04:41.560> just<00:04:41.950> a<00:04:42.070> diagram

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
an elevation and that's just a diagram

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.340 
an elevation and that's just a diagram
looking<00:04:43.600> straight<00:04:44.260> on<00:04:44.290> to<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:46.350> cabinet

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
looking straight on to the cabinet

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.950 
looking straight on to the cabinet
installation<00:04:47.850> what<00:04:48.850> I'm<00:04:48.970> going<00:04:49.240> to<00:04:49.300> do<00:04:49.480> with

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
installation what I'm going to do with

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.020 
installation what I'm going to do with
my<00:04:50.140> tape<00:04:50.380> is<00:04:50.620> I<00:04:50.790> will<00:04:51.790> measure<00:04:52.410> from<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:54.850> edge

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
my tape is I will measure from the edge

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.230 
my tape is I will measure from the edge
of<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.270> counter<00:04:55.690> all<00:04:56.170> the<00:04:56.920> way<00:04:57.070> over<00:04:57.430> to<00:05:00.240> this

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
of the counter all the way over to this

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.690 
of the counter all the way over to this
back<00:05:01.570> wall<00:05:01.840> so<00:05:02.560> that<00:05:02.740> I'll<00:05:02.890> have<00:05:02.920> an<00:05:03.220> overall

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
back wall so that I'll have an overall

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.660 
back wall so that I'll have an overall
measurement<00:05:04.180> of<00:05:04.510> the<00:05:05.050> full<00:05:05.350> length<00:05:05.650> of<00:05:05.920> this

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
measurement of the full length of this

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.180 
measurement of the full length of this
backsplash<00:05:07.270> I'm<00:05:07.810> really<00:05:08.470> just<00:05:08.680> worried<00:05:09.100> about

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
backsplash I'm really just worried about

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.600 
backsplash I'm really just worried about
this<00:05:09.520> area<00:05:10.530> then<00:05:11.530> what<00:05:11.770> I'll<00:05:11.920> do<00:05:12.130> is<00:05:12.160> measure

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
this area then what I'll do is measure

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.440 
this area then what I'll do is measure
from<00:05:13.530> this<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:14.890> edge<00:05:15.010> of<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.250> countertop<00:05:15.760> to

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
from this the edge of the countertop to

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.750 
from this the edge of the countertop to
where<00:05:16.690> the<00:05:17.440> overhead<00:05:17.800> cabinet<00:05:18.220> starts<00:05:18.580> I'll

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
where the overhead cabinet starts I'll

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.780 
where the overhead cabinet starts I'll
measure<00:05:19.510> from<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:19.930> overhead<00:05:20.290> cabinet<00:05:20.790> to

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
measure from the overhead cabinet to

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.410 
measure from the overhead cabinet to
this<00:05:22.000> edge<00:05:22.240> I<00:05:22.540> know<00:05:23.290> that<00:05:23.680> this<00:05:23.800> is<00:05:23.980> where<00:05:24.130> my

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
this edge I know that this is where my

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.960 
this edge I know that this is where my
range<00:05:25.420> will<00:05:25.750> be<00:05:25.780> I<00:05:26.230> won't<00:05:27.130> have<00:05:27.340> this<00:05:27.580> in<00:05:27.790> any

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
range will be I won't have this in any

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.240 
range will be I won't have this in any
longer<00:05:28.420> and<00:05:28.630> this<00:05:28.810> will<00:05:29.050> we<00:05:29.170> go<00:05:29.350> on<00:05:29.380> so<00:05:30.220> I

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
longer and this will we go on so I

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.950 
longer and this will we go on so I
measure<00:05:30.730> this<00:05:31.510> whole<00:05:31.810> area<00:05:32.290> so<00:05:32.880> I<00:05:33.880> now<00:05:34.540> have<00:05:34.570> my

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
measure this whole area so I now have my

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.440 
measure this whole area so I now have my
elevation<00:05:35.530> drawing<00:05:35.830> with<00:05:36.640> my<00:05:36.670> measurements

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
elevation drawing with my measurements

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.050 
elevation drawing with my measurements
being<00:05:38.320> sure<00:05:38.590> to<00:05:38.620> put<00:05:38.920> the<00:05:39.040> outlets<00:05:39.430> in<00:05:39.640> there<00:05:39.850> I

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
being sure to put the outlets in there I

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.320 
being sure to put the outlets in there I
also<00:05:41.050> want<00:05:41.500> to<00:05:41.560> know<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:42.010> height<00:05:42.370> so<00:05:43.210> I've

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
floor I haven't talked about the floor I

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.990 
floor I haven't talked about the floor I
should<00:06:20.830> tell<00:06:21.010> you<00:06:21.070> about<00:06:21.100> the<00:06:21.340> floor<00:06:21.520> we're

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
should tell you about the floor we're

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.240 
should tell you about the floor we're
going<00:06:22.120> to<00:06:22.180> keep<00:06:22.330> the<00:06:22.480> floor<00:06:22.660> tile<00:06:22.930> but<00:06:23.770> I<00:06:24.010> don't

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
going to keep the floor tile but I don't

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.640 
going to keep the floor tile but I don't
have<00:06:24.400> a<00:06:24.460> sample<00:06:24.730> of<00:06:24.970> that<00:06:25.180> so<00:06:25.900> what<00:06:26.050> I'll<00:06:26.200> do<00:06:26.410> is

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
have a sample of that so what I'll do is

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.780 
have a sample of that so what I'll do is
take<00:06:27.100> a<00:06:27.160> picture<00:06:27.400> with<00:06:27.670> my<00:06:27.850> phone<00:06:28.090> and<00:06:28.330> I<00:06:29.260> will

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
take a picture with my phone and I will

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.000 
take a picture with my phone and I will
have<00:06:30.790> at<00:06:31.090> least<00:06:31.450> an<00:06:31.720> idea<00:06:31.840> of<00:06:32.290> what<00:06:32.650> the<00:06:32.770> floor

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
have at least an idea of what the floor

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.190 
have at least an idea of what the floor
tile<00:06:33.280> looks<00:06:33.550> like<00:06:33.760> when<00:06:34.330> I<00:06:34.360> go<00:06:34.600> to<00:06:34.660> look<00:06:34.870> for<00:06:34.930> my

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.200 
tile looks like when I go to look for my

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.290 
tile looks like when I go to look for my
backsplash<00:06:35.590> material<00:06:36.310> the<00:06:36.790> other<00:06:37.000> thing<00:06:37.270> that

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
backsplash material the other thing that

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.000 
backsplash material the other thing that
would<00:06:37.540> probably<00:06:37.780> be<00:06:38.080> a<00:06:38.200> really<00:06:38.290> good<00:06:38.650> idea<00:06:38.950> for

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
would probably be a really good idea for

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.800 
would probably be a really good idea for
me<00:06:39.250> to<00:06:39.280> do

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
me to do

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.020 
me to do
would<00:06:40.170> be<00:06:40.320> to<00:06:40.440> take<00:06:40.680> a<00:06:40.710> picture<00:06:41.280> of<00:06:41.460> these

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
would be to take a picture of these

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.480 
would be to take a picture of these
problem<00:06:42.570> areas<00:06:42.720> that<00:06:43.110> I<00:06:43.139> talked<00:06:43.500> about<00:06:43.650> when<00:06:44.460> I

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490
