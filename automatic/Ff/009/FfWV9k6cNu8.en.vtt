00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello I 'm ambitious from the video of 30 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.060
 colleges in the viola of today I go 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.340
 understand the request of a person who 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.860
 watching my videos and asked 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.710
 how to install two monitors 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.920
 the same computer and thus achieve 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.660
 expand this work with the option of 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.150
 use different images and each 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.279
 for example by watching on the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.350
 monitor and browse the internet on the other 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.470
 so I'll show you that this procedure 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.490
 it is quite simple anyone with the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.219
 minimum knowledge in computer science 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.020
 Will you be able to do it and then let's go there ? 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.480
 I did not have two monitors to 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.379
 making demonstration so I took that 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.649
 32-inch old tv used as 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.590
 one of the monitors is the normal monitor I 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.750
 I use the computer and the computer 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.059
 turned backwards to facilitate the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.850
 then a case of this 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.699
 computer here I have installed on 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.120
 a very simple video card like this is 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.100
 which cost around $ 100 and this 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.939
 copy of the video it has three outputs 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.490
 one of its outputs is an hdmi output and 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.619
 a better standard output in this case. 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.040
 video card here I can use 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.540
 up to three different monitors with image 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.820
 difference is played on the screen hidden 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.660
 for example because that word does not 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.650
 allows most video cards 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.630
 modern and current 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.510
 they are compatible with this feature and 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.180
 you use multiple monitors in one 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.700
 for the most active video cards and 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.090
 may not support this feature 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.770
 so here in the cashew I did I made the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.840
 connecting the TV via an HDMI cable , and 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.240
 as long as you use TV through the 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.240
 juve in the brain and the computer monitor 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:04.759
 here has a very linked image on the network 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.630
 normal 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.399
 the hdmi cable and are here to roll 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.120
 if I had a third return with 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.120
 free entry 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:22.340
 The entrance should stay here so it's a 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.020
 benefit of this type of connection is in the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.070
 fact that you can expand your 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.450
 workspace 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.519
 for example a person who 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.180
 working with video editing can 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:35.620
 use the computer screen to do 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.440
 the edition to use for example 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.090
 view as a larger whole or even the 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.159
 same size monitor 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.430
 they preview the video one 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:48.549
 person who likes to play is 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.440
 It's racing cry for example you can 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.599
 have a monitor to function as if 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.390
 whether it was a rearview mirror or 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.739
 expand as division of your screen and 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.959
 various other things 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.090
 so here with an intention was only 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.280
 show this I have a video already 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.260
 published on the channel signing you are 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.049
 a video card so if your 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.910
 computer does not have a board defends 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.079
 that is compatible with the use of two or more 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.700
 more monitors 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.769
 but since you buy an easy 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.049
 installation I'll put the link here 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.910
 below so you can see the 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.940
 step by step procedure of 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.909
 installation of a video card and now 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.129
 I'll show you one of the benefits of 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:34.680
 time the monitors are here for 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:34.680
 example of the government on the Internet 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:47.880
 so if I want I can for example 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.900
 on one of the monitors 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:03.320
 so here for example what I did 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.140
 I can watch a thousand video on tv or 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.250
 watch a movie anything 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.940
 important part of the internet candle in 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.800
 time 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.440
 So how did I say one of the advantages? 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.960
 you can use two monitors is that 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.610
 Can you do two good jobs? 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.010
 different at the same time 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.170
 here for example I get the floor son 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.050
 even to the end of the silence of the 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.970
 installation of the video card and here I 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.490
 I can surf the internet 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.960
 so this is one of the advantages is if you 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.190
 have any questions concerning this 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.010
 procedure 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.710
 you can ask for the comments of 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.800
 impossible conversation is possible 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.750
 video is simpler but it was done there 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.760
 to meet a request from a person 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.290
 who watched if you have a story 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.720
 the video where you asked to apply a 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.820
 itamaraty premiere recommends signing up 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.070
 in the channel because the brain 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.950
 the electronic information content of the 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.990
 society and also leaves even because it 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.820
 Do you have any suggestions for you? 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.380
 suggests through comment could not 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.270
 have as soon as possible 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.780
 many thanks to watching the video 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.780
