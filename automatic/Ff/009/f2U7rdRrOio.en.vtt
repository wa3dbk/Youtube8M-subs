00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
your berry earlier than you actually

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.880 
your berry earlier than you actually
would<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.809> think<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.260> half<00:00:55.469> or<00:00:55.860> double

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
would I think it's like half or double

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.189 
would I think it's like half or double
earlier<00:00:56.610> but<00:00:57.149> I'm<00:00:57.300> she<00:00:57.840> goes<00:00:57.989> for<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
earlier but I'm she goes for the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.020 
earlier but I'm she goes for the
flamethrower<00:00:58.710> with<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> patio<00:00:59.370> berry<00:00:59.699> raise

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
flamethrower with the patio berry raise

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.360 
flamethrower with the patio berry raise
i<00:01:00.359> think<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:00.989> called<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.469> i<00:01:01.890> go<00:01:02.160> for<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
i think it's called and i go for the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.609 
i think it's called and i go for the
earthquake<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.840> will<00:01:04.019> take<00:01:04.260> out<00:01:04.439> that

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
earthquake so that will take out that

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.910 
earthquake so that will take out that
semi<00:01:04.920> see<00:01:05.220> no<00:01:05.610> problem<00:01:06.500> yeah<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.799> my

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
and sizzle and I was predicting

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.680 
and sizzle and I was predicting
something

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
something

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.720 
something
along<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.080> lines<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.500> superpower<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.250> I

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
along the lines of a superpower and I

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.210 
along the lines of a superpower and I
got<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.210> ride<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.480> guess<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:16.530> now<00:02:16.710> she<00:02:16.770> switches

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
got a ride I guess so now she switches

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.290 
got a ride I guess so now she switches
back<00:02:17.460> out<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.820> a<00:02:17.880> dragonite<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:20.760> forgot

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
back out to a dragonite and I I forgot

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.180 
back out to a dragonite and I I forgot
that<00:02:21.480> she<00:02:21.630> had<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.810> Zork<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.680> was<00:02:22.800> like<00:02:22.920> why

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
that she had a Zork and I was like why

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.670 
that she had a Zork and I was like why
is<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.460> dragonite<00:02:24.390> poisoned<00:02:24.810> isn't<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:25.140> gut

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
is that dragonite poisoned isn't it gut

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.850 
is that dragonite poisoned isn't it gut
flying-type<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:27.810> kind<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.110> confused<00:02:28.560> me<00:02:28.680> there

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
flying-type it kind of confused me there

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.380 
flying-type it kind of confused me there
but<00:02:29.100> in<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> end<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.610> figured<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.000> out<00:02:30.060> when<00:02:30.270> it

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
but in the end I figured it out when it
