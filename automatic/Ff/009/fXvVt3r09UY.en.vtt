00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.110
 now we are in one more program of the 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.500
 pc and they are problems of the university of 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.940
 Chile Chilean greetings to friends 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.820
 and it also helps you for the mathematics of 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.830
 school or if you're preparing in this 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.019
 question number two of the exam to all 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.909
 the Chilean universities tells us in 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:23.089
 the graph of figure 1 figure one 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:25.999
 is right here that they tell me about 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.050
 This chart tells me the following 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:29.210
 shows the distance in kilometers 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.500
 tours by four trucks 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.019
 abc and see the roads up here abcy 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.329
 d for a period of time the type 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.510
 is down here since time is in 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.660
 hours that is fine as then he wants 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.220
 say that the four trucks part of the 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.080
 Same time 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.940
 here do not know how 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.320
 good time you can place of 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.690
 any particular number if 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.340
 you want you can place the number two 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.040
 number one good interests me in the 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.670
 problem to 12 times that are all 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:06.049
 they will travel the same time 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.390
 and more tell me what is or which of the 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.149
 following statements are true 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.240
 the number one the truck of that more 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:17.820
 quick good let's analyze something 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.159
 remember what 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:26.030
 mrw we had this little triangle 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.759
 also in which up here was the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.130
 space here was speed and here 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.719
 was the time if you want to find the 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.359
 space in the product of speed by 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.829
 time if you wanted to be the speed it would be 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:39.649
 the division of who is above you are 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.450
 down space between time and if you wanted 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.060
 find time is going to be the division of 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.130
 who the space between speed and 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.000
 this step in this case we want to know 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.599
 that faster in this case the speed 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.069
 then for the speed mobile 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:58.429
 will be the same here in the division of 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:01.879
 space between time the space that 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.670
 travels the mobile is 40 kilometers or 

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:08.390
 in time for the 4 are going to be 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.840
 the same in this case it would be 240 between 2 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.050
 would give me a speed of 20 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.940
 let's test for the mobile its speed that 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.840
 would be the same would be the distance that 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.330
 travel that is 30 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.760
 between 2 it would be 15 we see that it is 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.700
 lowering speeds means that 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:33.730
 the cell phone is the fastest 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:37.519
 and here is one more question old age 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.129
 would be 20 between 210 and the would be 10 between 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.730
 25 then the speeds are 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:46.730
 lowering therefore the question of one 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.769
 it would be true let's go to two the 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.920
 truck is traveled twice the distance 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.739
 that runs the good way in the truck 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.580
 you go around that is your graph 30 in the 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:01.220
 truck is going to travel 30 kilometers and 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.340
 the truck is traveling how much is 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.790
 traveling 10 kilometers therefore 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.980
 it would be says the truck runs two 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.829
 times the distance traveled by the mine 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.829
 it is not false to be winning three times 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.660
 then this would be false if you 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.720
 he will ask that the truck travels two 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.270
 more times 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.480
 the distance that the truck travels 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.330
 it would be true because it is 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.050
 going through what goes the way that 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.720
 is 10 kilometers more than 2 times 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.230
 go through the change nothing of 10 by 2 me 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.850
 would give 20 and 20 would rather do 30 if 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.430
 was this little word more 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.580
 there it would be true how is the 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.050
 little word more then this affirmation 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.630
 it's false because the answer would be 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.670
 it should be 20 not in the truck I remember 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.510
 times the distance traveled by the truck 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:01.080
 it should not be triple three times we see 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.050
 the question the alternative 3 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.140
 the truck is going to erase this I've 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.980
 used 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.500
 in the truck you see runs the half that 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.560
 travels changing the gabion sees when 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.420
 is traveling, is traveling in 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.610
 total 20 km 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.090
 correct and the truck to be 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:26.760
 touring here is your graph 40 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.560
 kilometers if it says that the change should 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.840
 travel half the distance that 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:36.180
 remember change if true 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:38.730
 because 20 is half of 40 therefore 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.230
 the 3 would be true well very well 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.460
 then the correct alternatives would be 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:47.600
 the dwarf letter subscribe comments and 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.600
 see you in the next video
