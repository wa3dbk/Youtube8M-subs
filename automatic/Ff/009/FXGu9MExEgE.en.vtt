00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.460
 in the trunk of a regular sedan, I would like this 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.460
 easy of course not to the forest 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.690
 BMW introduced a new generation of cross 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:55.039
 coupe 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.829
 x 6 2 6 received the code designation f-16 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.360
 as a fighter the car got bigger 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.510
 both more powerful and more economical 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.460
 and in my opinion even more beautiful yet 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.130
 charismatic Mercedes who prepares 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.479
 and submit your version soon 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.390
 all-wheel drive coupe will obviously not have to 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.729
 compete easily with so handsome in 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.280
 the beginning of the new 6 will only be sold 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.250
 with three engines this is the last v8 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.819
 generations of 4 4 liters capacity 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.240
 450 horsepower 3-liter inline 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:28.190
 580 six-cylinder diesel engine 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.700
 horsepower and model with the same 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:35.149
 motor up to 381 horsepower 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.580
 forces and 450 strong eight capable 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.429
 accelerate the car to hundreds for 4 and 8 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:45.469
 seconds of diesel dynamics is also quite 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:47.420
 decent 6.7 not 5.2 seconds to a hundred 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.369
 respectively, the transmission 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.060
 eight-speed sports machine 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.560
 tiptronic with shift paddles 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.630
 average fuel consumption of new engines 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.899
 decreased according to the manufacturer 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.180
 somewhere around 22 percent next year 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.899
 the motor scale will be replenished with two more 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.060
 engines power 306 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.820
 313 horsepower wheelbase size 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.000
 new ik-6 has not changed on the car 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.070
 became a little longer by 32 millimeters on 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.910
 6 millimeters wider and 3 millimeters 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.700
 above 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.670
 Front optics is almost the same as 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.010
 on the new bmw x5 it fit perfectly into 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.109
 design models look great 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.359
 rear wings with a very characteristic 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.910
 dynamic relief they successfully 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.450
 harmonize in my opinion with even more sloping 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.610
 roofs 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.750
 body 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.120
 most are now really 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.890
 very similar to the cube and 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.040
 only with high ground clearance and five 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.310
 doors standard equipment new 6 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.230
 includes bikenon 19-inch wheels 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.550
 dual-zone climate control electric 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.740
 fifth door 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.600
 number of options unfortunately as always 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.120
 for very extra money 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.400
 standard is great and chic 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.660
 audio and multimedia system 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.670
 professional 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.950
 and parking aid with a circular 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.450
 overview and several complete sets including 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.580
 sports m package 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.790
 and even the trunk of the new 6 increased by 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.410
 75 liters and now its size is 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.640
 580 liters and with the rear folded 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.620
 the seats its volume 1 1525 liters 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.230
 although who can really 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.060
 interested in the size of the trunk on such 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.640
 car I have a suspicion that 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.739
 seedlings to the cottage and old refrigerators in 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.739
 their new sixth will not carry
