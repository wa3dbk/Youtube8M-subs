couldn't get on to the bigger map at the

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.810 
couldn't get on to the bigger map at the
moment<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.560> smaller<00:00:16.949> map<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.640> this

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
moment this is the smaller map so this

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.970 
moment this is the smaller map so this
one<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> lot<00:00:18.480> more<00:00:18.660> harder<00:00:19.050> but<00:00:19.650> are<00:00:19.859> the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
one is a lot more harder but are the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.710 
one is a lot more harder but are the
other<00:00:20.130> map<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.490> katie<00:00:20.730> for<00:00:20.939> 24<00:00:21.300> players<00:00:21.510> wear

a<00:00:23.519> video<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.970> bigger<00:00:24.150> map<00:00:24.390> but<00:00:24.689> uh<00:00:24.740> yeah

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
a video on the bigger map but uh yeah

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.620 
a video on the bigger map but uh yeah
anyway<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.490> point<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:26.849> game<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.359> just

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
anyway the point of this game is to just

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.450 
anyway the point of this game is to just
run<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:28.080> blocks<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.650> blocks<00:00:28.800> will<00:00:29.099> disappear

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
run on blocks and blocks will disappear

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.890 
run on blocks and blocks will disappear
behind<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.060> got<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.240> be<00:00:30.330> careful<00:00:30.510> and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
behind you so you got to be careful and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.139 
behind you so you got to be careful and
now<00:00:31.320> i<00:00:31.380> believe<00:00:31.740> there's<00:00:31.949> four<00:00:32.279> or<00:00:32.610> three

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
now i believe there's four or three

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.330 
now i believe there's four or three
layers<00:00:33.390> some<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.140> underneath<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.070> so

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
layers some of that underneath you so

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.920 
layers some of that underneath you so
once<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.850> fall<00:00:36.059> down<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.300> don't<00:00:36.600> fall<00:00:36.750> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
once you fall down you don't fall to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.290 
once you fall down you don't fall to
your<00:00:37.020> death<00:00:37.079> luckily<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.489> fall<00:00:38.760> down<00:00:39.000> to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
your death luckily but you fall down to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.420 
your death luckily but you fall down to
another<00:00:40.050> layer<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.770> pretty<00:00:41.070> much<00:00:41.190> get

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
another layer so you pretty much get

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.880 
another layer so you pretty much get
four<00:00:41.700> chances<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.840> bad<00:00:43.050> thing<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.350> if<00:00:43.739> you

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
four chances but the bad thing is if you

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.680 
four chances but the bad thing is if you
stay<00:00:44.100> up<00:00:44.129> here<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.550> long<00:00:44.789> you're<00:00:45.270> gonna<00:00:45.390> fall

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
stay up here for long you're gonna fall

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.930 
stay up here for long you're gonna fall
down<00:00:46.070> to<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.250> layers<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.670> already

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
down to the layers that have already

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.729 
down to the layers that have already
been<00:00:48.090> walked<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:48.960> guy<00:00:49.140> nearly<00:00:49.469> got<00:00:49.680> me

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739
