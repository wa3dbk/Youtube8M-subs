00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
null of Oasis so here's just what I can

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.650

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
remember when I just got to play this

00:04:16.660 --> 00:05:22.480 
remember when I just got to play this
stuff

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:45.120 

finally

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.210 

so<00:05:46.130> yeah<00:05:46.970> it's<00:05:47.780> I<00:05:48.290> think<00:05:48.620> it<00:05:48.710> sounds<00:05:48.890> a<00:05:49.100> lot

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
so yeah it's I think it sounds a lot

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.310 
so yeah it's I think it sounds a lot
different<00:05:49.280> because<00:05:50.030> of<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.360> the<00:05:50.720> F<00:05:50.870> holes<00:05:51.140> in

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
different because of the the F holes in

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.080 
different because of the the F holes in
it<00:05:51.440> and<00:05:51.590> stuff<00:05:51.830> and<00:05:52.040> is<00:05:52.250> kind<00:05:52.610> of<00:05:52.700> a<00:05:52.790> bit<00:05:52.940> more

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
it and stuff and is kind of a bit more

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.540 
it and stuff and is kind of a bit more
of<00:05:53.150> a<00:05:53.210> mellow<00:05:53.620> sound<00:05:54.620> and<00:05:54.860> stuff<00:05:55.040> and<00:05:55.400> it's

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
of a mellow sound and stuff and it's

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.370 
of a mellow sound and stuff and it's
definitely<00:05:55.820> lighter<00:05:56.230> because<00:05:57.230> there's

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
definitely lighter because there's

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.020 
definitely lighter because there's
nothing<00:05:57.590> to<00:05:57.770> it<00:05:58.070> which<00:05:58.520> I<00:05:58.640> think<00:05:58.700> makes<00:05:58.940> a

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
nothing to it which I think makes a

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.580 
nothing to it which I think makes a
massive<00:05:59.180> difference<00:05:59.360> to<00:05:59.780> my<00:05:59.900> being<00:06:00.290> able<00:06:00.470> to

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
massive difference to my being able to

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.440 
massive difference to my being able to
play<00:06:00.830> it<00:06:00.980> because<00:06:01.370> normal<00:06:01.820> Les<00:06:01.940> Paul's<00:06:02.180> I<00:06:02.270> just
