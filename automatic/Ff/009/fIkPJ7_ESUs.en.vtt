they'll all be in there so - one minute
twelve<00:00:47.910> point<00:00:48.150> one<00:00:48.210> from<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.630> Grainger<00:00:49.140> but

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
twelve point one from the Grainger but

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.260 
twelve point one from the Grainger but
in<00:00:49.680> fourth<00:00:49.950> place<00:00:50.130> we've<00:00:50.430> got<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> benefactor

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
in fourth place we've got the benefactor

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.270 
in fourth place we've got the benefactor
Serano<00:00:51.660> which<00:00:52.050> managed<00:00:52.380> to<00:00:52.530> achieve<00:00:52.650> a<00:00:52.860> woman

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
Serano which managed to achieve a woman

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.480 
Serano which managed to achieve a woman
at<00:00:53.400> eleven<00:00:53.820> point<00:00:54.120> seven<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:55.320> it's<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.130> good

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
at eleven point seven so it's a good

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.270 
at eleven point seven so it's a good
four<00:00:56.790> tenths<00:00:57.090> quicker<00:00:57.450> than<00:00:58.110> the<00:00:58.830> Grainger

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
four tenths quicker than the Grainger

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.270 
four tenths quicker than the Grainger
and<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.760> up<00:01:00.000> there<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.470> rose<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> lot

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and is up there and with the rose a lot

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.609 
and is up there and with the rose a lot
better<00:01:02.490> than<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.730> rest<00:01:02.880> of<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.120> SUVs<00:01:03.630> but

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
better than the rest of the SUVs but

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.480 
better than the rest of the SUVs but
it's<00:01:05.309> not<00:01:05.610> really<00:01:06.030> enough<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.950> get<00:01:07.950> close<00:01:08.310> to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
it's not really enough to get close to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.399 
it's not really enough to get close to
the<00:01:08.579> top<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.479> third<00:01:09.810> place<00:01:10.109> spot

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the top and in the third place spot

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.469 
the top and in the third place spot
we've<00:01:10.679> got<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.039> de<00:01:11.159> classe<00:01:11.429> Park<00:01:11.880> Ranger

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
we've got the de classe Park Ranger

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.740 
we've got the de classe Park Ranger
which<00:01:13.020> actually<00:01:13.380> achieved<00:01:13.679> a<00:01:13.770> one-minute

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
which actually achieved a one-minute

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.440 
which actually achieved a one-minute
11.00<00:01:15.750> force<00:01:16.140> or<00:01:16.439> very<00:01:17.219> very<00:01:17.549> very<00:01:17.880> close<00:01:18.240> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
11.00 force or very very very close to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.760 
11.00 force or very very very close to
getting<00:01:18.539> that<00:01:18.719> one<00:01:19.049> minute<00:01:19.320> ten<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.710> it

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
getting that one minute ten and it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.929 
getting that one minute ten and it
probably<00:01:20.100> would<00:01:20.249> have<00:01:20.280> been<00:01:20.399> able<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:20.909> a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
probably would have been able to get a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.669 
probably would have been able to get a
woman<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.390> ten<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.719> I'd<00:01:21.869> given<00:01:22.079> it<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.530> know<00:01:22.649> I

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
woman at ten if I'd given it you know I

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:25.550 
woman at ten if I'd given it you know I
know<00:01:22.950> flops<00:01:23.479> but<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.539> wanted<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.079> be<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.320> fair<00:01:25.530> as

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
know flops but I wanted to be as fair as

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560 
know flops but I wanted to be as fair as
possible<00:01:25.649> and<00:01:26.189> give<00:01:26.310> each<00:01:26.429> car<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> same<00:01:27.060> time

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
possible and give each car the same time

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.880 
possible and give each car the same time
so<00:01:28.439> yeah<00:01:28.920> one<00:01:29.249> minute<00:01:29.369> 11.04<00:01:30.359> the<00:01:30.719> park<00:01:31.409> ranger

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
so yeah one minute 11.04 the park ranger

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.620 
so yeah one minute 11.04 the park ranger
it<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> good<00:01:32.310> car<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.880> does<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.299> good

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
it is a good car that does have good

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.870 
it is a good car that does have good
traction<00:01:33.929> and<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.369> doesn't<00:01:35.670> have

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
traction and but it just doesn't have

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.130 
traction and but it just doesn't have
the<00:01:36.890> speed<00:01:37.890> for<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.249> top<00:01:38.429> two<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.780> second

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
the speed for the top two so in second

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.830 
the speed for the top two so in second
place<00:01:40.259> we<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.950> vapid<00:01:41.340> radius<00:01:41.850> which<00:01:42.299> got

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
place we have the vapid radius which got

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.370 
place we have the vapid radius which got
a<00:01:42.869> lap<00:01:43.170> time<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> 1<00:01:43.829> minute<00:01:44.030> 9.13<00:01:45.030> nine<00:01:45.659> now

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
a lap time of 1 minute 9.13 nine now

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.410 
a lap time of 1 minute 9.13 nine now
this<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> big<00:01:47.130> jump<00:01:47.520> from<00:01:47.639> the<00:01:47.789> Park<00:01:48.030> Ranger

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
this is a big jump from the Park Ranger

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.679 
this is a big jump from the Park Ranger
almost<00:01:48.840> two<00:01:49.170> seconds<00:01:49.710> quicker<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:51.090> really

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
almost two seconds quicker and really

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.149 
almost two seconds quicker and really
the<00:01:51.810> top<00:01:52.049> two<00:01:52.259> are<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.499> a<00:01:52.560> class<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.770> their<00:01:52.920> own

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
the top two are in a class of their own

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.879 
the top two are in a class of their own
so<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.179> radius<00:01:54.509> does<00:01:54.719> have<00:01:54.899> very<00:01:55.259> very<00:01:55.560> good

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:55.889 
so the radius does have very very good

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:59.120 
so the radius does have very very good
traction<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.429> very<00:01:57.060> good<00:01:57.240> brakes<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:57.810> well<00:01:58.130> so

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
traction and very good brakes as well so

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.489 
traction and very good brakes as well so
you<00:01:59.789> know<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.149> depends<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:01.020> your<00:02:01.139> driving

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:01.499 
you know it depends on your driving

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:03.050 
you know it depends on your driving
style<00:02:01.619> as<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.069> how<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.249> want<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.609> use<00:02:02.670> these

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
style as to how you want to use these

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.179 
style as to how you want to use these
cars<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.049> would<00:02:04.229> say<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.619> radius<00:02:05.009> is

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
cars but I would say that the radius is

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.010 
cars but I would say that the radius is
definitely<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.090> know<00:02:06.179> you<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.509> throw<00:02:06.810> into

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
definitely you know you can throw into

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.520 
definitely you know you can throw into
the<00:02:07.259> into<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.679> corners<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.130> lot<00:02:08.250> more<00:02:09.229> but<00:02:10.229> it

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the into the corners a lot more but it

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.510 
the into the corners a lot more but it
just<00:02:10.890> doesn't<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:11.910> power

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
just doesn't have the the power

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.520 
just doesn't have the the power
get<00:02:14.120> it<00:02:14.240> open<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.630> that<00:02:14.750> first<00:02:15.020> position

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
get it open to that first position

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.370 
get it open to that first position
because<00:02:16.280> in<00:02:16.580> first<00:02:16.970> place<00:02:17.210> with<00:02:17.810> their<00:02:18.110> lap

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
because in first place with their lap

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.830 
because in first place with their lap
time<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.800> one<00:02:19.040> minute<00:02:19.070> seven<00:02:19.910> point<00:02:20.240> six<00:02:20.510> four

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
time of one minute seven point six four

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.080 
time of one minute seven point six four
zero<00:02:20.870> is<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:22.100> galavant<00:02:22.550> abala

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
zero is the galavant abala

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.930 
zero is the galavant abala
now<00:02:23.750> this<00:02:24.080> is<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.380> second<00:02:24.860> baller<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:25.550> not<00:02:25.820> the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
now this is the second baller so not the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.570 
now this is the second baller so not the
one<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.300> looks<00:02:26.450> like<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:26.660> box<00:02:26.990> basically<00:02:27.580> it's

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
one that looks like a box basically it's

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.980 
one that looks like a box basically it's
the<00:02:28.730> one<00:02:28.850> that<00:02:28.940> looks<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.180> bit<00:02:29.210> more<00:02:29.480> stylish

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
the one that looks a bit more stylish

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.100 
the one that looks a bit more stylish
and<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:31.250> just<00:02:31.790> it's<00:02:32.090> it's<00:02:32.510> on<00:02:32.750> another<00:02:32.870> level

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
and this just it's it's on another level

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.500 
and this just it's it's on another level
really<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.830> know<00:02:33.920> it's<00:02:34.070> it's<00:02:34.400> more<00:02:34.700> than<00:02:34.880> it's

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
really you know it's it's more than it's

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.090 
really you know it's it's more than it's
about<00:02:35.720> one<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.170> half<00:02:36.350> seconds<00:02:36.860> quicker

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
about one and a half seconds quicker

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.030 
about one and a half seconds quicker
than<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.370> radius<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.320> doesn't<00:02:39.890> even

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
than the radius and it it doesn't even

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.500 
than the radius and it it doesn't even
have<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.550> traction<00:02:40.820> or<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.150> braking

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
have the traction or the braking

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.690 
have the traction or the braking
capabilities<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.290> radius<00:02:42.680> it's<00:02:43.160> just<00:02:43.490> out

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
capabilities of the radius it's just out

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.440 
capabilities of the radius it's just out
and<00:02:44.000> out<00:02:44.150> faster<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.460> just<00:02:46.910> has<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.180> lot

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
and out faster and the it just has a lot

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.830 
and out faster and the it just has a lot
more<00:02:47.480> power<00:02:47.900> behind<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:50.120> lot<00:02:50.630> more<00:02:50.660> a

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
more power behind it and a lot more a

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.650 
more power behind it and a lot more a
lot<00:02:51.140> better<00:02:51.350> acceleration<00:02:51.710> as<00:02:52.220> well<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:52.730> the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
lot better acceleration as well so the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.750 
lot better acceleration as well so the
baller<00:02:54.110> just<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.710> on<00:02:54.890> another<00:02:55.220> level<00:02:55.400> really

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
baller just is on another level really

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.360 
baller just is on another level really
and<00:02:56.660> it's<00:02:56.900> easily<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.440> fastest<00:02:57.950> as<00:02:58.100> long<00:02:58.250> as

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
and it's easily the fastest as long as

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.800 
and it's easily the fastest as long as
you<00:02:58.460> can<00:02:58.610> handle<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:59.000> around<00:02:59.240> the<00:02:59.360> corners

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
you can handle it around the corners

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.220 
you can handle it around the corners
it's<00:03:00.710> easily<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.340> fastest<00:03:01.790> SUV<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.810> if<00:03:03.140> you

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
it's easily the fastest SUV and if you

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.270 
it's easily the fastest SUV and if you
checked<00:03:03.470> out<00:03:03.590> some<00:03:03.800> of<00:03:03.920> my<00:03:04.010> other<00:03:04.190> videos

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
checked out some of my other videos

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.940 
checked out some of my other videos
you'll<00:03:04.850> know<00:03:04.910> that<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.240> 1<00:03:05.420> or<00:03:05.600> 7.6<00:03:06.470> is<00:03:06.620> actually

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
you'll know that a 1 or 7.6 is actually

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.250 
you'll know that a 1 or 7.6 is actually
a<00:03:07.160> would<00:03:07.790> be<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:07.970> reasonable<00:03:08.480> lap<00:03:08.780> time<00:03:08.990> for<00:03:09.230> a

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
a would be a reasonable lap time for a

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.100 
a would be a reasonable lap time for a
sedan<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.770> is<00:03:10.550> rivaling<00:03:11.180> where<00:03:11.750> isn't<00:03:11.870> that

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
sedan and is rivaling where isn't that

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.230 
sedan and is rivaling where isn't that
much<00:03:12.260> slower<00:03:12.620> than<00:03:12.650> some<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.250> coupe<00:03:13.460> is<00:03:13.700> so

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
much slower than some of the coupe is so

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.420 
much slower than some of the coupe is so
you<00:03:14.960> know<00:03:15.080> it<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.410> a<00:03:15.440> very<00:03:15.680> quick<00:03:15.980> lap<00:03:16.190> time

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
you know it is a very quick lap time

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.120 
you know it is a very quick lap time
especially<00:03:16.730> for<00:03:17.000> an<00:03:17.210> SUV<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:18.620> it's<00:03:18.800> easily

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
especially for an SUV and it's easily

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.460 
especially for an SUV and it's easily
the<00:03:19.310> quickest<00:03:19.760> in<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.000> SUV's<00:03:20.450> class<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:21.440> I

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
the quickest in the SUV's class so I

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.930 
the quickest in the SUV's class so I
hope<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.070> has<00:03:22.190> helped<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:22.520> figure<00:03:22.910> out

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
hope this has helped you figure out

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.510 
hope this has helped you figure out
which<00:03:23.180> SUV<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:24.050> want<00:03:24.260> and<00:03:24.530> which<00:03:24.770> car<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.340> use
