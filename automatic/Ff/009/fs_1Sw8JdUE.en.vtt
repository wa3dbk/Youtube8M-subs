back of the case so it's a clear back
case<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> say<00:01:36.330> will<00:01:36.510> fully<00:01:36.750> show<00:01:37.080> off

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
case that like I say will fully show off

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.940 
case that like I say will fully show off
your<00:01:38.130> iPad<00:01:38.700> Mini<00:01:38.970> 3<00:01:39.170> have<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.320> gold<00:01:40.530> one<00:01:40.740> here

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
your iPad Mini 3 have the gold one here

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.039 
your iPad Mini 3 have the gold one here
so<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.400> definitely<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.180> then<00:01:42.960> it

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
so you can definitely see that then it

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.539 
so you can definitely see that then it
has<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> front<00:01:43.470> cover<00:01:43.740> that's<00:01:44.010> going<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.340> cover

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
has a front cover that's going to cover

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.289 
has a front cover that's going to cover
it<00:01:44.700> up<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.600> also<00:01:45.780> folds<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.939> which<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.119> nice

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
it up and it also folds up which is nice

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.320 
it up and it also folds up which is nice
and<00:01:48.659> provides<00:01:49.640> several<00:01:50.640> different<00:01:50.970> viewing

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
and provides several different viewing

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.090 
and provides several different viewing
angles<00:01:51.720> there<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.260> see<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.590> landscape

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
angles there you can see the landscape

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.640 
angles there you can see the landscape
but<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.640> also<00:01:53.760> does<00:01:54.119> portrait<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.900> a<00:01:55.200> typing

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
but it also does portrait and a typing

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.800 
but it also does portrait and a typing
angle<00:01:55.979> as<00:01:56.189> well<00:01:56.490> has<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.299> sleep/wake

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.170 
angle as well has the sleep/wake
functionality<00:01:58.619> which<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.130> see<00:01:59.340> turns

typing mode so I can just fold that over

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.090 
typing mode so I can just fold that over
put<00:06:40.910> that<00:06:41.120> in<00:06:41.360> the<00:06:41.660> little<00:06:41.870> slot<00:06:42.110> there

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 
put that in the little slot there

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.770 
put that in the little slot there
and<00:06:43.220> that<00:06:43.460> can<00:06:43.610> be<00:06:43.700> used<00:06:43.880> in<00:06:44.120> a<00:06:44.240> typing<00:06:44.630> mode

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
and that can be used in a typing mode

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.140 
and that can be used in a typing mode
which<00:06:45.050> is<00:06:45.230> nice<00:06:45.470> so<00:06:45.730> gives<00:06:46.730> you<00:06:46.850> a<00:06:46.880> lot<00:06:47.030> of
