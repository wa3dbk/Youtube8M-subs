have a bar that it makes it a little
harder<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.970> mean<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.520> if<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
harder but you mean it's if you have a

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.910 
harder but you mean it's if you have a
from<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.360> mean<00:01:48.509> their<00:01:49.020> setups<00:01:49.470> are<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> really

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
from in I mean their setups are a really

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.859 
from in I mean their setups are a really
good<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.250> good<00:01:50.670> start<00:01:51.030> temperature<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:51.780> it

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
good that good start temperature but it

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.990 
good that good start temperature but it
worse<00:01:52.020> them<00:01:52.229> out<00:01:52.380> then<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.579> know<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.700> mean<00:01:53.850> like

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
worse them out then you know I mean like

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.450 
worse them out then you know I mean like
what<00:01:54.180> happened<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> first<00:01:54.869> race<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.680> movin

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
what happened in the first race we movin

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.490 
what happened in the first race we movin
really<00:01:56.729> aggressive<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> setup<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:58.049> speed

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
really aggressive on the setup for speed

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.190 
really aggressive on the setup for speed
and<00:01:58.979> we<00:01:59.189> kill<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> tires<00:01:59.759> were<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.869> Long

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and we kill the tires were in in Long

job<00:02:02.670> I'm<00:02:03.149> putting<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.020> set<00:02:04.229> up<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.560> gonna

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
job I'm putting a set up that is gonna

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.889 
job I'm putting a set up that is gonna
look<00:02:04.890> after<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.280> tires<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:06.509> at<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.719> same

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
look after the tires but at the same

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.779 
look after the tires but at the same
time<00:02:07.170> if<00:02:07.409> he<00:02:07.530> looks<00:02:07.710> at<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.979> tires<00:02:08.250> then<00:02:08.610> it's

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
time if he looks at the tires then it's

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.400 
time if he looks at the tires then it's
not<00:02:08.970> gonna<00:02:09.149> create<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.750> ultimate<00:02:10.200> laugh

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
not gonna create that ultimate laugh

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.800 
not gonna create that ultimate laugh
because<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.580> too<00:02:11.819> easy<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.270> tire<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:12.690> you

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
because it's too easy on the tire so you

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.309 
because it's too easy on the tire so you
know

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
know

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.309 
know
generate<00:02:13.650> enough<00:02:13.890> heat<00:02:13.920> on<00:02:14.249> them<00:02:14.400> yeah<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.359> on

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
generate enough heat on them yeah and on

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.619 
generate enough heat on them yeah and on
ovals<00:02:16.680> with<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.129> test<00:02:17.370> you've<00:02:17.549> just<00:02:17.760> done<00:02:18.030> how

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
ovals with the test you've just done how

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.770 
ovals with the test you've just done how
does<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.989> feel<00:02:19.260> come<00:02:20.099> on<00:02:20.219> seems<00:02:21.180> okay<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.569> know

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
does it feel come on seems okay you know

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.330 
does it feel come on seems okay you know
I<00:02:21.810> mean<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.019> gotta<00:02:22.200> figure<00:02:22.409> out<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.859> bracing<00:02:23.249> a

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
I mean I gotta figure out the bracing a

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.339 
I mean I gotta figure out the bracing a
little<00:02:23.579> bit<00:02:23.700> how<00:02:24.150> close<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.629> can<00:02:24.810> run<00:02:25.049> behind

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
little bit how close you can run behind

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.959 
little bit how close you can run behind
them<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.859> you<00:02:26.069> don't<00:02:26.219> mean<00:02:26.310> understand<00:02:26.790> that

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:26.969 
them and you don't mean understand that

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:31.220 
them and you don't mean understand that
a<00:02:26.999> little<00:02:27.329> bit<00:02:28.310> but<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.879> seems<00:02:30.269> I<00:02:30.659> mean<00:02:30.959> speed

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
a little bit but it seems I mean speed

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.170 
a little bit but it seems I mean speed

out and I figure out a way to run wide
open<00:02:42.989> Wow

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889

the way around and and then we looked at

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.860 
the way around and and then we looked at
the<00:02:46.980> data<00:02:47.159> on<00:02:47.400> niether<00:02:48.000> earlier<00:02:48.389> will<00:02:48.659> we're

opposite<00:02:54.269> lock<00:02:54.449> on<00:02:54.659> the<00:02:54.810> steering<00:02:55.079> telemetry

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
opposite lock on the steering telemetry

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.670 
opposite lock on the steering telemetry
in<00:02:55.799> that<00:02:56.010> wide<00:02:56.250> open<00:02:56.280> lap<00:02:56.819> no<00:02:57.689> no<00:02:57.959> no<00:02:58.109> they<00:02:58.349> in

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
in that wide open lap no no no they in

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.159 
in that wide open lap no no no they in
the<00:02:58.799> car

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169 
the car

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.559 
the car
they're<00:03:01.169> really<00:03:01.469> tail<00:03:01.769> heavy<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.549> so<00:03:03.329> there's

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
they're really tail heavy and so there's

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.789 
they're really tail heavy and so there's
a<00:03:03.629> lot<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.930> weight<00:03:04.079> on<00:03:04.109> the<00:03:04.290> back<00:03:04.409> of<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.620> car

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
a lot of weight on the back of the car

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.330 
a lot of weight on the back of the car
so<00:03:06.169> if<00:03:07.169> you<00:03:07.260> get<00:03:07.409> opposite<00:03:07.799> lock<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.189> know<00:03:08.310> I

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
so if you get opposite lock you know I

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.390 
so if you get opposite lock you know I
would<00:03:09.000> say<00:03:09.389> there's<00:03:09.689> a<00:03:09.780> good<00:03:10.169> chance<00:03:10.829> it's<00:03:11.340> not

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
would say there's a good chance it's not

NASCAR<00:03:22.019> if<00:03:22.109> you<00:03:22.229> do<00:03:22.409> get<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.650> lot<00:03:22.829> of<00:03:22.919> opposite

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
NASCAR if you do get a lot of opposite

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.939 
NASCAR if you do get a lot of opposite
lock<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:24.000> it's<00:03:24.150> it's<00:03:24.449> weird<00:03:24.810> because<00:03:25.019> see

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
lock and it's it's weird because see

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.490 
lock and it's it's weird because see
that<00:03:26.189> in<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.639> point<00:03:26.939> of<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.389> phone<00:03:27.720> one<00:03:28.169> or

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
that in the point of a phone one or

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.819 
that in the point of a phone one or
IndyCar<00:03:29.129> when<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.579> car<00:03:29.790> goes<00:03:30.290> that's<00:03:31.290> for<00:03:31.709> you

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
IndyCar when the car goes that's for you

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.270 
IndyCar when the car goes that's for you
starting<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.250> get<00:03:32.400> comfortable<00:03:32.790> in<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.090> cop<00:03:33.239> car

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
starting to get comfortable in a cop car

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.589 
starting to get comfortable in a cop car
so<00:03:35.280> it's<00:03:35.400> like<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.729> thing<00:03:35.939> gets<00:03:36.150> out<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.389> shape

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
so it's like the thing gets out of shape

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.439 
so it's like the thing gets out of shape
and<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:36.930> can<00:03:36.959> okay<00:03:37.769> tell<00:03:37.979> a<00:03:38.009> shape<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.579> can

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
and you can okay tell a shape you can

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.509 
and you can okay tell a shape you can
stand<00:03:39.780> again<00:03:40.049> as<00:03:40.199> you<00:03:40.319> can<00:03:40.349> keep<00:03:40.739> going<00:03:40.919> that

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
stand again as you can keep going that

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.909 
stand again as you can keep going that
it's<00:03:41.729> very<00:03:41.970> different<00:03:42.239> so<00:03:42.900> yeah<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.560> that

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
it's very different so yeah that that

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.439 
it's very different so yeah that that
was<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.069> hard<00:03:44.340> thing<00:03:44.519> when<00:03:44.669> I<00:03:44.699> went<00:03:44.849> to<00:03:45.030> NASA<00:03:45.239> I

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449 
was a hard thing when I went to NASA I

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.330 
was a hard thing when I went to NASA I
was<00:03:45.479> getting<00:03:45.900> used<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.199> okay<00:03:46.530> it's<00:03:47.009> sideways

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
was getting used to okay it's sideways

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.569 
was getting used to okay it's sideways
where<00:03:47.790> you're<00:03:47.909> good<00:03:48.169> yeah<00:03:49.169> but<00:03:49.349> that's<00:03:50.340> what

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
where you're good yeah but that's what

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:51.949 
where you're good yeah but that's what
racing<00:03:50.790> should<00:03:51.150> be<00:03:51.269> all<00:03:51.359> about<00:03:51.389> I<00:03:51.629> think<00:03:51.780> it

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
racing should be all about I think it

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.330 
racing should be all about I think it
was<00:03:51.989> Jill<00:03:52.259> Vilna<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:52.769> once<00:03:52.919> said<00:03:53.159> that

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
was Jill Vilna that once said that

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.640 
was Jill Vilna that once said that
whenever<00:03:53.909> racing<00:03:54.449> is<00:03:54.569> slow<00:03:54.870> in<00:03:55.079> your<00:03:55.229> sideways

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
whenever racing is slow in your sideways

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.300 
whenever racing is slow in your sideways
that's<00:03:55.949> bad<00:03:56.159> racing<00:03:57.739> but<00:03:58.739> one<00:03:58.889> public<00:03:59.219> when

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
that's bad racing but one public when

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.860 
that's bad racing but one public when
you<00:03:59.370> look<00:03:59.519> back<00:03:59.699> now<00:03:59.939> at<00:04:00.090> your<00:04:00.209> NASCAR<00:04:00.689> career

we're going in I mean they're going the
right<00:04:30.979> direction<00:04:31.039> but<00:04:31.789> it's<00:04:32.569> hard<00:04:32.900> when<00:04:33.020> you

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
right direction but it's hard when you

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.480 
right direction but it's hard when you
make<00:04:33.289> so<00:04:33.409> many<00:04:33.499> changes<00:04:33.800> there's<00:04:34.340> no

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
make so many changes there's no

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.030 
make so many changes there's no
consistency
