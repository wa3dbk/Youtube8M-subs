 perl 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.120
 in his absence it is the director of the opow following the duel of the shock of 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.819
 titans 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:16.929
 0 360 and ps3 which the club needs because it is always for paris and in 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:20.140
 this video that will tell us about the combat system if the understand 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.210
 m 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.230
 and as soon as you pay so that you are fighting against the visible exodus 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.589
 it is enough if visible again 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.090
 the stronger you're doing what it gives once you have 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.560
 weakened in the elite to be very mentally strong 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.210
 for the sixth time you use secondary weapons, we talk about it 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.210
 a little slower while the networks of the event 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.430
 do not agree so kind of twitter so that's not worth it 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.710
 I could not do that brandon 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.490
 first at the bass 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.950
 it's relatively simple so he has to use the secondary weapons that 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.630
 are there 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.750
 in fact what you are according to the elected 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.950
 here is the popular china can we still work a little more of the dead 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.309
 for europe in the fascinating world you must not hurt it patti hansen 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.510
 allows to show directly his orders when you see you go in the small 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.850
 menu 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.439
 once in the secondary 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.319
 and there you have a whole darmon quality and stop declared either three points 

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.329
 basic they are subdivided so years 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:18.370
 several categories claude makelele hammer days 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.860
 lahrache points 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.560
 the request was missed therapy and so according to the elected 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.080
 we will have to take 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.740
 to the violence of certain passages elsewhere this is the good weapon 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.980
 the accusation that 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.880
 this game leads 6% 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.680
 I go so 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.240
 the machines actually use the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.270
 the mythological 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.450
 yes the 7th resolutely Japanese 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.170
 in his way for them to present the action 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.170
 art and do it but hey it's still good for a lot of things 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.350
 no doubt that the stuff that makes you think that the city will put him because of 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.380
 the aggravation of fighting in the currency effects and it feels like that 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.330
 looks like the victim are using the brigade 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.370
 the most American of finance has of what 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.960
 justice has for the moment his act he is finally forfeit this piece has 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.490
 succeeded where he wants at once you doubt that several weapons 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.600
 recovered you can also 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.850
 exchanges show how are you 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.140
 for example rodong reinforced 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.099
 to prevail 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.599
 weapons also so with targets to find burglaries are the 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.289
 Armenian 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:16.299
 here's the ice cream brings a little aspect it tests the lisation that is 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:16.930
 interesting 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:17.710
 Sadly 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.909
 audax arabic 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.509
 what is not the heart of the game 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:22.429
 know the action city 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.709
 I find it extremely redundant and proceeded to the Dutch internet 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.259
 taketori detail of italy 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.329
 more generally done that is inserted between two bones 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.279
 small requires a particular technique to be beaten 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:35.179
 but percent 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:36.669
 as unfortunately 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:40.399
 me personally I find it very very redundant a very screening 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.310
 repetitive and country then liman missing 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.579
 how can we really 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.509
 the losc something at the level of the dgsn react to what was there 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:49.639
 unrolled theme started two days afp 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.900
 I thought my train to get up 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.849
 the main 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.339
 the future after the quack 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:57.059
 for the apa know how to tame 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:00.409
 costa finishing our world provider in water 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:04.839
 for once the deposit paid 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:07.719
 he gives me his arms while an interesting thing if you can that his 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:08.619
 opponents 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:11.619
 about european cuts global growth 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:15.339
 what's more you'll have it so I'll be able to recover 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:20.110
 a kind of cold spring machine if I can say it will allow me 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.249
 to use so why not 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:25.399
 finally with attacks 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:27.760
 attacks to special attacks 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.909
 disarms secondary 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.359
 everything is linked after for example of which 10% 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.139
 the a380 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.369
 a dollar flop affected and rain 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:39.779
 so here it is who will follow 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:42.779
 its victorious goal to use them 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.059
 so this year was the example 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.870
 the team managed to do just now about the reform 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.240
 he is accused of two small 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.160
 mandela remained closed hewitt almost came face to face like that 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.539
 who is the most cited cooking all the elected 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:58.539
 so during the clasico that's it that's done it's very classic 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.659
 sometimes my brother flourish the avatar of a suicide 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.689
 French secret services 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:09.809
 so point 2008 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:13.229
 free radio I recover you I can recover objects so there I the 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:15.849
 know by the standards of protection from where the interest to do that in fact 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.289
 in all cases of opponent and it's all the more interesting 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.079
 still important sooner 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.340
 pretext to recover time 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.400
 the women 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.240
 toorop what they have to say 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.840
 who will allow you 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.759
 secondary weapons 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.139
 in the wake of the strike 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.509
 these small parties 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.779
 it's a pity that it's not really busy 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:38.900
 but but 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.900
 luckily everything will stop 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.199
 you have to fight according to m 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.240
 it's not uninteresting and despite despite three bullets in the secondary 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.539
 despite not bad not a system choice of life 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.550
 review of finishing moves not based on them on the usa 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.150
 priscilla 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.229
 yes it's at the csa wide roof 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.910
 his favor but they are often reluctant to deal with derivatives 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.839
 among them lie twice and company 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:14.319
 France in this competition France 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.319
 the vote was acquired from fortis holding he quotes these figures 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:23.409
 even without talking about homework for the csc 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.110
 it is extreme 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.949
 you me I think it is also close finally a lot of small who 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:31.479
 is not the case of other friends 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.580
 he takes a lot of ideas 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.129
 good there I quote damage is not the case because it's a game that came out 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:37.139
 on both sides 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.550
 mehdi baala thousand the concern is that besides the fact that it must be concluded 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.139
 the 40 40 organizer 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.710
 currently has metastases start tomorrow 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.689
 teach them a little bit further east 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:50.319
 so proposed 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.770
 not bad at all he proposed in November of three cases 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.910
 it takes a little less than 4 30 euros really because others for samba 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.219
 after after busy 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:03.619
 - the value has benefited in begging his wife side 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:06.619
 first obvious sign of the second 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.009
 yet shows that a small trickle 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:12.589
 christine 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:15.860
 you follow a periphery tables in celebration of the nettle of the film 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.279
 after to 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:20.419
 lengthen the life they have lengthened women are added by 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.669
 our team in search of queries annexes mail the problem is that the techniques 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.359
 is with his interesting film and that the canvas in the same environment 

00:06:26.359 --> 00:06:28.759
 this one 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:32.080
 in the katuba system by order 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.960
 the coaches 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.600
 to do the same thing to know through these environments 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.509
 and in addition they pushed the vice up 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:39.810
 until we do 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.960
 radio france 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.289
 pass it 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:45.270
 however in 80% of cases 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.869
 hawthorne so c 

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:49.710
 repetitive pssst and here are the levels extremely 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.909
 extremely repetitive 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:53.050
 and that's his victory 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.050
 what I did not blame my day he retired from the race 2 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.550
 to guess who is starting to accelerate the recovery 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.850
 yes yes this damn little question of certain types of packages and 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.529
 emotionally in the game 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:09.029
 in ain he knows how to play football with periods of speed 

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:11.969
 story to demonstrate that doing is a historical superman that you can 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:15.289
 run in a lot faster than when you want to take the time of the grab 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:18.839
 so sometimes societal problems from the coup de montréal the 

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:21.369
 things that happen there is no veolia there is no phase of strong 

00:07:21.369 --> 00:07:23.210
 nice way to ensure may 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.389
 unstoppable this is drawing up several schools of agen twice a year that's 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:28.860
 still enough is fabulous 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.860
 now it was indeed saussez boss of tax increases 

00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:35.860
 this is for the sake of having watched 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.289
 this second video of all time 

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:40.469
 I was a little tense 

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:41.809
 life to 16 people
