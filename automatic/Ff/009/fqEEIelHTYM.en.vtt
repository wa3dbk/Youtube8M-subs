the bug jar there and then they can take
a<00:03:30.870> look<00:03:31.110> at<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.650> different<00:03:32.010> bugs<00:03:32.190> through<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
a look at the different bugs through the

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.690 
a look at the different bugs through the
magnifying<00:03:33.750> glass<00:03:33.870> there<00:03:34.370> that's<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.520> fun

this<00:04:49.830> is<00:04:50.010> it<00:04:50.190> no<00:04:50.930> here<00:04:51.930> it<00:04:52.050> is<00:04:52.200> praying<00:04:52.620> mantis

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.650 

this<00:04:57.270> is<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.660> ant<00:04:57.900> can<00:04:58.800> you<00:04:58.889> find<00:04:59.100> the<00:04:59.250> ant

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
this is the ant can you find the ant

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.630 
this is the ant can you find the ant
let's<00:05:00.660> see<00:05:01.080> that<00:05:01.500> one<00:05:01.680> No

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
let's see that one No

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.060 
let's see that one No
and<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.419> top<00:05:03.600> goes<00:05:03.810> on<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.230> on<00:05:04.290> this<00:05:04.530> is<00:05:04.650> great

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
and the top goes on and on this is great

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.180 
and the top goes on and on this is great
for<00:05:05.310> matching<00:05:05.720> practice<00:05:06.720> and<00:05:06.960> for<00:05:07.860> visual

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
for matching practice and for visual

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.960 
for matching practice and for visual
discrimination<00:05:09.290> and<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:11.310> last<00:05:11.490> activity

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
discrimination and the last activity

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
thorax and the abdomen let's go to the

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.320 
thorax and the abdomen let's go to the
next<00:05:49.950> one<00:05:50.130> to<00:05:50.280> determine<00:05:50.640> if<00:05:50.729> it's<00:05:50.880> an<00:05:50.970> insect

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
next one to determine if it's an insect

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.430 
next one to determine if it's an insect
does<00:05:52.260> it<00:05:52.500> have<00:05:52.710> six<00:05:53.039> legs<00:05:53.340> no<00:05:53.729> more<00:05:53.970> no<00:05:54.120> less

one two three four five six yes and

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.710 
one two three four five six yes and
lastly<00:06:00.900> all<00:06:01.770> insects<00:06:02.250> must<00:06:02.430> have<00:06:02.580> antennas<00:06:03.210> or

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
lastly all insects must have antennas or

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.420 
lastly all insects must have antennas or
feelers<00:06:04.260> on<00:06:04.410> their<00:06:04.590> head<00:06:04.800> and<00:06:04.919> this<00:06:05.039> one<00:06:05.220> does

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
feelers on their head and this one does

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.070 
feelers on their head and this one does
so<00:06:05.669> this<00:06:06.330> is<00:06:06.539> indeed<00:06:06.960> a<00:06:07.430> insect<00:06:08.840> the<00:06:09.840> child

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
so this is indeed a insect the child

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.560 
so this is indeed a insect the child
goes<00:06:10.260> on<00:06:10.440> and<00:06:10.620> on<00:06:10.940> let's<00:06:11.940> see<00:06:12.090> this<00:06:12.240> one<00:06:12.479> is
