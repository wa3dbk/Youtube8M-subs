00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.060
 absolutely so we start today vi 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:23.070
 I want to show how to download from mode 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.039
 too many items on minecraft cracked for 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.699
 mac 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:32.700
 meanwhile we have to go to this link 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:35.640
 this link that I will leave you in 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:43.950
 description this link that I will leave you 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:45.180
 in description so this link one 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.550
 Once in this link you will have to 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:55.440

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.149
 tutorial applies to versions 1.5 1.5.1 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.210
 is 1.5.2 therefore more or less the most recent 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.250
 who call on this link 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.030
 immediately this will not be downloaded 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.850
 folder that we for convenience 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.710
 we will carry in the desktop as you see me 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.710
 I've downloaded so many times 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:24.689
 so then we will have to go to martin tosh 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:29.850
 that is, go here in first class 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:35.450
 here this cannot go into 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:39.689
 bookstore once in the library in hatred 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.090
 application support in application 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.149
 support you will find the minecraft folder 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.549
 at athens the minecraft folder you will find 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.970
 so many tantini folders in different 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:57.630
 you have to go to be in minecraft point 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.460
 just missing jar but the jar point for 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.170
 who has it for those who don't have it there is a 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.760
 completely different process that I believe 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.149
 which I'll show you in another tutorial 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.460
 once gone to the minecraft point already 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.300
 enough just that you will find many in 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.900
 different 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:22.640
 just open the too many folder 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:24.940
 items select all all 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.170
 pages present the paper like nothing 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.780
 simply copy and paste like this 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.850
 here in the folder what I 've been 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.709
 I won't do it because I've already done it 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:42.800
 clearly and by form already downloaded 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.959
 let's pretend i already have that 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:51.890
 the books I made I made a copy 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:53.810
 paste inside and small inside you and now 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.300
 here we close the minecraft folder 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:03.800
 dot jre and open minecraft point up 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:12.380
 that would be the inter minecraft game 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:17.300
 game here's a moment that loads 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:22.239
 ah I forgot this tutorial 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:24.830
 applies only to those at minecraft forge 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.200
 therefore before downloading this mode 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.450
 you have to know if you never know kraft or maybe 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.440
 you have to download the vi one first 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:36.790
 I show a world in a world 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.790
 ordunque which world 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:47.000
 this on white we shoot at random 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.530
 most likely this will appear 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.760
 what to click on yes because a lot 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:59.690
 probably so it will load that 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:02.450
 our world that is not so much world 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.280
 can call is my world that I use 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.920
 when I vent myself just when I want 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:13.160
 let me off take the tnt and bomba bum bam 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:18.709
 fire and flames going into the inventory 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:24.670
 we will find this ie too many items ci 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:28.340
 there will be many attacks on different objects 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:30.560
 has so many many urgent 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.130
 there is also a search for various objects 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.790
 for example if we do spooner I can 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:42.500
 writing banks will give us all answers 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:45.560
 present in which south hands items in 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.630
 practice will gradually become me 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.760
 nasty this stuff here in practice 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.400
 to select something 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.010
 it will simply be enough to do for example 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.380
 a nice jude will simply suffice 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:00.860
 click it that a stack of will appear 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:05.590
 these things in the inventory in the limit 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.590
 airy indeed we have a staff of 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:20.210
 so much baires now is the hug 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:27.530
 I like it so I will eliminate it 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:34.460
 a moment I will do this, however, ad 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:37.070
 eliminating was just attached taste 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.680
 and mÃ² just observed the fixing of the 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.760
 sorry sorry takata guys it's not

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:56.280

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.220
