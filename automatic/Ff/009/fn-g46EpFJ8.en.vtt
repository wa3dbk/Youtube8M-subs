00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.400
 if the skin 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.050
 from yesterday 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.270
 hi friends today we are going to learn to play 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.630
 the lip a classic of the beatles 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.420
 you would like to learn it, let's go to it 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.550
 The first thing we will see is the intro 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.710
 what is that I just played there 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.990
 uses only four chords 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.900
 the first is my minor if I carry it in my 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.840
 minor the next one is the biggest if what 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:45.440
 viola 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.440
 the third major if the u2 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:55.100
 and ends in G major for easy truth 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.100
 without me 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:04.629
 now the greatest now 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.149
 greater 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.950
 once you have the chords you already know 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.110
 the change between them what we have to 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.000
 to do is to learn the rhythm that 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.939
 apply is this look let's put my 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.539
 minor and we're going to do well let's give 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.390
 down down up up down down and up 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.570
 he always does that's how we're going to do it 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.570
 slowly 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:41.040
 ta ta ta ta ta 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.900
 and that does it in all the chords 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.250
 look, let's do the intro slowly 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.150
 so you can practice friends 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.150
 starts 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.690
 easy no longer little by little it will be catching 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.690
 speed and reacting better 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.879
 and after the delivery it comes to 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.840
 which is the verse that is when it starts 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:37.270
 to sing and he turns them 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.520
 d 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.410
 and there he uses only those four 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.630
 chords that I just showed you the 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:51.300
 first is G major I am for my 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:56.220
 minor the second now yes 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:59.120
 and re greater repeats is greater sun 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:04.310
 and less 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.590
 without minor and flock and at the rate that applies 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.569
 I have good news is the same as 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.760
 we have learned in the intro we are going to 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.019
 practice it then with the rhythm let's go 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.019
 there youtube 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.350
 easy truth after this comes what 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:43.260
 that up to the refrain 66 if I think about it 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.260
 Older and you know that camping 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.040
 now comes the most complicated chord 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.909
 all for you and if you are a novice who is do 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.470
 minor I'm still here with capo entrÃ© 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:57.250
 Until 3 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.500
 someone nobody forget god 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.080
 let's touch this part so you can see 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.080
 how is it slow 16 yes 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.600
 i 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.000
 less 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.260
 at least 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.570
 of elders 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.430
 Well, fantastic , we already have all the 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.640
 parts of the song because now what 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.640
 come back is again to stanza 66 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.140
 higher 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.310
 m 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.310
 and we come again the chorus 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.860
 and huge success just as they have finished 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.069
 to profile 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.710
 and I repeat Chile again and today in the 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.710
 yesterday's intro if the skin 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:20.080
 the enter returns to make another stanza the 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:24.129
 refrain and ends with the same 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.139
 if you violate them 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:31.539
 the data because here comes the change 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:34.319
 two or three strokes down and 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.319
 Now he comes to row 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:45.990
 They are older and younger and come back to care 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.990
 younger and older 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:57.520
 again take care it has stopped says and not 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:06:00.180
 new york live my life and do the 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.180
 final chorus 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:07.770
 the same rhythm 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.770
 and I contract with the largest innate bid 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.180
 lacava 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.660
 although there are friends thus fixed of this 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.550
 way so easy we want this great 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.140
 classic of the beatles the only thing that 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.670
 you have to do is learn the 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.890
 chord progressions that are very 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.830
 simple and use the pace that we have 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.440
 learned for the whole song now what 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.850
 What I recommend is that you visit the 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.820
 video show that I leave the link 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.440
 that I lower it and touch it with me and if 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.480
 you're not, well, I recommend you 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.520
 subscribe to the guitar channel to 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.110
 be aware of the news and if you 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.660
