in LA I'm really happy that I have a TV

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.710 
in LA I'm really happy that I have a TV
show<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.070> shoots<00:01:47.430> here<00:01:47.880> hopefully<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:48.600> get<00:01:48.659> a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
show that shoots here hopefully we get a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.330 
show that shoots here hopefully we get a
second<00:01:48.960> season<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.799> rare<00:01:50.100> thing

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
second season but it's like a rare thing

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.069 
second season but it's like a rare thing
to<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.640> TV<00:01:51.210> show<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.450> shoots<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.840> New<00:01:51.930> York

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
to have TV show that shoots in New York

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.569 
to have TV show that shoots in New York
City<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:52.979> needs<00:01:53.340> to

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
City and I think that that needs to

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.120 
City and I think that that needs to
change<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.899> keep<00:01:55.200> funny<00:01:55.649> people

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
change so that we can keep funny people

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.390 
change so that we can keep funny people
here<00:01:56.460> because<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.969> best<00:01:57.149> city
