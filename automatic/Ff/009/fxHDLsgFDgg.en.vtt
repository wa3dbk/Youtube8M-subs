Magus<00:03:42.770> I'll<00:03:43.280> go<00:03:43.520> ahead<00:03:43.640> and<00:03:43.970> get<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.180> focus

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
Magus I'll go ahead and get the focus

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.800 
Magus I'll go ahead and get the focus
void<00:03:44.900> stone<00:03:45.670> I<00:03:46.670> would<00:03:47.210> definitely<00:03:47.540> get<00:03:47.600> this

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
void stone I would definitely get this

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.230 
void stone I would definitely get this
if<00:03:47.990> you're<00:03:48.290> in<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.890> mid<00:03:49.100> lane<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.340> conquest

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
especially about it gives us early

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.520 
especially about it gives us early
probably<00:03:52.820> your<00:03:53.030> second<00:03:53.420> item<00:03:53.570> if<00:03:53.990> anything

mid<00:03:57.890> laners<00:03:58.160> come<00:03:58.340> me<00:03:58.490> magical<00:03:58.970> most<00:03:59.180> of<00:03:59.240> the

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
mid laners come me magical most of the

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.840 
mid laners come me magical most of the
time<00:03:59.510> and<00:03:59.750> this<00:03:59.840> will<00:03:59.990> help<00:04:00.170> you<00:04:00.320> I<00:04:00.350> guess<00:04:00.710> that

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
time and this will help you I guess that

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.820 
time and this will help you I guess that
another<00:04:01.850> mid<00:04:02.270> laner<00:04:02.420> of<00:04:02.600> course<00:04:02.780> so<00:04:03.560> that's<00:04:03.710> an

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
another mid laner of course so that's an

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.980 
another mid laner of course so that's an
eternity<00:04:04.100> for<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.430> spear<00:04:04.640> Magus<00:04:04.970> next<00:04:05.360> up<00:04:05.480> pie

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.230 
nomicon since he's kind of basic attack
heavy<00:04:09.160> so<00:04:10.160> you<00:04:10.550> would<00:04:10.670> be<00:04:10.790> following

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
heavy so you would be following

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.480 
heavy so you would be following
following<00:04:11.660> up<00:04:12.050> after<00:04:12.710> your<00:04:12.950> buildings<00:04:13.250> with

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
following up after your buildings with

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.000 
following up after your buildings with
basic<00:04:13.790> attacks<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.440> pretty<00:04:15.440> much<00:04:15.530> if<00:04:15.830> you

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
basic attacks and pretty much if you

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.220 
basic attacks and pretty much if you
don't<00:04:16.310> know<00:04:16.370> upon<00:04:16.640> nomicon<00:04:17.030> does<00:04:17.270> is<00:04:17.540> it<00:04:17.960> puts

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
don't know upon nomicon does is it puts

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.720 
don't know upon nomicon does is it puts
a<00:04:18.560> hundred<00:04:18.890> percent<00:04:18.950> of<00:04:19.160> your<00:04:19.220> magical<00:04:19.580> power

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
a hundred percent of your magical power

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.540 
a hundred percent of your magical power
into<00:04:20.030> your<00:04:20.150> next<00:04:20.330> basic<00:04:20.570> attack<00:04:21.440> so<00:04:22.280> I'm<00:04:22.460> gonna

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
into your next basic attack so I'm gonna

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.960 
into your next basic attack so I'm gonna
go<00:04:22.700> ahead<00:04:22.790> and<00:04:22.880> catch<00:04:23.060> my<00:04:23.210> three<00:04:23.480> and<00:04:23.920> then

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
go ahead and catch my three and then

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.110 
go ahead and catch my three and then
five<00:04:25.970> twenty<00:04:26.300> five<00:04:26.330> as<00:04:26.840> a<00:04:26.920> basic<00:04:27.920> attack<00:04:28.120> so

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
five twenty five as a basic attack so

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.910 
five twenty five as a basic attack so
that's<00:04:29.540> the<00:04:29.690> yellow<00:04:29.810> number<00:04:30.140> there<00:04:30.290> so<00:04:30.470> that

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
that's the yellow number there so that

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.550 
that's the yellow number there so that
does<00:04:31.100> quite<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.490> damage<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:32.030> do<00:04:32.900> in<00:04:33.080> violation

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
does quite the damage I do in violation

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.620 
does quite the damage I do in violation
that<00:04:34.460> way<00:04:34.580> when<00:04:34.880> you're<00:04:35.180> when<00:04:35.360> they're<00:04:35.510> in

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
that way when you're when they're in

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.350 
that way when you're when they're in
your<00:04:36.050> three<00:04:36.380> they're<00:04:36.770> slowed<00:04:37.070> by<00:04:37.310> you<00:04:38.240> know

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
your three they're slowed by you know

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.380 
your three they're slowed by you know
twenty<00:04:38.720> five<00:04:38.840> percent<00:04:39.670> for<00:04:40.670> additional<00:04:41.240> two

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
twenty five percent for additional two

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.320 
twenty five percent for additional two
seconds<00:04:41.870> as<00:04:42.020> I<00:04:42.440> pretty<00:04:43.190> sure<00:04:43.280> as<00:04:43.730> long<00:04:43.790> as<00:04:44.000> the

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
seconds as I pretty sure as long as the

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.390 
seconds as I pretty sure as long as the
damage<00:04:44.540> keeps<00:04:44.840> takin<00:04:45.230> on<00:04:45.410> them

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
damage keeps takin on them

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.520 
damage keeps takin on them
the<00:04:46.970> longer<00:04:47.240> they<00:04:47.360> keep<00:04:47.690> slowed<00:04:48.080> so<00:04:48.350> this

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
the longer they keep slowed so this

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.530 
the longer they keep slowed so this
allows<00:04:48.830> you<00:04:49.040> to<00:04:49.220> you<00:04:49.460> know<00:04:49.490> better<00:04:49.880> a<00:04:49.970> mere<00:04:50.300> one

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
allows you to you know better a mere one

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.390 
allows you to you know better a mere one
or<00:04:50.810> basic<00:04:51.080> attacks<00:04:51.380> or<00:04:51.590> whatnot<00:04:51.830> so<00:04:52.100> terms<00:04:52.340> of

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
or basic attacks or whatnot so terms of

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.770 
or basic attacks or whatnot so terms of
isolation<00:04:52.790> works<00:04:52.970> pretty<00:04:53.180> well<00:04:53.300> along<00:04:53.540> them

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
isolation works pretty well along them

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.680 
isolation works pretty well along them
and<00:04:53.960> they're<00:04:54.860> funny<00:04:55.040> relativity<00:04:55.640> for<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.030> you

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
and they're funny relativity for the you

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.250 
and they're funny relativity for the you
know<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:56.960> final<00:04:57.380> cap<00:04:57.620> on<00:04:57.800> your<00:04:57.950> damage<00:04:59.260> so

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
know the final cap on your damage so

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.130 
know the final cap on your damage so
with<00:05:00.530> the<00:05:00.620> red<00:05:00.740> buff<00:05:00.950> we<00:05:01.130> have<00:05:01.450> 624<00:05:02.450> magical

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
with the red buff we have 624 magical

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.470 
with the red buff we have 624 magical
power<00:05:03.400> so<00:05:04.400> real<00:05:04.550> quickly<00:05:04.730> I<00:05:04.910> want<00:05:05.120> to<00:05:05.180> get<00:05:05.240> I

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
power so real quickly I want to get I

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.260 
power so real quickly I want to get I
fill<00:05:05.780> up<00:05:05.810> my<00:05:05.990> high<00:05:06.140> tide<00:05:06.440> and<00:05:07.120> actually<00:05:08.120> before

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
fill up my high tide and actually before

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.090 
fill up my high tide and actually before
that<00:05:08.450> I'm<00:05:08.720> gonna<00:05:08.810> show<00:05:09.320> you<00:05:09.380> the<00:05:09.650> damage<00:05:09.860> from

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
that I'm gonna show you the damage from

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.700 
that I'm gonna show you the damage from
low<00:05:10.310> tide<00:05:10.580> to<00:05:10.790> high<00:05:10.910> tide<00:05:11.180> so<00:05:12.020> we<00:05:12.200> have<00:05:12.350> our<00:05:12.470> one

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
low tide to high tide so we have our one

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.680 
low tide to high tide so we have our one
here<00:05:12.980> let's<00:05:13.130> go<00:05:13.370> ahead<00:05:13.400> and<00:05:13.790> check<00:05:14.390> this<00:05:14.480> out

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
here let's go ahead and check this out

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.020 
here let's go ahead and check this out
so<00:05:15.850> 696<00:05:16.850> on<00:05:17.270> is<00:05:17.990> one<00:05:18.580> so<00:05:19.580> let's<00:05:19.700> go<00:05:19.820> around

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
so 696 on is one so let's go around

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.200 
so 696 on is one so let's go around
basic<00:05:20.360> attacking<00:05:20.840> and<00:05:21.020> let's<00:05:21.170> try<00:05:21.320> to<00:05:21.350> get<00:05:21.620> our

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
basic attacking and let's try to get our

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.150 
basic attacking and let's try to get our
high<00:05:23.210> tide<00:05:23.510> and<00:05:23.810> you<00:05:24.020> can<00:05:24.170> see<00:05:24.290> the<00:05:24.380> difference

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
high tide and you can see the difference

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:31.540 
high tide and you can see the difference
oh<00:05:25.870> that's<00:05:26.870> 20%<00:05:27.530> and

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.369 

okay<00:05:32.550> go<00:05:33.000> ahead<00:05:33.030> kill<00:05:33.360> him<00:05:33.509> and<00:05:34.080> I<00:05:34.139> would<00:05:34.289> have

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:34.379 
okay go ahead kill him and I would have

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:36.649 
okay go ahead kill him and I would have
moved<00:05:34.590> to<00:05:34.770> another<00:05:34.919> group<00:05:35.310> and<00:05:35.550> you'll<00:05:36.300> see

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
moved to another group and you'll see

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:39.379 
moved to another group and you'll see
the<00:05:36.780> damage<00:05:36.990> difference<00:05:37.970> just<00:05:38.970> go<00:05:39.090> back<00:05:39.360> to

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
the damage difference just go back to

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:39.950 
the damage difference just go back to
red

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
red

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.110 
red
okay<00:05:40.710> so<00:05:41.340> 696<00:05:42.090> on<00:05:42.330> our<00:05:42.449> one<00:05:42.690> and<00:05:43.310> now<00:05:44.310> check<00:05:45.000> it

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
okay so 696 on our one and now check it

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.950 
okay so 696 on our one and now check it
out<00:05:46.280> 827<00:05:47.280> that's<00:05:47.460> a<00:05:47.639> that's<00:05:48.030> a<00:05:48.240> significant

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
out 827 that's a that's a significant

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.339 
out 827 that's a that's a significant
difference<00:05:49.440> in<00:05:49.650> damage<00:05:50.150> just<00:05:51.150> with<00:05:51.300> that<00:05:51.349> so

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349 
difference in damage just with that so

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.469 
difference in damage just with that so
that<00:05:52.500> kind<00:05:52.680> of<00:05:52.710> shows<00:05:52.949> you<00:05:53.190> that<00:05:53.400> extra<00:05:53.610> 20%<00:05:53.970> is

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
that kind of shows you that extra 20% is

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.869 
that kind of shows you that extra 20% is
definitely<00:05:55.169> worth<00:05:55.409> it<00:05:55.650> so<00:05:55.949> attack<00:05:56.460> speed<00:05:56.699> on

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:56.879 
definitely worth it so attack speed on

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.920 
definitely worth it so attack speed on
Poseidon<00:05:57.449> works<00:05:57.599> pretty<00:05:57.870> well

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
Poseidon works pretty well

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.570 
Poseidon works pretty well
also<00:06:00.930> your<00:06:01.110> two<00:06:01.289> can<00:06:01.560> be<00:06:01.740> very<00:06:02.190> useful<00:06:02.220> when

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
also your two can be very useful when

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.499 
also your two can be very useful when
building<00:06:02.970> extra<00:06:03.539> tide<00:06:04.500> because<00:06:05.340> it's<00:06:05.970> you<00:06:06.300> do

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:06.509 
building extra tide because it's you do

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:08.779 
building extra tide because it's you do
two<00:06:07.199> basic<00:06:07.530> attacks<00:06:07.800> with<00:06:08.039> each<00:06:08.220> one<00:06:08.460> basic

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789 
two basic attacks with each one basic

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.379 
two basic attacks with each one basic
attack<00:06:09.050> as<00:06:10.050> you<00:06:10.169> saw<00:06:10.349> it<00:06:10.440> there<00:06:10.650> and<00:06:11.180> with<00:06:12.180> pot

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
attack as you saw it there and with pot

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.260 
attack as you saw it there and with pot
nomicon<00:06:12.870> after<00:06:13.500> you<00:06:13.650> hit<00:06:13.860> your<00:06:14.130> to<00:06:14.370> your<00:06:14.909> next

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
nomicon after you hit your to your next

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.580 
nomicon after you hit your to your next
basic<00:06:15.449> attack<00:06:15.630> is<00:06:15.960> gonna<00:06:16.050> hit<00:06:16.259> that<00:06:16.289> target

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
basic attack is gonna hit that target

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.760 
basic attack is gonna hit that target
for<00:06:16.800> three<00:06:16.949> times<00:06:17.900> so<00:06:18.900> I<00:06:18.960> saw<00:06:19.229> there<00:06:19.409> you<00:06:19.500> see

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
for three times so I saw there you see

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.430 
for three times so I saw there you see
the<00:06:19.979> the<00:06:20.340> orange<00:06:20.550> to<00:06:20.880> yellow<00:06:20.909> and<00:06:21.479> then<00:06:21.659> start

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
the the orange to yellow and then start

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.770 
the the orange to yellow and then start
at<00:06:22.500> the<00:06:22.650> orange<00:06:23.069> and<00:06:23.190> the<00:06:23.280> white<00:06:23.310> and<00:06:23.849> then<00:06:24.509> the

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
at the orange and the white and then the

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.990 
at the orange and the white and then the
yellow<00:06:25.169> was<00:06:25.380> a<00:06:25.409> polyatomic<00:06:25.770> on<00:06:26.190> so<00:06:26.550> after<00:06:26.789> you

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
yellow was a polyatomic on so after you

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.610 
yellow was a polyatomic on so after you
hit<00:06:27.120> to<00:06:27.330> your<00:06:27.629> next<00:06:27.840> based<00:06:28.020> attacks<00:06:28.289> been<00:06:28.469> hit

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
hit to your next based attacks been hit

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.010 
hit to your next based attacks been hit
pretty<00:06:28.740> hard

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
pretty hard

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.680 
pretty hard
okay<00:06:31.020> so<00:06:31.490> now<00:06:32.490> we<00:06:32.880> don't<00:06:33.030> have<00:06:33.150> red<00:06:33.479> buff

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
okay so now we don't have red buff

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.200 
okay so now we don't have red buff
anymore<00:06:34.050> so<00:06:34.800> we<00:06:35.009> can<00:06:35.039> see<00:06:35.340> our<00:06:35.610> powers<00:06:36.090> have

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
anymore so we can see our powers have

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.920 
anymore so we can see our powers have
525<00:06:37.050> with<00:06:37.289> that<00:06:37.409> red<00:06:37.560> buff<00:06:37.770> so<00:06:38.750> look<00:06:39.750> at<00:06:39.840> our

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
525 with that red buff so look at our

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.749 
525 with that red buff so look at our
movement<00:06:40.229> speeds<00:06:40.409> that<00:06:40.530> 500<00:06:41.159> let's<00:06:41.340> cap<00:06:41.610> out

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 
movement speeds that 500 let's cap out

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.629 
movement speeds that 500 let's cap out
her<00:06:41.940> and<00:06:42.120> tied<00:06:42.330> it<00:06:43.259> caps<00:06:43.469> out<00:06:43.620> at<00:06:43.680> five<00:06:44.130> ten<00:06:44.430> so

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
her and tied it caps out at five ten so

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.430 
her and tied it caps out at five ten so
that's<00:06:44.759> fairly<00:06:45.270> nice<00:06:45.569> we're<00:06:46.050> just<00:06:46.199> having

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
that's fairly nice we're just having

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.249 
that's fairly nice we're just having
just<00:06:46.770> boots<00:06:47.240> and<00:06:48.240> of<00:06:48.389> course<00:06:48.599> we<00:06:48.719> hit<00:06:48.870> our<00:06:48.900> two

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 
just boots and of course we hit our two

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.860 
just boots and of course we hit our two
and<00:06:49.529> then<00:06:49.860> our<00:06:50.039> boom<00:06:50.190> is<00:06:50.310> speed<00:06:50.659> goes<00:06:51.659> all<00:06:51.840> the

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
and then our boom is speed goes all the

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.559 
and then our boom is speed goes all the
way<00:06:51.960> up<00:06:52.050> to<00:06:52.169> six<00:06:52.620> thirty<00:06:53.009> average<00:06:53.610> or<00:06:53.849> high<00:06:54.300> cap

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:54.569 
way up to six thirty average or high cap

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:56.959 
way up to six thirty average or high cap
I<00:06:54.750> should<00:06:54.930> say<00:06:55.080> so<00:06:55.919> that's<00:06:56.039> that's<00:06:56.669> a<00:06:56.789> fairly

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:56.969 
I should say so that's that's a fairly

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:02.689 
I should say so that's that's a fairly
fast<00:06:57.330> up<00:06:57.630> aside<00:06:57.990> and<00:07:00.979> go<00:07:01.979> ahead<00:07:02.190> show<00:07:02.340> you<00:07:02.430> how

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:02.699 
fast up aside and go ahead show you how

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:06.320 
fast up aside and go ahead show you how
much<00:07:02.819> the<00:07:02.940> OLT<00:07:03.120> dose<00:07:03.330> at<00:07:03.539> max<00:07:03.719> height<00:07:05.150> that<00:07:06.150> was

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
much the OLT dose at max height that was

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.480 
much the OLT dose at max height that was
so<00:07:06.750> many<00:07:06.930> numbers<00:07:07.169> is<00:07:07.289> like<00:07:07.440> 800<00:07:07.800> something

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490 
so many numbers is like 800 something

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.370 
so many numbers is like 800 something
500<00:07:09.029> something<00:07:09.330> knows<00:07:09.509> does<00:07:10.110> a<00:07:10.199> lot<00:07:10.319> of

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 
500 something knows does a lot of

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.589 
500 something knows does a lot of
numbers<00:07:10.710> there<00:07:10.740> so<00:07:11.190> this<00:07:11.940> build<00:07:12.150> works<00:07:12.360> really

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:12.599 
numbers there so this build works really

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.749 
numbers there so this build works really
well<00:07:12.750> Poseidon<00:07:13.259> I<00:07:13.349> really<00:07:13.590> like<00:07:13.770> it<00:07:13.949> for<00:07:14.610> my
