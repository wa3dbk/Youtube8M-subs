00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.839
 For the first time, Judith's keyword here becomes innovative features 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.080
 maybe have 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.369
 what could Ballack be allowed to do 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:14.889
 yes it is him today so that accidentally jostled and Thun percent and 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:15.749
 Sberbank stands 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.880
 but that they can safely through the finder 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.660
 Percent as well at facilities for example 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.970
 but these devices 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.779
 only network opportunities would have these networks possibilities 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:26.530
 for example 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.460
 Young mothers apply for the option through a godfather's box 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.849
 attached to the device 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.200
 Therefore, a sd card so a small memory card from the camera Re 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.930
 Great im and will enter the tv to watch on tv 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.690
 to look at his pictures is a very simple variant that works 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.760
 quite a percent and on the remote I can then access it too 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.530
 Percentage photo show, for example, then the on the Snapple and the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.880
 productive force available 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.070
 one by then, of course, the possibility 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.540
 for the now completely new in this generation 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.400
 the team was Martin Brundle 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.320
 if the SC Kappel content but what is actually this in hall 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.640
 on arriva 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.640
 stored in the hard drive also stored on a computer 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.050
 as well as a way to make that visible on the TV 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.450
 and in fact that is so these devices have 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.450
 Everywhere the data functions more server function is called ours when I am in 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.390
 this samples Media Server feature 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.619
 the keywords about calls 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.100
 then I have the opportunity 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.240
 finally a pcr-test Blatter 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.180
 about an old man whose use the victims were children 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.969
 the Order has to merge Ursula 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:42.159
 how can he then from this the Burda of Beata c 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.890
 Get content to the screen 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.950
 for example 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.509
 To videos or photos percent and percent could then, so to speak year the dream 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.270
 from a central server 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.530
 the visualization of many different locations 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.530
 it is up to us as you see 8 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.380
 the CVP previously found cede opportunities Ing 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.890
 that's always the case 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.809
 so to speak, the most up-to-date Actemra first thought of using this technology 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:12.829
 So it is 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:17.090
 we have one percent over the one we Wiera Box 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:19.090
 Possibility to go Santana 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.999
 namely from that devices on 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:25.579
 it was, so to speak, permanently installed working together with the 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.179
 Google operating system of the TV 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:31.909
 not so close, apparently, temporarily easy to recognize Luca 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.680
 reach the Internet Explorer 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.230
 But since we have the functions that are based on the conditions of the 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.319
 Television are optimized 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.319
 In addition to two advantages it has a very high security on one side 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:46.699
 because by that, ultimately, this connection goes straight to a full one 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:47.849
 percentage point 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.129
 they secured Server of Folk 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.999
 For example, no virus wants to be downloaded to the device 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:57.239
 otherwise he might be able to access the internet freely 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.750
 and for the second, it is what keeps that 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.559
 maybe otherwise 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.779
 Fact setting does not work so well water lily would 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.439
 to optimize so 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.999
 then already selected 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:12.039
 But I also have the opportunity in old-lotte possibility of 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:15.309
 Minority percent of this platform are cooperation partners with whom we 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:17.229
 then work together freely back 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.049
 the supporting program from the Bank Open 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.560
 and a few to 4 percent of the key we Artur is 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.540
 Percentage for killers per cent per cent of Peruvians Jörg 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.310
 PaaS and if I have the thumb and if the device was connected one 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.229
 Surveys internet connection 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:35.819
 then took over connection then we had some here 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.829
 McLaren open more new reality 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.420
 and I, in the end, just like, say, percent more citizens 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.979
 Information can pull the kahlo-see and can directly select 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:50.180
 that's very important I do not have to fix it to the percent e 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.129
 Sending times have now been a news broadcast thus can 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.830
 Hans Albers was me, I do that 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.230
 around and because I now need this news about me now and immediately 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.269
 can also 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.540
 Another innovation we have is our turn 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.450
 Do preview 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.169
 that works the possibility for example 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.060
 I also shot videos myself 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.959
 want to watch the cards because I know people are watching 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.809
 accordingly would be satisfied 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:16.920
 I also have the option for those 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.120
 Platform 4 percent could clearly adjust their photos with Gekas r 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.439
 access 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:24.060
 for Voss but last year 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.370
 to the annoyance of Leon probably if there are photos 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.490
 the percentage of the friendship in the view would like to still can 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:30.020
 of the world 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.819
 Who is on the way can then finally percent on the word I 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:35.740
 tell them 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.560
 on the personal parts of this summer little contemplative for me 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.060
 use 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.430
 then access and order 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.699
 Bechtolf break this 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.699
 this platform only 8 percent restricted 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.030
 In any case, we in Recife just like Lucio 2 5 percent new ways 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:56.780
 Gone at the club was received 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.210
 we can now put all their samples to the test and chose that 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.650
 were 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.650
 searches accordingly 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.400
 right now and would kill me now 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.120
 Anna is a possibility 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.979
 over one percent 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.089
 Vintage virtual keyboard the end of their work to go with it you can 

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.690
 now 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.430
 on the two for example only 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.169
 be missing 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.499
 Mombauer down here 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:22.349
 Nexus percent 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.610
 just my stomach chest 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.610
 Kurt Krömer 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.379
 Mohr already 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:36.379
 and will 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:42.119
 Of course you also have that I'm not that big and faster 

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:43.589
 as a writer 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:45.340
 sometimes comes to draw 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.120
 and 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.580
 and then he became Group 4 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.890
 even percent will be able to move percent for two percent 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.669
 three weeks to choose and that I then but also bad, for example 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:05:59.270
 glocks 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.090
 who as the young women 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.869
 Wine enjoyment accordingly 

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:05.869
 loaded and I can on to this content 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.460
 which I exactly, yes 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.909
 that is also recommended at Heller pause 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:14.950
 the now at 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.460
 YouTube, for example, are discontinued because here 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.000
 Often the resolution used is very low 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.400
 partly really webcam 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.350
 Have quality 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.630
 Aldrin treated herself so homann percent her husband has hired privately 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.969
 and these qualities 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:34.379
 which would then satisfy the Roche company with window percent very good for 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:38.460
 Anschober are less beautiful it is then if you are wrong 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.460
 Percent and Renault to pay 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:46.650
 among many 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.360
 In any case, yes so can at this point that time
