this down here I'm sorry this up here

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.230 
this down here I'm sorry this up here
and<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.829> down<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:05.189> are<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.369> same<00:02:05.579> size<00:02:05.880> so

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
and this down here are the same size so

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389 
and this down here are the same size so
what<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.320> have<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.560> do<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.039> got<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.280> get<00:02:08.369> a

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
what you have to do is you got to get a

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.330 
what you have to do is you got to get a
spacer<00:02:08.819> made<00:02:09.000> up<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.390> go<00:02:09.539> behind

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
spacer made up to go behind

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.530 
spacer made up to go behind
handle<00:02:10.640> grip<00:02:12.310> now<00:02:13.310> I've<00:02:13.550> lowered<00:02:13.790> I've

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
handle grip now I've lowered I've

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.240 
handle grip now I've lowered I've
lowered<00:02:14.780> this<00:02:15.080> an<00:02:15.379> inch<00:02:17.230> an<00:02:18.230> inch<00:02:18.410> total<00:02:18.739> is

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
lowered this an inch an inch total is

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.309 
lowered this an inch an inch total is
what<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.459> lowered<00:02:19.760> this<00:02:19.849> bike<00:02:20.120> now<00:02:20.420> I've<00:02:20.989> done

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
what I lowered this bike now I've done

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.199 
what I lowered this bike now I've done
that<00:02:21.379> it<00:02:21.709> put<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.040> handle<00:02:22.340> grips<00:02:22.550> down<00:02:22.849> into

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
that it put the handle grips down into

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.440 
that it put the handle grips down into
the<00:02:24.019> smaller<00:02:24.319> diameter<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.430> what<00:02:26.090> I<00:02:26.120> ended<00:02:26.330> up

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
the smaller diameter so what I ended up

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.630 
the smaller diameter so what I ended up
doing<00:02:26.930> was<00:02:27.140> having<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.470> make<00:02:27.590> a<00:02:27.620> shim<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.190> put

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
doing was having to make a shim and put

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.059 
doing was having to make a shim and put
it<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:28.760> behind<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:30.230> was<00:02:30.349> a<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.860> shim

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
it in behind that and it was a the shim

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.570 
it in behind that and it was a the shim
I<00:02:31.160> used<00:02:31.370> was<00:02:31.670> 1/32<00:02:32.540> inch<00:02:32.629> piece<00:02:33.080> of<00:02:33.110> ten<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:34.549> I

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
I used was 1/32 inch piece of ten and I

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.640 
I used was 1/32 inch piece of ten and I
took<00:02:34.670> him<00:02:34.940> cut<00:02:35.120> out<00:02:35.239> a<00:02:35.269> couple<00:02:35.390> strips<00:02:35.989> but<00:02:36.140> you

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
took him cut out a couple strips but you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.770 
took him cut out a couple strips but you
know<00:02:36.739> the<00:02:37.190> width<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.519> that<00:02:37.670> right<00:02:37.849> there<00:02:37.879> cut

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
know the width of that right there cut

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.449 
know the width of that right there cut
them<00:02:38.930> out<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:39.260> then<00:02:39.799> I<00:02:39.830> slid<00:02:40.220> them<00:02:40.340> up

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
them out and then I slid them up

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.710 
them out and then I slid them up
underneath<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.940> there<00:02:41.030> whenever<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:41.420> tighten

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
underneath of there whenever I tighten

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.350 
underneath of there whenever I tighten

down<00:03:28.970> inside<00:03:29.420> your<00:03:29.599> triple<00:03:29.900> tree<00:03:30.109> and<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.920> get

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
down inside your triple tree and you get

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.520 
down inside your triple tree and you get
it<00:03:31.190> lowers<00:03:31.519> to<00:03:31.670> wherever<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.260> need<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.470> be

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
it lowers to wherever you need it to be

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.110 
it lowers to wherever you need it to be
like<00:03:33.709> I<00:03:33.799> said<00:03:33.859> all<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.220> lowered<00:03:34.549> mine<00:03:34.700> an<00:03:34.880> inch

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
like I said all I lowered mine an inch

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.660 
like I said all I lowered mine an inch
go<00:03:35.599> lower<00:03:35.900> than<00:03:35.989> that<00:03:36.290> I<00:03:36.620> don't<00:03:37.040> know<00:03:37.340> really

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
go lower than that I don't know really

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.909 
go lower than that I don't know really
how<00:03:37.819> it's<00:03:37.940> going<00:03:38.090> to<00:03:38.180> affect<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.769> some<00:03:39.769> once

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
how it's going to affect you some once

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.909 
how it's going to affect you some once
you<00:03:39.980> get<00:03:40.099> all<00:03:40.190> that<00:03:40.310> together<00:03:41.799> there's<00:03:42.799> an

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
you get all that together there's an

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.120 
you get all that together there's an
alignment<00:03:43.130> pin<00:03:44.230> in<00:03:45.230> between<00:03:45.560> here<00:03:45.799> and<00:03:45.829> here

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
alignment pin in between here and here

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.129 
alignment pin in between here and here
that<00:03:46.340> you<00:03:46.819> need<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.180> really<00:03:47.450> pay<00:03:47.660> attention<00:03:48.049> to

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
that you need to really pay attention to

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.080 
that you need to really pay attention to
where<00:03:48.290> it's<00:03:48.410> at<00:03:48.560> so<00:03:48.769> your<00:03:49.489> handle<00:03:49.760> grips<00:03:49.940> and

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
where it's at so your handle grips and

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.270 
where it's at so your handle grips and
everything<00:03:50.359> are<00:03:50.480> in<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.630> same<00:03:50.810> spot<00:03:51.139> as<00:03:52.130> long

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
everything are in the same spot as long

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.949 
everything are in the same spot as long
as<00:03:52.400> you<00:03:52.459> slide<00:03:52.700> it<00:03:52.880> all<00:03:53.000> back<00:03:53.209> together<00:03:53.359> you

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
as you slide it all back together you

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.530 
as you slide it all back together you
tighten<00:03:54.290> everything<00:03:54.410> up<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:55.940> I<00:03:56.269> actually

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
tighten everything up and I actually
