00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
we have a 55 gallon bucket that is

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.339 
we have a 55 gallon bucket that is
attached<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.580> another<00:00:26.939> 55<00:00:27.689> gallon<00:00:28.019> bucket

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
attached to another 55 gallon bucket

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.630 
attached to another 55 gallon bucket
with<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> hose<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:30.230> we<00:00:31.230> have<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.949> submersible

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
with a hose and we have a submersible

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.190 
with a hose and we have a submersible
pump<00:00:33.469> inside<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.489> bucket<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.750> rated<00:00:37.170> for

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
pump inside of the bucket it's rated for

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.080 
pump inside of the bucket it's rated for
a<00:00:37.380> hundred<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.800> sixty<00:00:38.129> gallons<00:00:38.489> an<00:00:38.610> hour<00:00:38.730> but

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
a hundred and sixty gallons an hour but

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.970 
a hundred and sixty gallons an hour but
of<00:00:39.239> course<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.629> doesn't<00:00:39.780> go<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.739> fast

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
of course it doesn't go that fast

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.459 
of course it doesn't go that fast
because<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:42.120> uphill<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:43.020> we're<00:00:43.350> not

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
because it's going uphill so we're not

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.840 
because it's going uphill so we're not
really<00:00:43.649> sure<00:00:43.739> how<00:00:44.129> much<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.489> actually

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
really sure how much it's actually

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.330 
really sure how much it's actually
something<00:00:45.090> but<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.350> rated<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.039> hundred

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
something but it's rated for a hundred

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.529 
something but it's rated for a hundred
sixty<00:00:47.520> gallons<00:00:48.059> an<00:00:48.180> hour<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.930> we<00:00:49.469> have<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
sixty gallons an hour and we have a

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.720 
sixty gallons an hour and we have a
bubbler<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.170> we're<00:00:52.980> gonna<00:00:53.100> get<00:00:53.280> another<00:00:53.399> one

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
bubbler and we're gonna get another one

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.970 
bubbler and we're gonna get another one
of<00:00:53.850> those<00:00:54.000> for<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.719> other<00:00:55.260> bucket<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.829> want

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
of those for the other bucket you want

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.979 
of those for the other bucket you want
to<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.250> much<00:00:56.460> air<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:57.149> as<00:00:57.360> possible

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
to have as much air going as possible

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.209 
to have as much air going as possible
then<00:00:58.620> we've<00:00:58.949> got<00:00:59.219> three<00:01:00.170> 12-foot<00:01:01.170> pieces<00:01:01.739> of

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
then we've got three 12-foot pieces of

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.649 
then we've got three 12-foot pieces of
four<00:01:02.850> inch<00:01:03.030> PVC<00:01:03.329> pipe<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.640> those<00:01:05.640> go<00:01:05.909> all<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
four inch PVC pipe and those go all the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.330 
four inch PVC pipe and those go all the
way<00:01:06.689> down<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.680> they're<00:01:07.799> connected<00:01:07.950> on

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
way down and then they're connected on

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.770 
way down and then they're connected on
that<00:01:08.520> end<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.270> they're<00:01:09.420> connected

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
that end and then they're connected

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.530 
that end and then they're connected
again<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.229> end<00:01:10.470> with<00:01:11.070> two<00:01:11.490> ninety<00:01:12.210> degree

we<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.540> drilled<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.320> two<00:01:22.560> inch<00:01:22.740> hole<00:01:23.009> which

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
we have drilled a two inch hole which

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.940 
we have drilled a two inch hole which
we've<00:01:23.670> put<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.909> net<00:01:24.240> basket<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.740> net

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
we've put a net basket in the net

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.969 
we've put a net basket in the net
baskets<00:01:26.520> are<00:01:27.200> relatively<00:01:28.200> cheap<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.650> got<00:01:28.799> them

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
baskets are relatively cheap we got them

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.649 
baskets are relatively cheap we got them
at<00:01:29.130> Virginia<00:01:29.430> hydroponics<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> quarter<00:01:30.630> of

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
at Virginia hydroponics for a quarter of

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.109 
at Virginia hydroponics for a quarter of
a<00:01:30.900> piece<00:01:31.140> but<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:32.070> found<00:01:32.310> them<00:01:32.549> online<00:01:32.700> for

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
a piece but we found them online for

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.630 
a piece but we found them online for
cheaper<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.869> we've<00:01:34.650> ordered<00:01:35.040> some<00:01:35.250> more<00:01:35.280> that

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
cheaper so we've ordered some more that

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.190 
cheaper so we've ordered some more that
we're<00:01:35.759> gonna<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> third<00:01:36.390> pipe<00:01:36.659> for<00:01:37.049> we've

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
we're gonna do the third pipe for we've

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200 
we're gonna do the third pipe for we've
just<00:01:37.470> added<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.189> third<00:01:38.369> pipe<00:01:38.640> recently

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
just added the third pipe recently

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.539 
just added the third pipe recently
because<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.689> don't<00:01:39.869> want<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.560> your

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
because you don't want to have your

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.870 
because you don't want to have your
water<00:01:42.170> being<00:01:43.170> pumped<00:01:43.500> up<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.040> dumped<00:01:44.640> back

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
water being pumped up and dumped back

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.630 
water being pumped up and dumped back
into<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> same<00:01:45.509> bucket<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.020> want<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.380> it

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
into the same bucket you want to have it

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.969 
into the same bucket you want to have it
dumped<00:01:47.640> into<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.000> other<00:01:48.149> end<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.540> your<00:01:48.689> line

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
dumped into the other end of your line

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.039 
dumped into the other end of your line
because<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.369> way<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:51.119> water<00:01:51.270> will<00:01:51.540> actually

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
because that way the water will actually

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.810 
because that way the water will actually
cycle<00:01:52.500> all<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.740> way<00:01:52.890> around<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.399> all<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
cycle all the way around and all of the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.370 
cycle all the way around and all of the
water<00:01:54.000> will<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.329> good<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.750> won't<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:55.079> just

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
water will be good you won't have just

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.170 
water will be good you won't have just
one<00:01:55.530> stagnant<00:01:56.159> bucket<00:01:56.520> sitting<00:01:56.880> down<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
one stagnant bucket sitting down at the

one stagnant bucket sitting down at the
other<00:01:57.390> end<00:01:57.860> for<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> growing<00:01:59.759> medium<00:02:00.090> we've

other end for a growing medium we've

other end for a growing medium we've
used<00:02:01.409> grodan<00:02:02.399> rockwool<00:02:03.060> which<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.439> these

if<00:02:07.440> I<00:02:07.560> could<00:02:07.710> take<00:02:07.830> one<00:02:07.890> out<00:02:09.649> this<00:02:10.649> is

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
if I could take one out this is

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.050 
if I could take one out this is
apparently<00:02:12.140> someone<00:02:13.140> told<00:02:13.320> me<00:02:13.500> it's<00:02:13.710> a

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
apparently someone told me it's a

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.700 
apparently someone told me it's a
volcanic<00:02:15.060> rock<00:02:15.360> that's<00:02:15.870> been<00:02:15.960> heated<00:02:16.290> up<00:02:16.500> and

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
volcanic rock that's been heated up and

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.190 
volcanic rock that's been heated up and
spun<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.190> cotton<00:02:17.550> candy<00:02:17.580> they're<00:02:18.510> pretty

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
spun like cotton candy they're pretty

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.440 
spun like cotton candy they're pretty
easy<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.590> use<00:02:19.860> if<00:02:20.400> they've<00:02:20.700> all<00:02:20.850> got<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.030> hole<00:02:21.270> in

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
easy to use if they've all got a hole in

easy to use if they've all got a hole in
the<00:02:21.540> top<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.930> just<00:02:22.050> drop<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> seed<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:22.860> and

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
the top you just drop the seed in and

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.640 
the top you just drop the seed in and
then<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.910> put<00:02:24.090> those<00:02:24.240> in<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.570> baskets<00:02:25.110> we

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
then you put those in the baskets we

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.110 
then you put those in the baskets we
don't<00:02:25.860> put<00:02:26.040> them<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.400> baskets<00:02:26.850> in<00:02:27.000> our

don't put them in the baskets in our

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.970 
don't put them in the baskets in our
system<00:02:27.540> until<00:02:27.810> they<00:02:27.960> have<00:02:28.140> some<00:02:28.380> sort<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.710> root

them are doing better than others

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.199 
them are doing better than others
because<00:02:40.770> some<00:02:40.950> sprouted<00:02:41.459> sooner<00:02:41.880> than<00:02:42.120> others

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
these for these lettuce right here we've

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.370 
these for these lettuce right here we've
did<00:02:54.060> those<00:02:54.270> in<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.660> jiffy<00:02:54.959> peat<00:02:55.200> pellets

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
did those in the jiffy peat pellets

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.900 
did those in the jiffy peat pellets
they've<00:02:55.830> been<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.130> here<00:02:56.160> for<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.550> little<00:02:56.760> while

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
they've been in here for a little while

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.760 
they've been in here for a little while
now<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.870> peat<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.290> everything<00:02:58.650> is

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
now and the peat and everything is

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.890 
now and the peat and everything is
staying<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.400> pellets<00:02:59.790> so<00:02:59.910> it's<00:03:00.690> not

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
staying in the pellets so it's not

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.500 
staying in the pellets so it's not
making<00:03:01.110> our<00:03:01.350> system<00:03:01.680> any<00:03:01.860> dirtier<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.510> it

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
making our system any dirtier and it

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.180 
making our system any dirtier and it
seems<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.959> be<00:03:04.050> working<00:03:04.200> out<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:04.709> we<00:03:04.830> might<00:03:04.980> try

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
seems to be working out so we might try

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.550 
seems to be working out so we might try
to<00:03:05.250> just<00:03:05.520> use<00:03:05.580> them<00:03:08.120> later<00:03:09.120> later<00:03:10.110> on<00:03:10.320> in<00:03:10.470> the

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
to just use them later later on in the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.400 
to just use them later later on in the
season<00:03:10.800> or<00:03:11.160> next<00:03:11.459> year<00:03:12.019> some<00:03:13.019> of<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.260> might

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
season or next year some of you might

season or next year some of you might
remember<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:15.170> was<00:03:16.170> impatient<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:17.070> I<00:03:17.580> took<00:03:17.640> this

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
remember I was impatient and I took this

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.610 
remember I was impatient and I took this
romaine<00:03:19.080> which<00:03:19.769> is<00:03:20.100> beautiful<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.620> had

romaine which is beautiful and had
washed<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.610> dirt<00:03:23.850> off<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:24.540> was<00:03:24.750> a

washed the dirt off of it this was a
bunch<00:03:25.799> of<00:03:25.950> romaine<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.519> was<00:03:26.610> growing<00:03:26.820> in

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
bunch of romaine that was growing in

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.720 
bunch of romaine that was growing in
dirt<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:27.650> we<00:03:28.650> had<00:03:28.769> washed<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.280> dirt<00:03:29.459> off<00:03:29.670> of

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
dirt and we had washed the dirt off of

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.550 
dirt and we had washed the dirt off of
the<00:03:30.980> roots<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.750> cut<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.780> piece<00:03:34.019> of<00:03:34.170> Rockville

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
the roots and cut a piece of Rockville

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.590 
the roots and cut a piece of Rockville
in<00:03:34.680> half<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.250> stuck<00:03:35.910> it<00:03:36.060> on<00:03:36.209> there<00:03:36.420> with

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
in half and stuck it on there with

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.620 
in half and stuck it on there with
toothpicks<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:38.700> didn't<00:03:39.090> know<00:03:39.180> whether<00:03:39.480> or

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
toothpicks and I didn't know whether or

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.690 
toothpicks and I didn't know whether or
not<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.840> was<00:03:39.900> gonna<00:03:40.049> work<00:03:40.260> or<00:03:40.440> not<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:40.950> we<00:03:41.580> were

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
not it was gonna work or not so we were

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.590 
not it was gonna work or not so we were
just<00:03:41.910> trying<00:03:42.630> it<00:03:42.870> out<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:44.030> when<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.269> had<00:03:45.390> first

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
just trying it out and when I had first

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.180 
just trying it out and when I had first
put<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:45.989> in<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.350> had<00:03:46.500> roots<00:03:46.739> that<00:03:46.950> looked<00:03:47.100> like

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
put it in it had roots that looked like

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.610 
put it in it had roots that looked like
that<00:03:47.459> because<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.540> was<00:03:48.660> I<00:03:48.930> couldn't<00:03:49.230> pull<00:03:49.470> the

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
that because it was I couldn't pull the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.650 
that because it was I couldn't pull the
roots<00:03:49.830> through<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.310> basket<00:03:50.489> properly<00:03:51.330> and

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
roots through the basket properly and

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.449 
roots through the basket properly and
they<00:03:52.170> were<00:03:52.230> all<00:03:52.410> crammed<00:03:52.739> in<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:52.980> rockwool

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
they were all crammed in the rockwool

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.030 
they were all crammed in the rockwool
and<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.750> was<00:03:54.870> about<00:03:55.080> as<00:03:55.380> much<00:03:55.590> as<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:55.860> could

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
and so that was about as much as I could

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.190 
and so that was about as much as I could
pull<00:03:56.250> through<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:56.870> now<00:03:58.640> it's<00:03:59.640> got<00:03:59.940> this

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
pull through and now it's got this

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.590 
pull through and now it's got this
tremendous<00:04:01.200> root<00:04:01.440> system<00:04:01.950> which<00:04:02.390> shows<00:04:03.390> me

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
tremendous root system which shows me

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.090 
tremendous root system which shows me
that<00:04:03.720> it's<00:04:03.900> working<00:04:04.110> pretty<00:04:04.470> well<00:04:04.560> if<00:04:04.980> you

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
that it's working pretty well if you

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.120 
that it's working pretty well if you
look<00:04:05.340> closely<00:04:06.269> you<00:04:07.200> can<00:04:07.230> see<00:04:07.380> that<00:04:07.830> each<00:04:08.100> of

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
look closely you can see that each of

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.000 
look closely you can see that each of
the<00:04:08.519> roots<00:04:09.420> that<00:04:09.690> come<00:04:09.870> out<00:04:10.080> have<00:04:10.440> more<00:04:10.769> roots

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
the roots that come out have more roots

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.340 
the roots that come out have more roots
shooting<00:04:11.519> off<00:04:11.640> of<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.880> ends<00:04:12.330> and<00:04:12.480> that<00:04:13.170> one's

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
shooting off of the ends and that one's

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.770 
shooting off of the ends and that one's
just<00:04:13.590> doing<00:04:13.860> really<00:04:14.070> really<00:04:14.220> well

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
just doing really really well

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.500 
just doing really really well
and<00:04:16.739> you<00:04:17.070> can<00:04:17.190> move<00:04:17.370> them<00:04:17.549> around<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:18.030> stuff<00:04:18.090> I

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
and you can move them around and stuff I

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.930 
and you can move them around and stuff I
mean<00:04:18.720> it's<00:04:19.260> not<00:04:19.470> like<00:04:19.530> growing<00:04:20.160> in<00:04:20.400> dirt<00:04:20.640> where

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
mean it's not like growing in dirt where

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.640 
mean it's not like growing in dirt where
once<00:04:21.269> it's<00:04:21.450> there<00:04:21.540> you<00:04:22.019> have<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.230> leave<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.560> in

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
once it's there you have to leave it in

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.220 
once it's there you have to leave it in
that<00:04:22.740> spot<00:04:22.950> but<00:04:23.910> when<00:04:24.480> people<00:04:24.780> come<00:04:24.930> over<00:04:25.050> and

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
that spot but when people come over and

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.650 
that spot but when people come over and
look<00:04:25.470> we<00:04:25.680> let<00:04:25.860> them<00:04:26.010> actually<00:04:26.790> pick<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.480> outer

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
look we let them actually pick the outer

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.100 
look we let them actually pick the outer
leaves<00:04:27.990> off<00:04:28.440> of<00:04:28.470> this<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.160> eat<00:04:29.970> them<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.480> of

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
leaves off of this and eat them and of

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.280 
leaves off of this and eat them and of
course<00:04:31.140> just<00:04:31.650> like<00:04:32.030> perpetual<00:04:33.030> harvest<00:04:33.780> in<00:04:33.990> a

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
course just like perpetual harvest in a

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.260 
course just like perpetual harvest in a
dirt<00:04:34.560> garden<00:04:35.010> more<00:04:35.370> just<00:04:35.640> keeps<00:04:35.820> growing<00:04:36.000> out

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
dirt garden more just keeps growing out

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.140 
dirt garden more just keeps growing out
of<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.450> center<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:36.900> it<00:04:36.990> just<00:04:37.590> keeps<00:04:37.800> growing

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
of the center and it just keeps growing

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.140 
of the center and it just keeps growing
this<00:04:39.150> is<00:04:39.300> an<00:04:39.420> onion<00:04:39.780> that<00:04:40.560> we<00:04:40.740> had<00:04:41.010> chucked<00:04:41.970> out

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
this is an onion that we had chucked out

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.410 
this is an onion that we had chucked out
because<00:04:42.770> it<00:04:43.770> had<00:04:43.890> gotten<00:04:44.040> soft<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.850> when<00:04:45.390> I

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
because it had gotten soft and when I

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.450 
because it had gotten soft and when I
went<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:45.840> do<00:04:46.080> my<00:04:46.110> garden<00:04:46.620> it<00:04:46.800> had<00:04:46.920> taken<00:04:47.130> root

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
went to do my garden it had taken root

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.580 
went to do my garden it had taken root
in<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.730> garden<00:04:48.120> so<00:04:48.720> I<00:04:48.750> pulled<00:04:49.140> it<00:04:49.260> out<00:04:49.350> and

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
in the garden so I pulled it out and

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.920 
in the garden so I pulled it out and
stuck<00:04:49.830> it<00:04:49.950> in<00:04:49.980> here<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:51.450> seems<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.840> be

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
stuck it in here and it seems to be

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.659 
stuck it in here and it seems to be
doing<00:04:52.080> pretty<00:04:52.230> good<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.800> whole<00:04:52.950> onion<00:04:53.490> is

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
doing pretty good the whole onion is

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.000 
doing pretty good the whole onion is
firmed<00:04:54.120> up<00:04:54.240> nicely<00:04:54.870> again<00:04:55.350> I<00:04:55.590> don't<00:04:55.740> know<00:04:55.860> what

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
firmed up nicely again I don't know what

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.590 
firmed up nicely again I don't know what
we're<00:04:56.130> gonna<00:04:56.190> do<00:04:56.430> with<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.610> but<00:04:56.940> we're<00:04:57.570> just

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
we're gonna do with it but we're just

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.060 
we're gonna do with it but we're just
basically<00:04:58.080> playing<00:04:58.290> around<00:04:58.680> with<00:04:58.860> stuff

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
basically playing around with stuff

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.620 
basically playing around with stuff
right<00:04:59.280> now<00:04:59.340> just<00:04:59.760> to<00:04:59.880> see<00:05:00.060> what<00:05:00.240> works<00:05:00.419> and

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
right now just to see what works and

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.450 
right now just to see what works and
what<00:05:00.750> does<00:05:00.960> it<00:05:00.990> we've<00:05:01.740> got<00:05:01.860> a<00:05:01.890> couple<00:05:02.130> of<00:05:02.310> green

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
what does it we've got a couple of green

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.460 
what does it we've got a couple of green
peppers<00:05:02.910> over<00:05:03.060> here<00:05:03.419> that<00:05:03.750> seem<00:05:03.960> to<00:05:04.080> be<00:05:04.110> doing

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
peppers over here that seem to be doing

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.840 
peppers over here that seem to be doing
well<00:05:04.500> those<00:05:04.919> are<00:05:05.100> also<00:05:05.250> in<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.669> peat<00:05:05.880> pot<00:05:06.110> but

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
well those are also in the peat pot but

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.480 
well those are also in the peat pot but
it<00:05:08.850> all<00:05:09.000> seems<00:05:09.300> to<00:05:09.419> be<00:05:09.480> working<00:05:09.540> pretty<00:05:10.050> well

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
it all seems to be working pretty well

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.920 
it all seems to be working pretty well
one<00:05:11.490> of<00:05:11.610> the<00:05:11.700> things<00:05:11.760> that<00:05:12.330> you<00:05:12.630> need<00:05:12.780> to

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
one of the things that you need to

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.750 
one of the things that you need to
remember<00:05:13.169> is<00:05:13.530> that<00:05:13.890> if<00:05:14.040> you<00:05:14.190> do<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.430> 12-foot

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
remember is that if you do the 12-foot

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.790 
remember is that if you do the 12-foot
sections<00:05:15.390> you<00:05:15.900> didn't<00:05:16.110> want<00:05:16.260> something<00:05:16.530> in

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
sections you didn't want something in

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.180 
sections you didn't want something in
the<00:05:16.890> center<00:05:17.370> to<00:05:18.210> stabilize<00:05:19.110> your<00:05:19.740> system

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
the center to stabilize your system

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.920 
the center to stabilize your system
because<00:05:20.520> if<00:05:20.640> you<00:05:20.729> don't<00:05:20.970> the<00:05:21.270> weight<00:05:21.540> from<00:05:21.810> the

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
because if you don't the weight from the

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.170 
because if you don't the weight from the
water<00:05:22.140> makes<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.590> pipe<00:05:22.860> sag<00:05:23.220> and<00:05:23.610> then<00:05:24.060> the

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
water makes the pipe sag and then the

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.909 
water makes the pipe sag and then the
water<00:05:24.360> pours<00:05:24.780> out<00:05:25.080> of<00:05:25.350> the<00:05:25.470> ones<00:05:25.680> in<00:05:25.830> the

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
water pours out of the ones in the

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.880 
water pours out of the ones in the
middle<00:05:26.330> another<00:05:27.330> thing<00:05:27.600> that<00:05:27.750> we<00:05:27.840> did<00:05:28.020> was<00:05:28.470> on

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
middle another thing that we did was on

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.219 
middle another thing that we did was on
the<00:05:29.040> ends<00:05:29.669> we<00:05:30.120> cut<00:05:30.330> a<00:05:30.360> two-liter<00:05:30.780> bottle<00:05:31.140> in

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
the ends we cut a two-liter bottle in

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.680 
the ends we cut a two-liter bottle in
half<00:05:31.440> and<00:05:32.220> we<00:05:32.370> put<00:05:32.640> half<00:05:33.090> of<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.300> two<00:05:33.479> of<00:05:33.600> the

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
half and we put half of the two of the

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.600 
half and we put half of the two of the
bottle<00:05:34.020> on<00:05:34.110> this<00:05:34.320> side<00:05:34.530> to<00:05:34.800> plug<00:05:34.979> up<00:05:35.100> this<00:05:35.310> end

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
bottle on this side to plug up this end

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.730 
bottle on this side to plug up this end
and<00:05:35.850> then<00:05:36.390> the<00:05:36.479> other<00:05:36.630> half<00:05:36.960> is<00:05:37.110> on<00:05:37.290> this<00:05:37.500> side

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
and then the other half is on this side

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.820 
and then the other half is on this side
to<00:05:38.130> plug<00:05:38.340> up<00:05:38.460> this<00:05:38.669> end<00:05:38.970> and<00:05:39.600> you<00:05:40.320> want<00:05:40.530> to<00:05:40.650> have

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
to plug up this end and you want to have

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:53.360 
to plug up this end and you want to have
the<00:05:41.160> same<00:05:41.370> amount<00:05:41.669> of<00:05:41.729> water<00:05:41.940> coming<00:05:42.419> out<00:05:52.370> long

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
the same amount of water coming out long

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.730 
the same amount of water coming out long
enough<00:05:53.550> to<00:05:54.030> where<00:05:54.240> they're<00:05:54.690> reaching<00:05:55.620> the

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
enough to where they're reaching the

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
seems to be the easiest way that we

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.080 
seems to be the easiest way that we

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
could figure out to do this and the

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.690 
could figure out to do this and the

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700 
cheapest way now that we know that it's

going<00:06:45.880> to<00:06:46.060> work<00:06:46.270> we're<00:06:47.170> probably<00:06:47.410> going<00:06:47.650> to<00:06:47.710> be

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
going to work we're probably going to be

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.200 
going to work we're probably going to be
putting<00:06:48.010> some<00:06:48.100> more<00:06:48.310> money<00:06:48.520> into<00:06:48.730> it<00:06:49.030> by

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.210 
putting some more money into it by

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.170 
putting some more money into it by

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
adding a grow bed on this end you want

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.640 
adding a grow bed on this end you want

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
to have a grow bed to help filter out

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.260 
to have a grow bed to help filter out
some<00:06:54.040> of<00:06:54.160> the<00:06:54.250> solid<00:06:54.610> waste<00:06:54.760> from<00:06:55.090> the<00:06:55.150> fish

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
some of the solid waste from the fish

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.090 
some of the solid waste from the fish
and<00:06:55.780> then<00:06:56.440> if<00:06:56.770> you<00:06:58.200> have<00:06:59.200> it<00:06:59.380> so<00:06:59.560> that<00:06:59.590> it's<00:06:59.890> not

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:00.100 
and then if you have it so that it's not

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.190 
and then if you have it so that it's not

completely filling with water you can

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.990 
completely filling with water you can
put<00:07:02.440> red<00:07:02.740> wigglers<00:07:03.130> in<00:07:03.370> there<00:07:03.550> and<00:07:03.820> they'll

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 
put red wigglers in there and they'll

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.420 
put red wigglers in there and they'll
eat<00:07:04.240> the<00:07:04.420> solid<00:07:04.810> waste<00:07:04.990> and<00:07:05.470> give<00:07:06.040> off<00:07:06.220> their

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.430 
eat the solid waste and give off their

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.600 
eat the solid waste and give off their
own<00:07:06.610> solid<00:07:07.120> waste<00:07:07.330> that's<00:07:07.630> like<00:07:08.560> pure<00:07:08.980> compost

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:26.920 
and there's a good possibility this is
