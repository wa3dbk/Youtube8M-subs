00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.950 
so Terence Crawford is known to be
somewhat<00:04:58.800> of<00:04:59.070> you<00:05:00.000> can<00:05:00.180> say<00:05:00.389> a<00:05:00.570> slow

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
somewhat of you can say a slow

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.980 
somewhat of you can say a slow
methodical<00:05:01.820> starter<00:05:02.820> he's<00:05:03.330> figuring<00:05:03.780> you<00:05:03.960> out

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.200 
so even though he lost the first two out
of<00:05:06.690> three<00:05:06.960> rounds<00:05:07.380> in<00:05:07.440> my<00:05:07.620> opinion<00:05:07.979> still<00:05:08.910> all
