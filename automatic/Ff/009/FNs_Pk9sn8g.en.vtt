good at speed I think they're around 20
for<00:01:33.040> each<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.610> they're<00:01:33.820> very<00:01:34.240> easy<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.659> catch

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960

i'm just going to do these until i get
kind<00:02:44.800> of<00:02:44.890> bored<00:02:45.160> so<00:02:45.670> basically<00:02:46.030> what<00:02:46.210> I've

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
kind of bored so basically what I've

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.450 
kind of bored so basically what I've
been<00:02:46.420> doing<00:02:46.600> for<00:02:46.750> my<00:02:46.960> skills<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:48.100> get<00:02:48.190> bored

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460

doing<00:02:48.550> something<00:02:49.360> I<00:02:49.540> move<00:02:49.720> on<00:02:49.810> something<00:02:50.200> else

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
doing something I move on something else

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.190 
doing something I move on something else
but<00:02:51.880> I<00:02:51.940> should<00:02:52.360> probably<00:02:52.390> be<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.810> little<00:02:52.990> bit

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
but I should probably be a little bit

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.140 
but I should probably be a little bit
higher<00:02:53.530> in<00:02:53.800> total<00:02:54.100> level<00:02:54.280> because<00:02:54.730> I've

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
higher in total level because I've

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.680 
higher in total level because I've
trained<00:02:55.690> some<00:02:55.870> slower<00:02:56.140> stuff<00:02:56.500> like<00:02:56.770> agility

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.350 
mining those are pretty slow fishing is
pretty<00:03:02.500> slow<00:03:02.770> or<00:03:03.250> Ted<00:03:03.640> takes<00:03:03.850> quite<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.180> bit<00:03:04.240> of

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
pretty slow or Ted takes quite a bit of

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.500 
pretty slow or Ted takes quite a bit of
time<00:03:04.660> once<00:03:05.110> you<00:03:05.260> get<00:03:05.470> up<00:03:05.680> so<00:03:05.950> about<00:03:06.100> 45<00:03:06.730> or<00:03:07.120> 40

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510

time once you get up so about 45 or 40
or<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:07.870> then<00:03:08.710> it<00:03:08.830> takes<00:03:09.040> quite<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:09.940> bit<00:03:10.030> XP<00:03:10.570> i
