00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
 yes hello crashed ice friends heartily 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.250
 Welcome here in my workshop 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.889
 as you have probably already seen 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.870
 I have new skates and I found 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.900
 that's quite fitting to say 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.230
 or to explain what about the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.850
 cake at crashed ice on safe here 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.210
 we see quite normal skids well 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.340
 nobody at ice hockey wears them all 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.460
 has a different cut but so see 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.980
 which we normally hold out 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.590
 just next to it the crashed ice skids 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.770
 and you'll be very clear about that 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.590
 difference that much longer 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.040
 is much higher and of the form too 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.230
 looks very different 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.809
 yes, as we see here, it's easy 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.879
 a very long pad and the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.170
 it just makes it possible to balance more 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.910
 to hold one has no longer the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.489
 problems with the wobble in front and 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.600
 behind but here you just stand yes 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.969
 like on a machine 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.670
 Everyone knows the proverb length 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.170
 running or skiing you can too 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.939
 but I am with longer sheer 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.210
 faster and a bit quieter 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.610
 on the piste and that's exactly how it is here 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.350
 which of course the disadvantage of a runner 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.240
 is for monaco for that the curve driving 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.100
 really difficult one has 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.960
 Of course the problems then complete 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.570
 to get around so at a first 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.850
 test ride with the call with the bin 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.590
 I also very angry in the walker 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.439
 I just popped the curve 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.329
 did not get oh well that's with 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.950
 such skids as not given there can 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.829
 you turn around in a small room and with 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.390
 you have to buy ice hockey , you have to 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.240
 be pretty agile and be quick 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.659
 yes, as I said so what can turn here 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.370
 you use at crashed ice and that means 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.680
 also much better and you are too 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.150
 faster so yes and yes you will 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.710
 Now let's see how I flag now 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:02:07.880
 old skates on the new ones 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:07.880
 skates conversion happiness be 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:18.840
 ready and you can do it now 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.290
 drive crashed ice and should too 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.840
 more quickly 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.840
 then we'll see each other
