 sodium in the body is not possible to exchange 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.469
 substances transmission of nerve impulses or 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.059
 narrow movement including cardiac

 muscles in the body of an adult 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.030
 contains about 250 grams of sodium but 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.670
 salt is constantly consumed and therefore its 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.539
 losses must be repaid on girl 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.670

 just do not overdo the common phrase 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.200

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.299
 Existence 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.790

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.670
 a teaspoon but 250 grams per day

 by physical labor became less this 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.420
 means that excess sodium with sweat from 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.710
 body excretion ceased as a result

 cardiovascular mortality 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.380
 diseases takes one of the first places 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.720

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.410
 various trace elements 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.170
