00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:11.110
 hello very good for those who have 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:14.139
 made a purchase that contains a 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.539
 wax ball and must be applied by 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.789
 example because you bought a 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.990
 invisible deck you know you have 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:25.660
 we have in magic tree the format more 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.630
 possible economic to the sale of deck 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.429
 invisible to both turn and I take 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.670
 to say it we also have a deck 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.050
 invisible with factory anti-skid 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.420
 what makes it a little more expensive 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.550
 that what we usually sell in 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.980
 magic but with total security and 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.010
 One hundred percent functionality guarantee 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.789
 but we do not see sides of that here but 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:52.149
 I come to explain you operation of use 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:56.530
 of wax for application in decks 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:58.449
 that require such wax what 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.180
 it does not have to be a bullet 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.340
 sensitive a simple game that is done 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.060
 for example to children to a child you can 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.100
 make a card game but you have to 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.690
 be very visual you can not tell 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.149
 to a kid who talked about the best of 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.770
 78-year-old children who choose online from 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.690
 concrete is right is because 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.700
 always comes out without devaluations but 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.580
 it has to be something visual it would be that 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.000
 one half of the cards 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:28.770
 blue and this one 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.229
 giving use to the sidewalk to become 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.690
 a red is very simple according to how 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.390
 It is carried out first of that kind 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.760
 everything is that by doing globality now 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.000
 you must remove the cotton that the 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.910
 It obviously protects the protects for 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.369
 that does not get dirty or dirty and a 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:54.900
 After removing it will be the ball 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.960
 wax just like that because of the temperature 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.229
 and for the non- use the wax will be hard 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:06.210
 as if from a lot of plasticine 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:09.959
 it's about you have to mold it so that it 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.600
 soften and then apply a minimum and 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.930
 I say minimal amount of derisory in the 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.000
 back of the card you want to convert into 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.060
 special line in ip jimmy as is 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.130
 in this case but naipe double back 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.400
 blue and red I do not know if you already appreciate 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.569
 I guess not but just in case you 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.790
 I show it 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:34.519
 through screen as this carries a 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.519
 so insignificant amount 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.300
 very little but something is that neither 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.660
 appreciate you should apply a small 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.970
 very very thin layer so that 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:53.250
 do not do any kind of 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.510
 of bulk and to be able to paste this card together 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.569
 with another 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:04.579
 they are in front of nests in a very 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:04.579
 simple very simple and to separate them 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.700
 you just have to slide extract the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.700
 letter 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.080
 of the place and slide it from one end 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.810
 slide it a little on the side so that 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.370
 separate do not create any strange sound 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.569
 sometimes if we did this with 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:32.659
 with a before and double- sided hbo 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:36.739
 you have the risk of the classic clack of 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:39.890
 separation but in this case application 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.260
 of a minimum amount the amount that 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:47.360
 You can take 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.360
 extracting it with the tip of a fingernail 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:56.319
 that is rubbed on top of the card and already 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:00.100
 you have a job treated with wax for 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:03.220
 that sticks to any letter 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.860
 and the treatment of this drug that I had 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.600
 I eat red or blue 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.290
 it adheres a little pressure makes 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.640
 it adheres easily the 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:17.019
 Sliding cards in your hands 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:20.440
 obviously it should be soft 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.199
 for no sudden movements so that no 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.710
 separate it if you squeeze is a lot about it 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:30.210
 I would also separate them but if you do 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.210
 with relative softness 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:37.259
 does not have any problem and it stays 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.479
 perfectly has had although the letter 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:42.879
 extract it in an unorthodox way 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.610
 no manuel more than then agent tell me 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:47.110
 that you roll too much but I think 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.560
 that things are sometimes necessary 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:54.099
 say them because it's better to sin of 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.900
 many that of little if there are doubts or if 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:05:00.180
 this has not explained it to me and now how 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.180
 was going in this way is solved 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.950
 all such cards will be to use 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.600
 and methods I hope you have served 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.060
 help and thank you very much for continuing 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.300
 trusting magic trick until next 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.300
