00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
each side okay so this Riemann start to

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.010 
each side okay so this Riemann start to
look<00:02:56.940> very<00:02:57.000> nice<00:02:59.360> you<00:03:00.360> can<00:03:00.510> use<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.840> whole

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
pretty big bow then you you grab like a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.500 
pretty big bow then you you grab like a
wire<00:03:12.570> or<00:03:13.050> a<00:03:13.080> piece<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.650> string<00:03:14.150> okay<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.210> wrap
