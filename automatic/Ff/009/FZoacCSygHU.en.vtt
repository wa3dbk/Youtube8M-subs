diameter as the screw if you could do

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.010 
diameter as the screw if you could do
this<00:02:02.400> outside<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.090> would<00:02:03.270> recommend<00:02:03.780> doing

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
this outside I would recommend doing

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.550 
this outside I would recommend doing
that<00:02:04.140> because<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:05.430> fumes<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:07.229> are<00:02:07.350> going<00:02:07.500> to

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
that because the fumes that are going to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.350 
that because the fumes that are going to
be<00:02:08.429> emitted<00:02:08.880> from<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.750> PCV<00:02:10.229> pipe<00:02:10.380> is<00:02:11.360> it's

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
be emitted from the PCV pipe is it's

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.900 
be emitted from the PCV pipe is it's
probably<00:02:12.510> toxic<00:02:12.870> honestly<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:13.980> just<00:02:14.490> really

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
probably toxic honestly so just really

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.820 
probably toxic honestly so just really
careful<00:02:15.540> about<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.870> don't<00:02:16.140> inhale<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.470> if

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
careful about that don't inhale it if

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.890 
careful about that don't inhale it if
anything<00:02:17.760> make<00:02:18.150> sure<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.810> turn<00:02:19.020> on<00:02:19.080> your

all right when your nail is hot enough

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.839 
all right when your nail is hot enough
for<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.629> short<00:02:48.930> piece<00:02:49.109> of<00:02:49.290> PCV<00:02:49.739> pipe<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:50.670> want

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
for the short piece of PCV pipe you want

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.089 
for the short piece of PCV pipe you want
to<00:02:50.969> melt<00:02:51.269> one<00:02:51.749> hole<00:02:51.989> straight<00:02:52.680> through<00:02:53.010> the

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
to melt one hole straight through the

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.160 
to melt one hole straight through the
center<00:02:53.370> not<00:02:53.999> through<00:02:54.329> both<00:02:54.480> sides<00:02:54.689> just

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
center not through both sides just

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.929 
center not through both sides just
through<00:02:55.349> one<00:02:55.499> side<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:56.159> turn<00:02:56.370> on<00:02:56.489> your<00:02:56.639> exhaust

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.460 

so<00:03:04.030> it<00:03:04.090> should<00:03:04.330> look<00:03:04.360> something<00:03:04.569> like<00:03:04.959> this

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
so it should look something like this

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.120 
so it should look something like this
after<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.069> melt<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.340> hole<00:03:06.489> and<00:03:06.730> your<00:03:08.130> your

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
after you melt the hole and your your

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.820 
after you melt the hole and your your
bolt<00:03:09.459> should<00:03:09.940> be<00:03:10.060> able<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.330> fit<00:03:10.480> through<00:03:10.720> it

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.470 

all<00:03:14.830> right<00:03:15.010> now<00:03:15.190> for<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.580> longer<00:03:16.060> piece<00:03:16.300> of

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
all right now for the longer piece of

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.839 
all right now for the longer piece of
PCV<00:03:16.930> pipe<00:03:16.959> you're<00:03:17.920> going<00:03:18.130> to<00:03:18.250> do<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.640> same

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
PCV pipe you're going to do the same

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.610 
PCV pipe you're going to do the same
thing<00:03:19.090> heat<00:03:19.360> that<00:03:19.510> nail<00:03:19.750> up<00:03:20.640> melt<00:03:21.640> one<00:03:22.030> hole

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
thing heat that nail up melt one hole

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.839 
thing heat that nail up melt one hole
through<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.709> bottom<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.269> PCV<00:03:25.840> pipe<00:03:25.870> and

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
through the bottom of the PCV pipe and

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.699 
through the bottom of the PCV pipe and
do<00:03:27.849> another<00:03:28.120> hole<00:03:28.450> on<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:29.019> opposite<00:03:29.470> side

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
do another hole on the opposite side

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.710 
do another hole on the opposite side
that<00:03:30.130> lines<00:03:30.370> up<00:03:30.610> so<00:03:31.300> it's<00:03:31.420> going<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.569> be

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
that lines up so it's going to be

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.520 
that lines up so it's going to be
something<00:03:32.470> like<00:03:32.560> that<00:03:32.620> okay<00:03:34.410> when<00:03:35.410> you're

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
something like that okay when you're

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.770 
something like that okay when you're
doing<00:03:35.860> this<00:03:36.040> if<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:36.970> have<00:03:37.090> a<00:03:37.120> pair<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:37.450> plumber

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
doing this if you have a pair of plumber

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.559 
doing this if you have a pair of plumber
pliers<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:39.730> would<00:03:39.850> be<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.000> little<00:03:40.269> bit<00:03:40.360> safer

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
pliers that would be a little bit safer

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.449 
pliers that would be a little bit safer
because<00:03:41.319> if<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:41.530> just<00:03:41.709> use<00:03:41.890> some<00:03:42.069> normal

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
because if you just use some normal

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.449 
because if you just use some normal
pliers<00:03:43.209> without<00:03:43.690> any<00:03:43.870> insulation<00:03:44.350> it's<00:03:45.280> going

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
pliers without any insulation it's going

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.009 
pliers without any insulation it's going
to<00:03:45.519> get<00:03:45.610> really<00:03:45.819> hot<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.360> you<00:03:46.420> might<00:03:46.750> not<00:03:46.870> be

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
to get really hot and you might not be

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.640 
to get really hot and you might not be
able<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.290> hold<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:48.430> pliers<00:03:49.380> so<00:03:50.380> when<00:03:50.530> you're

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
able to hold the pliers so when you're

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.729 
able to hold the pliers so when you're
attaching<00:03:50.920> this<00:03:51.190> small<00:03:51.519> piece<00:03:51.730> of<00:03:51.910> PCV<00:03:52.390> pipe

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739

pole won't be able to fit through so if

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.999 
pole won't be able to fit through so if
this<00:05:54.529> happens<00:05:54.740> to<00:05:54.979> you<00:05:55.159> you<00:05:55.719> can<00:05:56.719> just<00:05:57.020> take<00:05:57.979> a

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
this happens to you you can just take a

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.360 
this happens to you you can just take a
knife<00:05:58.309> or<00:05:58.639> something<00:05:59.349> heat<00:06:00.349> it<00:06:00.469> up<00:06:00.620> and<00:06:00.800> melt

half<00:06:02.240> of<00:06:02.360> that<00:06:02.479> off<00:06:02.689> and<00:06:02.960> now<00:06:03.430> you<00:06:04.430> got<00:06:04.759> a<00:06:06.129> spike

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:07.129 
half of that off and now you got a spike

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:08.950 
half of that off and now you got a spike
where<00:06:07.370> you<00:06:07.430> can<00:06:07.550> just<00:06:07.729> play<00:06:08.240> your<00:06:08.419> pole<00:06:08.659> in<00:06:08.839> it

where you can just play your pole in it

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.929 
where you can just play your pole in it
you<00:06:09.889> don't<00:06:10.009> got<00:06:10.129> to<00:06:10.219> put<00:06:10.339> it<00:06:10.430> through<00:06:10.550> the<00:06:10.669> top

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:12.939 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.999 

the<00:06:13.939> only<00:06:14.120> problem<00:06:14.479> with<00:06:14.599> this<00:06:14.779> is<00:06:15.050> if<00:06:15.710> your

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:16.009 
the only problem with this is if your

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:17.769 
the only problem with this is if your
pole<00:06:16.219> isn't<00:06:16.460> angled<00:06:17.089> in<00:06:17.210> the<00:06:17.300> ground<00:06:17.539> like

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:17.779 
pole isn't angled in the ground like

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:20.709 
pole isn't angled in the ground like
this<00:06:17.930> and<00:06:18.219> if<00:06:19.219> it's<00:06:19.370> more<00:06:19.520> straight<00:06:19.909> up<00:06:19.939> then

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:20.719 
this and if it's more straight up then

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:23.170 
this and if it's more straight up then
your<00:06:21.649> pole<00:06:21.889> could<00:06:22.249> fall<00:06:22.490> off<00:06:22.520> the<00:06:22.909> spike

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
your pole could fall off the spike

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.049 
your pole could fall off the spike
pretty<00:06:23.539> easily<00:06:23.930> go<00:06:24.529> into<00:06:24.680> the<00:06:24.830> sand<00:06:25.099> so<00:06:25.399> if<00:06:25.909> you

00:06:26.049 --> 00:06:26.059 
pretty easily go into the sand so if you

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:27.339 
pretty easily go into the sand so if you
do<00:06:26.180> it<00:06:26.300> like<00:06:26.389> this<00:06:26.449> just<00:06:26.960> make<00:06:27.080> sure<00:06:27.199> it's

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
do it like this just make sure it's

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:42.610 
do it like this just make sure it's
angled<00:06:27.740> in<00:06:27.949> the<00:06:28.279> sand<00:06:28.490> properly<00:06:29.289> like<00:06:30.289> this

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.680
