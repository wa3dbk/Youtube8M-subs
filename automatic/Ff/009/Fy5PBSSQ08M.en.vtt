Bend's<00:00:01.439> aquariums<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.370> filters<00:00:03.120> on<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.750> 55

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
Bend's aquariums the filters on the 55

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.120 
Bend's aquariums the filters on the 55
gallon<00:00:04.609> with<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:06.000> plants<00:00:06.750> in<00:00:06.899> them<00:00:09.230> so<00:00:10.230> I<00:00:10.620> got

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
gallon with the plants in them so I got

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.049 
gallon with the plants in them so I got
I<00:00:11.580> thought<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:13.009> the<00:00:14.009> filters<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.610> got<00:00:14.820> with

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
I thought that the filters I got with

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.689 
I thought that the filters I got with
the<00:00:15.269> 20<00:00:16.230> gallon<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.800> accidentally<00:00:17.369> broke

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
the 20 gallon that I accidentally broke

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.480 
the 20 gallon that I accidentally broke
I<00:00:18.060> thought<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.779> they<00:00:18.900> wouldn't<00:00:19.320> fit<00:00:19.619> but<00:00:20.340> it

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
I thought that they wouldn't fit but it

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.660 
I thought that they wouldn't fit but it
turns<00:00:20.789> out<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.270> they<00:00:21.510> do<00:00:21.949> I<00:00:22.949> tried<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.550> put

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
turns out that they do I tried to put

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.019 
turns out that they do I tried to put
him<00:00:23.850> putting<00:00:24.210> him<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.449> with<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.769> downs<00:00:26.279> this

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
him putting him on with the downs this

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.169 
him putting him on with the downs this
down<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.960> intake<00:00:28.650> tube<00:00:28.920> all<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.369> way<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.880> and

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
down the intake tube all the way on and

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.799 
down the intake tube all the way on and
it<00:00:30.300> wouldn't<00:00:30.570> fit<00:00:31.070> so<00:00:32.070> then<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:33.180> dawned<00:00:33.600> on

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
it wouldn't fit so then I just dawned on

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:34.910 
it wouldn't fit so then I just dawned on
me<00:00:33.870> about<00:00:34.079> five<00:00:34.290> minutes<00:00:34.469> ago

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
me about five minutes ago

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.160 
me about five minutes ago
duh<00:00:35.489> we<00:00:35.910> could<00:00:36.059> just<00:00:36.210> take<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.570> off<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
duh we could just take it off but the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.160 
duh we could just take it off but the
filter<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.920> then<00:00:38.070> put<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.309> back<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:39.140> so<00:00:40.140> I

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
filter on and then put it back on so I

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.090 
filter on and then put it back on so I
did<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.829> then<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.239> put<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.140> with<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
did that and then I put it with the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.590 
did that and then I put it with the
cheapest<00:00:45.980> filter<00:00:46.980> media<00:00:47.450> out<00:00:48.450> there

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.060 

polyester<00:00:53.360> fiberfill<00:00:54.360> they<00:00:55.079> feel<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.590> your

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
polyester fiberfill they feel like your

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.830 
polyester fiberfill they feel like your
stuff<00:00:56.280> pillows<00:00:56.699> would<00:00:56.850> pull<00:00:57.059> them<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:58.460> I<00:00:59.840> mean

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
stuff pillows would pull them and I mean

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.150 
stuff pillows would pull them and I mean
this<00:01:00.960> stuff<00:01:01.140> works<00:01:01.379> really<00:01:01.680> well<00:01:01.920> if

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
this stuff works really well if

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.310 
this stuff works really well if
polishing<00:01:02.670> water<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.239> already<00:01:03.809> see

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
polishing water I can already see

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.480 
polishing water I can already see
particles<00:01:05.240> being<00:01:06.240> trapped<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.490> it's

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
particles being trapped in it and it's

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.609 
particles being trapped in it and it's
alright<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.030> filters<00:01:09.390> overflowing<00:01:09.960> it's

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
alright the filters overflowing it's

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.940 
alright the filters overflowing it's
completely<00:01:11.010> fine<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:12.990> what<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.140> did<00:01:13.380> was<00:01:13.619> I

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
completely fine so but what I did was I

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.690 
completely fine so but what I did was I
took<00:01:14.210> part<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> Papa's<00:01:16.220> plant<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.490> got

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
took part of the Papa's plant that I got

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.940 
took part of the Papa's plant that I got
and<00:01:18.090> put<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.320> what's<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.920> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
and put it in here so what's going to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.310 
and put it in here so what's going to
happen<00:01:20.009> is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
happen is

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.130 
happen is
these<00:01:22.950> two<00:01:23.460> nub<00:01:23.909> things<00:01:25.610> right<00:01:26.610> there<00:01:27.140> are

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
these two nub things right there are

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.790 
these two nub things right there are
going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:29.010> roots<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.660> nub<00:01:31.140> right<00:01:31.560> on

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
going to be roots and that nub right on

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.050 
going to be roots and that nub right on
the<00:01:32.010> tip<00:01:32.190> of<00:01:32.310> my<00:01:32.370> thumb<00:01:34.100> there<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.460> going<00:01:35.790> to

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the tip of my thumb there is going to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.620 
the tip of my thumb there is going to
end<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:37.130> think<00:01:38.130> being<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.850> plant<00:01:41.479> but<00:01:42.479> if

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
end up I think being the plant but if

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.210 
end up I think being the plant but if
that<00:01:42.780> does<00:01:43.020> not<00:01:43.050> work<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.920> alright

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
that does not work that is alright

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.080 
that does not work that is alright
because<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.910> one<00:01:45.119> leaf<00:01:46.520> but<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.970> other

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
because it's just one leaf but the other

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.359 
because it's just one leaf but the other
down<00:01:48.360> down<00:01:48.840> side<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.560> don't<00:01:49.800> have<00:01:49.979> room<00:01:50.340> for

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
down down side is I don't have room for

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.590 
down down side is I don't have room for
the<00:01:50.790> other<00:01:51.090> filter<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.780> put<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.290> tank<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
the other filter to put on this tank and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.180 
the other filter to put on this tank and
I<00:01:54.950> decided<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.610> don't<00:01:57.450> want<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.440> get<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.830> new

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
I decided that I don't want to get a new

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.690 
I decided that I don't want to get a new
filter<00:01:59.490> for<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.970> tank<00:02:00.300> I<00:02:00.690> want<00:02:01.410> to<00:02:01.500> see<00:02:01.710> how

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
filter for this tank I want to see how

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.790 
filter for this tank I want to see how
much<00:02:03.229> filtration<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.410> can<00:02:04.619> get<00:02:04.860> done<00:02:05.720> with

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
much filtration I can get done with

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.180 
much filtration I can get done with
plants<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:09.840> spider<00:02:10.470> plants

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
plants so spider plants

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.730 
plants so spider plants

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
pothos perhaps that's not really in the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.200 
pothos perhaps that's not really in the
tank<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:18.550> want<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.610> see<00:02:19.700> how<00:02:19.850> much<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.150> can

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
tank you I want to see how much I can

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.570 
tank you I want to see how much I can
get<00:02:20.450> done<00:02:20.630> I<00:02:20.840> know<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.530> reduces<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.190> nitrates

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
get done I know it reduces the nitrates

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.450 
get done I know it reduces the nitrates
a<00:02:22.760> lot<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:24.110> if<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.350> can<00:02:24.500> just<00:02:24.530> pack<00:02:24.920> in<00:02:25.100> a<00:02:25.190> filter

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
a lot so if I can just pack in a filter

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.300 
a lot so if I can just pack in a filter
media<00:02:25.910> in<00:02:26.330> with<00:02:26.840> in<00:02:27.110> these<00:02:27.380> filters<00:02:27.890> I<00:02:28.100> should

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
media in with in these filters I should

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.870 
media in with in these filters I should
be<00:02:28.430> good<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:29.620> eventually<00:02:30.620> maybe<00:02:31.340> really<00:02:31.700> cool

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
be good and eventually maybe really cool

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.980 
be good and eventually maybe really cool
if<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:32.090> could<00:02:32.120> get<00:02:32.360> up<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.750> not<00:02:33.050> having<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.400> do

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
if I could get up to not having to do

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.790 
if I could get up to not having to do
water<00:02:35.990> changes<00:02:36.400> for<00:02:37.400> like<00:02:37.520> a<00:02:37.550> month<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.800> that

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
water changes for like a month and that

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.210 
water changes for like a month and that
would<00:02:39.950> save<00:02:40.160> water<00:02:40.460> which<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:40.940> always<00:02:41.150> good

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
would save water which is always good

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.120 
would save water which is always good
but<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.820> is<00:02:44.150> my<00:02:44.480> goal<00:02:44.810> with<00:02:45.170> this<00:02:45.380> with<00:02:45.950> the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
but that is my goal with this with the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.100 
but that is my goal with this with the
filter<00:02:46.820> side<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:47.540> this<00:02:47.690> tank<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.940> we<00:02:50.110> have

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
filter side of this tank and we have

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.100 
filter side of this tank and we have
these<00:02:52.040> runners<00:02:52.690> going<00:02:53.690> all<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.020> way<00:02:54.050> back

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
these runners going all the way back

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.700 
these runners going all the way back
there<00:02:54.500> but<00:02:55.010> they<00:02:55.310> are<00:02:55.550> growing<00:02:56.270> roots<00:02:56.510> now<00:02:56.840> see

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
there but they are growing roots now see

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.780 
there but they are growing roots now see
that's<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.070> focus<00:02:58.430> on<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.820> run<00:02:59.420> roots<00:02:59.990> and

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
that's it focus on the run roots and

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.650 
that's it focus on the run roots and
that's<00:03:01.790> pretty<00:03:02.150> cool

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:18.710 

oh<00:03:06.180> yeah<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.330> should<00:03:07.360> you<00:03:08.730> watch<00:03:09.730> this

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.870 

look<00:03:19.720> at<00:03:19.870> those<00:03:19.990> words<00:03:20.640> that's<00:03:21.640> insane

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
look at those words that's insane

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.420 
look at those words that's insane
so

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.120 

all<00:03:28.430> right<00:03:29.110> so<00:03:30.110> I'm<00:03:30.410> doing<00:03:30.560> something<00:03:30.980> right

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
all right so I'm doing something right

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.230 
all right so I'm doing something right
because<00:03:31.960> there's<00:03:32.960> a<00:03:33.080> whole<00:03:33.380> bunch<00:03:34.000> of<00:03:35.000> roots

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
because there's a whole bunch of roots

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.960 
because there's a whole bunch of roots
in<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.510> filter<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.080> they're<00:03:36.980> absorbing<00:03:37.700> all

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
in the filter and they're absorbing all

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.150 
in the filter and they're absorbing all
of<00:03:38.210> the<00:03:38.330> nitrates<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.050> excess<00:03:39.410> nutrients<00:03:40.100> and

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
of the nitrates the excess nutrients and

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.400 
of the nitrates the excess nutrients and
they're<00:03:43.160> just<00:03:43.340> work<00:03:44.300> it's<00:03:44.540> working<00:03:44.930> really

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
they're just work it's working really

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.550 
they're just work it's working really
well

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
well

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:56.220 
well
um<00:03:50.970> when<00:03:51.970> I<00:03:52.000> get<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.690> new<00:03:52.959> light<00:03:53.319> for<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:54.840> 75<00:03:55.840> I

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
um when I get the new light for the 75 I

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.260 
um when I get the new light for the 75 I
will<00:03:56.560> take<00:03:56.830> one<00:03:57.040> of<00:03:57.069> those<00:03:57.280> lights<00:03:57.610> and<00:03:57.880> I<00:03:58.060> will

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
will take one of those lights and I will

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.170 
will take one of those lights and I will
probably<00:03:58.569> either<00:03:59.260> hang<00:03:59.709> it<00:03:59.950> up<00:04:00.190> here<00:04:01.000> with

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
probably either hang it up here with

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.470 
probably either hang it up here with
this<00:04:01.330> one<00:04:01.980> or<00:04:02.980> I'll<00:04:03.190> put<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.550> on<00:04:03.670> this<00:04:03.970> tank<00:04:04.269> for

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
this one or I'll put it on this tank for

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.070 
this one or I'll put it on this tank for
the<00:04:04.569> aquatic<00:04:04.870> plants<00:04:05.319> I<00:04:05.500> don't<00:04:06.280> know<00:04:06.370> I

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.400 

I<00:04:10.110> don't<00:04:10.710> know<00:04:10.770> what<00:04:11.520> my<00:04:12.390> goal<00:04:12.600> is<00:04:12.660> to<00:04:13.080> get<00:04:13.200> as

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
I don't know what my goal is to get as

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.380 
I don't know what my goal is to get as
much<00:04:13.560> filtration<00:04:13.830> done<00:04:14.370> with<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.120> plants<00:04:15.720> as

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
much filtration done with the plants as

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.199 
much filtration done with the plants as
possible<00:04:18.390> I<00:04:19.310> don't<00:04:20.310> necessarily<00:04:20.430> want<00:04:20.730> to<00:04:20.910> go

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
possible I don't necessarily want to go

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.030 
possible I don't necessarily want to go
with<00:04:21.840> like<00:04:22.140> algae<00:04:23.870> but<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:25.170> wanted<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.710> go<00:04:25.860> with

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
with like algae but I wanted to go with

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.430 
with like algae but I wanted to go with
plants<00:04:26.580> like<00:04:26.700> these<00:04:26.880> like<00:04:27.240> I<00:04:27.600> used<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.350> do

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
plants like these like I used to do

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.130 
plants like these like I used to do
algae<00:04:29.040> on<00:04:29.160> this<00:04:29.480> phase<00:04:30.480> to<00:04:30.660> have<00:04:30.780> a<00:04:30.810> bath

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
algae on this phase to have a bath

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.890 
algae on this phase to have a bath
things<00:04:31.730> like<00:04:32.730> this<00:04:32.910> one<00:04:33.180> only<00:04:33.840> over<00:04:34.470> here<00:04:35.900> but

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
things like this one only over here but

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.580 
things like this one only over here but
that's<00:04:37.590> gone<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.490> it's<00:04:38.730> still<00:04:38.940> gross<00:04:39.150> analogy

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
that's gone and it's still gross analogy

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.030 
that's gone and it's still gross analogy
great<00:04:42.190> there<00:04:42.850> but<00:04:43.300> I<00:04:43.570> just<00:04:44.080> it's<00:04:44.680> not<00:04:44.830> working

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
great there but I just it's not working

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.240 
great there but I just it's not working
so<00:04:45.130> well<00:04:45.690> so<00:04:46.690> that's<00:04:46.930> what's<00:04:47.320> happening<00:04:48.190> with

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
so well so that's what's happening with

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.510 
so well so that's what's happening with
this<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:49.090> filter<00:04:49.540> side<00:04:49.870> of<00:04:50.230> this<00:04:50.520> 55-gallon

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
this the filter side of this 55-gallon

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:59.400 
this the filter side of this 55-gallon
tank<00:04:52.860> um<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:55.330> yeah<00:04:55.900> all<00:04:56.320> right<00:04:56.530> later
