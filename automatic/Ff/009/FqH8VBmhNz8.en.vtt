00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.590 
size up if you normally wear large or if
you<00:01:34.740> normally<00:01:35.009> wear<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.189> medium<00:01:35.939> go<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
you normally wear a medium go up to the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.020 
you normally wear a medium go up to the
large<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:38.130> that's<00:01:38.280> why<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.400> did<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.909> it

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
large so that's why I did this and it

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.560 
large so that's why I did this and it
fits<00:01:39.180> really<00:01:39.360> good<00:01:40.340> so<00:01:41.340> if<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.060> look<00:01:42.210> at<00:01:42.329> their

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
fits really good so if you look at their

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.990 
fits really good so if you look at their
climbing<00:01:43.530> belts<00:01:43.829> you'll<00:01:43.979> see<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.310> this

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
climbing belts you'll see this this

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.149 
climbing belts you'll see this this
buckle<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.079> really<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.439> exact

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
buckle and this is really just exact

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.940 
buckle and this is really just exact
same<00:01:47.369> buckle<00:01:47.759> they<00:01:47.970> took<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.680> they<00:01:49.680> put

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
same buckle they took that and they put

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.370 
same buckle they took that and they put
it<00:01:50.040> here<00:01:50.250> into<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.750> end<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:51.960> climb<00:01:52.200> it

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
it here into the end of this climb it

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.590 
it here into the end of this climb it
into<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.890> Rigger's<00:01:53.670> belt<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
into this Rigger's belt and one of the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.420 
into this Rigger's belt and one of the
reasons<00:01:54.840> they<00:01:54.899> did<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.320> riggers<00:01:56.100> belts

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
reasons they did that is riggers belts

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.800 
reasons they did that is riggers belts
are<00:01:56.579> also<00:01:56.850> supposed<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.240> be<00:01:57.299> able<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.509> be<00:01:57.570> used

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
are also supposed to be able to be used

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.889 
are also supposed to be able to be used
as<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:59.280> device<00:01:59.969> for<00:02:00.270> coming<00:02:00.689> out<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
as a device for coming out of a

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.319 
as a device for coming out of a
helicopter<00:02:01.229> repelling<00:02:02.040> things<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.670> so

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
helicopter repelling things like that so

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.780 
helicopter repelling things like that so
they<00:02:03.990> did<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:05.009> would<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.310> really

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
they did that so that it would be really

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.459 
they did that so that it would be really
sturdy<00:02:06.149> they<00:02:06.329> know<00:02:06.479> their<00:02:06.659> system<00:02:06.990> works<00:02:07.140> oh

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
sturdy they know their system works oh

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.040 
sturdy they know their system works oh
they<00:02:08.129> did<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.550> way<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.910> also<00:02:09.060> some

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
they did it that way and also some

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.479 
they did it that way and also some
people<00:02:10.319> really<00:02:10.440> like<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.800> climbing<00:02:11.129> belt<00:02:11.250> so

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
people really like the climbing belt so

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.770 
people really like the climbing belt so
they<00:02:11.610> were<00:02:11.670> actually<00:02:12.030> using<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.510> riggers

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
they were actually using this riggers

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.670 
they were actually using this riggers
belts<00:02:13.080> cutting<00:02:13.379> off

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
belts cutting off

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.550 
belts cutting off
the<00:02:13.769> leg<00:02:14.489> loops<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:14.909> just<00:02:15.060> using<00:02:15.299> the<00:02:15.390> belt<00:02:15.810> so

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
the leg loops and just using the belt so

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.080 
the leg loops and just using the belt so
our<00:02:16.680> teres<00:02:16.980> decided<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.400> build<00:02:18.000> a

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
our teres decided to build a

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.030 
our teres decided to build a
purpose-built<00:02:18.659> belt<00:02:19.049> and<00:02:19.379> this<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.799> what<00:02:19.950> they

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
purpose-built belt and this is what they

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.399 
purpose-built belt and this is what they
came<00:02:20.189> up<00:02:20.250> with<00:02:20.540> this<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.689> definitely<00:02:21.959> stiffer

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
came up with this is definitely stiffer

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.880 
came up with this is definitely stiffer
in<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:23.069> in<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.579> band<00:02:23.819> but<00:02:24.780> I'm<00:02:25.049> probably<00:02:25.709> not

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
in the in the band but I'm probably not

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.280 
in the in the band but I'm probably not
quite<00:02:26.099> as<00:02:26.159> stiff<00:02:26.459> as<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:27.209> is<00:02:27.420> but<00:02:27.689> a<00:02:27.930> little

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
quite as stiff as this is but a little

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.890 
quite as stiff as this is but a little
bit<00:02:28.379> stiffer<00:02:28.709> in<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:28.890> band<00:02:29.150> then<00:02:30.150> there<00:02:30.389> the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
bit stiffer in the band then there the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.629 
bit stiffer in the band then there the
climbing<00:02:31.290> harness<00:02:31.530> this<00:02:31.709> one<00:02:31.889> here<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.189> it's

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
climbing harness this one here the it's

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.119 
climbing harness this one here the it's
nice<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.030> soft<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.450> supple<00:02:33.689> but<00:02:34.019> they<00:02:34.980> made

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
nice and soft and supple but they made

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.500 
nice and soft and supple but they made
it<00:02:35.250> really<00:02:35.370> wide<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:35.700> it<00:02:36.030> distributes<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
it really wide so it distributes the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.119 
it really wide so it distributes the
weight<00:02:36.599> really<00:02:36.930> well<00:02:37.139> in<00:02:37.230> your<00:02:37.349> back<00:02:37.500> when<00:02:37.769> you

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
weight really well in your back when you

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.129 
weight really well in your back when you
take<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.340> fall<00:02:38.639> now<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.359> is<00:02:39.480> designed<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.959> take

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
take a fall now this is designed to take

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.979 
take a fall now this is designed to take
serious<00:02:40.680> Falls<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.159> mean<00:02:41.340> 100-foot<00:02:42.239> 200-foot

don't know what you'd use these forward

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.470 
don't know what you'd use these forward
is<00:03:13.739> gear<00:03:14.099> or<00:03:14.340> whatever<00:03:14.639> but<00:03:15.180> what<00:03:15.359> you'll

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
is gear or whatever but what you'll

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.580 
is gear or whatever but what you'll
notice<00:03:15.599> is<00:03:15.810> when<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.019> put<00:03:16.169> the<00:03:16.290> belt<00:03:16.469> on

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
notice is when you put the belt on

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.689 
notice is when you put the belt on
properly<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:19.590> hook<00:03:19.889> end<00:03:20.069> point<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.519> right

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
properly the the hook end point is right

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.580 
properly the the hook end point is right
here<00:03:20.989> that's<00:03:21.989> where<00:03:22.169> going<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.349> put<00:03:22.470> your

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
here that's where going to put your

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.460 
here that's where going to put your
carabiner<00:03:22.979> and<00:03:23.220> this<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.180> way<00:03:24.989> stronger<00:03:25.290> than

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
carabiner and this is way stronger than

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.559 
carabiner and this is way stronger than
any<00:03:25.799> metal<00:03:26.400> hook<00:03:26.819> or<00:03:27.030> whatever<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.359> you<00:03:27.419> see

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
any metal hook or whatever that you see

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.360 
any metal hook or whatever that you see
on<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.720> lot<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:27.900> riggers<00:03:28.169> belts<00:03:28.500> but<00:03:29.159> that's

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
on a lot of riggers belts but that's

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.710 
on a lot of riggers belts but that's
we're<00:03:29.459> going<00:03:29.579> to<00:03:29.699> hook<00:03:29.819> your<00:03:29.970> carabiner<00:03:30.540> in

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
we're going to hook your carabiner in

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.860 
we're going to hook your carabiner in
two<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.049> that's<00:03:31.709> what<00:03:31.859> you'd<00:03:31.949> rappel<00:03:32.370> off<00:03:32.400> of

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
two and that's what you'd rappel off of

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.809 
two and that's what you'd rappel off of
so<00:03:33.870> when<00:03:34.049> it's<00:03:34.169> in<00:03:34.379> the<00:03:34.500> proper<00:03:34.889> position<00:03:35.669> with

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
so when it's in the proper position with

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.969 
so when it's in the proper position with
this<00:03:36.000> forward<00:03:36.269> you'll<00:03:37.019> see<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.470> these<00:03:37.650> line

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:37.979 
this forward you'll see that these line

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:39.500 
this forward you'll see that these line
up<00:03:38.189> on<00:03:38.400> both<00:03:39.030> sides

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
up on both sides

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.839 
up on both sides

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
having leg loops attached these are

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.929 
having leg loops attached these are
simply<00:03:43.859> keepers<00:03:44.280> if<00:03:44.430> you'll<00:03:44.519> notice<00:03:44.819> with

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939 
simply keepers if you'll notice with

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.569 
simply keepers if you'll notice with
this<00:03:45.150> setup<00:03:45.359> here<00:03:45.829> you<00:03:46.829> have<00:03:46.949> keepers<00:03:47.340> here

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
this setup here you have keepers here

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.219 
this setup here you have keepers here
that<00:03:47.819> just<00:03:48.000> hold<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.479> leg<00:03:48.629> loops<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:49.019> place

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:49.229 
that just hold the leg loops in place

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.689 
that just hold the leg loops in place
and<00:03:49.439> you're<00:03:49.530> putting<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.859> belt<00:03:50.009> on<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.519> just

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
and you're putting the belt on it just

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:51.860 
and you're putting the belt on it just
keeps<00:03:50.879> everything<00:03:51.030> together<00:03:51.329> makes<00:03:51.750> it

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
these are going to be as keepers and

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.809 
these are going to be as keepers and
they're<00:03:58.560> not<00:03:58.620> made<00:03:58.889> for<00:03:59.129> any<00:03:59.220> weight<00:03:59.459> you<00:03:59.669> can

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
even see on there it says 0kn so it's

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.020 
even see on there it says 0kn so it's
made<00:04:03.359> for<00:04:03.569> no<00:04:04.139> type<00:04:04.439> of<00:04:04.650> fall<00:04:05.189> or<00:04:05.519> weight<00:04:05.790> or

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
anything like that just there is a

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.879 
anything like that just there is a
keeper<00:04:07.970> so<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.180> explain<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:09.989> to<00:04:10.259> you<00:04:10.349> now

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
keeper so that explain that to you now

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.610 
keeper so that explain that to you now
for<00:04:11.129> me<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.519> just<00:04:12.090> use<00:04:12.299> these<00:04:12.540> as<00:04:12.750> basically

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
for me I just use these as basically

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.080 
for me I just use these as basically
like<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.769> little<00:04:13.859> loop<00:04:14.189> for<00:04:14.370> my<00:04:14.459> keys<00:04:14.669> I'll<00:04:14.909> just

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
like a little loop for my keys I'll just

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.149 
like a little loop for my keys I'll just
take<00:04:15.629> my<00:04:15.659> keys<00:04:16.229> in<00:04:16.380> my<00:04:16.470> carabiner<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:17.099> I'll

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.159 
take my keys in my carabiner and I'll

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.069 
take my keys in my carabiner and I'll
stick<00:04:17.940> them<00:04:18.030> through<00:04:18.239> there<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.659> hang<00:04:18.930> my

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
stick them through there and hang my

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.990 
stick them through there and hang my
keys<00:04:19.289> off<00:04:19.470> them<00:04:19.650> so<00:04:19.829> you<00:04:20.310> can<00:04:20.459> find<00:04:20.669> uses<00:04:20.970> for

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
keys off them so you can find uses for

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.250 
keys off them so you can find uses for
them<00:04:21.239> but<00:04:21.359> they're<00:04:21.539> really<00:04:21.750> designed<00:04:21.989> for

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
them but they're really designed for

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.230 
them but they're really designed for
when<00:04:23.070> you<00:04:23.159> use<00:04:23.340> these<00:04:23.520> in<00:04:23.639> combination<00:04:24.120> two

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
when you use these in combination two

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.240 
when you use these in combination two
leg<00:04:24.419> loops<00:04:24.650> haven't<00:04:25.650> seen<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.800> review<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.219> have

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
leg loops haven't seen a review you have

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.440 
leg loops haven't seen a review you have
anybody<00:04:26.700> show

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
anybody show

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.030 
anybody show
them<00:04:27.630> with<00:04:27.780> leg<00:04:28.020> loops<00:04:28.260> even<00:04:28.680> our<00:04:28.770> terrace

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
them with leg loops even our terrace

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.560 
them with leg loops even our terrace
reviews<00:04:29.310> don't<00:04:29.460> have<00:04:29.640> them<00:04:29.820> but<00:04:30.000> they<00:04:30.210> do<00:04:30.270> make

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
reviews don't have them but they do make

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.990 
reviews don't have them but they do make
leg<00:04:30.870> loops<00:04:31.110> that<00:04:31.740> go<00:04:31.890> with<00:04:32.070> these<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.550> at<00:04:32.880> that

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
leg loops that go with these and at that

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.030 
leg loops that go with these and at that
point<00:04:33.180> I<00:04:33.330> don't<00:04:33.390> believe<00:04:33.690> this<00:04:33.810> is<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:34.470> climbing

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
point I don't believe this is a climbing

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.830 
point I don't believe this is a climbing
harness<00:04:35.130> but<00:04:35.610> it's<00:04:36.300> going<00:04:36.450> to<00:04:36.510> be<00:04:36.630> a<00:04:36.660> little

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
harness but it's going to be a little

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.120 
harness but it's going to be a little
more<00:04:36.930> comfortable<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.410> repels<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:37.980> things

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
more comfortable and repels and things

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.060 
more comfortable and repels and things
like<00:04:38.280> that<00:04:38.600> longer<00:04:39.600> days<00:04:39.870> on<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.140> rope<00:04:40.320> but

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
like that longer days on the rope but

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.910 
like that longer days on the rope but
other<00:04:41.760> than<00:04:41.910> that<00:04:42.440> it's<00:04:43.440> really<00:04:43.740> not<00:04:43.860> a

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
other than that it's really not a

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.960 
other than that it's really not a
climbing<00:04:44.310> harness<00:04:44.370> it's<00:04:44.700> made<00:04:44.850> for

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
climbing harness it's made for

that's<00:06:27.060> a<00:06:27.120> lot<00:06:27.330> of<00:06:27.420> slack<00:06:27.630> and<00:06:27.900> then<00:06:28.710> same<00:06:29.550> kind

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
that's a lot of slack and then same kind

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.010 
that's a lot of slack and then same kind
of<00:06:29.820> principle<00:06:29.970> here<00:06:30.330> on<00:06:30.420> the<00:06:30.510> climbing<00:06:30.840> belt

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
of principle here on the climbing belt

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.410 
of principle here on the climbing belt
they<00:06:31.170> have<00:06:31.260> a<00:06:31.290> elastic<00:06:31.770> keeper<00:06:32.310> here<00:06:32.520> but

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:33.420 
they have a elastic keeper here but

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.480 
they have a elastic keeper here but
they've<00:06:34.050> got<00:06:34.350> less<00:06:34.560> slack<00:06:34.920> on<00:06:34.950> this<00:06:35.250> so<00:06:35.460> I

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
they've got less slack on this so I

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.250 
they've got less slack on this so I
don't<00:06:35.580> know<00:06:35.790> why<00:06:36.300> they<00:06:36.450> use<00:06:36.600> so<00:06:36.780> much<00:06:36.900> on<00:06:37.110> there

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260 
don't know why they use so much on there

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.320 
don't know why they use so much on there
maybe<00:06:37.980> somebody<00:06:38.280> watching<00:06:38.700> this<00:06:38.730> will<00:06:38.940> build

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
maybe somebody watching this will build

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.360 
maybe somebody watching this will build
tell<00:06:40.020> me<00:06:40.110> why<00:06:40.230> that<00:06:40.260> is<00:06:40.440> but

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
tell me why that is but

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.189 
tell me why that is but
that<00:06:41.669> just<00:06:41.880> sums<00:06:42.030> it<00:06:42.150> up<00:06:42.210> for<00:06:42.270> me<00:06:42.419> I<00:06:42.810> ended<00:06:43.080> up

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 
that just sums it up for me I ended up

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:44.270 
that just sums it up for me I ended up
buying<00:06:43.410> two<00:06:43.500> of<00:06:43.710> them<00:06:43.800> they're<00:06:43.979> pretty

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
buying two of them they're pretty

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.560 
buying two of them they're pretty
expensive<00:06:44.580> belts<00:06:44.970> but<00:06:45.090> it<00:06:45.180> was<00:06:45.270> well<00:06:45.419> worth

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 
expensive belts but it was well worth

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.450 
expensive belts but it was well worth
for<00:06:45.870> me<00:06:45.960> because<00:06:46.139> of<00:06:46.260> comfort<00:06:46.590> and<00:06:46.800> I<00:06:47.100> can<00:06:47.310> have

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
for me because of comfort and I can have

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.100 
for me because of comfort and I can have
one<00:06:47.639> on<00:06:47.790> one<00:06:48.030> pair<00:06:48.330> of<00:06:48.389> jeans<00:06:48.479> or<00:06:48.870> pair<00:06:49.050> of

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910 
shorts and not have to keep stringing

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.110 
shorts and not have to keep stringing
them<00:06:51.000> through<00:06:51.949> but<00:06:52.949> I<00:06:52.979> really<00:06:53.729> like<00:06:53.880> them<00:06:54.030> I

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
them through but I really like them I

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.060 
them through but I really like them I
think<00:06:54.210> that<00:06:54.449> they're<00:06:54.660> pretty<00:06:55.290> top-notch<00:06:55.770> I

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070 
think that they're pretty top-notch I

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.280 
think that they're pretty top-notch I
did<00:06:56.550> find<00:06:56.820> these<00:06:56.970> on<00:06:57.290> mission-ready

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.290

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.560 
did find these on mission-ready
equipment<00:06:58.800> comm<00:06:59.130> and<00:06:59.310> they<00:06:59.370> were<00:06:59.430> on<00:06:59.610> sale<00:06:59.880> so

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.570 
equipment comm and they were on sale so

equipment comm and they were on sale so
they<00:07:01.320> normally<00:07:01.650> go<00:07:01.800> I<00:07:01.830> think<00:07:02.130> close<00:07:02.460> to<00:07:02.490> 120

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220 
our Tareq's products are like that so

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.710 
our Tareq's products are like that so
