00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:12.789
 Hi, welcome to the clothes you give today. 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:16.840
 Let's draw the princess Ana is not 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.850
 beautiful and can also play with the 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.110
 patient's body if a pencil and a 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.570
 paper sheet 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.500
 we already have a circle and two curved lines 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.910
 by May and now we will mark well the 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.270
 lines 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.129
 I'm uploading more of mine to 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.129
 see where to face 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:47.210
 here we have a line that goes from May 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.519
 middle ear for us 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.390
 show where is the bottom of the 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.390
 eyes 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.350
 then we go down to show 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:02.149
 where women are and nose can be 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.930
 to draw the mouth and thus to build 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.930
 Yeah man 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.100
 when they have already had their right forms 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.939
 we can delete the lines no longer 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.469
 We need 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.670
 the lines that did not stay too long will 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.670
 always happen 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:43.159
 Ok let's draw there and mark the 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:46.009
 lines women in the mouth are already two 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.579
 lines on each side of the mouth to show 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.579
 the expression 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.849
 I do not really like that line so the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.890
 pay because when making the mouth 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:03.229
 I realized that the shape of the face has to be 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:05.979
 bigger and it does not hurt sometimes it will take 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.979
 change things 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:27.120
 now the eye is on, let's do it 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:29.330
 pupil like white ball on tip 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.330
 left 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.109
 and the same on the other side because it is one of the 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.150
 reflexes in the same site in both 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:45.079
 eyes 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.859
 now we do the eyelid and eyelashes and 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.859
 clear 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:02.540
 the eyebrows and I see that tip of the 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:06.769
 eyebrow begins at the nose line in the 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.220
 right side and now let's do the 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.220
 hair 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:19.250
 let's do first draft and another 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.680
 line that is on the left side and 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:27.170
 we make these simple lines on the side 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:30.620
 direct as well and we are creating champion and 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.709
 to draw the ear 12 years with a 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.599
 line from the base of the nose to the top of the eye and 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.720
 so we see more or less when it gets 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.720
 now 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.720
 and now we pay the lines that no longer 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.720
 We need 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:57.600
 because we already have a better idea of ​​how 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:04:00.320
 It's going to be a very good deal. 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.320
 stay spin 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:13.840
 so far we have made a draft of what 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:16.440
 to see the light we can do for ourselves and 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.910
 we make these forms 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.910
 following the sketch we did 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.229
 and the same thing here we give more texture 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.100
 but always following the first form that 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:54.979
 we made a promoter on the farm one 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:57.039
 line and then more hair fell a lot 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.039
 good 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.920
 and those lines show hair falling 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:18.910
 and now it looks like we're making a 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:24.030
 Egg roundup is not one to the side 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:27.450
 of others is very simple 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.450
 This is going to be the basis 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:40.360
 before we finish this we will make the 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:44.250
 underneath makes the lines marked and 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.250
 Let's finish the hair text next to it. 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:59.099
 Very well now, I'll definitely score 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:04.949
 more as the eggs and can see what is 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:07.409
 It seems like we play braid in the shapes. 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:14.309
 initials and deviate more in the form of 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:16.759
 tear made the hair is to go inside and 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:16.759
 outside 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:28.160
 it's very simple already 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.160
 a circus is the end of france 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:40.080
 and pay the lines we no longer need 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:14.780
 have to have a little patience already 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:17.740
 and a few more details to stay 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.740
 same goes 

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:32.470
 the clothes are braid 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:37.720
 and a shadows can in the neck and now 

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:42.640
 the more my eyes detail the end of 

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:46.540
 bathing lines and is already 

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:48.940
 It's just fun coloring. 

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:52.390
 I hope you have enjoyed drawing the 

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:54.490
 princess in the show in her design in
