is in relation to the shift lever I
don't<00:01:15.330> want<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.509> be<00:01:15.570> resting<00:01:16.020> my<00:01:16.110> foot<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
want to push it down into neutral at

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.609 
want to push it down into neutral at
Frisky<00:01:21.240> when<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.450> jump<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.780> tank<00:01:22.080> now<00:01:22.440> one

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
Frisky when I jump to the tank now one

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.830 
Frisky when I jump to the tank now one
of<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> showed<00:01:23.550> exactly<00:01:24.119> how<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.420> jump<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
of you showed exactly how you jump to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.050 
of you showed exactly how you jump to
the<00:01:24.869> tank<00:01:25.140> well<00:01:25.860> there's<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.399> couple<00:01:26.520> ways<00:01:26.700> jump

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the tank well there's a couple ways jump

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.010 
the tank well there's a couple ways jump
think<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.360> could<00:01:27.479> do<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.630> from<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:27.810> front

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
think you could do it from the front

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.770 
think you could do it from the front
pegs<00:01:28.290> which<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.220> basically<00:01:29.549> almost<00:01:30.540> into<00:01:30.750> a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
pegs which is basically almost into a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.070 
pegs which is basically almost into a
stand-up<00:01:31.229> wheelies<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.360> like<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.899> only

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
stand-up wheelies and like this the only

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.620 
stand-up wheelies and like this the only
problem<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:35.909> kind<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.509> an

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
problem with this is it's kind of an

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.109 
problem with this is it's kind of an
abrupt<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.440> an<00:01:37.590> abrupt<00:01:37.920> jump<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.910> like

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
abrupt it's an abrupt jump so like

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.639 
abrupt it's an abrupt jump so like
there's<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.420> lot<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.690> chance<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.140> throttle

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
there's a lot of chance of throttle

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:41.840 
there's a lot of chance of throttle
trapping<00:01:41.009> going<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.369> when<00:01:41.520> you're<00:01:41.640> sitting

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
trapping going on when you're sitting

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.249 
trapping going on when you're sitting
here<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.210> you're<00:01:42.420> kind<00:01:42.690> of<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.929> vulnerable

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
here and you're kind of in a vulnerable

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:43.700 
here and you're kind of in a vulnerable

what<00:01:44.429> happens<00:01:44.789> is<00:01:44.970> I've<00:01:45.450> seen<00:01:45.690> guys<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:46.110> this

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
what happens is I've seen guys do this

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.810 
what happens is I've seen guys do this
they'll<00:01:46.860> be<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.250> when<00:01:47.550> they<00:01:47.640> go<00:01:47.670> to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
they'll be like this when they go to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.760 
they'll be like this when they go to
make<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.030> jump<00:01:48.360> they<00:01:48.899> let<00:01:49.409> off<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
make the jump they let off on the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.590 
make the jump they let off on the
throttle<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.340> then<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.940> bike<00:01:51.119> comes<00:01:51.360> down<00:01:51.569> a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
throttle and then the bike comes down a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.480 
throttle and then the bike comes down a
lot<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.259> they<00:01:52.350> got<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> gas<00:01:52.770> way<00:01:53.039> back<00:01:53.280> into

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
lot so then they got a gas way back into

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.609 
lot so then they got a gas way back into
it<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.179> an<00:01:54.270> ugly<00:01:54.479> looking<00:01:54.720> thing<00:01:54.780> it's

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
it it's it's an ugly looking thing it's

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.499 
it it's it's an ugly looking thing it's
almost<00:01:55.830> like<00:01:56.039> you<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.509> overcompensate

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
almost like you have to overcompensate

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.609 
almost like you have to overcompensate
or<00:01:58.050> something<00:01:58.289> like<00:01:58.350> that

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
or something like that

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.919 
or something like that
right<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.550> thing<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.909> do<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.300> as<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
right one thing that I do is as the

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:02.180 
right one thing that I do is as the
bikes<00:02:01.110> coming<00:02:01.530> up<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:01.890> wheelie

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
bikes coming up in the wheelie

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.309 
bikes coming up in the wheelie
immediately<00:02:02.729> after<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.090> clutch<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.539> up<00:02:03.659> as<00:02:03.840> it's

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
immediately after I clutch it up as it's

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.320 
immediately after I clutch it up as it's
coming<00:02:04.649> up<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> bounce<00:02:05.159> point<00:02:05.550> I'll<00:02:05.880> jump

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
coming up to the bounce point I'll jump

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.600 
coming up to the bounce point I'll jump
right<00:02:06.509> into<00:02:06.690> the<00:02:06.840> tank<00:02:07.050> position<00:02:07.590> what<00:02:08.459> that

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
right into the tank position what that

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.190 
right into the tank position what that
enables<00:02:09.000> me<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.149> do<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.479> ride<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.840> wheelie<00:02:10.019> out

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
enables me to do is ride the wheelie out

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.690 
enables me to do is ride the wheelie out
a<00:02:10.229> little<00:02:10.530> bit<00:02:10.709> longer<00:02:10.920> because<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.370> longer<00:02:11.670> I

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
a little bit longer because the longer I

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.880 
a little bit longer because the longer I
wait<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.239> jump<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.690> tank<00:02:12.930> like<00:02:13.380> Kyle<00:02:13.590> said

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
wait to jump to the tank like Kyle said

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.500 
wait to jump to the tank like Kyle said
there's<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.130> better<00:02:14.310> chance<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:15.120> might

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
there's a better chance that I might

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.360 
there's a better chance that I might
overcompensate<00:02:16.380> by<00:02:16.530> dropping<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.010> throttle

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
overcompensate by dropping the throttle

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.039 
overcompensate by dropping the throttle
trying<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:17.640> save<00:02:17.850> myself<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.299> little<00:02:18.420> bit<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.840> I

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
trying to save myself a little bit and I

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.300 
trying to save myself a little bit and I
might<00:02:19.260> not<00:02:19.410> have<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.650> gear<00:02:20.010> that's<00:02:20.220> gonna

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
might not have the gear that's gonna

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.220 
might not have the gear that's gonna
pull<00:02:20.579> me<00:02:20.670> back<00:02:20.820> up<00:02:21.030> into<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.299> position<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:22.170> I

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
pull me back up into that position so I

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.380 
pull me back up into that position so I
want<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.500> do<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.739> as<00:02:22.829> soon<00:02:22.950> as<00:02:23.070> possible

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
want to do it as soon as possible

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.640 
want to do it as soon as possible

that's my personal favor the only

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.539 
that's my personal favor the only
problem<00:02:42.239> with<00:02:42.329> that<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:43.010> that's<00:02:44.010> more<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.459> a

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
problem with that is that's more of a

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.770 
problem with that is that's more of a
harsh<00:02:44.730> jump<00:02:45.030> because<00:02:45.209> you're<00:02:45.299> going<00:02:45.450> from<00:02:45.540> the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
harsh jump because you're going from the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.599 
harsh jump because you're going from the
c1<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.350> tank<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.160> have<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.370> tendency

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
c1 of the tank so you have a tendency

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.160 
c1 of the tank so you have a tendency
like<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.239> always<00:02:48.420> know<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.570> tendency<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.989> knock

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
like I always know a tendency to knock

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.870 
like I always know a tendency to knock
the<00:02:49.320> bike<00:02:49.470> down<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:49.859> actually<00:02:50.220> what<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.370> do<00:02:50.459> will

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
the bike down so actually what I do will

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.000 
the bike down so actually what I do will
either<00:02:50.970> not<00:02:51.120> sounds<00:02:51.480> crazy<00:02:51.690> when<00:02:52.019> I'm<00:02:52.799> when

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
either not sounds crazy when I'm when

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.680 
either not sounds crazy when I'm when
I'm<00:02:53.130> in<00:02:53.250> my<00:02:53.340> seat<00:02:53.579> stander<00:02:53.790> position<00:02:54.299> I'm

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
I'm in my seat stander position I'm

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.360 
I'm in my seat stander position I'm
doing<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.019> good<00:02:55.140> seat<00:02:55.380> stander<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.920> actually

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
doing a good seat stander I actually

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.949 
doing a good seat stander I actually
gaps<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.209> enough<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.600> where<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.840> probably

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
gaps it enough to where it probably

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.270 
gaps it enough to where it probably
gonna<00:02:58.230> stand<00:02:58.470> here<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.680> just<00:02:58.920> loop<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.070> whole

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
gonna stand here I just loop the whole

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.090 
gonna stand here I just loop the whole
thing<00:02:59.519> as<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.299> jump<00:03:00.570> Ross<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.140> guess<00:03:01.350> even<00:03:01.890> more

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
thing as I jump Ross I guess even more

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.009 
thing as I jump Ross I guess even more
because<00:03:02.549> when<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:02.790> when<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.120> meet<00:03:03.420> my<00:03:03.600> bike<00:03:03.810> and

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
because when I when I meet my bike and

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.539 
because when I when I meet my bike and
hit<00:03:04.079> it<00:03:04.230> I'm<00:03:04.350> pushing<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.799> down<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.220> kind<00:03:05.489> of

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
hit it I'm pushing it down so I kind of

too much right here it is possible stock
sprockets<00:03:55.209> except<00:03:55.540> we'd<00:03:55.989> have<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.290> be<00:03:56.410> up

around<00:03:56.800> 100<00:03:57.730> maybe<00:03:58.060> 110<00:03:58.570> miles<00:03:58.810> an<00:03:58.959> hour<00:03:59.080> and

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
around 100 maybe 110 miles an hour and

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.490 
around 100 maybe 110 miles an hour and
our<00:04:00.970> chase<00:04:01.270> car<00:04:01.300> couldn't<00:04:01.930> keep<00:04:02.080> up<00:04:02.260> with<00:04:02.380> that

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
so we had to go with the bigger gearing

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.390 
so we had to go with the bigger gearing
for<00:04:03.820> this<00:04:04.060> one<00:04:04.739> all<00:04:05.739> right<00:04:05.860> one<00:04:06.100> thing<00:04:06.130> to
