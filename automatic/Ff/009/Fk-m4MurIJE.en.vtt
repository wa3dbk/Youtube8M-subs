things smooth hands versus quick moves
that's<00:02:08.640> fun<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.910> practice<00:02:09.060> both<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:10.379> then<00:02:10.500> I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
that's fun to practice both and then I

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.949 
that's fun to practice both and then I
do<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.890> again<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:12.000> time<00:02:12.209> it's<00:02:12.330> green<00:02:12.540> biscuit

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959

I<00:02:13.140> really<00:02:13.739> like<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:14.099> investigated

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
I really like to be investigated

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.070 
I really like to be investigated
especially<00:02:14.970> I'd<00:02:15.120> rather<00:02:15.269> than<00:02:15.420> training

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
especially I'd rather than training

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.470 
especially I'd rather than training
tiles<00:02:16.349> so<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.040> like<00:02:17.250> using<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.610> there<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.120> slides

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
tiles so I like using it there it slides

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.559 
tiles so I like using it there it slides
very<00:02:18.900> well<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:20.310> that's<00:02:20.730> nice<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.060> do<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.480> I'm

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569

very well so that's nice to do and I'm
just<00:02:21.690> doing<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.140> pull<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.069> on<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.640> back

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
just doing the pull it in on the back

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.150

can't<00:02:24.060> pull<00:02:24.269> it<00:02:24.360> on<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.450> forehand<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.160> that

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
can't pull it on the forehand and that

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.040 
can't pull it on the forehand and that
just<00:02:26.340> helps<00:02:26.519> you<00:02:26.610> get<00:02:26.670> some<00:02:26.849> smooth<00:02:27.060> hands<00:02:27.480> and
