00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.189
 how to everyone to make a new 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:28.509
 puzzle game in this case I'm going to 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:31.270
 use a spring plus some element 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:35.490
 such as rope ring or some 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.990
 ball is made of wood or plastic 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.930
 we need to do it 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.280
 a dock as I said in which by the 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.130
 upper part 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:51.960
 will close to put a ring 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:54.870
 a piece of string in three rings and 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.170
 a piece of a wire that we will make this 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.950
 shape 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.420
 to be able to fit inside 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.720
 of memory 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.890
 I'm going to do it in a way now 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.620
 provisional 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.600
 that is to say that it can be released but 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:19.240
 already in the future, we would do it 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.110
 more secure so that you can not 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.340
 drop and tied to one of the rings 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.060
 rope 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.060
 we put 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.150
 once it has come out we take another 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.000
 ring 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.000
 we hooked it we put it back 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.150
 We take out the dock 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.800
 and once we have it here we have 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.810
 what to do this movement this ring is 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:01.240
 Stays here 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.240
 and this other one we have to hook 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.200
 in the east part of the pier 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.970
 so that this ring can not come out 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.739
 here and now the rope the other 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.739
 extreme we will hook 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.980
 good 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.090
 well then in this way we only 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:34.120
 remains 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:37.470
 put the decoy or trap as you 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.350
 I call myself in this way 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.810
 and through all the movements that 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.360
 we want to go doing it 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.910
 we will deliver our friends so that 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.390
 they can solve it 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.710
 have 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.590
 some difficulty 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.830
 and as I say in all the game then one 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.490
 Once it is manufactured 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.450
 you can modify play to make a gift 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.580
 what you want 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.760
 and the good thing about this is that we 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:14.879
 We have made ourselves and 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.879
 our friends, it can be a gift 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.660
 and we will get them 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.350
 entertained and if there are children then what 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.280
 same 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.280
 these are some variants 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.580
 some have double strings but already 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.490
 everyone will have to go looking for their 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.210
 own again very well well many 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:42.230
 thank you I hope it serves someone and 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.230
 until the next video
