00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 2 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.410
 Hello Beautiful that we're back again 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.300
 to the latest video I once I have 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.830
 no special topic but have 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.369
 just the training of yesterday 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.400
 filmed on halloween to show you 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.960
 on which we stand at the moment are the 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.520
 I know most of you 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.199
 last two weeks actually only 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.720
 step led or down and 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.870
 on hearing aids because he is not very clear 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.699
 was from the left back leg because there 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.220
 veterinarian there but you can not me 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.250
 read everything again the case is 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.110
 so that he fits again quite well now 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.760
 and yesterday was the first right one 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.239
 training now at these two weeks 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.129
 again now just a first round 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.769
 but, of course, see what happens shortly 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:03.220
 I'm afraid to let him go 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:06.310
 Step through and parry 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.690
 he would be at rest without pressure now 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.700
 here at the second round you can see 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.950
 lattice also totally open when wanting 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.600
 do nothing anymore 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.869
 at the beginning here always nice very 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.640
 operate with the diligent working pace 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.250
 try a good connection to the mouth 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.200
 produce and drive in evenly 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.580
 allow 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.520
 I think that's something nice here 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.520
 tough to compare to the last or 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.770
 especially to the initial videos 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.990
 that he is much more relaxed here 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.000
 on the diagonal america really 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.590
 seen beautiful swinging Switzerland 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.820
 this is always a sign for me 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.740
 film satisfied horse and that too 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.440
 Neck is much better, I think 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.780
 so it's really close to the 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.230
 vertical can sometimes even further 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.510
 before and only rarely really much too 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.970
 So talk that comes just in gallop 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.100
 even before the right hand but here in the 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.920
 trot I think that's already 53 it drives 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.080
 very well then what, of course 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.920
 So it happened a bit long 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.470
 The frame is currently expanding 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.090
 rather , the garage is everything 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.760
 a little eggs and that is now 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.010
 of course longer but it is in 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.110
 order 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.700
 I prefer it as a cramped one 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.730
 Engelbert walker comes to another 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.700
 also fast 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.680
 by and here in the blog on the right 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.049
 that it is still his difficult task 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.810
 side and just one believed that me 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.890
 Hard you can see very deep and 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.920
 too tight 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.370
 but what I have to say is the gallop jump 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.200
 in itself is probably not quite so 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.849
 tamped in the ground as well on the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.330
 right looks a bit like this 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.879
 but right here on the left I was totally 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.670
 surprised yesterday because so good 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.069
 I think never gallops am 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.709
 the neck I liked it super good 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.209
 was already possible above and me 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.310
 could also always super good 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.629
 For example, paint with 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.299
 Both hands and he has that great 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:11.359
 assumed has stayed nice with me 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:14.690
 and has the movement forward beautiful 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.790
 taken by around which went even 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.280
 I had better deal with that 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.019
 a gallop would do it all 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.670
 a bit spongier but that has 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.530
 worked well and also very nice with me 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.569
 and also relatively straight one more 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.130
 picture are bad but their second 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.220
 long side was actually right 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.930
 good and will gallop so nicely 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.389
 is only two three rounds I with the 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.769
 Come away then that I can 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.349
 actually be good and the 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.389
 easy sits and that one more 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.370
 gallop less free because that is 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:48.919
 his education stood for his age 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.200
 absolutely sufficient in my opinion 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:54.769
 I need then not set 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.260
 worth and not totally constant in the 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.130
 application 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.510
 Yesterday I have one too 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.459
 made third extend a bit 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.000
 In between , you can see the same 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.829
 I like my long side too 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.750
 pretty good especially what i like very well 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.750
 like that he is from neck gentleman 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.549
 The hand pulls it forward nicely 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.039
 is exactly the reaction and I have 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.500
 want that he pushed and developed 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.299
 he wants to pull in front and he has good 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.300
 made 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:26.840
 I am about 25 minutes and 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.360
 have him then as always nice on 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.250
 let loose long reins must falls 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.890
 he takes it well that he always takes great 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.990
 you can already see that met 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.860
 then clearly freer and clear 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.259
 has more room handle 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.740
 can I have taken to him 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:45.689
 but you can feel free to contact me 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.340
 like to comment on your opinion 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:54.509
 Just watch the video like you 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:56.360
 I will find it quite well so that was 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:58.650
 the training of yesterday 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.740
 I am one has nothing left of this 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.159
 seen shorter 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:09.020
 and yes soon there will be something from us again 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:09.020
