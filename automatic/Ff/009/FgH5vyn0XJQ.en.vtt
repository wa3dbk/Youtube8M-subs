trying<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.840> keep<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.109> from<00:00:31.260> rolling<00:00:32.120> and<00:00:33.120> I'm

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
trying to keep it from rolling and I'm

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.549 
trying to keep it from rolling and I'm
not<00:00:33.390> going<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.630> make<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.780> no<00:00:33.989> higher<00:00:34.200> than<00:00:34.230> that

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
not going to make it no higher than that

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.290 
not going to make it no higher than that
if<00:00:34.770> i<00:00:34.890> needed<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.340> go<00:00:35.370> higher<00:00:35.670> throw<00:00:36.090> some

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
if i needed to go higher throw some

if i needed to go higher throw some
block<00:00:36.570> under<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:36.989> because<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.800> may<00:00:37.950> be<00:00:38.480> may<00:00:39.480> one

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
block under it because it may be may one

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:49.639 
block under it because it may be may one
it<00:00:39.809> low<00:00:39.989> I'm<00:00:40.739> not<00:00:40.920> sure<00:00:40.980> yet<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:48.500> besides<00:00:49.500> that

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
it low I'm not sure yet but besides that

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.270 
it low I'm not sure yet but besides that

syrup<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:02.039> year<00:01:02.340> anyhow<00:01:03.059> because<00:01:03.690> I've<00:01:03.930> been

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
syrup this year anyhow because I've been

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.969 
syrup this year anyhow because I've been
collected<00:01:04.409> all<00:01:04.890> year<00:01:05.299> since<00:01:06.299> october

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
collected all year since october

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.010 
collected all year since october
november<00:01:07.979> other<00:01:08.840> probably<00:01:09.840> could<00:01:09.990> have

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
november other probably could have

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.899 
november other probably could have
collected<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.680> looked<00:01:10.830> over<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:16.580> have<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
collected it and looked over I have the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.990 
collected it and looked over I have the
top<00:01:18.540> cut<00:01:18.810> out<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.229> cut<00:01:20.220> their<00:01:20.400> own<00:01:20.430> circle

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
top cut out of it cut their own circle

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.460 
top cut out of it cut their own circle
out<00:01:22.520> mid<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.700> late<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.360> was<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> inside<00:01:25.140> this

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
out mid to late this was the inside this

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.539 
out mid to late this was the inside this
part<00:01:25.850> you<00:01:26.850> see<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.570> concave<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.280> at

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
part you see it's concave and it's at

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.620 
part you see it's concave and it's at
the<00:01:29.700> other<00:01:29.820> way<00:01:30.030> because<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.299> was<00:01:30.420> an<00:01:30.509> old

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the other way because it was an old

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.609 
the other way because it was an old
water<00:01:30.869> tank<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.990> there's<00:01:34.110> no<00:01:34.229> water<00:01:34.439> would

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
water tank and so there's no water would

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.609 
water tank and so there's no water would
sit<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> bottom<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:36.229> guess<00:01:37.229> that's<00:01:37.470> why

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
sit on the bottom I guess that's why

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.200 
sit on the bottom I guess that's why
they<00:01:37.770> made<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.340> way<00:01:40.009> but<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.060> see

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
they made it that way but you can see

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.889 
they made it that way but you can see
the<00:01:42.329> other<00:01:42.479> side<00:01:44.149> this<00:01:45.149> was<00:01:45.299> actually<00:01:45.479> twice

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
the other side this was actually twice

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.039 
the other side this was actually twice
the<00:01:46.110> size<00:01:46.290> at<00:01:46.530> one<00:01:46.649> time<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.329> cut<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.420> off<00:01:48.570> use<00:01:48.840> it

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the size at one time I cut it off use it

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.350 
the size at one time I cut it off use it
as<00:01:49.140> an<00:01:49.290> air<00:01:49.439> tank<00:01:50.299> used<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.720> while<00:01:51.899> and

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
as an air tank used it for a while and

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.789 
as an air tank used it for a while and
didn't<00:01:54.360> need<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.570> anymore<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:57.469> got<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.590> hinge

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
didn't need it anymore I got the hinge

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.440 
didn't need it anymore I got the hinge
set<00:01:59.070> up<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.549> also

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.859 

I<00:02:03.159> have<00:02:04.159> to<00:02:04.280> cut<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.490> flew<00:02:04.759> on<00:02:04.939> it<00:02:05.060> yet<00:02:05.240> jumpin

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
I have to cut it flew on it yet jumpin

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.569 
I have to cut it flew on it yet jumpin
87<00:02:06.350> is<00:02:06.439> because<00:02:06.680> they've<00:02:06.770> got<00:02:06.890> 7-inch<00:02:07.340> pipe

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
87 is because they've got 7-inch pipe

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:13.180 
87 is because they've got 7-inch pipe
and<00:02:10.000> cut<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.120> top<00:02:11.360> off<00:02:11.569> or<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.110> side<00:02:12.379> up<00:02:12.590> well

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
and cut the top off or the side up well

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.430 
and cut the top off or the side up well
I<00:02:13.220> guess<00:02:13.459> actually<00:02:13.670> this<00:02:13.910> top<00:02:14.269> not<00:02:15.099> because<00:02:16.099> I

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
I guess actually this top not because I

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.640 
I guess actually this top not because I
want<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.470> put<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.680> quarter<00:02:19.190> inch<00:02:19.900> or<00:02:20.900> 316

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
want to put that quarter inch or 316

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.940 
want to put that quarter inch or 316
still<00:02:21.980> played<00:02:22.280> on<00:02:22.489> it<00:02:23.650> should<00:02:24.650> be<00:02:24.739> big<00:02:24.920> enough

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
still played on it should be big enough

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.620 
still played on it should be big enough
to<00:02:25.250> hold<00:02:25.340> three<00:02:25.700> large<00:02:26.269> pots<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:28.480> don't<00:02:29.480> think

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
to hold three large pots I don't think

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.089 
to hold three large pots I don't think
I'll<00:02:29.750> make<00:02:29.780> any<00:02:30.049> bigger<00:02:30.290> than<00:02:30.410> that<00:02:30.500> if<00:02:30.769> I<00:02:30.890> do<00:02:30.950> a

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
I'll make any bigger than that if I do a

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.820 
I'll make any bigger than that if I do a
lot<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.400> build<00:02:31.580> something<00:02:31.879> bigger<00:02:32.120> later<00:02:32.830> but

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
lot to build something bigger later but

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.700 
lot to build something bigger later but
this<00:02:33.860> year<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:34.280> should<00:02:34.340> do<00:02:34.670> it
