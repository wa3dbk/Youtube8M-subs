over salted a little bit of all sorted

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.870 
over salted a little bit of all sorted
not<00:01:28.860> too<00:01:29.070> much<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.920> since<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.280> boiled<00:01:32.549> water

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
not too much so since it's boiled water

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.380 
not too much so since it's boiled water
you<00:01:33.270> come<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.630> boil<00:01:33.840> soon<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:36.240> final

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
you come to boil soon and the final

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.569 
you come to boil soon and the final
stage<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.729> adding<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> rise<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.420> this

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
stage is in adding on the rise to this

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:47.389 
stage is in adding on the rise to this
at<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:42.030> stage<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.659> add<00:01:42.950> lemon<00:01:45.799> to<00:01:46.799> big

sized<00:01:47.670> lemon<00:01:48.149> juice<00:01:49.159> juice<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:02.100> slemon<00:02:02.520> is

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
sized lemon juice juice so slemon is

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.380 
sized lemon juice juice so slemon is
quite<00:02:03.030> essential<00:02:03.420> because<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.829> keeps<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.610> lick

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
quite essential because it keeps a lick

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.650 
quite essential because it keeps a lick
on<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:07.680> rice<00:02:08.360> you<00:02:09.360> know
