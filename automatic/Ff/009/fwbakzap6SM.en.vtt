00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
is a knife based multi-tool and have a

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.950 
is a knife based multi-tool and have a
Leatherman<00:00:17.520> here<00:00:17.699> which<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.390> player<00:00:18.660> based

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
Leatherman here which is a player based

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.230 
Leatherman here which is a player based
multi-tool<00:00:19.560> now<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.430> main<00:00:20.730> difference<00:00:21.119> is

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
multi-tool now the main difference is

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.759 
multi-tool now the main difference is
like<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.750> said<00:00:21.960> are<00:00:22.109> they<00:00:22.230> or<00:00:22.380> what<00:00:22.619> they're

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
like I said are they or what they're

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.099 
like I said are they or what they're
based<00:00:22.949> on<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.820> main<00:00:24.119> tool<00:00:24.510> at<00:00:24.720> least<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:24.990> my

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
based on the main tool at least in my

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.259 
based on the main tool at least in my
opinion<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.650> Swiss<00:00:25.890> Army<00:00:26.039> knife<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:27.029> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
opinion on a Swiss Army knife is the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.080 
opinion on a Swiss Army knife is the
main<00:00:27.449> blade<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:28.590> know<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:29.310> cuts<00:00:29.580> pretty<00:00:29.820> well

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
main blade you know it cuts pretty well

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.420 
main blade you know it cuts pretty well
its<00:00:30.570> large<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.199> mean<00:00:31.380> it's<00:00:31.800> more<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.219> knife

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
its large I mean it's more of a knife

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
have you know let's look on the smaller

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.590 
have you know let's look on the smaller
secondary<00:03:36.220> knife<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.790> you'd<00:03:37.000> still<00:03:37.150> be<00:03:37.299> under

10 ounces you know so I mean all

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.350 
10 ounces you know so I mean all
something<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.769> considered<00:03:42.190> are<00:03:42.580> these<00:03:42.940> is

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
something that considered are these is

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.979 
something that considered are these is
either<00:03:43.480> one<00:03:43.750> good<00:03:43.989> or<00:03:44.110> bad<00:03:44.260> no<00:03:44.830> but<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.870> know
