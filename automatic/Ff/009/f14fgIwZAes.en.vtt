water um then I let my hair dry and when
I<00:05:02.520> use<00:05:02.700> the<00:05:02.729> deep<00:05:03.030> conditioner<00:05:03.510> I'll<00:05:03.720> put<00:05:04.020> it

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
I use the deep conditioner I'll put it

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.350 
I use the deep conditioner I'll put it
on<00:05:04.410> dry<00:05:04.860> hair<00:05:04.889> because<00:05:05.550> it<00:05:05.729> absorbs<00:05:05.910> way

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
on dry hair because it absorbs way

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.240 
on dry hair because it absorbs way
better<00:05:06.600> like<00:05:07.139> if<00:05:07.320> you<00:05:07.470> ever<00:05:07.500> use<00:05:07.950> a<00:05:07.979> deep

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
better like if you ever use a deep

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.310 
better like if you ever use a deep
conditioner<00:05:08.460> um<00:05:09.030> compare<00:05:09.780> it<00:05:09.810> to<00:05:09.990> one<00:05:10.139> at<00:05:10.229> your

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
conditioner um compare it to one at your

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.290 
conditioner um compare it to one at your
heads<00:05:10.590> wet<00:05:10.889> and<00:05:11.040> then<00:05:11.100> your<00:05:11.250> hair's<00:05:11.580> dry<00:05:11.850> and

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
heads wet and then your hair's dry and

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.050 
heads wet and then your hair's dry and
you'll<00:05:12.960> get<00:05:13.110> the<00:05:13.200> best<00:05:13.500> effect<00:05:14.040> on<00:05:14.310> your<00:05:14.760> hair

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.490 
you'll get the best effect on your hair

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
is on your heads drive because it

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.440 
is on your heads drive because it
absorbs<00:05:16.710> into<00:05:17.160> your<00:05:17.340> hair<00:05:17.550> more<00:05:17.729> whereas<00:05:18.419> if

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
your hair's wet it kind of like runs off

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.909
