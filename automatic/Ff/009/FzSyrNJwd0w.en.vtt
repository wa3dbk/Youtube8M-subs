00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
he comes up to the surface you kind of

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.240 
he comes up to the surface you kind of
reel<00:04:47.840> through<00:04:48.110> it<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:48.470> just<00:04:48.620> kind<00:04:48.800> of<00:04:48.830> drag

then when it hits out there I'll try to
let<00:05:26.099> out<00:05:26.280> a<00:05:26.310> bunch<00:05:26.550> of<00:05:26.699> line<00:05:26.849> and<00:05:27.030> then<00:05:27.150> I'm

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
let out a bunch of line and then I'm

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.600 
let out a bunch of line and then I'm
gonna<00:05:27.389> watch<00:05:27.569> well<00:05:28.500> I<00:05:28.530> want<00:05:28.889> the<00:05:28.979> bait<00:05:29.190> to<00:05:29.370> fall

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
gonna watch well I want the bait to fall

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.879 
gonna watch well I want the bait to fall
almost<00:05:30.419> vertical<00:05:31.169> where<00:05:31.319> it<00:05:31.410> landed<00:05:31.770> out

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
almost vertical where it landed out

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.879 
almost vertical where it landed out
there<00:05:32.599> so<00:05:33.599> if<00:05:33.660> it<00:05:33.750> takes<00:05:33.990> up<00:05:34.139> on<00:05:34.259> my<00:05:34.380> slack<00:05:34.650> I'll

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
there so if it takes up on my slack I'll

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.719 
there so if it takes up on my slack I'll
open<00:05:35.160> my<00:05:35.220> reel<00:05:37.039> let<00:05:38.039> it<00:05:38.160> take<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:38.430> rest<00:05:38.580> of

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
open my reel let it take the rest of

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.060 
open my reel let it take the rest of
slack<00:05:38.940> till<00:05:39.120> I<00:05:39.180> know<00:05:39.240> it's<00:05:39.479> on<00:05:39.599> the<00:05:39.690> bottom<00:05:40.070> and

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
slack till I know it's on the bottom and

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.290 
slack till I know it's on the bottom and
essentially<00:05:41.520> the<00:05:41.610> way<00:05:41.639> you<00:05:41.759> know<00:05:41.940> it's<00:05:42.090> on<00:05:42.210> the

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
essentially the way you know it's on the

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.999 
essentially the way you know it's on the
bottom<00:05:42.599> is<00:05:42.720> your<00:05:43.050> line<00:05:43.289> I'll<00:05:43.440> just<00:05:43.560> lay<00:05:43.740> limp

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
bottom is your line I'll just lay limp

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:49.040 
bottom is your line I'll just lay limp
on<00:05:44.160> the<00:05:44.250> water<00:05:46.759> and<00:05:47.759> so<00:05:48.060> I<00:05:48.090> mean<00:05:48.539> I<00:05:48.630> find<00:05:48.900> these

on the water and so I mean I find these

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.890 
on the water and so I mean I find these
places<00:05:49.259> where<00:05:49.650> these<00:05:49.770> fish<00:05:50.070> get<00:05:50.310> grouped<00:05:50.550> up

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
places where these fish get grouped up

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.529 
places where these fish get grouped up
