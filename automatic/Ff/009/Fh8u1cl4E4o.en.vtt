end it you know you know reality TV is
all<00:01:30.180> about<00:01:30.360> drama<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.930> they're<00:01:31.170> not<00:01:31.320> really

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
all about drama so they're not really

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.170 
all about drama so they're not really
that<00:01:31.860> interested<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.340> all<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.579> get<00:01:32.729> nice<00:01:32.909> stuff

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
that interested in all to get nice stuff

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.700 
that interested in all to get nice stuff
so<00:01:33.390> we<00:01:33.540> they<00:01:33.689> usually<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:34.110> cut<00:01:34.259> right<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.500> it

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
so we they usually just cut right to it

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.800 
so we they usually just cut right to it
so<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.280> guys<00:01:35.400> never<00:01:35.729> really<00:01:35.909> see<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> whole

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
so you guys never really see the whole

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.039 
so you guys never really see the whole
