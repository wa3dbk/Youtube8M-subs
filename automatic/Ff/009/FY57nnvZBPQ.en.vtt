wait so there I open it so the first

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.520 
wait so there I open it so the first
code<00:00:33.780> came<00:00:34.170> with<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:38.660> Omnitrix<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:39.899> here

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
code came with the the Omnitrix so here

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.410 
code came with the the Omnitrix so here
it<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:40.950> 1<00:00:41.309> 1<00:00:41.340> 2<00:00:42.000> 3<00:00:42.270> 4<00:00:43.020> 5<00:00:43.579> so<00:00:44.579> here<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:44.940> 1<00:00:45.390> 1

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
it is it's 1 1 2 3 4 5 so here it's 1 1

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.779 
it is it's 1 1 2 3 4 5 so here it's 1 1
2<00:00:45.989> 3<00:00:46.260> 4<00:00:46.710> 5<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:49.920> as<00:00:50.039> I'm<00:00:50.219> saying<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.610> are

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
2 3 4 5 so it's as I'm saying you are

2 3 4 5 so it's as I'm saying you are
great<00:00:51.180> potential<00:00:51.960> young<00:00:52.140> generation<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.730> that

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
great potential young generation so that

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.700 
great potential young generation so that
is<00:00:54.239> code<00:00:54.480> number<00:00:54.719> one<00:00:54.840> if<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.079> think<00:00:55.289> catch<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
is code number one if you think catch it

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:05.660 
is code number one if you think catch it
the<00:00:55.980> first<00:00:56.010> time<00:00:56.309> is<00:01:00.649> 1<00:01:01.649> 1<00:01:01.920> 2<00:01:02.160> 3<00:01:02.399> 4<00:01:02.730> 5<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:04.369> that<00:01:05.369> is

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the first time is 1 1 2 3 4 5 so that is

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.520 
the first time is 1 1 2 3 4 5 so that is
code<00:01:05.909> number<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:06.420> now<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.659> code<00:01:07.020> number<00:01:07.290> two

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
code number one now for code number two

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.789 
code number one now for code number two
I<00:01:07.799> found<00:01:08.280> somewhere<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.180> internet<00:01:09.799> Thank

Internet<00:01:16.049> again<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.040> code<00:01:17.520> number<00:01:17.759> 2<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.060> 5<00:01:18.299> 6<00:01:18.750> C

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
Internet again so code number 2 is 5 6 C

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:27.499 
Internet again so code number 2 is 5 6 C
2<00:01:19.860> 1<00:01:20.220> 7<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:24.799> it's<00:01:25.799> asthma<00:01:26.700> saying<00:01:27.270> they're

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
2 1 7 so it's asthma saying they're

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.440 
2 1 7 so it's asthma saying they're
universally<00:01:28.380> Jack<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:29.009> won't<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.850> so

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
universally Jack you won't like you so

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.240 
universally Jack you won't like you so
that<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.900> code<00:01:31.439> number<00:01:31.740> 2<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.070> didn't

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
that is code number 2 if you didn't

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.210 
that is code number 2 if you didn't
catch<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.430> again<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> first<00:01:33.150> time<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:34.110> 5<00:01:34.470> 6<00:01:34.920> C

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
catch it again the first time it's 5 6 C

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:44.780 
catch it again the first time it's 5 6 C

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
2 1 7 so that is code number 2 now this

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.450 
2 1 7 so that is code number 2 now this
is<00:01:45.000> my<00:01:45.210> out<00:01:45.450> right<00:01:45.810> now<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.890> part<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.280> would
