00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.949
 while sébastien turin discovered even if you know it before this 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:05.500
 new 908 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.100
 do not you know how you judged him the first day I had him 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.899
 really discovered 

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:12.899
 well in fact quite a car that is 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:18.929
 m on the landing in visual like that relatively close to the 908 although 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:19.990
 we lost a lot of horses 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.249
 in Cairo have been much reworked 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.789
 in reality when we ride in for its part the cockpit which is very 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.439
 close 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.259
 there is really not much more in common 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.679
 the fact that we have a roughly four rear tires on the car has changed 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:35.880
 normally the feeling in the back 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.790
 car is much more centered the day before yesterday a little bit more specific to 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.460
 read you 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.120
 but much more radical 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.080
 - endurance spirit 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.740
 we follow the lineage I would say the current is to say that but more and more 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.400
 in a 24-hour sprint that 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.330
 Norman durance as we knew it a few years ago 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.620
 and no longer two-way the c5 mediately draveil% and very 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.880
 concentrated 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.020
 a lot of formats will not be easy even if turkey is made 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.350
 to win simply in case of publication by his absence to this 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.430
 famous dorsal that characterizes it 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.220
 it feels like it changes a lot of things 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.210
 regulatory marcel in just c 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.860
 it's a short test of making sure that cars 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.860
 renault flies away as we saw with mark hurd 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.850
 the banks 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.900
 because it will be enough I do not know 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.030
 a steering of the sound dispute with his part it takes it is not something 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.960
 we feel that we can really feel if we have a big side wind 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.380
 as in the mistral oka solar 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.159
 otherwise it's not something very sensitive I did a lot of sessions 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.130
 test 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.840
 there are also many more that are planned 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.840
 I made 316 car 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.900
 in May already expect quite a lot of 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.190
 two different terrains 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.780
 she's behaving pretty well and basically for tire work that has 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.820
 been engaged because necessarily the fact of passing rear tires in front 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.980
 it took king develop plans 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.810
 rain 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.910
 since mid-June this permanent way 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.720
 behind even though it's a little new bakai still has a lot 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.540
 known data 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.149
 and even fat about work now is 5% feminization 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.549
 so this year 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.299
 Peugeot plays the championship here at one of his 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.169
 I was wondering so heavily everyone else go right do other 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.599
 races like that by the way in fact you're a few to do 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.400
 practically all and it is in any case that he does 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.459
 almost all 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.179
 is it for you something very doubtful very positive 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:28.109
 see it's something very positive because it means two 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.899
 years now trust 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:34.059
 to do this by meeting months the 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:36.549
 to keep the commitments 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.060
 among the other winners it works more in the continuity of 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:43.980
 knowing the car better is a nice thing and% va 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:45.489
 it's necessarily motivating 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.489
 the club has now see how it's going to go but it's true that 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:52.939
 the savate even hired at home to have more eager to be in a big 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.969
 championship that the blues to be a little 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:57.459
 a free electron that beats to 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.049
 from one race to another from one crew to another marseille it's still 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.359
 Easier to manage when you know the car better etc 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.529
 and the way it's going and it's always nicer it's a good 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:09.310
 thing in the championship ilmc it looks like 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.379
 actually already a small world championship 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.400
 here is a small world championship in sailing 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.620
 if we do not have the name because it's not labeled but it's true it's 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.349
 something that stuck who I hope is called to 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.219
 the world 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.619
 a true international dimension we have 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:27.189
 only in part it is sl hebrew to better play for them 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.289
 builders to a very important point 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:31.819
 little problem they are part of it 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.339
 right now 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:36.349
 to just look at it then we learned recently that she could 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.909
 maybe come to the united states this time in hindi 40 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.699
 how much do you think you were staggering before you go there 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:43.679
 really 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:45.530
 I would say it's fifty-fifty 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.319
 since now the breakage went well the beautiful really want that 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.509
 it's done 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:51.820
 but me too 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.009
 but I will do 6% and the right people in the right place 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:58.299
 and there are still three key people missing in the organization of 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.379
 two o'clock 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.669
 now it's up to him to go hunting 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:03.529
 100 head service 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:06.439
 he is looking for a driver in the road circuits and no question of values ​​he 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:10.019
 is not about the wave cssa not hide too much with endurance 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.289
 that is, at the complicated logistical level of 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:15.979
 from Europe and it's true that I do not have the ambition to stay in 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.169
 one year united states 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.820
 to gaillac is a little word on simon benjamin implied that what is it 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:23.650
 what you can tell us about him and your teammate 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.700
 there he will be your teammate again at the 24 hours of mans I answer a 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.699
 pair with simon and perotti works extremely well 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.789
 abassi madani 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.719
 pedro May 6 but simon especially because but when 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:37.900
 even a lot of stuff together you have 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.900
 it's someone I really appreciate 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.229
 has this desire and ambition to do something 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:48.460
 so we won this few years 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.080
 that's a good way 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.770
 maybe not won is going very well but if we won two 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.990
 it only makes 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.469
 so a year ago I think that 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:59.259
 more seriously eh we have three teams 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.120
 13-month-old genes who understands very well ours 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.949
 our father is still very 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.129
 very complementary 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:09.539
 but there's no need to compromise at the set-up level would 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.650
 always the most remote the most difficult and the most delicate 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.969
 and so we have very optimized crew teams for 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:18.889
 we saw last year at the performance level we had something for 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:19.949
 This meeting 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.699
 everyone is extremely happy with the car she has now 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.210
 I hope that will still be the case 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.169
 this year in 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.120
 in this version of the 908
