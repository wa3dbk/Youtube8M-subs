00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.600
 tutorial to know how to get on 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.160
 the terminal plane so there is not bad 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.430
 on youtube 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.559
 but this this tutorial here I think they 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.510
 could you be very helpful because 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.789
 just after I want to finally show the 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.460
 joystick to show you how I 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.290
 so shows sorry 1 for videos 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.280
 than boss right now but 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.260
 I receive my case Tuesday which she 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.760
 try as I told you but 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.240
 that there will be a lot of videos that 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.900
 are going out 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.000
 so there we see the controller so 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.370
 I listen to you and so I call it 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.440
 tactics him because in fact we're going 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.440
 make a hub with the left stick 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.320
 here it is I will shoot and here we will do 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.990
 we're going to jump then we'll do a put 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.190
 so do not worry, I'll go back to you 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.430
 and so I will try to you 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.880
 explain a little better so we at the 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.870
 controller 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.950
 so we hang against the part 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.470
 invisible actually is there we will jump on 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.710
 going to do a nude so the u will do it 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.119
 with the left stick but we're going 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.600
 from the right to do it 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.630
 but while being doing by the 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.420
 right we jump so it's a little bit 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.790
 complicated to explain like that and I 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.170
 had a lot of people I was doing like that 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.890
 when he explained like that and I 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.630
 wanted a little camera that's that 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.220
 I put for you to see 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.850
 so feel free to pause 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.110
 for well look well so we're fine 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.730
 looking at you, we are getting under 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:32.090
 from here and there we do the tactics of the ppu 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.340
 now look here that's it 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.400
 pass quickly so train you well in 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.980
 private one 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.480
 after you can do his ultimate in 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.390
 affected why so the video is 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:50.030

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.030
