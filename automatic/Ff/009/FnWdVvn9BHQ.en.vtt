00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:21.779
 is to sin in the sap nephews oxy 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:26.039
 I think the argument is even for 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.039
 Tattoo if these things 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:36.550
 there are a certain earring earrings are already 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.730
 piercings widely accepted by 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.730
 society 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:54.510
 There are people who do it in the ears of 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:01:02.950
 girls practically babies and I accept 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:07.840
 nor the questioned is sin is not sin 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:12.520
 so do now if you do a good 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:16.689
 Are you from Mozambique in the jungle? 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:21.130
 Then you 'll stick everything there, huh? 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:25.959
 if you're from a tribe you know those 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:30.369
 which opens opens to the lip and puts a plate 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:39.340
 or something like that and it is not sin 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:42.429
 sin is the social one that neither wear makeup 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:47.490
 The shaving head hair or paint 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.490
 purple is kind of crazy right 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:02:01.120
 then thing is I see many Christians is 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.160
 Who has a tattoo, I do not see many 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.740
 Christians with piercing do not know those 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.600
 things all so what the 20 holes in the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.420
 I ear lab's weird huh 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:20.380
 the language does not even say that the language is 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:23.020
 anti hygienic that more and more in 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.820
 good taste is good taste 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.459
 something that is not discussed today, right? 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.489
 regrets but do not listen I think it is 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.630
 a matter of taste and of a certain 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:38.709
 social convention for people who walk 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:43.590
 many tribes in our country where they are 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.590
 more accepted and influence of this, right? 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:53.320
 I do not think we can use a law that does not 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.340
 we can absurdly use something 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.750
 like this 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.370
 a person entered our church of 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.560
 confidence and will not be treated in a 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.320
 different and will not be deleted will not 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.049
 That's how the young man came to me and said 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.730
 I want to do it well. Think about it. 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:15.310
 about this, do not you? 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:18.010
 I hear here on my fiancÃ©e there the thing is 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.340
 just that everyone here is look at 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.650
 You realize you're this to me, it 's a 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.630
 way to call the person if you avoid being 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:32.799
 tries to be acceptable in this way. 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:37.739
 some way I would not recommend now 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.739
 is not no sin is no sin
