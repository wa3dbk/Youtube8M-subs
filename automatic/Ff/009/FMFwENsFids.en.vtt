it<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.710> personally<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.610> another<00:00:47.940> solution

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
it I personally in another solution

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.500 
it I personally in another solution
something<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.110> make<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.289> happen<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.329> this<00:00:51.329> is

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
something to make it happen so this is

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.450 
something to make it happen so this is
the<00:00:51.629> little<00:00:51.750> rig<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.500> I've<00:00:52.590> adopted<00:00:52.860> off<00:00:53.190> gas

the little rig that I've adopted off gas

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.330 
the little rig that I've adopted off gas
it's<00:00:54.090> very<00:00:54.629> similar<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.649> concept<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
it's very similar to the concept of the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.660 
it's very similar to the concept of the
360<00:00:57.000> however<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.930> 360<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.620> very<00:00:58.920> dangerous<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
360 however the 360 is very dangerous it

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.520 
360 however the 360 is very dangerous it
gets<00:00:59.879> caught<00:01:00.390> up<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.719> then<00:01:00.809> there<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.230> tears

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
gets caught up in then there it tears

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.380 
gets caught up in then there it tears

through<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.079> front<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> eye<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.189> then

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
through the front of the eye and then

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.190 
through the front of the eye and then
whip<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.909> knotless<00:01:42.180> knot<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.600> normal<00:01:43.020> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
whip the knotless knot as normal and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.539 
whip the knotless knot as normal and
then<00:01:43.290> come<00:01:43.560> back<00:01:43.590> through<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> back<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
then come back through the back of the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.120 
then come back through the back of the
eye<00:01:44.579> towards<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> point<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.829> start

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
eye towards the point so it's the start

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.760 
eye towards the point so it's the start
of<00:01:47.250> its<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.610> reverse<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.840> end<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.380> you

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
of its in reverse so you end up as you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.450 
of its in reverse so you end up as you
can<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.659> with<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.979> material<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> inside

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
can see with the material on the inside

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.510 
can see with the material on the inside
the<00:01:54.420> next<00:01:54.720> job<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.320> most<00:01:55.500> complicated<00:01:55.979> job

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the next job is the most complicated job

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.280 
the next job is the most complicated job
basically<00:01:57.180> what<00:01:57.719> we're<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.110> doing

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
basically what we're going to be doing

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.370 
basically what we're going to be doing
is<00:01:58.619> adding<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.610> supernatural<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.689> IQ<00:02:00.899> I've

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
is adding the supernatural to IQ I've

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.080 
is adding the supernatural to IQ I've
used<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.950> IQ<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.790> fact<00:02:02.939> that

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
used the IQ I like the fact that

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.429 
used the IQ I like the fact that
obviously<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> fluorocarbon<00:02:04.140> it's

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
obviously it's a fluorocarbon it's

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.219 
obviously it's a fluorocarbon it's
invisible<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.880> 15<00:02:06.240> pounds<00:02:06.570> quite<00:02:06.750> supple

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
invisible and the 15 pounds quite supple

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.680 
invisible and the 15 pounds quite supple
so<00:02:07.380> even<00:02:07.649> though<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:09.000> know<00:02:09.030> stiff

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
so even though it's you know stiff

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.750 
so even though it's you know stiff
enough<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.110> keep<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.890> hooklink<00:02:11.099> away<00:02:11.520> from

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
enough to keep the hooklink away from

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.000 
enough to keep the hooklink away from
the<00:02:11.819> LED<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.120> stopped<00:02:12.360> angles<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:13.140> also

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
the LED and stopped angles it's also

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.649 
the LED and stopped angles it's also
after<00:02:14.250> take<00:02:14.430> up<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.700> contours<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.299> bottom

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
after take up the contours of the bottom

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.839 
after take up the contours of the bottom
so<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.140> gives<00:02:16.319> you<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.530> bit<00:02:16.709> of<00:02:16.739> versatility<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
so it gives you a bit of versatility the

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.640 
so it gives you a bit of versatility the
not<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.269> you<00:02:18.360> using<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:19.049> something<00:02:19.500> called

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
not that you using is something called

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.440 
not that you using is something called
the<00:02:19.980> Albright<00:02:20.310> knot<00:02:20.519> it's<00:02:20.730> actually<00:02:21.180> really

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
the Albright knot it's actually really

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.119 
the Albright knot it's actually really
really<00:02:21.720> easy<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.500> do<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.739> looks<00:02:22.920> quite

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
really easy to do it looks quite

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.470 
really easy to do it looks quite
complicated<00:02:23.549> but<00:02:23.879> what<00:02:23.939> you<00:02:24.120> do<00:02:24.269> is<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.450> make

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
complicated but what you do is you make

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.119 
complicated but what you do is you make
a<00:02:24.629> loop<00:02:24.959> at<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.230> end<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.650> fluorocarbon

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
a loop at the end of the fluorocarbon

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.530 
a loop at the end of the fluorocarbon
fold<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.730> back<00:02:26.849> on<00:02:27.000> itself<00:02:27.269> so<00:02:27.420> you've<00:02:27.510> just

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
fold it back on itself so you've just

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.780 
fold it back on itself so you've just
pinching<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.290> loop<00:02:28.470> in<00:02:28.590> your<00:02:28.739> hands<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.159> then

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
pinching a loop in your hands and then

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.240 
pinching a loop in your hands and then
simply<00:02:30.329> you<00:02:30.810> feed<00:02:31.260> them<00:02:31.500> supernatural

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
simply you feed them supernatural

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.770 
simply you feed them supernatural
through<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.730> loop<00:02:32.909> and<00:02:33.120> then<00:02:33.269> wrap<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.569> around

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
through the loop and then wrap it around

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.899 
through the loop and then wrap it around
the<00:02:34.230> body<00:02:34.409> of<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.739> loop<00:02:34.890> seven<00:02:35.370> times<00:02:35.640> and

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
the body of the loop seven times and

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.059 
the body of the loop seven times and
then<00:02:36.299> ensure<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.049> put<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.349> tag<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:37.769> back

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
then ensure you put the tag in back

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.220 
then ensure you put the tag in back
through<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:39.000> top<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.540> loop<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.989> same

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
through the top of the loop the same

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.050 
through the top of the loop the same
direction<00:02:40.500> as<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.069> hooks<00:02:41.459> coming<00:02:41.819> through

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
direction as the hooks coming through

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.210 
direction as the hooks coming through
and<00:02:42.299> then<00:02:42.690> all<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:43.019> do<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.260> just<00:02:43.620> gingerly

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
and then all you do is just gingerly

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.069 
and then all you do is just gingerly
work<00:02:44.549> that<00:02:44.849> knocked<00:02:45.090> down<00:02:45.299> it's<00:02:45.359> really<00:02:45.900> easy

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
work that knocked down it's really easy

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.470 
work that knocked down it's really easy
to<00:02:46.200> do<00:02:46.440> just<00:02:46.470> work<00:02:46.829> it<00:02:47.040> down<00:02:47.310> wet<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.329> and

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
to do just work it down wet it and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.140 
to do just work it down wet it and
ensure<00:02:49.019> it<00:02:49.349> all<00:02:49.500> bunches<00:02:49.950> up<00:02:50.129> neatly<00:02:50.459> isn't

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
ensure it all bunches up neatly isn't

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.819 
ensure it all bunches up neatly isn't
sort<00:02:51.299> of<00:02:51.329> tangled<00:02:51.780> up<00:02:51.959> or<00:02:52.200> cutting<00:02:52.590> into

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
sort of tangled up or cutting into

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.890 
sort of tangled up or cutting into
itself<00:02:53.129> and<00:02:53.459> then<00:02:53.790> just<00:02:54.000> slowly<00:02:54.180> draw<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.690> down

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
itself and then just slowly draw it down

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.869 
itself and then just slowly draw it down
pull<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.680> tight<00:02:55.920> with<00:02:56.099> a<00:02:56.159> puller<00:02:56.370> tool<00:02:56.639> and

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
pull it tight with a puller tool and

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.539 
pull it tight with a puller tool and
you've<00:02:57.030> got<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.209> perfect<00:02:57.930> pervy<00:02:58.440> combi<00:02:59.310> rig

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
you've got a perfect pervy combi rig

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.180 
you've got a perfect pervy combi rig
it's<00:02:59.849> all<00:03:00.030> up<00:03:00.389> together<00:03:00.629> lovely<00:03:01.590> looks<00:03:02.040> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
it's all up together lovely looks the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.640 
it's all up together lovely looks the
nuts<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:03.030> basically<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.930> pull<00:03:04.109> that<00:03:04.260> nice<00:03:04.440> and

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
nuts so basically I pull that nice and

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.190 
nuts so basically I pull that nice and
tight<00:03:05.299> and<00:03:06.299> then<00:03:06.420> just<00:03:06.629> a<00:03:06.750> little<00:03:06.989> bit<00:03:07.109> of

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
tight and then just a little bit of

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.500 
tight and then just a little bit of
putty<00:03:07.409> over<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.010> top<00:03:08.250> now<00:03:08.609> what<00:03:08.940> when<00:03:09.389> I'm

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
putty over the top now what when I'm

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.809 
putty over the top now what when I'm
doing<00:03:09.659> that<00:03:09.930> what<00:03:10.139> I<00:03:10.170> try<00:03:10.379> to<00:03:10.409> do<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.430> put

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
doing that what I try to do is to put

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.220 
doing that what I try to do is to put
more<00:03:11.970> putty<00:03:12.269> on<00:03:12.420> then<00:03:12.629> I<00:03:12.690> think<00:03:12.930> I'm<00:03:13.049> going<00:03:13.170> to

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
more putty on then I think I'm going to
