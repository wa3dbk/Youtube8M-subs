00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.840
 well I'm really the points and 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.670
 Now I'm going to coincidence 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.670
 I have 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.770
 three phones here each one different 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.150
 al next door and good basically 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.150
 commented is a little 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:33.300
 the results of dell ven marc antich 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:37.270
 since as I say this phone is two 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:41.110
 nuclei to 1.3 and gives a score of one thousand 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.570
 574 ok you have the video too 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.540
 back as you can see also at first 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.280
 view you see that it is here is not ips and the 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.620
 screen looks pretty bad 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.100
 in this angle of vision but good here 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.199
 we have a nn 6 of 4 cores to 1.5 in 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.570
 this case is not the new processor of 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.420
 four cores that work 13 and 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.339
 thanks to the separate gpu gives a 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.439
 score of about 17 thousand 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.850
 this is the one that has the gpu power vr x 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:15.700
 15 1531 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.380
 and in a resolution full hd very 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.790
 important, if it were a restriction 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:26.380
 simply hd then we would give score 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.710
 and finally being in 9,800 eight 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.860
 nuclei 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.150
 to 17 you can see a score of 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.600
 27,000 in resolution hd 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.950
 is the screen of the full hd screen 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.899
 as you can see 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.759
 so it's true that this leads to 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.400
 producers as just one screen 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:51.080
 but good as you can see it looks 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.360
 a tad better in that in the agreement 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.160
 yes it is true that it is not noticeable 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.890
 I would not know what the 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.170
 full hd and what is simply the hd but 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.040
 good so that more or less you see a 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.450
 Comparison of the number of cores 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.920
 of the size that is also a curiosity 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.970
 the coincidence of which are 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.330
 different screen sizes at 4.55 and 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.670
 5.7 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.790
 something incident that I've had here three 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.070
 very different mobiles and more protection 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.350
 we make a small demonstration a 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.780
 small comparative 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.460
 If I had to personally choose 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.050
 some good because it would be the laker 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.280
 more than anything because of the size is worth to me 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.550
 this phone seemed too much 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.570
 big but good in this case if 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.450
 someone I like big screens 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.870
 obviously it has better performance 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.730
 being in 9,800 a web is also 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.590
 true that we have released a version of 8 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.200
 cores in this smartphone 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.239
 so that 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.250
 If I wanted more power or needed 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.340
 more power because I would rather prefer 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.989
 by the cne than in the heels that 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.800
 you can also enter it find in 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.890
 a point is and well a little more than 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.890
 Add 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.720
 I honestly found it curious and 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.510
 that's why I've done it, we do not usually do 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.980
 this kind of videos so so so but 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.980
 good for you to see 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.520
 the truth is that quite happy and 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:29.160
 pretty pretty well nothing good 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.160
 Well nothing without saying goodbye
