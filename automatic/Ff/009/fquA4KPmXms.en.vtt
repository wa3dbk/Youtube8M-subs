00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.810
Maybe I didn't love you

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.480
Quite as often as I could have

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.830
And maybe I didn't treat you

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.620
Quite as good as I should have

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.470
If I made you feel second best

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.560
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.980
You were always on my mind

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.890
You were always on my mind

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.690
And maybe I didn't hold you

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.270
All those lonely, lonely times

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.890
And I guess I never told you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.800
I'm so happy that you're mine

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.330
Little things I should have said &amp; done

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.680
I'm so happy that you're mine

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.340
You were always on my mind

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.380
You were always on my mind

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.730
Tell me,

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.810
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.480
Give me

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.260
Ggive me one more chance to keep you satisfied

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.230
Keep you satisfied

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.770
Little things I should have said &amp; done

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.800
I just never took the time

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.530
You were always on my mind

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.440
You were always on my mind

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.860
You were always on my mind

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.740
You were always on my mind
