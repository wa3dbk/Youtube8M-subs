00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.430
 I'm going to teach you how to make these pretty 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:20.099
 earrings that are very simple are ones in 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.509

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.070

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.109
 circular 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.519
 we are going to need the following 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:33.570
 materials two charms in this case color 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:40.909

 Brooches for earrings and rings 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:01:02.100
 then let's start our work 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:05.810
 we put the little heart that you 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.490
 can see in this way and we're going to pass 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.979
 the pin as you can see 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:19.170
 once we have it so what are we going 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:22.080
 to do is take our pliers and go 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.520
 to cut more or less as you can see 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:30.390
 look at about an inch 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.020
 I'm going to place like this and I'm going to cut a 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.310
 time we have it so what are we going to 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:42.390
 to do is to place our nail 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.760
 in the shape of a clamp and we are going to rotate in 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.150
 this form 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:52.530
 in this way to do our 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.290
 orejita we are accommodating as you 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.630
 can see 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.710
 here I'm going to arrange it so that they can 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.790
 observe more clearly and we are forming 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:08.869
 a kind of circle with the help of 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:14.390
 our other this pin quotes plier 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:16.170
 we close our little ear we put like this and 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.360
 let's do 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.150
 accommodate it so that you can this 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.150
 appreciate better we close 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:33.610
 and what we are going to do is adjust 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.819
 in this way 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.060
 let's go here 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:42.100
 and we are going to close in this way once 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.660
 that we have it like that 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.660
 we accommodate it 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.860
 in this way and we already have our 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:56.140
 little hook with an ear in this way 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.810
 to repeat the process so they can 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.430

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:09.709

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:13.260
 from heart we take the pliers 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:18.209
 We cut approximately as you can see 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.720
 you here a centimeter in this 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.720
 shape 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:30.850
 we cut once we have this like this 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:34.510
 let's grab our clamp and form what 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:37.319
 it's been a kind of little ear 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:43.600
 little circle we close well 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:47.790

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:01.049
 there we have closed and we have this 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.739

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:18.570
 this way we take the chain by the side 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:21.720
 that they touch her so they touch her and feel for 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:27.330
 the side that can be opened we take the 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:30.090
 two clamps in this way and proceed to 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.889

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:48.930
 ear and we went through the little hole so 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.470
