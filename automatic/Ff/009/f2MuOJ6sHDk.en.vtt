JPEG<00:02:41.070> optimization<00:02:41.940> right<00:02:42.390> there<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.900> lost

the<00:02:43.950> PNG<00:02:44.280> optimization<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:45.480> then<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:45.959> you<00:02:46.050> go

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
the PNG optimization and then if you go

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.170 
the PNG optimization and then if you go
to<00:02:46.170> media<00:02:46.500> you'll<00:02:46.770> see<00:02:46.980> this<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.760> click<00:02:48.030> on

bulk optimize and this will help you to

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.240 
bulk optimize and this will help you to
optimize<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.750> size<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.320> all<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.620> your<00:02:52.860> images

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
optimize the size of all of your images

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.190 
optimize the size of all of your images
and<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.850> didn't<00:02:54.120> notice<00:02:54.390> really<00:02:54.630> any

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
and I didn't notice really any

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.710 
and I didn't notice really any
degradation<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.489> quality<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.090> think<00:02:57.600> they

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
degradation and quality I think they

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.120 
degradation and quality I think they
looked<00:02:57.930> fine<00:02:58.170> but<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.470> did<00:02:58.620> help<00:02:58.800> speed<00:02:59.100> things

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
looked fine but it did help speed things

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.110 
looked fine but it did help speed things
up<00:02:59.630> now<00:03:00.630> another<00:03:00.900> plugin<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.350> can<00:03:01.410> use<00:03:01.769> is

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
up now another plugin you can use is

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.610 
up now another plugin you can use is
auto<00:03:03.120> optimize<00:03:03.780> now<00:03:04.019> this<00:03:04.200> does<00:03:04.440> something

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
auto optimize now this does something

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.490 
auto optimize now this does something
very<00:03:05.040> similar<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.570> w3<00:03:06.570> total<00:03:06.750> cache<00:03:06.930> but<00:03:07.410> it

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
very similar to w3 total cache but it

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.290 
very similar to w3 total cache but it
does<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.769> better<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.610> click<00:03:08.820> on<00:03:08.940> there<00:03:09.120> and

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
does it better you click on there and

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.060 
does it better you click on there and
