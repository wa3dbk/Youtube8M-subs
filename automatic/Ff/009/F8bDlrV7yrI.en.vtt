okay<00:05:42.000> now<00:05:42.540> i<00:05:42.840> see<00:05:43.200> that<00:05:43.350> my<00:05:43.410> arrows<00:05:43.770> won't<00:05:44.010> do

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
okay now i see that my arrows won't do

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.580 
okay now i see that my arrows won't do
any<00:05:44.340> harm<00:05:44.490> against<00:05:45.210> so<00:05:45.780> i<00:05:45.810> have<00:05:46.050> to<00:05:46.170> look<00:05:46.350> for<00:05:46.560> a

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.100 

hmm<00:05:58.950> this<00:05:59.370> seems<00:05:59.580> to<00:05:59.760> not<00:05:59.940> be<00:06:00.000> enough<00:06:00.450> again

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
hmm this seems to not be enough again

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:44.069 
hmm this seems to not be enough again
we'll<00:06:01.590> have<00:06:01.740> to<00:06:01.770> find<00:06:02.070> another<00:06:02.160> solution

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:44.079 

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:47.350 

again<00:06:45.079> this<00:06:45.439> monster<00:06:46.039> is<00:06:46.069> really<00:06:46.459> tough<00:06:46.729> it's

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
again this monster is really tough it's

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.149 
again this monster is really tough it's
really<00:06:47.719> about<00:06:47.809> observing<00:06:48.529> their<00:06:48.679> environment

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:49.159 
really about observing their environment

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.769 
really about observing their environment
and<00:06:49.279> looking<00:06:49.759> for<00:06:49.909> some<00:06:50.029> weak<00:06:50.269> points<00:06:50.299> on<00:06:50.749> my

00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:50.779 
and looking for some weak points on my

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:53.079 
and looking for some weak points on my
target<00:06:51.319> only<00:06:52.069> after<00:06:52.549> trying<00:06:52.819> different

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:53.089 
target only after trying different

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:55.329 
target only after trying different
tactics<00:06:53.719> will<00:06:54.229> I<00:06:54.319> be<00:06:54.529> able<00:06:54.559> to<00:06:54.739> find<00:06:55.069> the<00:06:55.159> right

00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:55.339 
tactics will I be able to find the right

00:06:55.339 --> 00:07:19.980 
tactics will I be able to find the right
solution

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:19.990 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.800 

ok<00:07:20.860> that's<00:07:21.340> it<00:07:21.550> for<00:07:21.580> the<00:07:21.760> demo<00:07:21.970> I<00:07:22.270> think<00:07:22.720> we

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:22.810 
ok that's it for the demo I think we

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.510 
ok that's it for the demo I think we
really<00:07:23.050> saw<00:07:23.260> how<00:07:23.440> deep<00:07:23.770> and<00:07:23.950> immersive<00:07:24.430> the

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 
really saw how deep and immersive the

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.420 
really saw how deep and immersive the
action<00:07:25.000> is<00:07:25.180> in<00:07:25.240> dark<00:07:25.720> side<00:07:26.020> the<00:07:26.590> game<00:07:26.830> will

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:27.430 
action is in dark side the game will

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.860 
action is in dark side the game will
release<00:07:27.730> in<00:07:27.880> September<00:07:28.300> 2006<00:07:29.080> on<00:07:29.320> PCO
