P if you dip whisk it very quickly in
our<00:02:26.359> motor<00:02:26.599> bubbles<00:02:27.019> to<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.620> mixture<00:02:28.480> when

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
our motor bubbles to the mixture when

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.759 
our motor bubbles to the mixture when
you're<00:02:29.599> actually<00:02:29.750> boiling<00:02:30.109> the<00:02:30.349> boilies<00:02:30.739> and

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
actually make them crack so we're going

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.470 
actually make them crack so we're going
to<00:02:33.470> leave<00:02:33.560> this<00:02:33.709> variety<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:35.120> then<00:02:35.239> it<00:02:35.359> looks

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
to leave this variety and then it looks

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.150 
to leave this variety and then it looks
pretty<00:02:35.660> good<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:36.019> me<00:02:36.049> now<00:02:36.380> now<00:02:36.799> it's<00:02:36.950> time<00:02:37.130> to

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
pretty good to me now now it's time to

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.289 
pretty good to me now now it's time to
add<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.430> dry<00:02:37.639> mixture

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
add the dry mixture

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.589 
add the dry mixture
just<00:02:38.750> remember<00:02:39.139> to<00:02:40.030> don't<00:02:41.030> add<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.269> all<00:02:41.359> at<00:02:41.389> the

just remember to don't add it all at the

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.509 
just remember to don't add it all at the

same time had it bit by bit mix it all
up<00:02:43.549> in

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
up in

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.510 
up in
maybe<00:02:45.510> agency<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.320> putty<00:02:46.770> start<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.250> form
