motivations this was a lot of fun to
paint<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.920> mean<00:01:08.490> come<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.030> look<00:01:09.720> at<00:01:09.840> that

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
paint I mean come on look at that

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.440 
paint I mean come on look at that
reference<00:01:10.410> photo<00:01:10.880> it's<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.300> high

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
reference photo it's really high

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.839 
reference photo it's really high
resolution<00:01:12.690> so<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.890> see<00:01:14.039> a<00:01:14.069> lot<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.369> details

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:14.849 
resolution so I can see a lot of details

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:16.790 
resolution so I can see a lot of details
in<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.179> important<00:01:15.539> places<00:01:15.929> like<00:01:16.289> the<00:01:16.440> eyes<00:01:16.560> of

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
in the important places like the eyes of

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.969 
in the important places like the eyes of
the<00:01:16.890> note<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:18.330> lighting<00:01:18.690> is<00:01:18.780> spectacular<00:01:18.990> -<00:01:19.679> I

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
the note the lighting is spectacular - I

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.339 
the note the lighting is spectacular - I
did<00:01:20.819> two<00:01:21.060> thumbnail<00:01:21.509> sketches<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.110> get<00:01:22.259> an

00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:22.349 
did two thumbnail sketches to get an

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:24.020 
did two thumbnail sketches to get an
idea<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.860> how<00:01:23.190> I<00:01:23.220> was<00:01:23.459> going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.759> exaggerate

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
idea of how I was going to exaggerate

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.690 
idea of how I was going to exaggerate
like<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.740> first<00:01:26.009> sketch<00:01:26.250> was<00:01:26.490> only

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
like here the first sketch was only

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.120 
like here the first sketch was only
slightly<00:01:27.000> exaggerated<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.619> use<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.009> as

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
slightly exaggerated so I use it as

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.249 
slightly exaggerated so I use it as
reference<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:30.209> caricature<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.929> sketch

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
reference and caricature of the sketch

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.949 
reference and caricature of the sketch
to<00:01:31.560> get<00:01:31.709> a<00:01:31.740> more<00:01:32.009> exaggerated<00:01:32.580> one<00:01:32.959> which

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
to get a more exaggerated one which

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.839 
to get a more exaggerated one which
still<00:01:34.229> contained<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.860> basic<00:01:35.280> shapes<00:01:35.580> that

00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:35.849 
still contained the basic shapes that

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:38.399 
still contained the basic shapes that
holds<00:01:36.209> my<00:01:36.390> X<00:01:36.539> lanes

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
holds my X lanes

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.069 
holds my X lanes
I<00:01:38.469> like<00:01:39.460> when<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:39.729> painting<00:01:40.149> has<00:01:40.329> a<00:01:40.359> nice<00:01:40.659> slight

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
I like when a painting has a nice slight

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.319 
I like when a painting has a nice slight
shadow<00:01:41.530> side<00:01:41.829> to<00:01:42.039> it<00:01:42.189> it<00:01:42.880> really<00:01:43.119> helps

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
shadow side to it it really helps

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:45.179 
shadow side to it it really helps
describe<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.109> form<00:01:44.409> of<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.679> face<00:01:44.859> in<00:01:45.100> a

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
describe the form of the face in a

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.279 
describe the form of the face in a
dramatic<00:01:45.670> way<00:01:45.850> when<00:01:46.450> half<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:46.840> faces<00:01:47.079> in

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
dramatic way when half the faces in

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.319 
dramatic way when half the faces in
shadow<00:01:47.679> but<00:01:48.490> there's<00:01:48.700> just<00:01:48.969> enough

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
shadow but there's just enough

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.569 
shadow but there's just enough
reflective<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.229> bounce<00:01:50.500> light<00:01:50.859> to<00:01:51.159> describe

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
reflective and bounce light to describe

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.899 
reflective and bounce light to describe
what's<00:01:51.850> happening<00:01:52.359> in<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.539> shadow<00:01:52.750> side<00:01:53.020> and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
what's happening in the shadow side and

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.459 
what's happening in the shadow side and
that<00:01:54.909> really<00:01:55.329> bright<00:01:55.630> backlight<00:01:56.170> which

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
that really bright backlight which

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.889 
that really bright backlight which
causes<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.189> rim<00:01:57.399> light<00:01:57.609> on<00:01:57.880> his<00:01:58.119> head<00:01:58.390> is<00:01:58.689> an

causes the rim light on his head is an

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.620 
causes the rim light on his head is an
easy<00:01:59.200> trick<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.619> make<00:01:59.920> configure<00:02:00.429> not<00:02:01.329> blend

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
easy trick to make configure not blend

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.349 
easy trick to make configure not blend
in<00:02:01.840> with<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.289> dark<00:02:02.560> or<00:02:02.799> mid-tone<00:02:03.520> background

about me I've probably said it before in
another<00:02:14.709> video<00:02:15.250> but<00:02:15.819> I<00:02:16.060> really<00:02:16.629> enjoyed

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
playing video games like a lot I also

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.229 
playing video games like a lot I also
really<00:02:22.390> enjoyed<00:02:22.660> drawing<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:23.260> painting<00:02:23.440> a

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
really enjoyed drawing and painting a

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.789 
really enjoyed drawing and painting a
lot<00:02:26.459> so<00:02:27.459> sometimes<00:02:28.390> it's<00:02:28.989> really<00:02:29.290> hard<00:02:29.410> to

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
lot so sometimes it's really hard to

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.479 
lot so sometimes it's really hard to
balance<00:02:29.980> my<00:02:30.370> two<00:02:30.430> passions<00:02:32.099> with<00:02:33.099> perfect

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
balance my two passions with perfect

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.880 
balance my two passions with perfect
self<00:02:33.700> control<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.420> might<00:02:35.170> be<00:02:35.349> able<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.590> split

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
self control I might be able to split

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.979 
self control I might be able to split
half<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.370> my<00:02:36.489> time<00:02:36.700> playing<00:02:37.060> video<00:02:37.209> games<00:02:37.599> and

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
half of my time playing video games and

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.339 
half of my time playing video games and
the<00:02:38.379> other<00:02:38.470> half<00:02:38.739> drawing<00:02:39.720> but<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:40.810> course<00:02:41.079> I

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
the other half drawing but of course I

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.009 
the other half drawing but of course I
cannot<00:02:41.829> do<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.040> I<00:02:42.459> always<00:02:43.420> end<00:02:43.630> up<00:02:43.720> playing

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
cannot do that I always end up playing

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.009 
cannot do that I always end up playing
the<00:02:44.290> game<00:02:44.500> all<00:02:44.769> day<00:02:44.799> and<00:02:45.549> drawing<00:02:46.389> becomes<00:02:46.780> an

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
the game all day and drawing becomes an

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.710 
the game all day and drawing becomes an
afterthought<00:02:47.970> only<00:02:48.970> when<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.150> get<00:02:49.239> tired<00:02:49.540> of

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
afterthought only when I get tired of

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.660 
afterthought only when I get tired of
playing<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.109> game<00:02:50.260> when<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.680> take<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> break<00:02:51.250> and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
playing the game when I take a break and

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.500 
playing the game when I take a break and
draw<00:02:51.880> something<00:02:53.370> once<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:54.489> started<00:02:54.849> drawing<00:02:55.120> I

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
draw something once I started drawing I

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.839 
draw something once I started drawing I
wish<00:02:55.900> I'd<00:02:56.139> started<00:02:56.410> sooner<00:02:56.889> because<00:02:57.220> how<00:02:57.549> fun

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
wish I'd started sooner because how fun

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.050 
wish I'd started sooner because how fun
it<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.680> make<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.829> my<00:02:59.950> goal<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.250> play<00:03:00.639> fewer

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
it is I make it my goal to play fewer

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.199 
it is I make it my goal to play fewer
hours<00:03:01.299> of<00:03:01.690> games<00:03:01.930> so<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.470> can<00:03:02.650> draw<00:03:02.889> more

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
hours of games so that I can draw more

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.610 
hours of games so that I can draw more
but<00:03:04.209> I<00:03:04.239> go<00:03:04.450> back<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.750> playing<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.109> game<00:03:05.319> all

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
but I go back to playing the game all

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.490 
but I go back to playing the game all
day<00:03:05.680> until<00:03:06.130> I<00:03:06.400> get<00:03:06.549> tired<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:07.870> repeats<00:03:08.290> until

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
day until I get tired this repeats until

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.650

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
by this time I realized gaming is not

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.150 
by this time I realized gaming is not
that<00:03:20.830> important<00:03:21.280> right<00:03:21.700> now<00:03:22.000> in<00:03:22.870> my<00:03:23.110> life<00:03:23.160> and

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
that important right now in my life and

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.450 
that important right now in my life and
improving<00:03:24.640> my<00:03:24.760> art<00:03:24.940> is<00:03:25.800> so<00:03:26.800> I<00:03:26.830> purged<00:03:27.250> my

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
improving my art is so I purged my

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.720 
improving my art is so I purged my
computer<00:03:28.030> or<00:03:28.150> video<00:03:28.360> games<00:03:28.810> of<00:03:29.340> course<00:03:30.340> I

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
computer or video games of course I

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.820 
computer or video games of course I
could<00:03:31.060> just<00:03:31.240> reinstall<00:03:31.780> them<00:03:32.020> if<00:03:32.260> I<00:03:32.470> wanted<00:03:32.770> to

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
could just reinstall them if I wanted to

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.270 
could just reinstall them if I wanted to
play<00:03:33.070> but<00:03:33.550> that's<00:03:34.240> not<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.570> point<00:03:34.750> I<00:03:35.280> suddenly

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
play but that's not the point I suddenly

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.880 
play but that's not the point I suddenly
have<00:03:36.700> no<00:03:37.120> more<00:03:37.390> urge<00:03:37.630> to<00:03:37.870> play<00:03:37.990> games<00:03:38.380> when<00:03:38.860> I

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
have no more urge to play games when I

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.160 
have no more urge to play games when I
get<00:03:39.160> home<00:03:39.400> because<00:03:39.940> I<00:03:40.240> know<00:03:40.390> it's<00:03:40.780> not<00:03:40.870> on<00:03:41.140> a

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
get home because I know it's not on a

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.470 
get home because I know it's not on a
computer<00:03:41.590> anymore

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
computer anymore

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.570

when<00:03:43.480> I'm<00:03:43.600> at<00:03:43.720> work<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:43.959> don't<00:03:44.830> imagine<00:03:45.160> what

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
when I'm at work I don't imagine what

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.060 
when I'm at work I don't imagine what
I'm<00:03:45.700> gonna<00:03:45.910> do<00:03:46.150> in<00:03:46.450> game<00:03:46.690> when<00:03:46.930> I<00:03:46.959> get<00:03:47.140> home<00:03:47.350> but

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
I'm gonna do in game when I get home but

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.650 
I'm gonna do in game when I get home but
instead<00:03:48.370> I<00:03:48.700> imagine<00:03:49.360> what<00:03:49.600> I'm<00:03:49.690> gonna<00:03:49.870> paint

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
instead I imagine what I'm gonna paint

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.660 
instead I imagine what I'm gonna paint
eventually<00:03:52.660> after<00:03:52.959> lots<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.680> productivity<00:03:54.430> I

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
eventually after lots of productivity I

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.180 
eventually after lots of productivity I
feel<00:03:55.270> it's<00:03:55.450> time<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.780> I<00:03:56.170> earned<00:03:56.530> some<00:03:56.860> time

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
feel it's time that I earned some time

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.180 
feel it's time that I earned some time
to<00:03:57.280> play<00:03:57.459> video<00:03:57.880> games<00:03:58.120> again<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:59.770> cycle

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
to play video games again and the cycle

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.330 
to play video games again and the cycle
repeats<00:04:00.220> itself<00:04:01.170> I'm<00:04:02.170> actually<00:04:02.410> totally<00:04:02.980> fine

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
repeats itself I'm actually totally fine

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.150 
repeats itself I'm actually totally fine
with<00:04:03.520> that<00:04:03.550> because<00:04:04.360> like<00:04:04.750> I<00:04:04.900> said<00:04:04.959> I<00:04:05.410> really
