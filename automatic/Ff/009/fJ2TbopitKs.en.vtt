ocean and see what's happening at the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.310 
ocean and see what's happening at the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
moment I'm focusing on those big dark

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.820 
moment I'm focusing on those big dark
clouds<00:00:26.250> out<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.519> front<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.869> see<00:00:28.170> this

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
clouds out in front so I can see this

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.589 
clouds out in front so I can see this
well<00:00:29.099> from<00:00:29.250> my<00:00:29.429> left<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.789> right<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.269> straight

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
well from my left and right and straight

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.900 
well from my left and right and straight
ahead<00:00:30.869> now<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.650> reason<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.219> need<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.579> look

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
ahead now the reason you need to look

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.580 
ahead now the reason you need to look
straight<00:00:33.239> ahead<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.780> sides<00:00:34.050> because<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.440> can

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
straight ahead and sides because you can

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.740 
straight ahead and sides because you can
see<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:35.010> there<00:00:35.309> although<00:00:36.030> I'm<00:00:36.149> not<00:00:36.270> moving

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
see just there although I'm not moving

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.900 
see just there although I'm not moving
there's<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.079> slapping<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> boat<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.730> what

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
there's a slapping of the boat and what

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.700 
there's a slapping of the boat and what
that<00:00:39.090> does<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.540> breaks<00:00:39.989> my<00:00:40.230> boat<00:00:40.469> run

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
that does is that breaks my boat run

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.770 
that does is that breaks my boat run
down<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.760> could<00:00:41.879> imagine<00:00:42.000> over<00:00:42.540> an<00:00:42.629> hour

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
down so you could imagine over an hour

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.690 
down so you could imagine over an hour
and<00:00:43.020> hour<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.290> half<00:00:43.500> or<00:00:43.829> even<00:00:44.100> more<00:00:44.309> how

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
and hour and a half or even more how

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.540 
and hour and a half or even more how
many<00:00:44.879> times<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.360> slap<00:00:45.690> over<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> wave<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
many times you slap over a wave and the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.819 
many times you slap over a wave and the
boat<00:00:47.760> stops<00:00:48.270> you've<00:00:48.989> got<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.260> get<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.559> going

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
boat stops you've got to get that going

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.520 
boat stops you've got to get that going
again<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.910> need<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.510> look<00:00:51.719> where<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.350> can

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
again so you need to look where you can

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.470 
again so you need to look where you can
position<00:00:52.800> yourself<00:00:53.039> best<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.210> swells

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
position yourself best on the swells

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.479 
position yourself best on the swells
going<00:00:54.870> out<00:00:55.050> as<00:00:55.199> well<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.590> here<00:00:56.250> I'm<00:00:56.460> just

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
going out as well so here I'm just

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.060 
going out as well so here I'm just
keeping<00:00:57.030> my<00:00:57.059> head<00:00:57.329> up<00:00:57.480> keeping<00:00:58.260> us<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> good

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
keeping my head up keeping us a good

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.580 
keeping my head up keeping us a good
rhythm<00:00:59.430> but<00:01:00.059> more<00:01:00.300> importantly<00:01:00.780> I'm<00:01:00.899> steering

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
rhythm but more importantly I'm steering

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.490 
rhythm but more importantly I'm steering
away<00:01:02.010> from<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.789> steepest<00:01:03.719> part<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> swell

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
away from the steepest part of the swell

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.679 
away from the steepest part of the swell
because<00:01:05.040> when<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.430> goes<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.119> slaps<00:01:06.390> down

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
because when it goes up and slaps down

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.550 
because when it goes up and slaps down
as<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.930> said<00:01:07.260> from<00:01:07.799> 85<00:01:08.310> kilos<00:01:08.790> skis<00:01:09.510> 15<00:01:10.049> kilos

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
as I said from 85 kilos skis 15 kilos

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.590 
as I said from 85 kilos skis 15 kilos
there's<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.220> hundred<00:01:11.610> kilos<00:01:12.000> after<00:01:12.360> keep

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
there's a hundred kilos after keep

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.950 
there's a hundred kilos after keep
getting<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.830> every<00:01:14.280> time<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:15.240> if<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.540> steer

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
getting going every time but if I steer

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.679 
getting going every time but if I steer
to<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.350> where<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.070> not<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.310> state<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:18.030> don't

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
to this where it's not a state I don't

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.570 
to this where it's not a state I don't
lose<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.290> boat<00:01:19.560> run<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.100> I'll<00:01:20.250> become<00:01:20.400> more

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
lose that boat run and I'll become more

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.940 
lose that boat run and I'll become more
efficient<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.840> find<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.229> easier<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.770> keep

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
efficient and I find it easier to keep

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.910 
efficient and I find it easier to keep
going<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.490> whole<00:01:23.520> time<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:25.200> more<00:01:25.439> efficient

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
going the whole time the more efficient

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.039 
going the whole time the more efficient
you<00:01:26.040> are<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.369> your<00:01:26.490> paddling<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.509> faster

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
you are in your paddling the faster

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.080 
you are in your paddling the faster
you'll<00:01:28.200> go<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.250> more<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.670> will<00:01:29.790> enjoy

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
you'll go and the more you will enjoy

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.899 
you'll go and the more you will enjoy
another<00:01:30.960> part<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.439> tricky<00:01:31.920> paddling<00:01:32.460> is

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
another part of tricky paddling is

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.810 
another part of tricky paddling is
dealing<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:33.659> rebound<00:01:34.280> this<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.549> part

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
dealing with rebound this is the part

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.920 
dealing with rebound this is the part
where<00:01:36.000> people<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.540> little<00:01:36.780> bit

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
where people get a little bit

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.679 
where people get a little bit
uncomfortable<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.009> here<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:39.360> lesson

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
uncomfortable so here in this lesson

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.810 
uncomfortable so here in this lesson
we're<00:01:39.960> having<00:01:40.170> group<00:01:40.470> chat<00:01:40.770> about<00:01:41.040> what<00:01:41.640> to

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
we're having group chat about what to

bit of a swell or a wave there to get a
bit<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.180> assistance

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
bit of assistance

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.770 
bit of assistance
the<00:02:13.620> whole<00:02:13.800> time<00:02:14.070> again<00:02:14.370> head<00:02:14.700> up<00:02:14.880> looking

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
around and staying on my pedals that way

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.340 
around and staying on my pedals that way
I<00:02:19.320> can<00:02:19.920> steer<00:02:20.280> if<00:02:20.490> necessary<00:02:21.180> if<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.840> get<00:02:22.050> into<00:02:22.200> a

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
I can steer if necessary if I get into a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.200 
I can steer if necessary if I get into a
little<00:02:22.620> bit<00:02:22.710> of<00:02:22.800> trouble<00:02:22.980> with<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.820> group

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
little bit of trouble with the group

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.690 
little bit of trouble with the group
today<00:02:24.420> we<00:02:24.750> were<00:02:24.900> learning<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.680> relax<00:02:26.070> our<00:02:26.370> hips

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
today we were learning to relax our hips

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.360 
today we were learning to relax our hips
so<00:02:27.300> we<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.600> roll<00:02:27.870> with<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.260> waves<00:02:28.470> because

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
so we can roll with the waves because

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.800 
so we can roll with the waves because
they're<00:02:29.490> going<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.730> come<00:02:29.940> from<00:02:30.060> both<00:02:30.300> left<00:02:30.630> and

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
they're going to come from both left and

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.510 
they're going to come from both left and
right<00:02:31.080> now<00:02:31.320> because<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.860> swell<00:02:32.100> pushes

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
right now because the swell pushes

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.370 
right now because the swell pushes
against<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.970> cliffs<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.480> then<00:02:33.930> it's<00:02:34.080> got<00:02:34.290> to

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
against the cliffs and then it's got to

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.560 
against the cliffs and then it's got to
go<00:02:34.500> back<00:02:34.710> out<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.070> sea<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:36.090> can<00:02:36.270> stay

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
go back out to sea so you can stay

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.650 
go back out to sea so you can stay
relaxed<00:02:37.260> within<00:02:37.590> your<00:02:37.740> hips<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:38.790> roll<00:02:39.270> as

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
relaxed within your hips you can roll as

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.360 
relaxed within your hips you can roll as
the<00:02:39.690> boat<00:02:40.110> go<00:02:40.350> through<00:02:40.620> I'll<00:02:40.830> show<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.100> some

hips<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.670> they<00:02:50.820> can<00:02:51.150> roll<00:02:51.450> with<00:02:51.480> as<00:02:51.780> well<00:02:51.990> as

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
hips so they can roll with as well as

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.140 
hips so they can roll with as well as
they<00:02:52.230> get<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.440> bit<00:02:52.620> closer<00:02:52.920> as<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.790> can<00:02:53.940> see

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150
