doing<00:00:16.289> an<00:00:16.740> ultimate<00:00:17.100> finish<00:00:17.430> but<00:00:17.910> I've<00:00:18.270> seen

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
doing an ultimate finish but I've seen

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.320 
doing an ultimate finish but I've seen
people<00:00:18.840> do<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.020> just<00:00:19.350> by<00:00:19.529> clearing<00:00:20.070> me<00:00:20.300> so<00:00:21.300> I

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
people do it just by clearing me so I

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.820 
people do it just by clearing me so I
don't<00:00:21.660> really<00:00:21.810> think<00:00:22.020> there's<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.320> formula<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
don't really think there's a formula to

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:53.870 
don't really think there's a formula to
it<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.369> grinding

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.340 

another<00:00:54.880> thing<00:00:55.090> you'll<00:00:55.240> notice<00:00:55.480> entertainers

another thing you'll notice entertainers

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.740 
another thing you'll notice entertainers
feel<00:00:56.620> is<00:00:56.800> that<00:00:57.010> I<00:00:57.340> don't<00:00:57.790> get<00:00:57.970> a<00:00:58.030> pop-up<00:00:58.300> saying

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
feel is that I don't get a pop-up saying

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.440 
feel is that I don't get a pop-up saying
I<00:00:59.080> got<00:00:59.380> a<00:00:59.410> skill<00:00:59.830> so<00:01:00.820> just<00:01:01.090> because<00:01:01.330> you<00:01:01.390> don't

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
I got a skill so just because you don't

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.720 
I got a skill so just because you don't
get<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.660> pop-up<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:03.100> doesn't<00:01:03.400> mean<00:01:03.520> that<00:01:03.550> you

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
get a pop-up that doesn't mean that you

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.000 
get a pop-up that doesn't mean that you
shouldn't<00:01:03.970> finish<00:01:04.300> it<00:01:04.480> because<00:01:05.140> I<00:01:05.530> almost<00:01:05.680> put

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
shouldn't finish it because I almost put

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.500 
shouldn't finish it because I almost put
this<00:01:06.130> one<00:01:06.310> because<00:01:06.640> I<00:01:06.670> didn't<00:01:06.940> get<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.060> pop-up

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
this one because I didn't get the pop-up

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.420 
this one because I didn't get the pop-up
but<00:01:07.720> I<00:01:07.750> finished<00:01:08.140> it<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.500> still<00:01:09.190> got<00:01:09.310> the
