00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.270 
to do next I do like the Sun roof which
is<00:01:15.360> adjustable<00:01:15.600> but<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.860> shame<00:01:17.100> it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
is adjustable but it's a shame it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.899 
is adjustable but it's a shame it
doesn't<00:01:17.369> shut<00:01:17.759> itself<00:01:18.150> if<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.509> rains<00:01:19.909> probably

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
doesn't shut itself if it rains probably

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.760 
doesn't shut itself if it rains probably

like<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.410> is<00:01:56.980> really<00:01:57.700> good<00:01:57.850> quality<00:01:58.270> it's<00:01:58.900> but

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
like it is really good quality it's but

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.460 
like it is really good quality it's but
you'd<00:01:59.350> expect<00:01:59.710> from<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.860> VW<00:02:00.100> really<00:02:01.080> is<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.230> Scott

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
in-car entertainment but how easy it is

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.270 
in-car entertainment but how easy it is
to<00:02:13.480> use<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.960> fact<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.440> can<00:02:14.650> remove<00:02:15.100> it

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
to use the fact that you can remove it

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.910 
to use the fact that you can remove it
from<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.460> car<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.880> put<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.900> back<00:02:16.990> in<00:02:17.230> the
