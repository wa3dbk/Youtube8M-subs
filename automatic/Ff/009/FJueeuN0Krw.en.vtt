two oh three ways swivel your 1.0 crimps
because<00:00:35.670> we're<00:00:35.850> using<00:00:36.030> 80-pound

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
because we're using 80-pound

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.070 
because we're using 80-pound
monofilament<00:00:37.550> rubber<00:00:38.550> bands<00:00:39.120> these<00:00:39.930> are

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
monofilament rubber bands these are

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.990 
monofilament rubber bands these are
number<00:00:40.290> 64<00:00:40.740> rubber<00:00:40.980> bands<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.550> twist<00:00:41.820> up<00:00:41.970> your

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.960 
because the size of the hooks coming out
of<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.820> jig<00:00:48.150> are<00:00:48.420> different<00:00:48.990> sizes<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.340> use

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
of the jig are different sizes so we use

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.810 
of the jig are different sizes so we use
a<00:00:51.000> NATO<00:00:51.360> Stinger<00:00:51.960> hook<00:00:52.110> on<00:00:52.380> the<00:00:53.370> smaller

one eye of our 203 wave swivel again as

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.800 
one eye of our 203 wave swivel again as
we<00:01:28.229> Pro<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.710> pull<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.400> fairly<00:01:29.850> tight<00:01:30.479> here

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
we Pro this pull this fairly tight here

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.200 
we Pro this pull this fairly tight here
cuz<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.110> don't<00:01:31.260> need<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> big<00:01:31.650> loop<00:01:31.860> there

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
exactly see the crimps on both sides so

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.500 
exactly see the crimps on both sides so
when<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.580> crimp<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.150> hitting<00:01:36.390> the

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
hook up through it'll you can see where

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:09.849 
hook up through it'll you can see where
the<00:03:08.450> hook<00:03:08.629> is<00:03:08.810> going<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:09.049> start<00:03:09.349> to<00:03:09.500> come<00:03:09.680> out

the hook is going to start to come out
you<00:03:10.819> can<00:03:11.319> so<00:03:12.319> we<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:13.189> starts<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.819> make<00:03:13.969> a<00:03:14.000> mark

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
you can so we it starts to make a mark

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.059 
you can so we it starts to make a mark
on<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.659> shad<00:03:14.900> you<00:03:15.109> want<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.349> come<00:03:15.530> up<00:03:15.650> as<00:03:15.799> close

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
on the shad you want to come up as close

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.860 
on the shad you want to come up as close
to<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.370> center<00:03:16.670> of<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.849> shad<00:03:17.090> as<00:03:17.329> possible

to the center of the shad as possible

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.839 
to the center of the shad as possible
the<00:03:18.409> one<00:03:18.590> thing<00:03:18.829> about<00:03:18.859> these<00:03:19.280> shad<00:03:19.609> which

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
the one thing about these shad which

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.670 
the one thing about these shad which
makes<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.269> easy<00:03:20.540> is<00:03:20.840> there<00:03:21.109> is<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.290> small

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
makes it easy is there is a small

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.949 
makes it easy is there is a small
channel<00:03:22.400> here<00:03:22.730> that<00:03:23.480> makes<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:23.870> little

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
channel here that makes it a little

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.979 
channel here that makes it a little
easier<00:03:24.379> to<00:03:24.439> find<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.519> center<00:03:25.849> as<00:03:26.629> soon<00:03:26.780> as<00:03:26.900> it

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
easier to find the center as soon as it

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.339 
easier to find the center as soon as it
comes<00:03:27.139> around<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.620> bend<00:03:27.859> push<00:03:28.790> it<00:03:28.939> through

comes around to the bend push it through

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.159 
comes around to the bend push it through
it<00:03:30.349> slides<00:03:30.739> up<00:03:31.419> now<00:03:32.419> it's<00:03:32.599> in<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.840> center<00:03:33.109> of
