00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.870
 standard recipe 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.760
 if they are in the barrel class not for long 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.250
 these are long and very tasty 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.779
 means what is done as standard 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.140
 they fit in a jar 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:32.369
 giving different seasonings now being prepared 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.710
 marinade on the marina 1 10 liters given floor 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.469
 kilogram of sugar half a kilogram of vinegar 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.270
 and 300 grams of salt in this case I take 5 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:49.050
 liters so we will give half less 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:52.070
 250 grams of sugar 150 grams of salt or 5 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.129

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:59.340
 alloyed non-fluorinated and 250 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.969
 milliliters of vinegar all this is given 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.519
 repeat in the cold no one boiled 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.970
 water and stirred until full 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.909
 dissolving after this already 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.500
 marinade and pour tomatoes our choice 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.030
 we mixed all these marinade ingredients 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.210
 we beat now with this marinade 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.340
 jar I repeat marinade cold he 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.240
 me on the stove just for convenience is 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.409
 and not to boil it 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.470
 pickled tomatoes they are no 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.009
 no need for temperature now 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.390
 we give usual aspirin acetylsalicylic 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.180
 half gram acid 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.240
 so 0 5 grams are not special for 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.899
 dissolving there such a pop i am ordinary 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.579
 aspirin 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.500
 give three pills specifically for him 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.410
 he does not need to dissolve himself gradually 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.540
 dissolve 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.060
 I take nylon cover I do not use 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.930
 special and take the usual kapron 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.780
 covers thrown into boiling water 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.940
 Donat lie down and bend so mean 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.880
 Means that she already pro about steamed 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:18.450
 expanded so it means at this moment we 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:23.580
 and we get bright or something else and quickly 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.350
 closing all this whole recipe she can 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.270
 stand not which should not be covered 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.700
 i'm just fucking cold 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.500
 nylon covers 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.220
 Now I want to definitely explain one 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.830
 moment and how 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.200
 will surely scold about aspirin 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.810
 many so it is very creepy harmful 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.550
 medicine firstly here if you 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.690
 eat some tomatoes dose will 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.780
 very small 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.270
 secondly if i said that we give in 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.440
 this recipe willow bark 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.959
 most would say yes very 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.590
 wonderful delicious natural recipe 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.660
 but aspirin is found in willow bark 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.280
 in large quantities from there it is 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.530
 highlighted so I don't consider something in 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.840
 this recipe is so terrible 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.530
 aspirin is harmful only to those who have it. 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.959
 over the years 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.480
 consumes in large quantities over the years 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.370
 then it causes complications but 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.420
 because allergies can not only be 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.730
 for aspirin 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.370
 ayu like any other natural self 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.440
 In the year we even had cases in the hospital 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.019
 distilled water allergies that 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.880
 happens anything here i'm always on here 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.320
 These banks write as a marker and 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.959
 always ask guests if they have 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.150
 if you have this allergy 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.010
 prescription they do not use but allergies 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.110
 maybe on vinegar and on anything 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:45.390
 even on the tomatoes themselves and on any berries 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.610
 so this is the most delicious of all 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.310
 recipes always these tomatoes are eaten in 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.310
 first of all you their readiness 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.530
 considered in 2 2 months after 60 days 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.630
 but sometimes we start not keeping them 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.670
 eat before and very tasty 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.750
 at the same time they cost longer than 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.790
 plain sour without aspirin 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.950
 and their taste is very different from 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.800
 just pickled tomatoes and frost 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:13.210
 plumage only changes the process 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.200
 fermentation he still changes it so that the taste 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.570
 becomes different 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.910
 if you just dissolve aspirin in water 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.010
 the marinade will not be his taste namely in the 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.980
 these two months there are such processes 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.930
 that it gets very tasty but 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.670
 whether you do it or not 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.460
 personal decision 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.290
