00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.039
 based on surveys that we did in our school from third to fifth year 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.390

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.069
 in the act 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.379
 one of the teenagers 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.379
 such is your opinion 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:12.790
 one of the teachers 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.140
 that this has been one of the most chosen jobs given the problems 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.459
 the decade will come to alcohol

 develop in monterrey 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:33.499
 this aspect I do not think that 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:36.769
 The sequels that can leave addictions to drugs and alcohol 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.299
 this band pretty serious then 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.379
 I asked that what we are more than narrating to adopt forms from there can stop 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.269
 bottom 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.279
 the proposal that we percent made between when we are in that 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:50.989
 work 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.629
 so that they do not give so much importance to the prohibition of alcohol because 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.879
 propaganda is the prohibition of alcohol what they had to do is make 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.329
 propaganda 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.769
 Ikea and remote control goes to moderate with drinking alcohol 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.409
 not to prohibit it because they prevent it will take it to consume already prohibit that 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.959
 opining that these works will seal him with the conclusions to 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.780
 people that maybe they can will be made read in some change for example the 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:19.109
 councilors in only political officials who are managing our 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:19.669
 city 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.279
 the idea is very important that you see how it is 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:26.259
 the vision of them young not because the problem is really ours and not 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:29.979
 it seems it is very important that the index went up we think about it 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:34.449
 demise account henares per hundred a thought responsible for concern 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.749
 they did not live this reality when when you fail them because things are

 very different
