00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.750 
getting into what we're gonna be talking
about<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.140> three<00:01:01.469> main<00:01:01.680> cars<00:01:02.010> because<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
about the three main cars because the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.250 
about the three main cars because the
gesture<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.090> cool<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.480> everything<00:01:03.570> but<00:01:04.110> it's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
gesture is cool and everything but it's

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.870 
gesture is cool and everything but it's
not<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.710> know<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> greatest<00:01:05.129> top<00:01:05.400> speed<00:01:05.640> it's

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
probably a little bit better handling

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.950 
probably a little bit better handling

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.380 
want me to do some more testing I'll do
it<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.350> know<00:01:19.470> with<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.890> being<00:01:20.280> turns<00:01:21.090> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
it you know with it being turns and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.240 
it you know with it being turns and
everything<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:22.080> at<00:01:22.560> least<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:23.040> these

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
everything but at least on these

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.170 
everything but at least on these
straightaways

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
straightaways

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.090 
straightaways
I<00:01:24.210> think<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:25.020> tour<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.290> most<00:01:25.500> probably<00:01:25.890> best

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
I think the tour is most probably best

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.100 
I think the tour is most probably best
overall<00:01:26.640> car<00:01:26.939> you'll<00:01:27.180> see<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:27.990> pretty

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
overall car you'll see that it's pretty

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.380 
overall car you'll see that it's pretty
much<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.500> mix<00:01:28.799> between<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.310> adder<00:01:29.520> entity<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
much a mix between the adder entity the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.649 
much a mix between the adder entity the
entity<00:01:30.810> has<00:01:31.049> better<00:01:31.650> acceleration<00:01:32.329> but<00:01:33.329> less

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
entity has better acceleration but less

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.690 
entity has better acceleration but less
top<00:01:33.900> speed<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> adder<00:01:34.860> has<00:01:35.189> better<00:01:35.460> top

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
top speed and the adder has better top

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.760 
top speed and the adder has better top
speed<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.360> less<00:01:36.509> acceleration<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.590> kind

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
speed but less acceleration so it's kind

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.160 
speed but less acceleration so it's kind
of<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.009> middle<00:01:38.220> ground<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.729> them<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
of in the middle ground of them and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.240 
of in the middle ground of them and
personally<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> think<00:01:40.320> it's<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> best<00:01:40.920> not

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
personally I think it's the best not

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.100 
personally I think it's the best not
only<00:01:41.520> because<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.090> fact<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.930> fact

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
only because of that fact but the fact

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.859 
only because of that fact but the fact
that<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.380> only<00:01:43.520> $500,000<00:01:44.520> for<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.149> when

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
that it's only $500,000 for one and when

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.010 
that it's only $500,000 for one and when
you<00:01:46.049> blow<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.369> only<00:01:47.579> costs<00:01:48.060> $6,000<00:01:48.840> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
you blow it up it only costs $6,000 to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.389 
you blow it up it only costs $6,000 to
get<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.259> back<00:01:49.409> from<00:01:49.530> whores<00:01:49.770> mutual<00:01:50.130> which<00:01:50.280> is

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
get it back from whores mutual which is

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.100 
get it back from whores mutual which is
definitely<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> lot<00:01:51.000> better<00:01:51.180> than<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.509> 12,000

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
definitely a lot better than the 12,000

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.109 
definitely a lot better than the 12,000
for<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> adder<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.799> then<00:01:53.220> like<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> 10,000

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
for the adder and then like the 10,000

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.359 
for the adder and then like the 10,000
for<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> entity<00:01:54.710> doesn't<00:01:55.710> be<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.920> pretty<00:01:56.159> quick

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
for the entity doesn't be a pretty quick

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.310 
for the entity doesn't be a pretty quick
commentary<00:01:57.000> I'll<00:01:57.210> let<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.540> videos<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.110> then

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
commentary I'll let the videos and then

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.899 
commentary I'll let the videos and then
the<00:01:58.469> races<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:58.979> stuff<00:01:59.159> play<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.729> can

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the races and stuff play and you can

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.219 
the races and stuff play and you can
hear<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> engines<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.810> everything<00:02:00.869> it

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
hear the engines and everything it

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.470 
hear the engines and everything it
sounds<00:02:01.469> pretty<00:02:01.619> cool<00:02:01.770> I'm<00:02:01.950> not<00:02:01.979> gonna<00:02:02.219> lie

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
sounds pretty cool I'm not gonna lie

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.900 
sounds pretty cool I'm not gonna lie

do<00:02:08.390> you<00:02:08.510> like<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.900> entity<00:02:09.440> do<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:09.680> like<00:02:09.860> the

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
do you like the entity do you like the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.660 
do you like the entity do you like the
adder<00:02:10.250> or<00:02:10.640> do<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.390> like<00:02:11.860> Turismo<00:02:12.860> again

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
adder or do you like Turismo again

adder or do you like Turismo again
another<00:02:13.910> plus<00:02:14.480> for<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.810> tourism<00:02:14.990> O's<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.470> think

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
another plus for the tourism O's I think

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.140 
another plus for the tourism O's I think
it<00:02:15.860> probably<00:02:16.160> looks<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.430> best<00:02:16.640> out<00:02:16.820> of<00:02:16.850> all<00:02:17.120> of

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
it probably looks the best out of all of

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.910 
it probably looks the best out of all of
them<00:02:17.450> but<00:02:17.900> that's<00:02:18.050> just<00:02:18.260> me<00:02:18.410> but<00:02:18.530> again<00:02:18.710> let<00:02:18.890> me

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
them but that's just me but again let me

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
them but that's just me but again let me
