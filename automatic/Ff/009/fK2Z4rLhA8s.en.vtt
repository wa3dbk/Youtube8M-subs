00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.480 

jetted<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> carbs<00:01:16.910> put<00:01:17.910> the<00:01:18.180> Kaufmann<00:01:19.490> stubby

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490

exhaust<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.590> runs<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:23.250> really<00:01:23.400> good

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
exhaust on it runs really really good

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.100

you<00:01:25.680> get<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> little<00:01:26.670> D<00:01:26.880> cell<00:01:27.590> on<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.770> down<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
you get a little D cell on the down to

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.680 
you get a little D cell on the down to
starting<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.170> get<00:01:31.229> used<00:01:31.410> to<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:33.470> don't<00:01:34.470> know

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
starting to get used to it I don't know

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:51.800 
starting to get used to it I don't know
it<00:01:36.690> can<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:36.869> annoying<00:01:38.600> anyway

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.300 

so

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.640 

it's<00:01:58.310> basically<00:01:58.700> all<00:01:58.910> stock<00:01:59.480> except<00:02:00.200> for<00:02:00.380> some

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
it's basically all stock except for some

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.360 
it's basically all stock except for some
aftermarket<00:02:01.390> parts<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.890> getting<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:03.980> carbs

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
aftermarket parts and getting the carbs

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.200 
aftermarket parts and getting the carbs
