00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.190
 i 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.039
 from the heart 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:28.589
 of my eyes that were born around here 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:32.279

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:34.699
 his house that has come because he wants to be 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.699

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:43.460

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.790

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:51.290
 I have saved every race that I wrote with 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.620

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.899
 hands and with the rain consulted 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.899

 [Music] 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.120

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:44.239
 and get me out of your life and your mind 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:44.239
 [Music] 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.360

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.100
 [Music] 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.650
 in general 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:36.210
 with his white handkerchiefs applauding the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:38.220
 Ã“scar arturo good performance this 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.160
 part of the interpretations closes 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.860

 It was gratifying to see what was seen 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.810
 because sometimes we fall a bit 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.299
 indefinition we would be judges and 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.900
 we would put qualifications 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.040
 or we are critical because we criticize 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.599

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.340

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.340

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.930

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.480
