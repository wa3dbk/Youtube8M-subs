special saw tell me about this this is a
it's<00:01:01.659> a<00:01:01.869> Griffin<00:01:02.439> aqua<00:01:02.769> saw<00:01:02.920> basically<00:01:03.519> I

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
it's a Griffin aqua saw basically I

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.090 
it's a Griffin aqua saw basically I
think<00:01:04.030> it<00:01:04.299> was<00:01:04.420> made<00:01:04.629> originally<00:01:05.229> for<00:01:05.260> cutting

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
think it was made originally for cutting

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.000 
think it was made originally for cutting
tile<00:01:06.400> for<00:01:07.229> bathrooms<00:01:08.229> and<00:01:08.470> things<00:01:08.560> like<00:01:08.799> that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
tile for bathrooms and things like that

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.149 
tile for bathrooms and things like that
and<00:01:09.250> somebody<00:01:10.150> somewhere<00:01:10.360> went<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.170> decided

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
and somebody somewhere went and decided

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.530 
and somebody somewhere went and decided
they<00:01:12.250> could<00:01:12.400> put<00:01:12.520> salt<00:01:12.729> water<00:01:12.909> in<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.180> base<00:01:13.330> of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
they could put salt water in the base of

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.109 
they could put salt water in the base of
it<00:01:13.689> and<00:01:13.810> have<00:01:14.110> it<00:01:14.580> automatically<00:01:15.580> cool<00:01:15.880> in<00:01:16.030> the

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
it and have it automatically cool in the

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.420 
it and have it automatically cool in the
corals<00:01:16.450> as<00:01:16.630> their<00:01:16.810> as<00:01:17.290> their<00:01:17.560> being<00:01:17.799> frags<00:01:18.100> so

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
corals as their as their being frags so

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.819 
corals as their as their being frags so
it's<00:01:19.119> a<00:01:19.270> pretty<00:01:19.479> awesome<00:01:21.360> unintentional

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
it's a pretty awesome unintentional

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.230 
it's a pretty awesome unintentional
benefit<00:01:23.829> of<00:01:23.979> this<00:01:24.100> saw<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:24.640> this<00:01:24.909> is<00:01:25.030> one<00:01:25.180> of

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
benefit of this saw so this is one of

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.940 
benefit of this saw so this is one of
the<00:01:25.360> most<00:01:25.479> popular<00:01:25.930> ones<00:01:26.170> in<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.500> industry

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
the most popular ones in the industry

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.970 
the most popular ones in the industry
right<00:01:27.100> now<00:01:27.630> basically<00:01:28.630> with<00:01:29.230> this<00:01:29.380> one<00:01:29.620> you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
right now basically with this one you

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.820 
right now basically with this one you
have<00:01:30.010> a<00:01:30.159> water<00:01:30.880> reservoir<00:01:31.210> in<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.690> bottom<00:01:32.110> so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
have a water reservoir in the bottom so

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.790 
have a water reservoir in the bottom so
that<00:01:33.640> water<00:01:33.880> is<00:01:34.030> constantly<00:01:34.360> cooling<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.260> the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
that water is constantly cooling the the

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.590 
that water is constantly cooling the the
blade<00:01:36.070> as<00:01:36.280> its<00:01:36.490> cutting<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:36.850> coral<00:01:37.150> so<00:01:37.330> as<00:01:37.450> it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
blade as its cutting the coral so as it

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.120 
blade as its cutting the coral so as it
cuts<00:01:37.780> through<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.140> calcium<00:01:38.590> skeleton

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
cuts through the calcium skeleton

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.670 
cuts through the calcium skeleton
normally<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.390> would<00:01:40.570> heat<00:01:40.750> up<00:01:40.780> pretty<00:01:41.050> pretty

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
normally it would heat up pretty pretty

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.649 
normally it would heat up pretty pretty
high<00:01:41.890> so<00:01:42.250> it<00:01:42.430> would<00:01:42.610> can<00:01:42.790> potentially<00:01:43.390> damage

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
high so it would can potentially damage

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.830 
high so it would can potentially damage
the<00:01:43.870> coral<00:01:44.430> beyond<00:01:45.430> repair<00:01:45.760> there<00:01:46.090> this<00:01:46.630> way

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
the coral beyond repair there this way

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.010 
the coral beyond repair there this way
it<00:01:46.990> keeps<00:01:47.140> it<00:01:47.380> cool<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:47.710> keep<00:01:47.860> saltwater<00:01:48.250> on<00:01:48.520> it

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
it keeps it cool to keep saltwater on it

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.690 
it keeps it cool to keep saltwater on it
you<00:01:50.020> know<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.170> can<00:01:50.440> virtually<00:01:51.190> have<00:01:51.670> no

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
you know you can virtually have no

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.880 
you know you can virtually have no
issues<00:01:52.390> with<00:01:52.630> with<00:01:52.960> fraggin<00:01:53.409> it<00:01:53.500> makes<00:01:53.650> it<00:01:53.799> a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
issues with with fraggin it makes it a

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.550 
issues with with fraggin it makes it a
lot<00:01:54.190> quicker<00:01:54.790> healing<00:01:55.540> time<00:01:55.870> on<00:01:56.049> the<00:01:56.140> coils<00:01:56.440> as

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
lot quicker healing time on the coils as

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.789 
lot quicker healing time on the coils as
well<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:58.000> were<00:01:58.090> fraggin<00:01:58.540> a<00:01:58.690> acanthus<00:01:59.530> TRAI

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
well we were fraggin a acanthus TRAI

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.330 
well we were fraggin a acanthus TRAI

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
lord who insists an australian basically

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.920 
lord who insists an australian basically
a<00:02:03.400> closed<00:02:03.670> brain<00:02:03.970> coral<00:02:04.390> it's<00:02:04.659> one<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:04.870> the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
a closed brain coral it's one of the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.890 
a closed brain coral it's one of the
most<00:02:05.080> popular<00:02:05.500> corals<00:02:05.799> out<00:02:05.920> of<00:02:06.040> australia

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
most popular corals out of australia

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.210 
most popular corals out of australia
this<00:02:07.900> particular<00:02:08.200> one<00:02:08.470> has<00:02:08.649> really<00:02:08.890> good

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
this particular one has really good

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.339 
this particular one has really good
polyps<00:02:10.000> separation<00:02:10.599> so<00:02:10.780> we<00:02:10.989> should<00:02:11.170> be<00:02:11.260> able

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
polyps separation so we should be able

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.610 
polyps separation so we should be able
to<00:02:11.500> get<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.680> cut<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.370> actually<00:02:13.440> frag<00:02:14.440> out

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
to get a cut and actually frag out

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.770 
to get a cut and actually frag out
individual<00:02:15.430> polyps<00:02:15.819> if<00:02:15.970> we<00:02:16.060> wanted<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.480> so

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
individual polyps if we wanted to so

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.380 
individual polyps if we wanted to so
this<00:02:17.590> is<00:02:17.769> a<00:02:17.799> really<00:02:18.489> good<00:02:18.730> piece<00:02:18.940> for<00:02:19.269> that

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
this is a really good piece for that

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.160 
this is a really good piece for that
we've<00:02:20.200> already<00:02:21.659> kind<00:02:22.659> of<00:02:22.750> pushed<00:02:22.959> all<00:02:23.140> the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
we've already kind of pushed all the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.899 
we've already kind of pushed all the
water<00:02:23.470> out<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.980> actual<00:02:24.310> tissue<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.879> the

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
water out of the actual tissue of the

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.050 
water out of the actual tissue of the
coral<00:02:25.269> so<00:02:25.480> we're<00:02:25.659> pretty<00:02:25.810> much<00:02:26.640> at<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.879> base

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
coral so we're pretty much at the base

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.339 
coral so we're pretty much at the base
skeleton<00:02:28.629> so<00:02:28.780> it's<00:02:28.959> not<00:02:29.080> going<00:02:29.290> to

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
skeleton so it's not going to

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.559 
skeleton so it's not going to
necessarily<00:02:29.470> tear<00:02:30.220> any<00:02:30.430> tissue

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
necessarily tear any tissue

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.420 
necessarily tear any tissue
as<00:02:31.780> we're<00:02:32.019> cutting<00:02:32.200> how<00:02:32.799> did<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.040> push<00:02:33.249> some

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
as we're cutting how did you push some

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.640 
as we're cutting how did you push some
water<00:02:33.640> out<00:02:33.879> of<00:02:33.909> the<00:02:34.090> skeleton<00:02:34.469> basically<00:02:35.469> just

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
water out of the skeleton basically just

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.369 
water out of the skeleton basically just
agitate<00:02:36.159> the<00:02:36.280> coral<00:02:36.609> when<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.329> when<00:02:38.019> it<00:02:38.049> first

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
agitate the coral when it when it first

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.679 
agitate the coral when it when it first
gets<00:02:38.650> agitated<00:02:39.310> it's<00:02:39.939> gonna<00:02:40.060> automatically

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
gets agitated it's gonna automatically

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.300 
gets agitated it's gonna automatically
do<00:02:40.959> that<00:02:40.989> that's<00:02:41.469> one<00:02:41.739> of<00:02:41.829> its<00:02:41.920> defense

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
do that that's one of its defense

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.759 
do that that's one of its defense
mechanisms<00:02:42.939> and<00:02:43.120> will<00:02:43.689> actually<00:02:44.109> gently<00:02:44.560> rub

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
mechanisms and will actually gently rub

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.410 
mechanisms and will actually gently rub
our<00:02:44.920> hand<00:02:45.189> across<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.790> top<00:02:45.969> of<00:02:45.999> the<00:02:46.209> coil

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
our hand across the top of the coil

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.899 
our hand across the top of the coil
which<00:02:46.989> is<00:02:47.019> agitated<00:02:47.769> even<00:02:48.010> more<00:02:48.159> and<00:02:48.489> just<00:02:48.519> I

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
which is agitated even more and just I

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.589 
which is agitated even more and just I
guess<00:02:50.010> allows<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.219> or<00:02:51.370> forces<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.389> push

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
guess allows it or forces it to push

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.819 
guess allows it or forces it to push
that<00:02:52.780> water<00:02:52.989> out<00:02:55.079> exactly<00:02:56.079> if<00:02:56.469> we<00:02:56.680> were

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
that water out exactly if we were

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.099 
that water out exactly if we were
actually<00:02:57.250> gonna<00:02:57.909> cut<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.419> coral<00:02:58.750> without

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
actually gonna cut the coral without

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.869 
actually gonna cut the coral without
doing<00:02:59.439> this<00:02:59.530> I<00:02:59.709> think<00:02:59.769> it<00:03:00.010> tears<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.549> flesh<00:03:00.849> a

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
doing this I think it tears the flesh a

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.610 
doing this I think it tears the flesh a
lot<00:03:01.090> more<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.719> healing<00:03:02.079> time<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.409> a<00:03:02.439> lot

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
lot more the healing time is a lot

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.229 
lot more the healing time is a lot
greater<00:03:02.889> and<00:03:03.129> you<00:03:03.249> have<00:03:03.370> more<00:03:03.939> potential

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
greater and you have more potential

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.039 
greater and you have more potential
damage<00:03:04.980> basically<00:03:05.980> all<00:03:06.159> I'm<00:03:06.310> gonna<00:03:06.519> do<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:07.810> try

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
damage basically all I'm gonna do is try

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.869 
damage basically all I'm gonna do is try
to<00:03:08.079> find<00:03:08.379> a<00:03:08.560> little<00:03:08.799> path<00:03:09.010> before<00:03:09.340> we<00:03:09.639> start

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
to find a little path before we start

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.659 
to find a little path before we start
cutting<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.359> where<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.569> want<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.930> cut<00:03:11.669> typically

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:12.669 
cutting on where I want to cut typically

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.039 
cutting on where I want to cut typically
with<00:03:12.819> something<00:03:13.150> like<00:03:13.299> this<00:03:13.510> I<00:03:13.719> think<00:03:13.930> what

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
with something like this I think what

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.330 
with something like this I think what
we're<00:03:14.199> going<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.379> do<00:03:14.560> is<00:03:14.709> cut<00:03:14.949> this<00:03:15.099> piece

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
we're going to do is cut this piece

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.399 
we're going to do is cut this piece
right<00:03:15.579> here<00:03:15.639> so<00:03:16.120> we're<00:03:16.689> gonna<00:03:16.780> have<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.019> small

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
right here so we're gonna have a small

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:23.039 
right here so we're gonna have a small
fried<00:03:19.199> key<00:03:20.199> to<00:03:20.319> this<00:03:20.439> is<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.769> go<00:03:20.799> slow<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:22.049> have

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
fried key to this is to go slow and have

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.890 
fried key to this is to go slow and have
controlled<00:03:24.870> movements

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
controlled movements

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.600 
controlled movements
so<00:03:27.470> that<00:03:27.650> you<00:03:27.769> don't<00:03:27.980> accidentally<00:03:28.519> cut

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
so that you don't accidentally cut

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.059 
so that you don't accidentally cut
through<00:03:28.970> a<00:03:29.000> polyp<00:03:29.450> but<00:03:30.409> you're<00:03:30.590> not<00:03:30.680> wanting

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
through a polyp but you're not wanting

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.580 
through a polyp but you're not wanting
to

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.800 

most<00:03:37.190> of<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.459> intentions<00:03:38.060> of<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.270> frakkers

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
most of the intentions of the frakkers

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.110 
most of the intentions of the frakkers
is<00:03:38.959> going<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.200> be<00:03:39.500> for<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.280> value<00:03:40.670> actually<00:03:41.030> of

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
is going to be for the value actually of

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.960 
is going to be for the value actually of
the<00:03:41.240> coral<00:03:41.569> will<00:03:41.720> be<00:03:41.750> per<00:03:42.410> policy<00:03:42.709> so<00:03:43.700> most

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
the coral will be per policy so most

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.180 
the coral will be per policy so most
people<00:03:44.090> don't<00:03:44.270> want<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.720> risk<00:03:45.350> cutting<00:03:46.010> one<00:03:46.160> of

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
people don't want to risk cutting one of

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.010 
people don't want to risk cutting one of
the<00:03:46.340> polyps<00:03:46.670> in<00:03:46.819> half

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.250 

all<00:03:51.560> right<00:03:51.970> so<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.300> get<00:03:53.390> a<00:03:53.450> clean<00:03:53.750> cut<00:03:53.780> right

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
all right so you get a clean cut right

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.950 
all right so you get a clean cut right
through<00:03:54.290> it<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:56.180> stays<00:03:56.450> wet<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.870> whole

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
through it and it stays wet the whole

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.320 
through it and it stays wet the whole
time<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.500> very<00:03:57.680> very<00:03:57.920> little<00:03:58.280> very<00:03:59.060> little

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
time and very very little very little

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.260 
time and very very little very little
damage<00:04:00.220> so<00:04:01.220> now<00:04:01.370> you've<00:04:01.550> got<00:04:01.580> a<00:04:01.730> small<00:04:02.060> piece

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
damage so now you've got a small piece

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.300 
damage so now you've got a small piece
there

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.880 

how<00:04:06.790> many<00:04:06.970> polyps<00:04:07.330> on<00:04:07.480> that<00:04:07.690> this<00:04:08.260> one<00:04:08.500> we<00:04:08.650> have

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
how many polyps on that this one we have

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.800 
how many polyps on that this one we have
let's<00:04:09.190> see<00:04:09.280> one<00:04:09.489> two<00:04:09.700> three<00:04:09.970> four<00:04:10.270> five<00:04:10.569> six

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
let's see one two three four five six

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.160 
let's see one two three four five six
seven<00:04:11.640> there's<00:04:12.640> a<00:04:12.700> partial<00:04:13.360> polyp<00:04:13.780> here<00:04:13.959> that

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
seven there's a partial polyp here that

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.570 
seven there's a partial polyp here that
eventually<00:04:14.380> will<00:04:14.680> grow<00:04:14.860> into<00:04:15.160> another<00:04:15.250> one

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
eventually will grow into another one

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.879 
eventually will grow into another one
but<00:04:15.870> technically<00:04:16.870> that's<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.230> seven<00:04:17.560> polyp

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
but technically that's a seven polyp

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.479 
but technically that's a seven polyp
frag<00:04:18.269> now<00:04:19.269> we<00:04:20.049> can<00:04:20.200> actually<00:04:20.380> cut<00:04:20.829> individual

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
frag now we can actually cut individual

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.490 
frag now we can actually cut individual
polyps<00:04:21.820> with<00:04:21.970> this<00:04:22.090> saw<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.330> blade<00:04:23.050> is<00:04:23.230> fairly

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
polyps with this saw the blade is fairly

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.760 
polyps with this saw the blade is fairly
small<00:04:23.710> so<00:04:24.280> that<00:04:24.810> way<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:25.870> can<00:04:26.169> maximize<00:04:26.740> your

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
small so that way you can maximize your

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.760 
small so that way you can maximize your
I<00:04:27.340> guess<00:04:28.150> profit<00:04:28.720> as<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:28.900> store<00:04:29.230> or<00:04:29.260> as<00:04:29.740> a

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
I guess profit as a store or as a

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.400 
I guess profit as a store or as a
hobbyist<00:04:30.730> if<00:04:31.450> you're<00:04:31.660> cutting<00:04:31.960> these<00:04:32.050> up<00:04:32.260> and

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
hobbyist if you're cutting these up and

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.830 
hobbyist if you're cutting these up and
selling<00:04:32.710> them<00:04:33.090> I'm<00:04:34.090> gonna<00:04:34.270> try<00:04:34.450> to<00:04:34.510> get<00:04:34.660> this

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
selling them I'm gonna try to get this

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.760 
selling them I'm gonna try to get this
one<00:04:35.080> individual<00:04:35.620> polyp<00:04:36.070> out<00:04:37.410> this<00:04:38.410> one<00:04:38.650> is

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
one individual polyp out this one is

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:53.950 
one individual polyp out this one is
very<00:04:39.070> very<00:04:39.280> tedious

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.770 

all<00:04:54.289> right<00:04:55.090> that<00:04:56.090> worked<00:04:56.300> out<00:04:56.449> pretty<00:04:56.509> well

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
all right that worked out pretty well

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.350 
all right that worked out pretty well
and<00:04:56.900> then<00:04:57.229> typically<00:04:57.680> we've<00:04:58.669> got<00:04:58.819> some<00:04:59.000> excess

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
and then typically we've got some excess

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.840 
and then typically we've got some excess
skeleton<00:04:59.900> down<00:05:00.050> here<00:05:00.319> that<00:05:00.500> wouldn't<00:05:00.919> sit

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
skeleton down here that wouldn't sit

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.689 
skeleton down here that wouldn't sit
flat<00:05:02.199> so<00:05:03.199> we<00:05:03.440> typically<00:05:03.830> go<00:05:04.069> back<00:05:04.310> and<00:05:04.520> try<00:05:04.669> to

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
flat so we typically go back and try to

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.870 
flat so we typically go back and try to
clean<00:05:05.030> it<00:05:05.180> up<00:05:05.590> so<00:05:06.590> that<00:05:06.770> it<00:05:06.860> will<00:05:06.949> glue<00:05:07.490> down<00:05:07.669> to

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
clean it up so that it will glue down to

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.040 
clean it up so that it will glue down to
the<00:05:08.000> frag<00:05:08.240> plug<00:05:08.539> easier<00:05:10.389> the<00:05:11.389> key<00:05:11.630> is<00:05:11.780> not

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
the frag plug easier the key is not

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.640 
the frag plug easier the key is not
cutting<00:05:12.380> too<00:05:12.620> deep<00:05:13.190> into<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:14.440> skeleton<00:05:15.440> so

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
cutting too deep into the skeleton so

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.180 
cutting too deep into the skeleton so
that<00:05:15.800> you<00:05:15.919> don't<00:05:16.099> get<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.370> tissue<00:05:16.580> there<00:05:16.880> so

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.340 

and<00:05:19.670> that<00:05:19.790> sits<00:05:20.090> flat<00:05:20.330> it'll<00:05:20.870> easily<00:05:21.050> glue

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
and that sits flat it'll easily glue

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.340 
and that sits flat it'll easily glue
down<00:05:21.530> to<00:05:21.740> a<00:05:21.770> frag<00:05:22.490> plug<00:05:22.790> and<00:05:23.060> we're<00:05:24.050> good<00:05:24.200> to<00:05:24.230> go

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
down to a frag plug and we're good to go

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.440 
down to a frag plug and we're good to go
once<00:05:24.860> you<00:05:25.040> get<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.220> cut<00:05:25.520> and<00:05:25.730> flatten<00:05:26.150> out<00:05:26.270> on

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
once you get a cut and flatten out on

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.930 
once you get a cut and flatten out on
the<00:05:26.570> bottom<00:05:26.870> it's<00:05:27.080> time<00:05:27.320> to<00:05:27.610> pull<00:05:28.610> it<00:05:28.700> onto

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
the bottom it's time to pull it onto

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.270 
the bottom it's time to pull it onto
your<00:05:29.030> frag<00:05:29.270> plug<00:05:29.740> this<00:05:30.740> is<00:05:30.860> just<00:05:31.040> a<00:05:31.100> little

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
your frag plug this is just a little

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.510 
your frag plug this is just a little
ceramic<00:05:31.700> frag<00:05:32.060> plug<00:05:32.330> and<00:05:32.540> we've<00:05:32.630> got<00:05:33.280> icy<00:05:34.280> gel

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
ceramic frag plug and we've got icy gel

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.390 
ceramic frag plug and we've got icy gel
which<00:05:34.760> is<00:05:34.790> basically<00:05:35.330> superglue<00:05:36.020> gel<00:05:36.260> a<00:05:37.040> lot

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
which is basically superglue gel a lot

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.100 
which is basically superglue gel a lot
of<00:05:37.490> people<00:05:37.700> use<00:05:38.030> this<00:05:38.180> stuff<00:05:38.390> you<00:05:38.510> can<00:05:38.660> find<00:05:38.840> at

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
of people use this stuff you can find at

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.410 
of people use this stuff you can find at
the<00:05:39.290> dollar<00:05:39.980> store<00:05:40.160> for<00:05:40.670> a<00:05:40.700> real<00:05:40.910> cheap

Marine<00:05:43.940> has<00:05:44.060> a<00:05:44.120> really<00:05:44.450> nice<00:05:44.570> one<00:05:45.940> basically

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
Marine has a really nice one basically

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.900 
Marine has a really nice one basically
we<00:05:47.150> just<00:05:47.180> put<00:05:47.540> a<00:05:47.570> small<00:05:47.870> little<00:05:48.730> little<00:05:49.730> dab

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
we just put a small little little dab

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.600 
we just put a small little little dab
right<00:05:49.940> there<00:05:52.450> take<00:05:53.450> the<00:05:53.570> frag<00:05:54.370> blow<00:05:55.370> any

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
right there take the frag blow any

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.140 
right there take the frag blow any
standing<00:05:56.030> water<00:05:56.090> off<00:05:56.510> of<00:05:56.540> it<00:05:57.040> and<00:05:58.040> just<00:05:58.910> set<00:05:59.120> it

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
standing water off of it and just set it

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.390 
standing water off of it and just set it
down<00:05:59.270> flat

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.689 

and<00:06:02.540> typically<00:06:03.540> in<00:06:04.380> a<00:06:04.860> minute<00:06:05.160> or<00:06:05.280> two<00:06:05.430> we'll

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 
and typically in a minute or two we'll

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.240 
and typically in a minute or two we'll
set<00:06:05.940> it<00:06:05.970> down<00:06:06.090> so<00:06:06.449> that<00:06:06.570> it<00:06:06.720> can<00:06:06.870> dry<00:06:07.020> and<00:06:08.009> in<00:06:08.190> a

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
set it down so that it can dry and in a

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.610 
set it down so that it can dry and in a
minute<00:06:08.370> or<00:06:08.580> two<00:06:08.759> that'll<00:06:09.120> be<00:06:09.210> dry<00:06:09.479> you<00:06:09.720> can<00:06:09.930> put

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
minute or two that'll be dry you can put

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.980 
minute or two that'll be dry you can put
it<00:06:10.740> right<00:06:10.770> in<00:06:11.070> the<00:06:11.250> in<00:06:12.150> the<00:06:12.300> tank<00:06:12.509> in<00:06:12.660> your<00:06:12.690> frag
