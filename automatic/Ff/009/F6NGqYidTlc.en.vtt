cuts in fact starting this mower
couldn't<00:00:30.929> be<00:00:31.109> easier<00:00:31.590> with<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> honda<00:00:32.250> easy

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
couldn't be easier with the honda easy

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.729 
couldn't be easier with the honda easy
start<00:00:32.969> engine<00:00:33.510> when<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.020> cold<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.469> need<00:00:34.620> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
start engine when it's cold we need to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.740 
start engine when it's cold we need to
put<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> choke<00:00:35.190> lever<00:00:35.219> down<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.059> hold<00:00:36.570> back

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
put the choke lever down and hold back

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.810 
put the choke lever down and hold back
the<00:00:36.960> red<00:00:37.110> lever<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> safety<00:00:38.670> feature

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the red lever this is a safety feature

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.280 
the red lever this is a safety feature
that<00:00:39.090> as<00:00:39.210> soon<00:00:39.420> as<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.660> release<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
that as soon as you release it the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.200 
that as soon as you release it the
engine<00:00:40.649> will<00:00:40.800> cut<00:00:41.040> out<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> lever

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
engine will cut out so it's the lever

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.389 
engine will cut out so it's the lever
back<00:00:42.450> choke<00:00:42.989> down<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.770> when<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:43.980> want<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.250> move

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
back choke down and when we want to move

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.310 
back choke down and when we want to move
off<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.730> Drive<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.210> use<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> black<00:00:45.719> lever<00:00:45.989> at

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
off in Drive we use the black lever at

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.350 
off in Drive we use the black lever at
the<00:00:46.770> back<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.399> let's<00:00:47.430> give<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.969> pull<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.239> see

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the back so let's give it a pull and see

00:00:48.360 --> 00:01:03.010 
the back so let's give it a pull and see
what<00:00:48.539> happens

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.720 

this<00:01:04.020> smell<00:01:04.199> was<00:01:04.320> very<00:01:04.410> easy<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.100> use<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.610> it

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
this smell was very easy to use and it

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.550 
this smell was very easy to use and it
makes<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.970> really<00:01:06.000> neat<00:01:06.540> job<00:01:06.870> of<00:01:07.080> cutting<00:01:07.410> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
makes a really neat job of cutting the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.380 
makes a really neat job of cutting the
grass<00:01:07.740> now<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.430> remember<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> said<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.240> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
grass now if you remember I said this is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.390 
grass now if you remember I said this is
a<00:01:09.420> four<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.050> mower<00:01:10.470> which<00:01:10.800> means<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.250> got

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
a four in one mower which means it's got

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.400 
a four in one mower which means it's got
four<00:01:11.700> methods<00:01:12.120> of<00:01:12.480> mowing<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> grass<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
four methods of mowing the grass so the

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.080 
four methods of mowing the grass so the
way<00:01:13.500> I've<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:13.920> been<00:01:14.070> doing<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.000> would

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
way I've just been doing it is it would

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.540 
way I've just been doing it is it would
be<00:01:15.210> grass<00:01:15.390> box<00:01:15.780> attached<00:01:16.290> grass<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.100> blowing

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
be grass box attached grass is blowing

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.730 
be grass box attached grass is blowing
into<00:01:17.730> this<00:01:17.970> box<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.960> collects<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.470> from<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
into this box so it collects it from the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.680 
into this box so it collects it from the
lawn<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.400> dispose<00:01:20.760> of<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.510> that's

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
lawn and you can dispose of it so that's

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.290 
lawn and you can dispose of it so that's
method<00:01:22.110> one<00:01:22.350> method<00:01:23.010> two<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.700> what<00:01:23.940> we<00:01:24.060> call

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
method one method two is what we call

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.630 
method one method two is what we call
rear-discharge<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> grass<00:01:26.010> is<00:01:26.190> blown<00:01:26.430> out

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
rear-discharge so the grass is blown out

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.060 
rear-discharge so the grass is blown out
of<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> mower<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.140> flap<00:01:28.440> prevents<00:01:28.920> its

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
of the mower but this flap prevents its

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.410 
of the mower but this flap prevents its
spreading<00:01:29.430> all<00:01:29.550> over<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:30.120> it's<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.390> for

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
spreading all over and it's there for

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.030 
spreading all over and it's there for
safety<00:01:31.050> as<00:01:31.140> well<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.650> grass<00:01:31.830> is

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
safety as well so the grass is

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.310 
safety as well so the grass is
distributed<00:01:32.760> at<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.330> back<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.780> mower<00:01:33.960> and

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
distributed at the back of the mower and

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.749 
distributed at the back of the mower and
that's<00:01:34.530> ideal<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.250> beginning<00:01:35.550> of<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
that's ideal for the beginning of the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.609 
that's ideal for the beginning of the
season<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.360> end<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:36.780> season<00:01:37.170> when<00:01:37.530> you

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
season or the end of the season when you

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.410 
season or the end of the season when you
don't<00:01:37.800> want<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.130> know<00:01:38.250> quite<00:01:38.550> as<00:01:38.820> close<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
don't want to know quite as close and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.510 
don't want to know quite as close and
you<00:01:39.990> all<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.560> lift<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> height<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.340> cut

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
you all you do is lift the height of cut

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.040 
you all you do is lift the height of cut
and<00:01:41.729> take<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:42.060> top<00:01:42.210> off<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.420> grass

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
and take the top off the grass

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.719 
and take the top off the grass
so<00:01:43.140> that's<00:01:43.350> method<00:01:43.770> two<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.400> there<00:01:44.520> are<00:01:44.580> also

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
so that's method two but there are also

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.060 
so that's method two but there are also
two<00:01:45.360> more<00:01:45.390> methods<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.350> mower<00:01:46.590> uses

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
two more methods that this mower uses

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.310 
two more methods that this mower uses
the<00:01:47.670> third<00:01:47.910> method<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.570> mulching<00:01:49.080> and<00:01:49.200> that's

into the thickness of the Lord and we

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.800 
into the thickness of the Lord and we
can<00:01:59.070> start<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.670> happening<00:02:00.180> by<00:02:00.330> putting<00:02:00.690> in

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
can start that happening by putting in

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.410 
can start that happening by putting in
this<00:02:00.960> much<00:02:01.290> blood<00:02:01.710> which<00:02:02.250> blocks<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.790> exit

this much blood which blocks the exit

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.060 
this much blood which blocks the exit
for<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.630> grass<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.290> can't<00:02:04.530> get<00:02:04.710> out

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070

and<00:02:05.160> it<00:02:05.460> motors<00:02:05.880> inside<00:02:06.030> them<00:02:06.420> are<00:02:06.510> and<00:02:06.780> that's

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
and it motors inside them are and that's

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.350 
and it motors inside them are and that's
ideal<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.770> use<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.310> summer<00:02:08.550> when<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.119> dry

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360

conditions we mow regularly mulch as it

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.670 
conditions we mow regularly mulch as it
down<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> mulch<00:02:12.750> actually<00:02:13.200> helps<00:02:13.530> to

down and the mulch actually helps to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.320 
down and the mulch actually helps to
feed<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.100> lawn<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.459> keep<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.820> greener<00:02:15.090> for

discharge and we reduce that with the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.699 
discharge and we reduce that with the
mulch<00:02:20.220> plug<00:02:20.549> in<00:02:20.730> situ<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.200> ideal<00:02:22.620> for

we<00:02:26.730> simply<00:02:27.120> do<00:02:27.299> is<00:02:27.540> put<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.930> side<00:02:28.170> discharge

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
we simply do is put the side discharge

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.640 
we simply do is put the side discharge
chute<00:02:29.160> in<00:02:29.970> position<00:02:30.570> like<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.290> grass<00:02:31.470> is
