00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
it on a smith machine if you'd like to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.319 
it on a smith machine if you'd like to
begin<00:00:37.649> with<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:38.129> because<00:00:38.730> your<00:00:38.850> stabilizer

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
begin with just because your stabilizer

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.510 
begin with just because your stabilizer
muscles<00:00:39.480> won't<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.320> good<00:00:40.680> at<00:00:41.070> doing<00:00:41.430> this

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
muscles won't be as good at doing this

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.090 
muscles won't be as good at doing this
exercise<00:00:42.059> as<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.570> would<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> regular<00:00:43.020> grip<00:00:43.530> but

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
exercise as you would a regular grip but

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.080 
exercise as you would a regular grip but
this<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.399> probably<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> best

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
this is probably one of the best

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.090 
this is probably one of the best
exercises<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.719> help<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.170> bust<00:00:46.800> through<00:00:47.010> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
exercises to help you bust through a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.069 
exercises to help you bust through a
plateau<00:00:47.370> or<00:00:47.700> develop<00:00:48.090> your<00:00:48.120> chest<00:00:48.420> further<00:00:48.750> so

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
plateau or develop your chest further so

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.240 
plateau or develop your chest further so
let's<00:00:49.320> get<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.680> I'm<00:00:49.860> going<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.010> show<00:00:50.160> you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
let's get to it I'm going to show you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.510 
let's get to it I'm going to show you
exactly<00:00:50.489> how<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:50.910> done<00:00:51.469> so<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.829> setup<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.280> no

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
exactly how it's done so the setup is no

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.069 
exactly how it's done so the setup is no
different<00:00:53.940> than<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.059> regular<00:00:54.449> bench<00:00:54.629> press<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
different than a regular bench press the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.200 
different than a regular bench press the
only<00:00:55.469> difference<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.489> our<00:00:56.640> hands<00:00:56.879> are

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
only difference is that our hands are

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.970 
only difference is that our hands are
going<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.449> inverted<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.590> reverse

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
going to be inverted so it's a reverse

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.189 
going to be inverted so it's a reverse
grip<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.879> we<00:01:00.120> don't<00:01:00.270> want<00:01:00.390> them<00:01:00.510> too<00:01:00.690> far<00:01:00.930> away

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
grip and we don't want them too far away

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.410 
grip and we don't want them too far away
just<00:01:01.440> about<00:01:02.010> shoulder<00:01:02.430> width<00:01:02.640> apart<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
just about shoulder width apart and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.520 
just about shoulder width apart and
you're<00:01:03.600> really<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.989> squeeze<00:01:04.320> at<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
you're really going to squeeze at the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.109 
you're really going to squeeze at the
top<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.979> your<00:01:05.040> chest<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.519> each<00:01:05.790> movement

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
top of your chest on each movement

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.289 
top of your chest on each movement
really<00:01:06.930> push<00:01:07.590> out<00:01:07.830> contract<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.939> muscle

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
really push out contract the muscle

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.280 
really push out contract the muscle
that's<00:01:09.420> why<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.659> got<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.810> keep<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.110> mind
