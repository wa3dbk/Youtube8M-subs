um<00:02:47.239> gregorich<00:02:48.239> Greek<00:02:48.810> oregano<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.769> this<00:02:49.950> came

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
um gregorich Greek oregano so this came

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.420 
um gregorich Greek oregano so this came
from<00:02:50.640> Greece<00:02:50.970> but<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.860> guess<00:02:52.860> it's<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.250> big

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
from Greece but I guess it's a big

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.720 
from Greece but I guess it's a big
difference<00:02:53.850> maker<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:54.360> if<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.540> can<00:02:54.690> get<00:02:54.930> some

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
difference maker so if you can get some

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.390 
difference maker so if you can get some
real<00:02:56.730> authentic<00:02:57.209> or<00:02:57.810> egg<00:02:57.959> anel<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.560> guess<00:02:59.070> it's

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
real authentic or egg anel I guess it's

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.490 
real authentic or egg anel I guess it's
way<00:02:59.819> better<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.420> way<00:03:00.660> but<00:03:01.019> if<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.290> don't

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
way better that way but if you don't

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.710 
way better that way but if you don't
have<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:01.890> can<00:03:02.040> use<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> regular<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:03.239> then

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
have it you can use a regular and then

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.030 
have it you can use a regular and then
we're<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:03.930> going<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.200> need<00:03:04.350> some<00:03:04.530> freshly

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040

grated<00:03:05.340> black<00:03:06.030> pepper<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:06.420> then<00:03:06.540> she<00:03:06.720> also

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
grated black pepper and then she also

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.380 
grated black pepper and then she also
uses<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.470> little<00:03:07.739> bit<00:03:07.890> of<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.250> Himalayan<00:03:08.790> sea

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390
