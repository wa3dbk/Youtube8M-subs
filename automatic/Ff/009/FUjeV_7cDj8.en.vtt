right<00:01:52.619> there<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.159> on<00:01:53.340> top<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:54.000> gotta

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
right there and on top of that we gotta

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.200 
right there and on top of that we gotta
split<00:01:54.420> lane<00:01:55.369> this<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> first<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:56.969> year

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
split lane this is the first this year

split lane this is the first this year
last<00:01:57.600> year<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:58.079> meeting<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.439> Minneapolis<00:01:59.100> I

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
last year was meeting a Minneapolis I

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.830 
last year was meeting a Minneapolis I
did<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.610> so<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.240> made<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> big<00:02:00.630> difference

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
did that so and I made a big difference

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.350 
did that so and I made a big difference
so<00:02:01.610> this<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.759> definitely<00:02:02.939> going<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.299> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
so this is definitely going to be a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.719 
so this is definitely going to be a
little<00:02:03.509> strategy<00:02:03.810> going<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.409> here<00:02:04.729> especially

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
little strategy going in here especially

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.889 
little strategy going in here especially
when<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.909> comes<00:02:06.060> down<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.450> last<00:02:06.659> couple

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
when it comes down to the last couple

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.669 
when it comes down to the last couple
laps<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.439> race<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:08.179> this<00:02:09.179> just<00:02:09.599> this<00:02:10.050> split

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
laps of the race so this just this split

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.839 
laps of the race so this just this split
lane<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.160> these<00:02:11.280> whoops<00:02:11.520> are<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:11.760> to

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
lane and these whoops are going to

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.339 
lane and these whoops are going to
definitely<00:02:12.060> be<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.569> key<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.140> race

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
definitely be the key of the race
