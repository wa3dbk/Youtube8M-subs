00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.440
 excellent and this time I bring you 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.570
 what is a tutorial on how 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.539
 fix the 100% luso on hard drives 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.339
 in windows 8 windows 8.1 this why 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.379
 because it happened to me gentlemen and the truth 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.270
 is that my computer was super slow 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.450
 because of it as you can see right now 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.220
 my hard drive is at 0% 15 but when 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.110
 I installed it because I did not have it installed 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.150
 last week to windows 8.1 in my 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.950
 main computer and I noticed that my 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.480
 hard disk worked constantly at 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:35.180
 100% 99 100% 99% I was researching in 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.239
 forums on web pages about the problem 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.800
 almost all in English and then I found the 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.750
 solution gentlemen as you can see right now 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.850
 my hard drive is running normally 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.340
 as it should be and it turns out that it is 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.230
 because windows 8 or windows 8.1 that 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.510
 you have then they have the 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.280
 settings to optimize your disks 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.200
 storage if your hard drives the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.690
 is optimized while you LAs 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.350
 are using this optimization can be 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.540
 weekly daily monthly gentlemen 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.760
 the first step to to fix this 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.080
 this problem would be to disable it and the 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.740
 next remove the files from 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.780
 pagination 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.000
 I did that and really notice a 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.700
 change, that is, you are 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.380
 seeing 10 percent and then for all 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.659
 you who have that problem here 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.460
 is the solution gentlemen ready good 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.020
 so let's start we're going to go 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.789
 which it is our home menu good will 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.950
 let's click on search and we'll 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.289
 write tools we will give you 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.909
 click on administrative tools we 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.759
 is going to send this screen we are going to 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.289
 simply focus on where it says 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.060
 defragment and optimize drives you 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.710
 We are going to double click and he will send us 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.869
 to this screen here as you can see me 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.970
 shows what my partitions are and 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.890
 as you can see I have it at the level of 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.630
 hard drive that is where I have my windows 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.490
 we're going to focus on the in 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.140
 where he says activate we are going to give him a 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.880
 click and we will skip this next 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.679
 window says programming the 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.649
 optimization as you can see I have it 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.720
 unchecked you default to it 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.030
 have marked and as I said 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.220
 says daily weekly and monthly 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.560
 we simply to optimize or you 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.880
 we are going to unmark we are going to give in 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.610
 to accept 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.009
 and we're going to give it in close good now 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.599
 what we just did is that the 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.849
 default optimization that I had 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.489
 our windows 8.1 was canceled ok 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.069
 we are going to have to do the 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.019
 optimization manually since you can 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.180
 optimize it automatically does not have 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.390
 nothing after this let's move on to 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.280
 next step what would be the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.540
 next good we're going to go direct 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.650
 to our team 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.420
 here in our team we will give 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.769
 Right click properties and we're going 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.900
 to go to configure a configuration 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.730
 advanced system is going to vote this 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.959
 small window there as you can see here 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.940
 says architecture configuration 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.280
 configuration let's click on the 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.549
 first and we will jump here we go 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.099
 to go to advanced options and it would be 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.650
 remove the paging files 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.480
 open memory to ok gentlemen like 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.920
 can see I have it at zero and then 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.160
 nothing gentlemen I think that you are going to 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.420
 have marked here in administer 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.700
 automatically the file size and 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.950
 They will simply uncheck it and 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.780
 let's put without page files 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.730
 this is going to be that it will not detect 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.180
 new errors save information from 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.640
 system nothing nothing 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.170
 hard disk is recommended and at the same time not 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.879
 to you simple if you have the 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.799
 problem it is recommended that they do so and 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.170
 Check it out by checking if it is 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.849
 really for that but if they continue if 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.500
 they notice that they have the same problem as 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.269
 system that keeps running the same 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.069
 level simply redial for 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.750
 have no problem remember 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.909
 that this is all under your consent 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.950
 Well, as you can see, I have it 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.049
 paging files and I'll give you in 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.879
 accept they will ask you to restart it 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.500
 just restart it and they will have it 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.170
 normally they will give you to apply 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.720
 accept accept and can close 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.700
 all this restart and good to understand 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.680
 the changes good lords I decided to make 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.510
 this tutorial since there was a lot but 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.519
 many people having this error and 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.349
 some were solved to others not 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.689
 I simply ask for patience 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.579
 know your system well and that they are 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:59.609
 open mind to accept different 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:02.790
 forms or solutions for your computer 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:05.810
 remember that I went I am and I will be 09 and we 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.810
 we see in the next
