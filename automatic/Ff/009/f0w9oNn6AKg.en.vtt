so you can see how that looks

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.960 
so you can see how that looks
that<00:03:48.209> does<00:03:48.510> look<00:03:48.870> better<00:03:49.590> there's<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.640> soft

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
some flaxseed gel or some kind of gel at

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.759 
some flaxseed gel or some kind of gel at
the<00:04:02.609> end<00:04:02.819> so<00:04:03.599> this<00:04:03.810> is<00:04:04.019> how<00:04:04.169> it<00:04:04.379> looks<00:04:04.620> like

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
the end so this is how it looks like

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.330 
the end so this is how it looks like
after<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.310> took<00:04:05.579> everything<00:04:05.909> down

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.630 

it's<00:04:10.270> really<00:04:10.720> soft<00:04:11.140> and<00:04:12.569> bouncy<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:15.160> ends<00:04:15.520> are

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
it's really soft and bouncy the ends are

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.479 
it's really soft and bouncy the ends are
the<00:04:15.730> only<00:04:15.819> ones<00:04:16.060> that<00:04:16.150> have<00:04:16.389> brought<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:16.780> about

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
the only ones that have brought it about

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.580 
the only ones that have brought it about
so<00:04:18.489> next<00:04:18.730> time<00:04:18.970> I<00:04:19.209> will<00:04:19.419> put<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.840> gel<00:04:20.109> at<00:04:20.470> the

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
so next time I will put the gel at the

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.500 
so next time I will put the gel at the
end<00:04:20.769> because<00:04:21.130> you<00:04:21.160> can<00:04:21.370> see<00:04:21.609> this<00:04:21.850> one<00:04:22.150> didn't

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
end because you can see this one didn't

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.950 
end because you can see this one didn't
really<00:04:22.840> set<00:04:23.169> well

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.439 

so<00:04:27.500> what<00:04:27.680> I'm<00:04:27.830> going<00:04:28.009> to<00:04:28.070> do<00:04:28.340> now<00:04:28.580> is<00:04:28.850> I'm<00:04:29.210> just

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
so what I'm going to do now is I'm just

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:50.550 
so what I'm going to do now is I'm just
going<00:04:29.630> to<00:04:29.660> start<00:04:29.990> separating<00:04:30.650> it

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.870 

so<00:04:51.070> this<00:04:51.250> is<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.370> final<00:04:51.820> result<00:04:52.000> and<00:04:52.890> I<00:04:53.890> like

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880
