00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
second-round picks which you know I

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.080 
second-round picks which you know I
thought<00:00:22.830> if<00:00:22.920> we<00:00:23.010> moved<00:00:23.220> up<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.519> was<00:00:23.670> sure<00:00:23.970> that

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
thought if we moved up I was sure that

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.310 
thought if we moved up I was sure that
we<00:00:24.240> would<00:00:24.359> be<00:00:24.449> able<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.720> do<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.019> but<00:00:25.199> it

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
we would be able to do that but it

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.099 
we would be able to do that but it
worked<00:00:25.470> out<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.680> way<00:00:26.150> you<00:00:27.150> know<00:00:27.720> Nick<00:00:27.930> really

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
worked out that way you know Nick really

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.130 
worked out that way you know Nick really
did<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.410> good<00:00:28.529> job<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.800> handling<00:00:29.699> those<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.359> I

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
did a good job of handling those and I

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.139 
did a good job of handling those and I
felt<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.130> got<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> good<00:00:32.399> value<00:00:32.759> for<00:00:32.790> him

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
felt like we got a good value for him

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.530 
felt like we got a good value for him
and<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.739> took<00:00:34.739> Dante<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.770> Chandler

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
and and took Dante and and Chandler

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.220 
and and took Dante and and Chandler
probably<00:00:39.540> could<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.690> been<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.960> either<00:00:40.079> order

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
probably could have been in either order

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.410 
probably could have been in either order
but<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.980> know<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.370> felt<00:00:41.610> like<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:41.910> would<00:00:42.270> have

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
but you know we felt like we would have

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.600 
but you know we felt like we would have
a<00:00:42.450> better<00:00:42.600> chance<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:43.079> get<00:00:43.260> end<00:00:43.530> up<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.430> both

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
a better chance to get end up with both

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.970 
a better chance to get end up with both
players<00:00:44.789> if<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.690> went<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.989> way<00:00:46.230> not<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.860> we

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
players if it went that way not that we

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.110 
players if it went that way not that we
were<00:00:47.070> sure<00:00:47.219> we're<00:00:47.399> going<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> second

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
were sure we're going to get the second

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.250 
were sure we're going to get the second
one<00:00:48.149> but<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.539> thought<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.809> might<00:00:48.840> have<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.079> shot

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
one but we thought it might have a shot

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.160 
one but we thought it might have a shot
at<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.570> you<00:00:51.570> know<00:00:51.600> looking<00:00:51.870> forward<00:00:52.050> to

took the value that we fought thought
was<00:02:42.049> best<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.379> we<00:02:42.500> cooked<00:02:42.739> like<00:02:42.920> we<00:02:43.069> always<00:02:43.220> do

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489

I<00:02:49.750> don't<00:02:50.750> know<00:02:51.970> just<00:02:52.970> try<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.239> prepare<00:02:53.420> for<00:02:53.599> and

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
I don't know just try to prepare for and

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.809 
I don't know just try to prepare for and
we<00:02:54.409> can't<00:02:54.829> predict<00:02:55.129> what's<00:02:55.310> going<00:02:55.430> to<00:02:55.489> happen

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
we can't predict what's going to happen

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.259 
we can't predict what's going to happen
so<00:02:56.060> just<00:02:57.040> watch<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.310> players<00:02:58.730> as<00:02:58.970> they<00:02:59.000> come

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.960 
so just watch the players as they come
off<00:02:59.299> and<00:02:59.889> when<00:03:00.889> we<00:03:01.010> have<00:03:01.159> opportunities<00:03:01.819> and

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
off and when we have opportunities and

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.280 
off and when we have opportunities and

Patriot's<00:06:48.140> uniform<00:06:48.500> yet<00:06:48.620> so<00:06:48.920> we'll<00:06:49.070> see<00:06:49.250> how

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
Patriot's uniform yet so we'll see how

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.570 
Patriot's uniform yet so we'll see how
they<00:06:49.550> do<00:06:49.610> once<00:06:49.940> a<00:06:50.560> you<00:06:51.560> know<00:06:51.650> get<00:06:52.280> into<00:06:52.520> our

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
they do once a you know get into our

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.700 
they do once a you know get into our
system<00:06:53.000> and<00:06:53.150> learn<00:06:53.930> what<00:06:54.110> to<00:06:54.260> do<00:06:54.380> and<00:06:54.590> we'll

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
system and learn what to do and we'll

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.910 
system and learn what to do and we'll
see<00:06:54.890> how<00:06:55.010> they<00:06:55.190> develop<00:06:55.640> but<00:06:55.880> I<00:06:56.800> think<00:06:57.800> both

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:57.920 
see how they develop but I think both

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.140 
see how they develop but I think both
guys<00:06:58.130> have<00:06:58.310> been<00:06:58.370> good<00:06:58.580> players<00:06:58.820> in<00:06:59.030> their

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
guys have been good players in their

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.610 
guys have been good players in their
systems<00:06:59.570> they're<00:06:59.780> both<00:06:59.960> smart<00:07:00.140> or<00:07:00.500> high

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620 
systems they're both smart or high

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.250 
systems they're both smart or high
quality<00:07:01.040> goes<00:07:01.510> they've<00:07:02.510> been<00:07:02.660> productive<00:07:02.960> in

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.260

quality goes they've been productive in
in<00:07:03.500> their<00:07:03.740> systems<00:07:04.130> hopefully<00:07:04.460> they'll<00:07:04.610> be<00:07:04.640> to

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:04.820 
in their systems hopefully they'll be to

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.630
