00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
there's another little speaker here this

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.120 
there's another little speaker here this
is<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.540> subwoofer<00:01:19.200> let's<00:01:19.530> just<00:01:19.710> kind<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.890> pump

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
is the subwoofer let's just kind of pump

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.680 
is the subwoofer let's just kind of pump
on<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.340> base<00:01:20.640> into<00:01:20.970> your<00:01:21.119> into<00:01:21.600> your<00:01:21.630> ears

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
on that base into your into your ears

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.940 
on that base into your into your ears
and<00:01:24.690> one<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.990> ideas<00:01:25.020> here<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.800> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and one of the ideas here is that the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.860 
and one of the ideas here is that the
you<00:01:26.130> know<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> sound<00:01:26.670> isn't<00:01:26.940> coming<00:01:27.390> through

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
you know the sound isn't coming through

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.660 
you know the sound isn't coming through
your<00:01:28.020> head<00:01:28.260> the<00:01:28.650> speakers<00:01:28.980> are<00:01:29.370> actually

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
your head the speakers are actually

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.640 
your head the speakers are actually
pointed<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.420> know<00:01:30.510> upwards<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:31.320> they're

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
pointed you know upwards here they're

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.200 
pointed you know upwards here they're
actually<00:01:31.890> inside<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.370> this<00:01:32.460> little<00:01:32.729> casing

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
actually inside of this little casing

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.420 
actually inside of this little casing
and<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.750> idea<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.620> as<00:01:34.770> they<00:01:34.979> push<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and the idea is is that as they push the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.770 
and the idea is is that as they push the
sound<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> sound<00:01:36.120> comes<00:01:36.390> out<00:01:36.510> of<00:01:36.660> them

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
sound as the sound comes out of them

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.600 
sound as the sound comes out of them
they<00:01:37.110> follow<00:01:37.380> through<00:01:37.620> these<00:01:37.770> air<00:01:37.920> channels

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
they follow through these air channels

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.870 
they follow through these air channels
into<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.330> bottom<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.920> ear<00:01:41.070> covering

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
into the bottom of the the ear covering

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.160 
into the bottom of the the ear covering
device<00:01:42.119> here<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.510> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.660> just<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.080> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
device here and you can just see in the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.750 
device here and you can just see in the
back<00:01:43.320> there<00:01:43.619> that's<00:01:44.040> where<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> sound<00:01:44.490> comes

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
back there that's where the sound comes

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.880 
back there that's where the sound comes
out<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.270> basically<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.869> you're<00:01:46.320> you're<00:01:46.590> right

your<00:01:47.190> left<00:01:47.400> your<00:01:47.790> rear<00:01:48.090> right<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:48.570> rear<00:01:48.780> left

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
your left your rear right and rear left

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.050 
your left your rear right and rear left
get<00:01:49.560> pushed<00:01:49.770> down<00:01:49.860> through<00:01:50.160> this<00:01:50.250> these<00:01:50.760> holes

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
get pushed down through this these holes

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.670 
get pushed down through this these holes
up<00:01:51.270> here<00:01:51.479> being<00:01:51.690> generated<00:01:52.020> from<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.440> top<00:01:52.650> of

up here being generated from the top of

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.380 
up here being generated from the top of
the<00:01:52.830> headset<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.460> then<00:01:53.850> as<00:01:54.030> Mike<00:01:54.210> mentioned

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
the headset and then as Mike mentioned

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.389 
the headset and then as Mike mentioned
before<00:01:54.750> your<00:01:55.320> Center<00:01:55.710> sound<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.310> your

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
before your Center sound and your

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.130 
before your Center sound and your
subwoofer<00:01:56.970> is<00:01:57.090> coming<00:01:57.360> through<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.570> device

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
subwoofer is coming through that device

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.840 
subwoofer is coming through that device
right<00:01:58.470> in<00:01:58.649> there<00:01:58.800> well<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.490> interesting

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
right in there well it's interesting

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.219 
right in there well it's interesting
you're<00:02:00.210> apparently<00:02:00.509> these<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:00.990> zero

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
you're apparently these have zero

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.200 
you're apparently these have zero
latency<00:02:01.380> as<00:02:01.770> well<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.460> good<00:02:02.820> thing<00:02:03.000> for

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
latency as well so it's a good thing for

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.270 
latency as well so it's a good thing for
gaming<00:02:03.540> supposed<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.560> give<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.800> positional
