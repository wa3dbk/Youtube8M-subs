00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.940 
next we're going to spray her hair with
water<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:12.790> then<00:01:13.500> brush<00:01:14.500> it<00:01:14.680> out

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.230 

once<00:01:18.950> you're<00:01:19.100> done<00:01:19.250> with<00:01:19.310> that<00:01:19.460> just<00:01:19.970> split

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
once you're done with that just split

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.370 
once you're done with that just split
her<00:01:20.390> hair<00:01:20.660> into<00:01:20.840> roughly<00:01:21.530> two<00:01:21.890> equal<00:01:22.550> sections

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
her hair into roughly two equal sections

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.680 
her hair into roughly two equal sections
like<00:01:24.380> this<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:24.980> just<00:01:25.580> kind<00:01:25.790> of<00:01:25.880> loosely<00:01:26.240> twist

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
like this and just kind of loosely twist

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.830 
like this and just kind of loosely twist
them<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.100> left

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.230 

a<00:01:30.899> key<00:01:31.679> thing<00:01:32.009> while<00:01:32.250> twisting<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.060> make

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
a key thing while twisting is to make

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.630 
a key thing while twisting is to make
sure<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:34.200> keep<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.920> hair<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.429> head

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
sure that you keep the hair on the head

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.300 
sure that you keep the hair on the head
on<00:01:36.210> her<00:01:36.630> head<00:01:36.869> nice<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.170> flat<00:01:37.590> because<00:01:37.950> that's

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
on her head nice and flat because that's

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.039 
on her head nice and flat because that's
going<00:01:38.609> to<00:01:38.670> end<00:01:38.700> up<00:01:38.939> being<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.359> the<00:01:39.569> hair<00:01:39.840> that

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
going to end up being like the hair that

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.289 
going to end up being like the hair that
it's<00:01:40.200> going<00:01:40.469> to<00:01:40.530> look<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:40.789> for<00:01:41.789> the<00:01:41.909> ponytail

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
it's going to look like for the ponytail

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.039 
it's going to look like for the ponytail
that<00:01:42.509> makes<00:01:42.719> sense<00:01:42.929> so<00:01:43.530> yeah<00:01:44.569> so<00:01:45.569> now<00:01:45.750> since

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
that makes sense so yeah so now since

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.749 
that makes sense so yeah so now since
you<00:01:46.200> twisted<00:01:46.679> them<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.069> the<00:01:47.159> left<00:01:47.459> you're

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
you twisted them to the left you're

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.550 
you twisted them to the left you're
going<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.969> wrap<00:01:48.149> them<00:01:48.450> around<00:01:48.479> each<00:01:49.020> other<00:01:49.259> to

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
going to wrap them around each other to

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.980 
going to wrap them around each other to
the<00:01:49.679> right<00:01:49.950> if<00:01:50.219> that<00:01:50.549> makes<00:01:50.759> sense<00:01:50.969> so<00:01:51.750> wrap

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the right if that makes sense so wrap

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:01.429 
the right if that makes sense so wrap
them<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.469> that<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:59.630> this<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.810> called<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.200> rope

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
them like that and this is called a rope

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.350 
them like that and this is called a rope
braid<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.670> pretty<00:02:02.909> cool<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
braid and it's pretty cool and the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.270 
braid and it's pretty cool and the
reason<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.780> wrap<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.349> opposite<00:02:04.829> way<00:02:04.890> that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
reason you wrap in the opposite way that

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.270 
reason you wrap in the opposite way that
you<00:02:05.369> twisted<00:02:05.729> them<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.020> they<00:02:07.950> hold

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
you twisted them is so that they hold

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.830 
you twisted them is so that they hold
their<00:02:08.489> twist<00:02:08.759> better<00:02:08.970> together<00:02:09.329> if<00:02:09.630> that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
their twist better together if that

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.720 
their twist better together if that
