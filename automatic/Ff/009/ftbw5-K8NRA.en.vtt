nothing<00:01:12.600> down<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.650> staged<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.159> again

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
nothing down and I staged it again

universe<00:01:15.090> was<00:01:15.840> difficult<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.530> actually

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
universe was difficult and that actually

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.590 
universe was difficult and that actually
summed<00:01:17.250> up<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.490> season<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.000> because<00:01:18.509> I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
summed up of season and because I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.210 
summed up of season and because I
thought<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.960> we'd<00:01:19.170> started<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> game<00:01:19.860> play

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.050 
okay with a Newton mother we all up and
open<00:01:22.740> play<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.280> certainly<00:01:23.460> had<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> lot<00:01:23.850> of

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
open play but we certainly had a lot of

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.670 
open play but we certainly had a lot of
penetration<00:01:24.540> played<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> lot<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> game<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
penetration played a lot of the game the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.950 
penetration played a lot of the game the
first<00:01:25.830> 20<00:01:26.159> minutes<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.520> their<00:01:26.670> half<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.780> we've
