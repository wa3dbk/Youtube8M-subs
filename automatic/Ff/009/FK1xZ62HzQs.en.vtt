I should go set this in the snowbank and
just<00:04:41.470> let<00:04:41.650> it<00:04:42.060> let<00:04:43.060> it<00:04:43.210> stretch<00:04:43.510> in<00:04:43.690> fact<00:04:43.900> I'm

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
just let it let it stretch in fact I'm

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.630 
just let it let it stretch in fact I'm
going<00:04:44.200> to<00:04:44.289> do<00:04:44.470> that<00:04:44.680> right<00:04:44.890> now<00:04:45.099> so<00:04:45.130> it<00:04:45.370> doesn't

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
going to do that right now so it doesn't

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.140 
going to do that right now so it doesn't
get<00:04:45.729> too

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.520 

I'll<00:04:49.150> set<00:04:49.450> him<00:04:49.570> here<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:49.900> reason<00:04:50.230> is<00:04:50.380> I

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
I'll set him here and the reason is I

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.230 
I'll set him here and the reason is I
did<00:04:50.680> want<00:04:50.890> him<00:04:50.980> to<00:04:51.100> stretch<00:04:51.460> too<00:04:51.730> much

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
did want him to stretch too much

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.670 
did want him to stretch too much
so<00:04:52.510> we'll<00:04:52.660> just<00:04:52.840> sort<00:04:53.050> of<00:04:53.140> sighting<00:04:53.470> like<00:04:53.620> that

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
so we'll just sort of sighting like that

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.870 
so we'll just sort of sighting like that
and<00:04:54.130> a<00:04:54.190> snow<00:04:54.720> you<00:04:55.720> can<00:04:55.900> see<00:04:56.080> these<00:04:56.290> nice<00:04:56.500> little

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
and a snow you can see these nice little

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.610 
and a snow you can see these nice little
little<00:04:57.880> greens<00:04:58.360> got<00:04:58.810> in<00:04:58.990> there<00:04:59.140> too<00:04:59.380> and

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
little greens got in there too and

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.780 
little greens got in there too and
everything<00:05:01.290> and<00:05:02.290> at<00:05:02.650> this<00:05:02.800> point<00:05:03.040> it<00:05:03.370> isn't

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
everything and at this point it isn't

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.360 
everything and at this point it isn't
gonna<00:05:03.880> hurt<00:05:04.090> him<00:05:04.240> at<00:05:04.360> all<00:05:04.450> just<00:05:04.810> to<00:05:04.960> do<00:05:05.080> this

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
gonna hurt him at all just to do this

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.190 
gonna hurt him at all just to do this
you<00:05:06.370> don't<00:05:06.400> want<00:05:06.760> to<00:05:06.880> do<00:05:07.510> this<00:05:07.660> in<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:07.990> mold

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
you don't want to do this in the mold

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.520 
you don't want to do this in the mold
because<00:05:08.440> if<00:05:08.560> you<00:05:08.650> get<00:05:08.770> water<00:05:09.040> now<00:05:10.290> it'll<00:05:11.290> start

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
because if you get water now it'll start

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:18.990 
because if you get water now it'll start
popping<00:05:12.250> and<00:05:12.370> crackling

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.390
