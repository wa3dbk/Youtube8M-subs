 as you can see 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.310
 but of course 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.420
 in this price range 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.420
 all its competitors have the same type of finish 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.459
 What surprises in this model 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.459
 are the woven parts 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.079
 is it said that 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.079
 It is pleasant and also the strength 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.599
 something much better than we found the popular national 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:27.639
 which has a classic like this here only on the doorstep 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.049
 the same type of fabric is the baroque one 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.309
 Incidentally, the bank seems a little more rough 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:37.649
 it's interesting 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:40.769
 is that here in the column take a look 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.089
 between the front and rear door 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:46.449
 there is the same finish 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.589
 with fabric finish for 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:52.589
 the seats are very comfortable marcÃ­lio souza 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.369
 the negative point that 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:58.759
 we found that this top part is very thin 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.199
 so for those who have a back with a little more say 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:07.449
 as men generally did not feel a little lack of support here on the part 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:08.709
 from above 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.709
 but here below the support will have a very good 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.269
 info foam 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.229
 in the back door 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:26.369
 the finish is the same 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:28.679
 luck that the detail of the 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:31.679
 the world that surrounds you 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.349
 Yes, the pressure 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.349
 the course kicks in half silver 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.989
 here we have the parking sensor 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.909
 it's in a slightly different place 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.869
 I found it interesting because it works for you. 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:50.729
 I looked through the inner mirror 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:54.519
 the censor showing you the missing distance. 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.019
 to stay in the highlighted that is just behind the car 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.199
 the space back here 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.799
 It's small enough 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.849
 as long as the front seat is 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:27.680

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.599

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.479
 the knees is not a custom 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.279
 of course for three people 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.270
 It's hard to see back here. 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.270
 Medel is just two people just like the front 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.830
 here we have last minute 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:54.400

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.080
 an object carrier back here 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.360
 and the electric windows 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.099
 the space with the head has optimized useful 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.930
 that this coverage 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.150
 which causes 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.180
 the person the man who has tried from heights still has the glasses 5

 and down you have to push a button here in the front 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.330
 the rear belt does not have this adjustment 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.210
 the panel has the account-turns here on the side 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.439
 the warning lights bars

 the fact given that the lateral and after this attack 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:02.379
 and here we have a fuel marker 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:05.379
 this report from the driver 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.240
 What do you get out with the car? 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.240
 the use of a seat belt is necessary since it 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.000
 give the signal 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.349

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:17.259
 here it is almost all the time popping 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:20.279
 then it is impossible to walk without a seat belt 

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:23.279
 here we show the handbrake drive

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:58.089
 here in the trunk it complicates 

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.479
 for those who have big family and want to travel 

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:02.840
