thought this again would be fun with
leggings<00:00:31.529> by<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.070> way<00:00:32.160> I'll<00:00:32.250> probably<00:00:32.279> say

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
leggings by the way I'll probably say

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.430 
leggings by the way I'll probably say
that<00:00:32.880> about<00:00:33.149> just<00:00:33.480> about<00:00:33.630> every<00:00:33.989> single<00:00:34.140> top

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that about just about every single top

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.139 
that about just about every single top
in<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.680> video<00:00:34.950> because<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.340> basically<00:00:35.700> wear

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
in this video because I basically wear

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.790 
in this video because I basically wear
leggings<00:00:36.360> every<00:00:36.870> single<00:00:37.200> day<00:00:37.350> when<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.590> gets

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
leggings every single day when it gets

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.850 
leggings every single day when it gets
cold<00:00:38.070> out<00:00:38.420> yes<00:00:39.420> are<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.780> not<00:00:39.930> sorry<00:00:40.170> but<00:00:40.530> yeah
