00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.620
 we are in a screaming plot 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:19.189
 just the crickets used for the line 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:22.050
 held selenia teruel where we see 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.060
 what we call the head of 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.899
 willow breeding a pruning head 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.590
 this willow head this technique of 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:33.059
 pruning is an ancient system we have 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.719
 then adapted the system 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.270
 of the sapling adapted to modern 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.950
 breeding and production techniques 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.130
 as you can see the stem very straight 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.050
 no scarring as in the 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.660
 case of the spurred cordon we have 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.760
 seen previously does not present 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.710
 scars so the sap flow 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.780
 Latin happens with respect to physiology 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.550
 of the plant 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.090
 ignazio we explain a little how it is 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.250
 the plant evolves with this technique 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.540
 part of the technique we speak of course 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.770
 of a darkness not the classic guiot but 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.759
 like you said about someone I called 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.549
 a willow head where unlike 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.549
 of the old pruning school we have 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.359
 the spurs and the fruiting head all 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.569
 on the same floor so as to have one 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:34.350
 branching of the plant instead 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.969
 that go upwards but to the right 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.219
 both on the left 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.079
 this what allows us as in 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.990
 case of the spurred cordon to have one 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.399
 all-distributed production band 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:51.179
 in space and obviously to have cuts 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.909
 only from the top so you have this 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:56.450
 part below then from the stem that rises 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.179
 all this part without any cut 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.700
 own way to simplify and not have 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.420
 no bottleneck on the speech related 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.069
 to the language 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.709
 look at the wood of course 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:11.610
 the balance of the plant is the part 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:14.010
 let's say it's part of the spurs 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.189
 we have almost all of the fruit head 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.860
 same size ciacci bellini fica t 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.460
 obviously synonymous with a plant in 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.950
 health of a plant 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.180
 obviously that produces grapes of 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.180
 very high quality 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.690
 we have the branching 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.300
 we basically guarantee with these two 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.760
 spur cini after which we have ours 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.290
 the fruit in this case 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.350
 of last year 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.500
 as mentioned for the spurred cordon not 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.960
 we make superior cuts to the wood in 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.640
 this case of two years in cases 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.110
 exceptional of 3 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.970
 now I'm going to show you right 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.130
 manually as we do and come 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.580
 performed the pruning on the dark that we 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.590
 call willow head so this 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.480
 we have the spur of last year 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.260
 right in the speech of having cuts 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.900
 from above 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:25.570
 I'm going to cut this part here is 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.070
 I will practically give you my hope 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:33.580
 around which guarantees me the branching 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.740
 it is the same side in the sense 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.320
 of the row in my absence of the row 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.480
 of the plant and it is obviously not 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.520
 inter tiwari here 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.440
 obviously this was born cuts always 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.920
 in respect to the crown as we said 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.140
 to ensure healing, go 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.209
 right from the crown gems after that 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.010
 we will decide which one will be ours 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.380
 new head of fruit 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.910
 we can do this as we can do 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.370
 this also 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.290
 we even have the possibility seen 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.660
 that we do a pruning in this 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.490
 in case maybe these two are there 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.250
 remained a little shorter more 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.290
 short to make a double blind then 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.970
 we repeat our dryness 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.359
 let's go do the spur there 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:20.049
 guarantees our branching later 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:23.160
 of what we will have our fruitful head 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.160
 for next year 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:30.960
 1 of course we'll cut the wood here 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.960
 which he produced last year 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:39.460
 and we will make ourselves our new head south 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:43.390
 automatically this plant will become 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.660
 a double darkness with its two spurs that 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.200
 they guarantee the renewal of the plant 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.200
 for next year
