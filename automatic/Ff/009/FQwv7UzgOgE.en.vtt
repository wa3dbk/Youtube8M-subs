traditional sheep and beef farmer
suddenly<00:00:06.810> getting<00:00:07.140> into<00:00:07.500> greyhound<00:00:08.160> racing

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
suddenly getting into greyhound racing

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.089 
suddenly getting into greyhound racing
and<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.940> breeding<00:00:09.240> thereof<00:00:09.870> how<00:00:10.740> would<00:00:10.920> that

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
and the breeding thereof how would that

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.990 
and the breeding thereof how would that
happen<00:00:11.599> group<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.750> his<00:00:12.900> friends<00:00:13.759> sort<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.849> got

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
happen group of his friends sort of got

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.269 
happen group of his friends sort of got
together<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.509> decided<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.250> there'll<00:00:17.250> be

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
together and decided that there'll be

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.000 
together and decided that there'll be
something<00:00:17.670> fun<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.600> we<00:00:19.529> went<00:00:19.740> ahead<00:00:19.830> and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
something fun to do so we went ahead and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.120 
something fun to do so we went ahead and
got<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.310> couple<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:21.260> fun<00:00:22.260> dogs<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.800> guess<00:00:22.980> you

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
got a couple of fun dogs I guess you

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.420 
got a couple of fun dogs I guess you
class<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.580> mares<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.830> we<00:00:25.830> got<00:00:25.980> bitten<00:00:26.189> by<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
class the mares and we got bitten by the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.660 
class the mares and we got bitten by the
bag<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.359> now<00:00:27.630> we've<00:00:27.930> got<00:00:28.529> closed<00:00:28.740> 150<00:00:29.279> dogs<00:00:29.460> I

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
bag and now we've got closed 150 dogs I

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.269 
bag and now we've got closed 150 dogs I
guess<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.090> they<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.840> their<00:00:31.500> racing<00:00:31.949> as<00:00:32.099> well

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
guess and they have their racing as well

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.260 
guess and they have their racing as well
as<00:00:32.430> breeding<00:00:32.820> dogs

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
as breeding dogs

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.049 
as breeding dogs
this<00:00:33.780> year<00:00:34.140> we've<00:00:34.410> got<00:00:34.710> we've<00:00:35.579> started<00:00:35.880> a

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
this year we've got we've started a

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.139 
this year we've got we've started a
breeding<00:00:36.270> operation<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.910> we've<00:00:38.910> put

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
breeding operation here and we've put

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.190 
breeding operation here and we've put
them<00:00:39.180> out<00:00:39.360> with<00:00:39.510> trainers<00:00:39.899> when<00:00:40.050> they're

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
them out with trainers when they're

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.950 
them out with trainers when they're
almost<00:00:40.320> ready<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.829> start<00:00:41.100> racing<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.960> they

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
almost ready to start racing and they

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.450 
almost ready to start racing and they
break<00:00:43.230> them<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.710> put<00:00:43.980> them<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> track

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
break them in and put them on the track

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.299 
break them in and put them on the track
frozen<00:00:45.410> hopefully<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> success<00:00:46.710> follows

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
frozen hopefully the success follows

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.860 
frozen hopefully the success follows
know<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:48.030> all<00:00:48.180> due<00:00:48.210> respect<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.780> would

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
know with all due respect it would

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.750 
know with all due respect it would
almost<00:00:49.110> seem<00:00:49.410> as<00:00:49.590> though<00:00:49.710> greyhound<00:00:50.370> racing

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
almost seem as though greyhound racing

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.299 
almost seem as though greyhound racing
as<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.059> poor<00:00:51.300> cousin<00:00:51.629> as<00:00:52.110> far<00:00:52.440> as<00:00:52.680> racing<00:00:53.160> but

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
as the poor cousin as far as racing but

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.200 
as the poor cousin as far as racing but
that<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.579> changing

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
that is changing

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.290 
that is changing
absolutely<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.260> certainly<00:00:55.620> certainly<00:00:56.370> was

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
absolutely it certainly certainly was

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.709 
absolutely it certainly certainly was
and<00:00:57.770> some<00:00:58.770> may<00:00:58.949> say<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.309> tillers<00:00:59.699> but<00:01:00.570> it's

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and some may say it's tillers but it's

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.319 
and some may say it's tillers but it's
probably<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.500> growth<00:01:01.730> code<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> three

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
probably the growth code of the three

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.899 
probably the growth code of the three
codes<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.070> it's<00:01:05.070> becoming<00:01:05.400> more<00:01:05.640> more

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
codes and it's becoming more more

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.050 
codes and it's becoming more more
professional<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.369> there's<00:01:08.369> more<00:01:08.549> more<00:01:08.790> stake

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
professional and there's more more stake

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.140 
professional and there's more more stake
money<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.260> won<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.790> going

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
money to be won so it really is going

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.420 
money to be won so it really is going
ahead<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.170> how<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.619> end<00:01:13.830> up<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.159> top

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
ahead so how do you end up with a top

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.390 
ahead so how do you end up with a top
dog<00:01:14.640> yeah<00:01:15.450> that's<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.780> good<00:01:15.900> question

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
dog yeah that's a good question

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.010 
dog yeah that's a good question
obviously<00:01:17.400> genetics<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.119> lot<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.630> play<00:01:18.990> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
obviously genetics have a lot to play a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.240 
obviously genetics have a lot to play a
big<00:01:19.530> part<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.890> play<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:22.290> some<00:01:22.500> more<00:01:22.860> superior

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
big part to play the some more superior

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.830 
big part to play the some more superior
genetics<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.909> breed<00:01:24.090> from<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> more<00:01:24.570> chance

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
genetics you breed from the more chance

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.300 
genetics you breed from the more chance
you've<00:01:25.110> got<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.439> getting<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.979> really

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
you've got of getting that really

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.230 
you've got of getting that really
superstar<00:01:27.000> dog<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.560> saying<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
superstar dog but and saying that

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.210 
superstar dog but and saying that
superstars<00:01:30.240> have<00:01:30.420> come<00:01:30.600> out<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.220> poor

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
superstars have come out of poor

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.660 
superstars have come out of poor
genetics<00:01:32.729> too<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:34.470> does<00:01:34.799> give<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.220> fair

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
genetics too but it does give you a fair

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.719 
genetics too but it does give you a fair
head<00:01:35.850> start<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.329> few<00:01:36.600> used<00:01:37.229> kinetics<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.130> best

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
head start a few used kinetics so best

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.030 
head start a few used kinetics so best
genetics<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> world<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.869> they<00:01:39.979> you<00:01:40.979> would

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
genetics in the world do they you would

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.679 
genetics in the world do they you would
think<00:01:41.250> they'd<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:41.640> from<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.909> UK<00:01:42.270> but<00:01:42.329> not

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
think they'd be from the UK but not

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.420 
think they'd be from the UK but not
necessarily<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.290> Australia<00:01:43.740> probably<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
necessarily in Australia probably the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.429 
necessarily in Australia probably the
top<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.820> world<00:01:45.000> now<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.750> industry<00:01:46.259> over

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
top of the world now the industry over

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.490 
top of the world now the industry over
there<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.649> very<00:01:47.340> large<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.119> very

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
there is very large and very

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.100 
there is very large and very
professional<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:50.030> big<00:01:51.030> breeding<00:01:51.509> operations

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
professional and big breeding operations

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.710 
professional and big breeding operations
and<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.159> think<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.820> fastest<00:01:54.240> dogs<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
and I think the fastest dogs in the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.359 
and I think the fastest dogs in the
world<00:01:54.750> are<00:01:55.020> certainly<00:01:55.350> from<00:01:55.530> Australia<00:01:56.009> would

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
world are certainly from Australia would

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.770 
world are certainly from Australia would
I<00:01:56.399> be<00:01:56.610> right<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:56.969> suggesting<00:01:57.119> that's<00:01:57.600> where

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
I be right in suggesting that's where

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.179 
I be right in suggesting that's where

that's where you put most to be faith
absolutely<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.880> with<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:22.110> Sawyer<00:02:22.500> side<00:02:22.860> of

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
absolutely the with the Sawyer side of

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.450 
absolutely the with the Sawyer side of
it<00:02:23.270> there's<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.390> frozen<00:02:24.570> semen<00:02:25.250> operations<00:02:26.250> so

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
it there's a frozen semen operations so

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.490 
it there's a frozen semen operations so
anybody<00:02:26.820> can<00:02:27.210> access<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.840> top<00:02:28.020> dog<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.440> the

anybody can access the top dog in the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.220 
anybody can access the top dog in the
world<00:02:28.620> if<00:02:28.830> you're<00:02:28.980> right<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.190> big<00:02:29.430> enough<00:02:29.610> chair

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
world if you're right a big enough chair

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.900 
world if you're right a big enough chair
but<00:02:31.230> not<00:02:31.260> everyone<00:02:31.830> can<00:02:32.010> have<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.310> best<00:02:32.490> Dems

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
but not everyone can have the best Dems

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.270 
but not everyone can have the best Dems
in<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.390> world<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.350> female<00:02:34.710> side<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.130> it's

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
in the world so the female side of it's

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.790 
in the world so the female side of it's
extremely<00:02:35.910> important<00:02:36.390> frozen<00:02:37.290> salmon<00:02:37.500> for

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
extremely important frozen salmon for

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.400 
extremely important frozen salmon for
dogs<00:02:38.010> yes<00:02:38.610> here<00:02:39.150> yes

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
dogs yes here yes

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.190 
dogs yes here yes
it's<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.459> guess<00:02:42.000> it's<00:02:42.209> really<00:02:42.450> really<00:02:42.990> it

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
it's I guess it's really really it

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.280 
it's I guess it's really really it
spreads<00:02:43.560> up<00:02:43.740> genetic<00:02:44.190> gains<00:02:44.370> hugely<00:02:44.790> because

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
spreads up genetic gains hugely because

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.870 
spreads up genetic gains hugely because
anybody<00:02:46.290> can<00:02:46.620> access<00:02:46.800> that<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.490> know<00:02:47.730> the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
anybody can access that you know the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.520 
anybody can access that you know the
tops<00:02:48.150> are<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.660> world<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.750> it's<00:02:52.200> been

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
tops are in the world and so it's been

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.460 
tops are in the world and so it's been
huge<00:02:52.890> for<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.310> genetic<00:02:53.910> payments<00:02:54.840> me<00:02:54.989> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
huge for the genetic payments me the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.870 
huge for the genetic payments me the
other<00:02:55.590> thing<00:02:55.770> is<00:02:55.920> with<00:02:56.130> sheep<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.730> know

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
other thing is with sheep that you know

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.940 
other thing is with sheep that you know
a<00:02:56.940> lot<00:02:57.090> about<00:02:57.330> its<00:02:57.630> normally<00:02:58.320> sort<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.650> twins

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
a lot about its normally sort of twins

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.190 
a lot about its normally sort of twins
and<00:02:59.220> cattle<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.820> singles<00:03:00.330> for<00:03:00.840> these<00:03:00.989> things

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
and cattle that singles for these things

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.229 
and cattle that singles for these things
will<00:03:01.470> pump<00:03:01.950> out<00:03:02.160> quite<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.459> few<00:03:02.550> oh<00:03:02.910> absolutely

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
will pump out quite a few oh absolutely

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.100 
will pump out quite a few oh absolutely
yeah<00:03:03.930> they<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:05.160> think<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.209> industry<00:03:06.450> averages

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
yeah they I think the industry averages

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.840 
yeah they I think the industry averages
sort<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.470> six<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:07.830> half<00:03:07.890> seven<00:03:08.370> pups<00:03:08.610> per

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
sort of six and a half seven pups per

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.670 
sort of six and a half seven pups per
litter<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.950> know<00:03:11.070> anyway<00:03:11.459> up<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.850> fourteen

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
litter you know anyway up to fourteen

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.800 
litter you know anyway up to fourteen
quite<00:03:13.680> common<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:14.400> yeah<00:03:14.880> does<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.300> mean<00:03:15.600> that

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
quite common so yeah does that mean that

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.350 
quite common so yeah does that mean that
some<00:03:15.840> studs<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.680> I'm<00:03:16.799> referring<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.430> as<00:03:17.820> a<00:03:17.850> as

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
some studs and I'm referring to as a as

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.509 
some studs and I'm referring to as a as
a<00:03:18.450> stud<00:03:18.810> unit<00:03:19.140> would<00:03:19.650> have<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.860> fairly<00:03:20.160> heavy

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
a stud unit would have a fairly heavy

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.550 
a stud unit would have a fairly heavy
culling<00:03:21.000> regime<00:03:21.420> or<00:03:21.600> what<00:03:21.750> happens<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.470> the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
culling regime or what happens to the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.970 
culling regime or what happens to the
market

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
market

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.880 
market
now<00:03:23.370> obviously<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:24.120> dog's<00:03:24.890> ability

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
now obviously the dog's ability

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.250 
now obviously the dog's ability
determines<00:03:27.380> you<00:03:28.380> know<00:03:28.530> how<00:03:29.070> it<00:03:29.220> stacks<00:03:29.580> up

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
determines you know how it stacks up

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.990 
determines you know how it stacks up
there<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:31.680> all<00:03:31.860> dogs<00:03:32.160> will<00:03:32.370> be<00:03:32.459> sort<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.730> raised

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
there so all dogs will be sort of raised

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.900 
there so all dogs will be sort of raised
through<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:34.080> broken<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.459> then<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.700> comes

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
through and broken and and then it comes

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.430 
through and broken and and then it comes
down<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.239> how<00:03:36.450> quickly<00:03:36.720> they<00:03:36.989> can<00:03:37.049> run

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
down to how quickly they can run

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.180 
down to how quickly they can run
determines<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:39.870> erase<00:03:40.110> career<00:03:40.560> there<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.160> a

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
determines the erase career there is a

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.759 
determines the erase career there is a

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
retired dogs or dogs that quick enough

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.949 
retired dogs or dogs that quick enough
for<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.260> trick<00:03:46.880> for<00:03:47.880> people<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.390> take<00:03:48.810> them

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
for the trick for people to take them

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.840 
for the trick for people to take them
into<00:03:49.080> their<00:03:49.200> homes<00:03:49.410> as<00:03:49.650> pits<00:03:49.920> so<00:03:50.280> that's<00:03:50.549> good

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
into their homes as pits so that's good

that<00:05:49.229> so<00:05:50.100> yeah<00:05:50.370> there<00:05:50.880> I<00:05:50.910> guess<00:05:51.240> the<00:05:51.390> level<00:05:51.660> of

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
that so yeah there I guess the level of

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.740 
that so yeah there I guess the level of
investment<00:05:52.050> and<00:05:52.970> the<00:05:53.970> quality<00:05:54.419> of<00:05:54.510> stock

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
investment and the quality of stock

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.260 
investment and the quality of stock
we've<00:05:54.960> got<00:05:55.290> and<00:05:55.620> it<00:05:56.370> has<00:05:56.520> to<00:05:56.669> stack<00:05:56.880> up<00:05:57.060> now

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
we've got and it has to stack up now

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.590 
we've got and it has to stack up now
financially<00:05:57.690> so<00:05:58.020> yeah<00:05:58.729> absolutely<00:05:59.729> yeah<00:06:00.419> it's

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
financially so yeah absolutely yeah it's

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.080 
financially so yeah absolutely yeah it's
certainly<00:06:01.160> exceeding<00:06:02.160> our<00:06:02.250> expectations<00:06:02.580> of

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
certainly exceeding our expectations of

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.300 
certainly exceeding our expectations of
the<00:06:03.210> prison<00:06:03.479> Don<00:06:03.770> which<00:06:04.770> is<00:06:04.919> an<00:06:05.070> interesting

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
the prison Don which is an interesting

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.180 
the prison Don which is an interesting
thing<00:06:05.550> he<00:06:05.940> was<00:06:06.300> breeding<00:06:06.900> Wagyu<00:06:07.500> at<00:06:07.740> one<00:06:07.890> stage

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
thing he was breeding Wagyu at one stage

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.530 
thing he was breeding Wagyu at one stage
so<00:06:08.400> he<00:06:08.520> certainly<00:06:08.729> a<00:06:08.910> man<00:06:09.090> who<00:06:09.210> can<00:06:09.390> step

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
so he certainly a man who can step

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.380 
so he certainly a man who can step
outside<00:06:09.780> the<00:06:10.140> square
