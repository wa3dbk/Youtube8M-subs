00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.650
 here's how the samsung and the last 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.420
 I'll show you now times like the samsung 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.030
 galaxy s 6 and s 6 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.529
 the sim card employs samsung 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.880
 the two smartphones namely now on 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.010
 10 april in germany in the trade 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.630
 that means it is now relatively fast 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.160
 and then of course you want to know how 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.750
 I put the sim card in that 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.519
 as well as they are relatively common with us 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.900
 actually queried you have me too 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.220
 again and again with the devices is 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.140
 actually a bit trickier 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.880
 However, there are two things nobody 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.500
 First of all, you need to know the SIM cards 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.180
 size is nano meaning so the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.969
 smallest possible sim cards size of 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.540
 time and sd cards you can not 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.730
 use 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.960
 for example, at galaxy note 4 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.670
 you take off the back and then here 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.039
 use a micro sd 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.510
 this is the galaxy s6 and s6 action 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.879
 no longer the memory is permanently installed 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.170
 is in my opinion right by many 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.870
 I would also like to criticize 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.910
 that there is a micro sd card possibility 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.899
 would simply times with cheap the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.359
 memory can expand 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.829
 this is not what you use here 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.879
 can and should is a sim card 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.930
 otherwise you can not 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.439
 call and I show you 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.680
 this time 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.479
 Samsung provides such a tool with man 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.159
 this is a small needle 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.320
 or something else you can do in the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.869
 unboxing video watch here with us 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.560
 the channel how to use this or 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.450
 or 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.000
 what it looks like it comes with 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.470
 this tool will take you easily and 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.170
 then you have to look a little while 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.049
 galaxy s 6 edge is located at 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.790
 top of the device such a flap her 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.009
 see this on the top right of the device 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.290
 this is the sim slot 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.689
 here is above because of the pages 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.979
 frame we just had too thin because 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.990
 this is no place there 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.780
 that is why this is on the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.560
 top right to left one from 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.229
 moved up in the front 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.759
 at samsung galaxy s 6 you will find 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.280
 not on top of this slot 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.750
 because the galaxy s 6 you see it yes 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.579
 is a bit thicker especially the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.170
 Poor ones are a bit thicker one 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.880
 page into the total money a bit 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.680
 thinner than that but it does not matter 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.810
 and there is on the right 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.180
 side next to the power button of this 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.490
 Insertion etc it a small hole with 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.940
 so completely new and guess that there 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.509
 slot is like that and now you have to do that 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.920
 SIM card 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.140
 that's when I just go 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.870
 show it now at s6 eschweiler grad 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.579
 new sim card is in it and then it has to 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.629
 a coincidence 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:23.069
 you have to take this needle 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.620
 this tool what he is delivered with 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.060
 and up here purely shoot if you do 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.560
 you can not even find it, by the way 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.970
 always the earrings of the girlfriend 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.019
 It works pretty well too 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.489
 is fast solution 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:37.200
 then fix this needle in mechler here 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.790
 Priesters sometimes just once solid on it 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.640
 Now press a little clack and 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.440
 then here comes this thing out complained 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.150
 the phone already sim card removes it 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.540
 the thing could not take off 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.239
 lay 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.540
 then you have the sim card slot here 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.400
 you see it there lies the sim card in it 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.709
 that's how the nano SIM card from Libya looks like 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.090
 such a small trading and then you can 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.950
 Pecking her right out, respectively 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.139
 if you wanted to insert now then 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.549
 Of course, just take this slot 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.470
 if he pushed out then the 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.879
 sim card you have to rein rein properly 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.549
 a small corner on the sim card 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.870
 that also has to be according to now 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.720
 do not give away 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.870
 which of course must also correspondingly so 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.060
 to be tricked 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.949
 and if that's the thing then it's here 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.849
 you really have to be careful because that 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.989
 is a pretty shaky 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.239
 matter until then times 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.730
 actually quietly puts in the finger like that 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.859
 and then you just have to get it back in 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.419
 the top press in properly 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:35.669
 then pretend to press once finished 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:37.440
 so is inserted in this card and 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:39.269
 then the device restarts completely 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.489
 if you turned it on or you 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.650
 turns before the change can be 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.629
 then how you want to act 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.940
 so and now I say the whole thing too 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.680
 once again on the galaxy s 6 easy 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.109
 once again press in quickly 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.239
 slot open now they are already falling 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.419
 out then we take that once 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.040
 it's six then always here the page like 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.590
 said here is the slot on 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.579
 the other side here so once again 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.919
 take a look and then I'm here 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:11.549
 purely in the country then comes here 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:15.299
 hole out tool again put away slot 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.229
 pull out and then here the sim card 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.030
 insert 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.650
 they are actually peaceful 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.290
 so I find it on the galaxy note 4 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.330
 or so 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.900
 So a little bit easier 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.820
 So ours is this little bracket 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.110
 yes relatively easy and you have to do this here 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.060
 Just press it to push it easier 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.680
 finished and then the whole thing is sunk 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.500
 and now the sim card is inserted 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.480
 so easy the SIM card change 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.680
 samsung galaxy s 6 and essex edge 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.360
 I hope the short video has you 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.050
 please drop when in order to do so in 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.940
 the comments 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.620
 otherwise comes here on the channel now 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.050
 itself has a test direction galaxy s 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.060
 6 of the report on galaxy s 6 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.190
 then there are also various tutorials 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.600
 various tips and tricks videos and such 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.830
 far and so on worthwhile 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.480
 an abo number and here from the channel me 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.480
 it's a bit of a day of europe
