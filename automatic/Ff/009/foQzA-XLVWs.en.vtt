00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.160
What's up? Let's surf?

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.079
You wanna go right into the water? 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:11.039
Nah...you gotta be in tip top shape!

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.060
That's the difference between you being a Kelly Slater or a hot tub surfer!

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.260
Now I need a little help...let's see if I can find one surfer...

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.760
Yo...

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.140
Come here

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.480
This wil do...

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.620
What's up?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.320
Hangin' loose bro

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.980
This guy thinks he's somethin' else...

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.800
This is my mate Luis Morgado

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.310
We'll give you a full conditioning workout for surf

00:00:37.077 --> 00:00:39.297
We'll start with a circuit of 3 exercises

00:00:39.415 --> 00:00:42.975
The first thing you do when you get in the water...arm row

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:45.355
You'll be rowing lying down

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.420
Feet up, arms stretched, full range of motion

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.600
If it's too easy grab some weights...

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:58.033
A pair of light dumbells (5 lbs max)

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.260
Don'te be a pussy let's go!

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.560
10 reps

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:07.109
Let's go surfer dude!

00:01:08.113 --> 00:01:11.273
With no rest we go to the next exercise, 10 reps as well

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.760
Feet apart

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.554
It's called yoga push up

00:01:14.554 --> 00:01:18.214
This will work your shoulders and triceps

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.980
Doesn't it remind you of anything?

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.520
Stork Dive!

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.020
Duck man!

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.840
Oh right! Duck Dive! When you dive below the wave...

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.540
Whatever...10 reps go!

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.394
3rd exercise

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.897
Kinda like a burpee...I kid you not...

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.230
You lie down...kip up with your usual surfing stance and then jump up and land with a stop

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.240
This is called the take off

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.860
10 reps as well. This circuit will be done for 5 rounds and you rest one minute after each round

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.620
Circuit number 2 - Let's work board stability

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.040
If you don't have a medicine ball...get one! It's important

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.720
10 reps of this back and forth rock keeping your core tight

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.180
After those 10 reps get feet on the ball

00:02:15.775 --> 00:02:20.275
You cross your leg and do a push up at the same time, always alternating

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.680
This one's tough. Go for 10 reps one more time

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.080
Final circuit of the workout

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.280
This one and the one before are done for 3 rounds each with a minute rest in between rounds

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.280
Final one will have 2 more exercises

00:02:35.494 --> 00:02:37.494
Knees on the ball

00:02:37.494 --> 00:02:41.094
Twist to one side and then the other for 10 reps

00:02:45.795 --> 00:02:47.795
Now you go for pikes

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:54.999
Ball on the feet now, go up and down keeping your legs and arms stretched

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.240
Remember : 3 rounds, with 1 min rest in between each

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.380
I would go surf...but the seas's flat...

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.200
I only go when the sea's looking classic...

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.820
What a surf wannabe you are...
