the better high qualit or higher quality
case<00:00:28.240> makers<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.890> case<00:00:30.340> out<00:00:30.550> there<00:00:30.580> if<00:00:31.510> that

case makers a case out there if that

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.530 
case makers a case out there if that
makes<00:00:31.930> any<00:00:31.990> sense<00:00:32.110> basically<00:00:33.300> there's<00:00:34.300> low

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
makes any sense basically there's low

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.869 
makes any sense basically there's low
quality<00:00:34.780> cases<00:00:35.320> and<00:00:35.559> therefore<00:00:35.770> cheap<00:00:36.190> but

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
quality cases and therefore cheap but

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.060 
quality cases and therefore cheap but
this<00:00:37.059> is<00:00:37.239> a<00:00:37.270> an<00:00:37.600> take<00:00:37.990> case<00:00:38.230> which<00:00:38.560> means<00:00:38.740> that

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
this is a an take case which means that

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.060 
this is a an take case which means that
it<00:00:39.880> should<00:00:40.180> be<00:00:40.420> decent<00:00:41.079> quality<00:00:41.470> even<00:00:41.890> though

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
it should be decent quality even though

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.590 
it should be decent quality even though
it's<00:00:42.340> fairly<00:00:42.910> cheap<00:00:45.210> basically<00:00:46.210> if<00:00:46.329> we<00:00:46.420> got<00:00:46.570> a

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
it's fairly cheap basically if we got a

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.010 
it's fairly cheap basically if we got a
nice<00:00:46.810> little<00:00:47.079> case<00:00:47.290> nothing<00:00:48.900> specific<00:00:49.900> about

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
nice little case nothing specific about

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.020 
nice little case nothing specific about
it<00:00:50.200> on<00:00:50.380> the<00:00:50.530> outside<00:00:50.920> but<00:00:51.489> we'll<00:00:51.640> take<00:00:51.760> a<00:00:51.820> look

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
it on the outside but we'll take a look

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.060 
it on the outside but we'll take a look
at<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.180> inside<00:00:52.480> came<00:00:53.230> in<00:00:53.380> this<00:00:53.500> nice<00:00:54.040> little

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
at the inside came in this nice little

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.120 
at the inside came in this nice little
box<00:00:54.280> here<00:00:54.810> no<00:00:55.810> specific<00:00:56.350> colors<00:00:56.649> and<00:00:56.829> I<00:00:56.890> think

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.130 
box here no specific colors and I think

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.380 
box here no specific colors and I think
they<00:00:57.399> are<00:00:57.489> really<00:00:57.670> put<00:00:57.910> that<00:00:58.059> much<00:00:58.120> effort

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
they are really put that much effort

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.450 
they are really put that much effort
into<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:58.840> outside<00:00:59.170> of<00:00:59.320> it<00:00:59.410> but<00:00:59.620> well

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
into the outside of it but well

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.910 
into the outside of it but well
protected<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:02.260> case<00:01:02.440> was<00:01:02.590> well<00:01:02.739> protected

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
protected the case was well protected

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.039 
protected the case was well protected
really<00:01:03.399> shipping<00:01:03.700> so<00:01:03.940> that's<00:01:04.839> all<00:01:05.019> that
