00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.810
 that nothing will occupy entering the link that 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.060
 I will leave in the description of the video that 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.220

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.820
 of the game to download or just 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.620
 you are going to click here 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.740
 you have to create an account or 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.510
 register that is the same does not occupy in 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.610
 verify the account they simply put their 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.070
 mail your username and password and 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.479
 ready you can now download the game what 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.659
 I'm going to put here in English to make it 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.920
 the page as you seem if you have 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.869
 the windows version because nothing else 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.860
 click here is a link that is by 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.830
 mega does not weigh much weighs 250 and 5 megabytes is 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.000
 download in about 10 8 minutes 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.250
 depending on internet connection 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.660
 if you have mac then here you can see the 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.039
 installation instructions and everything 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.909
 that roll because the truth I do not have 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:48.880
 mac if they have linux they also have 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.319
 the direct download link I think if 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.890
 They have android nadas can scan 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.679
 this code 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.159
 good guys if they have iphone ipad or 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:02:00.969
 ipod can search it in the appstore and 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.069
 here is the option for google 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.929
 chrome which is that it's a beta option like that 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.310
 is that I do not recommend it much but good 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.170
 already cooked that have it downloaded 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.759
 for example in windows you do not have 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.680
 loaders as they will have a file 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.170
 simpler is a rar file does not weigh 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.040
 much like this folder they unpack it 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.379
 where you want 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.969
 we just miss her if we wait 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.219
 to decompress, I'm going to cancel it 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:25.939
 because I already have it decompressed 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:27.709
 and all the roll we are going to eliminate it and 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.969
 there will be a file more or less like this 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.250
 is the one that they have to open that I did 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:34.280
 but in the folder that they unzipped 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.750
 they will open it and the game will appear 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.000
 in English I have it in Spanish right now 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.700
 I'll show you how to translate it into 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.079
 Spanish quiet no profits can 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.370
 see here is the part to edit 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.620
 you what you are the first thing you should do 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.540
 edit the letters you are going to for which 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.870
 you are going to play here you come from export 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.260
 by default I just have some and 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.639
 that which I have the ones I use 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.519
 good to play just give you click 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:59.720
 here in multiplayer they put their name of 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.900
 user 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.520
 they select their region and in this case 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.640
 I have to put the US is not the 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.960

 scissors to see who says first who 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.630
 start second and all that roll is worth and 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.550
 good kids do not have much science here 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.110
 cpu mode is a beta mode where you can 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.420
 play against the computer to try 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.040
