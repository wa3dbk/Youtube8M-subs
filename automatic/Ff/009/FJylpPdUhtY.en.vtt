00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
through these there's tower defense

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.000 
through these there's tower defense
regular<00:03:51.840> app

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.010 

simply<00:03:58.010> got<00:03:58.190> their<00:03:58.400> own

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.380 

it<00:04:02.590> doesn't<00:04:02.920> say<00:04:03.100> if<00:04:03.250> it's<00:04:03.430> HD<00:04:03.880> or<00:04:04.060> not<00:04:06.390> which

it doesn't say if it's HD or not which
is<00:04:07.570> really<00:04:07.960> stupid<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:11.290> actually<00:04:11.980> think<00:04:12.310> this

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
is really stupid I actually think this

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.159 
is really stupid I actually think this
is<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:12.760> HD<00:04:13.150> one

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.730 

okay<00:04:19.169> so<00:04:20.120> I'm<00:04:21.120> just<00:04:21.299> gonna<00:04:21.419> minimize<00:04:22.139> that<00:04:22.500> and

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
okay so I'm just gonna minimize that and

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.080 
okay so I'm just gonna minimize that and
as<00:04:22.919> you<00:04:23.040> can<00:04:23.160> see<00:04:23.190> I've<00:04:23.490> already<00:04:23.639> extracted

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
as you can see I've already extracted

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.760 
as you can see I've already extracted
the<00:04:24.330> two<00:04:24.510> files<00:04:24.720> that<00:04:25.020> were<00:04:25.080> in<00:04:25.139> there<00:04:25.260> there's

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
the two files that were in there there's

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.350 
the two files that were in there there's
a<00:04:25.889> tower<00:04:26.280> defense<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:27.060> then<00:04:27.150> there's<00:04:27.300> a

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
a tower defense and then there's a

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.720 
a tower defense and then there's a
tattoo<00:04:27.600> fits<00:04:27.840> top<00:04:28.110> back<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:29.280> that's<00:04:29.430> in<00:04:29.580> case

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
tattoo fits top back and that's in case

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.040 
tattoo fits top back and that's in case
something<00:04:30.180> goes<00:04:30.270> wrong<00:04:30.419> and<00:04:30.660> you<00:04:30.720> want<00:04:30.930> your
