hi<00:00:00.930> guys<00:00:01.170> in<00:00:01.410> this<00:00:01.439> video<00:00:01.650> I'm<00:00:01.829> gonna<00:00:01.979> be<00:00:02.159> using

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
hi guys in this video I'm gonna be using

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.170 
hi guys in this video I'm gonna be using
a<00:00:03.120> tool<00:00:03.810> called<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:04.430> peterson<00:00:05.430> wafer<00:00:05.940> breaker

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
a tool called the peterson wafer breaker

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.020 
a tool called the peterson wafer breaker
and<00:00:06.569> bypass<00:00:07.259> tool<00:00:07.500> for<00:00:07.710> american<00:00:08.130> padlocks

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
and bypass tool for american padlocks

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.030 
and bypass tool for american padlocks
here's<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.960> two<00:00:10.200> way<00:00:10.349> for<00:00:10.530> break<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.830> tools

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
here's the two way for break the tools

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.799 
here's the two way for break the tools
for<00:00:11.429> security<00:00:11.820> wafers<00:00:12.150> in<00:00:12.300> higher<00:00:12.480> security

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
for security wafers in higher security

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.189 
for security wafers in higher security
american<00:00:13.590> locks<00:00:13.769> such<00:00:14.250> as<00:00:14.509> 752<00:00:15.509> honors<00:00:16.020> and

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
american locks such as 752 honors and

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.980 
american locks such as 752 honors and
stuff<00:00:16.379> like<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.970> and<00:00:17.970> here's<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.600> bypass

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
stuff like that and here's the bypass

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.470 
stuff like that and here's the bypass

of the tool facing downward go and try

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.779 
of the tool facing downward go and try
to<00:00:52.680> work<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.750> see<00:00:54.750> out<00:00:54.870> turn<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.829> open<00:00:56.730> up

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
to work it in see out turn just open up

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.170 
to work it in see out turn just open up
a<00:00:56.820> lot<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.449> simple<00:00:58.820> there's<00:00:59.820> one<00:01:01.100> same<00:01:02.100> thing

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
a lot that simple there's one same thing

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.770 
a lot that simple there's one same thing
live<00:01:03.180> part<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.570> tool<00:01:03.719> facing<00:01:04.110> down<00:01:05.600> pop<00:01:06.600> it

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
live part of the tool facing down pop it

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.719 
live part of the tool facing down pop it
open<00:01:11.990> go<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.229> back<00:01:13.409> work<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.040> he'll<00:01:14.520> turn

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
open go to the back work in he'll turn

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.330 
open go to the back work in he'll turn
them<00:01:14.880> slightly<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.860> just<00:01:16.860> opens<00:01:17.220> right<00:01:17.280> up

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
them slightly and just opens right up

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:38.940 
them slightly and just opens right up
you<00:01:20.340> speak<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.880> up<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.180> little<00:01:21.299> bit<00:01:21.420> for<00:01:21.900> you

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.820 

for<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.010> 700s<00:01:41.080> same<00:01:42.080> thing<00:01:42.350> these<00:01:42.530> had<00:01:42.740> to

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
for the 700s same thing these had to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.830 
for the 700s same thing these had to
just<00:01:43.340> have<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.520> security<00:01:44.180> wafers<00:01:44.479> in<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.659> back

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
just have a security wafers in the back

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.100 
just have a security wafers in the back
I<00:01:44.869> just<00:01:45.200> captured<00:01:45.770> them<00:01:45.890> through<00:01:46.190> with<00:01:47.150> those

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
I just captured them through with those

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.440 
I just captured them through with those
two<00:01:48.320> tools<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:49.729> kind<00:01:49.940> of<00:01:50.000> actually<00:01:50.300> have

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
two tools and you kind of actually have

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.810 
two tools and you kind of actually have
to<00:01:50.600> use<00:01:50.810> at<00:01:51.619> least<00:01:51.680> this<00:01:52.040> tool<00:01:52.280> on<00:01:52.369> most<00:01:52.670> of

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
to use at least this tool on most of

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.820 
to use at least this tool on most of
them<00:01:53.000> at<00:01:53.570> least<00:01:53.720> newer<00:01:53.960> ones<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:54.530> stuff<00:01:54.680> like

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
them at least newer ones and stuff like

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.280 
them at least newer ones and stuff like
that<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.729> tool<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.360> bypass<00:01:56.720> tool<00:01:56.990> itself

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
that the tool the bypass tool itself

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.530 
that the tool the bypass tool itself
just<00:01:57.979> usually<00:01:58.490> for<00:01:58.790> me<00:01:58.880> anyway<00:01:59.210> on<00:01:59.390> these

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
just usually for me anyway on these

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.170 
just usually for me anyway on these
locks<00:01:59.869> doesn't<00:02:00.259> always<00:02:00.380> work<00:02:00.650> so<00:02:01.640> I<00:02:01.670> just<00:02:01.820> use

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
locks doesn't always work so I just use

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.690 
locks doesn't always work so I just use
the<00:02:02.720> breaker<00:02:02.990> kit<00:02:03.290> on<00:02:03.440> every<00:02:03.920> padlock<00:02:04.550> i

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
the breaker kit on every padlock i

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.900 
the breaker kit on every padlock i
bypass<00:02:06.009> now<00:02:07.009> for<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.369> final<00:02:07.490> one<00:02:09.580> just<00:02:10.580> go<00:02:10.700> in

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
bypass now for the final one just go in

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.930 
bypass now for the final one just go in
just<00:02:11.750> tool<00:02:12.050> like<00:02:12.290> that<00:02:12.320> go<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.640> back<00:02:13.790> of

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
just tool like that go to the back of

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.990 
just tool like that go to the back of
the<00:02:14.000> lock<00:02:14.290> you'll<00:02:15.290> feel<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.920> work<00:02:16.489> right<00:02:16.850> in

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
the lock you'll feel it work right in

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.910 
the lock you'll feel it work right in
and<00:02:17.120> see<00:02:17.239> how<00:02:17.360> with<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.140> little<00:02:18.410> bit<00:02:18.500> of<00:02:18.620> inward

and see how with a little bit of inward

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.840 
and see how with a little bit of inward
pressure<00:02:19.180> watch<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.450> tool<00:02:21.130> see<00:02:22.130> how<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.400> goes

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
pressure watch the tool see how it goes

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.140 
pressure watch the tool see how it goes
in<00:02:23.170> just<00:02:24.170> pop<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:24.530> open<00:02:25.000> see<00:02:26.000> how<00:02:26.090> the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
in just pop it open see how the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.490 
in just pop it open see how the
cylinders<00:02:26.600> not<00:02:26.750> turned<00:02:26.959> that<00:02:27.140> means<00:02:27.320> it<00:02:27.470> is

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
cylinders not turned that means it is

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.600 
cylinders not turned that means it is
bypassing<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.340> lock<00:02:28.570> turn<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:29.660> back<00:02:29.810> and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
bypassing the lock turn it back and

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.370 
bypassing the lock turn it back and
