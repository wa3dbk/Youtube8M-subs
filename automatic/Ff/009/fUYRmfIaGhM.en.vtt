00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.070
 and then guys all right here the head shot rj 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.929
 with another video for you 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.210
 and in this video my first 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.600
 impressions on the counter-strike 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.140
 offense or the CS with a 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.810
 most people usually call my friends 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.510
 impressions are good but my opinion is 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.599
 the following I think this game should 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.260
 be bought by people who like the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.260
 ics 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.969
 new players think they will not have 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:46.350
 a good impression of the final game is a 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:49.890
 spectacular game but rather a remake of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.700
 our beloved and known success 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.630
 success 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.800
 and there are several new things is cocktail 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.420
 molotov 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.420
 the graphics are very good 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.260
 It's but the gameplay is a bit 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:12.590
 modified so you will have a 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:15.290
 difficulty in playing but the 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.470
 graphics and some effects are very 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.470
 Good 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:29.240
 lovers are already accustomed 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:33.950
 with 1.6 success and css will love this 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.500
 game I even liked but the problem 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.450
 It's the gringo server that leaves a little 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.530
 legging including some 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.220
 situations that you shoot at the enemy and 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.220
 he does not die 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:02:01.250
 It has some new weapons other weapons 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:07.310
 known but the gift of stark 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.690
 guns with aim is the distance you use 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.630
 wpp 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:18.770
 you will have more advantage than staying 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:21.200
 using a colt macca 47 because it is this 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.660
 we are going some distance and with 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.660
 a shot you can eliminate the enemy 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.450
 in the old success I can play with 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:42.890
 macca 47 at long distance with 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:45.080
 ease and the usual question also 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.340
 in gameplay at first I had a lot of 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:54.040
 difficulty but now I'm 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.040
 accustomed to playing with some weapons 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.270
 so this is it people I hope you have 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.620
 liked if you want cs gameplay 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.910
 go 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.910
 leave in comments 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.820
 including the physical game tabatinga 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.710
 I believe there are the 14 dollars 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.480
 more or less 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:27.150
 you only have to see it here on steam because 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.550
 I do not remember the value of the game 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:36.580
 is a game not so light in a sector of the 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:39.190
 computers that will pick up I go to 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.310
 put in the description the site where you 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.770
 you are buying and checking the 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:50.500
 The game's prerequisites the game is being 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:53.530
 $ 14 and $ 9915 less than 30 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.460
 Real in Brazil 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.220
 the game was released on August 21 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:05.200
 in this month 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:08.680
 there are several new modes also the game 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:13.060
 gives you the option of playing with pots or 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.330
 only online multiplayer guys hope 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.330
