00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.320
 hello we are in a photo studio 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.740
 where we go for the first time 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.150
 discover a concept Peugeot forward 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.369
 premiere of the Frankfurt show 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.369
 and to better tell us about it we're going 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.840
 welcome mathias to sade who is the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.730
 responsible for the concept cars of the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.869
 Mark 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.910
 before that a few quick elements 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.670
 on the one that peugeot called fractal 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.529
 it is a convertible coupe of 3 m 82 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.170
 one is a few centimeters near the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.579
 template of a lotus elise a concept that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.270
 for once do not just play the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.040
 style map 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.230
 explanations I would say that the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.059
 features of this new concept 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.370
 peugeot are particular all the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.620
 work that was done around the 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.730
 his 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.920
 we really intended to 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.989
 work all the features of 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.940
 design and specifically lessons from 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.120
 each all in operation of this 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.120
 vehicle 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:05.300
 one of the examples for example the opening 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.670
 doors who was who and and sounded 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.200
 and every its every detail has been 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.259
 worked so sheared 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.440
 specifically so by amon tobin 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:18.050
 especially the shares so it's the 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.390
 projectors the warning also was was 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.940
 worked specifically so even the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.880
 sound of each detail of each 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.380
 function was really design and for 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.420
 this vehicle we went in a 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.869
 level of detail I think pretty much 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.130
 never seen for a point a concept car 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.690
 its not only dedicated 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.069
 to electric vehicle drivers 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.899
 requires engines of a power 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.179
 unit of 102 horses are installed 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.860
 on the front and rear axle peugeot a 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.600
 also worked on tones to 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.600
 destination of other users of the 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.479
 road type pedestrians or cyclists as well to 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.319
 acceleration or deceleration 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.319
 fractals emits a specific noise 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.380
 there we are in a universe a concept case 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.000
 where each element is required but exercises 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.520
 rbe is against all this work we 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.670
 feeds for future development 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.670
 vehicles
