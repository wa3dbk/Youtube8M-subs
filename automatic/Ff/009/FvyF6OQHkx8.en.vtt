00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.960
 and started talking about several things that 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.790
 he has already succeeded in doing 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.620
 game but never managed to convince 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.509
 that this was really true since it is 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.639
 and much of this story that always 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.289
 counted turned out to be legends and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:22.199
 video of today I separated some measures 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:24.119
 to tell you and to 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.890
 begin these legends will change start 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.109
 with the legend of being able to play with the tank and 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.789
 incident gave two good no doubt 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.650
 some resident evil 2 is one of the best 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.480
 resident evil franchise 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.430
 when the game was launched 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.350
 rumor that it was possible to play with guilt 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.420
 of street fighter and for you to do this 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.579
 You had to finish the game several times. 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.800
 sometimes lead to attacks only using the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.629
 pistol and other insane prerequisites 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.700
 to be able to release the accumulates it does not 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.920
 would use weapons only wrong hills 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.500
 who even had images reinforcing this 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.969
 rumor that was posted in rdm magazine 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.920
 only that the magazine revealed that it was a 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.859
 April 1st play 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.359
 Since we talk about this magazine, I go 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.309
 talk about another legend that came before 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.170
 this one from the vat but also involved 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.060
 characters of the street fighter but this 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.860
 Once a villain enters the middle beyond 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.380
 the following in street fighter 2 if you 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.030
 raise without suffering any damage and 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.770
 then defeated the lowest would not 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.960
 appear the shane long the supposed trade 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.640
 River and who is again a picture 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.890
 forcing the farce and that image was 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.390
 also published by the magazine egm 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.400
 again they denied the news 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.360
 speaking that it was another trick of 1º 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.490
 Of april 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.259
 continuing with street fighter 2 there is 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.700
 a legend about the vega mask and 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.350
 everyone said that if you covered the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.689
 old man after knocking his 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.189
 his mask would fall and this legend 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.200
 and I'm sure it made many 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.090
 stay days and days trying but in the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.710
 Truth this is not possible it was only over 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.619
 one of those myths that someone invented and 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.240
 told his friends 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.130
 now let's talk about another fighting game 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.780
 mortal kombat he also has some 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.909
 legal legends in one of them is 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.530
 character pedro the creators of mortal 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.689
 kombat certainly had fun doing 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.460
 countless characters and various jokes 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.170
 along the franchise soon the fighter 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.149
 that could release gases 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.860
 should not have been received 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.110
 with astonishment but in fact the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.760
 Pedro was just one more 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.850
 joke published by a gaming magazine 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.220
 in 1996 to commemorate the day of the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.870
 lie the disclosed image of weight was 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.660
 just an altered version of the fighter 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.760
 striker coming off a bit of the 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.530
 fight and entering the games of rpg 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.360
 Let's start by talking about the final fantasy 7 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.130
 which was a game that marked me a lot 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.540
 childhood of many on playstation and a 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.490
 of reasons was by history 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.840
 sensational that game has to have 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.750
 a part of a character 's story 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.160
 dear to everyone dies aids and many 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.200
 until today it does not conform to death 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.550
 of her and of course she could not miss 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.720
 rumors saying it was possible 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.640
 resuscitate 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.740
 one of the most curious rumors instruct the 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.390
 player to reach level 99 with the 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.430
 cloud without changing your weapon before 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.380
 To get to the scene of death another 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.090
 the player could not talk to typh 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.650
 which would make the game understand that she 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.480
 was not as important as the 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.590
 them and therefore would be the character 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.750
 die in its place 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.940
 but unfortunately neither these rumors nor 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.530
 other numerous gambiarras will serve 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.959
 to save the young airs 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.910
 You've already played or less already. 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.010
 heard of the diablo game and this myth 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.930
 What I'm going to tell you now is one of the 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.480
 most famous myths involving video games 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.310
 until today which level of devil a case 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.110
 Do not you know the college I was a 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.950
 level where you faced super cows 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.720
 powerful 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.220
 entry to this level was possible 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.959
 by means of a cow that 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.860
 figure in the scenario and that in fact 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.540
 it was no use 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.610
 in the end it has been proved that he 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.200
 did not exist but the breeze of liked so much 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.380
 the idea of ​​a college that they 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.660
 put the college in devil two super 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.370
 mario galaxy 2 one of the most played games 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.140
 of nintendo wii has been bringing along with 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.209
 it a small doubt that arose in the 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.870
 phase is bani galaxy the doubt was the 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.549
 Following 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.709
 the stage has nothing much is like the 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.360
 others with the same objective but 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.340
 you look at the horizon you go 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.530
 find some strange things and not 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.570
 matter where you go they will always be 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.430
 there you can not get any closer to you 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.620
 never meet these people and 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.480
 anyone in the game mentioned then by 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.489
 Someone curious about this started to 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.709
 the game files and then the 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.540
 things get really weird it seems 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.060
 that the sky pattern of that area 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.980
 calls beyond defendant is worth real value and is not 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.570
 the name of that level or any level 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.340
 of mario galaxy and those things 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.650
 strange is called raul valle skype 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.050
 looking well at the picture this does not look like 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.150
 nothing with trees but with ghosts and 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.349
 in case you do not know the value means 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.570
 hell valley 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.310
 well the problem is that what I just 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.109
 telling is not quite a legend 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.240
 but the problem is there like no one else 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.460
 you know for sure what this is started 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.810
 several stories about these 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.810
 ghosts of mario galaxy 2 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.930
 to finish the legends here is a 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.430
 playstation lara croft game all 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.169
 world knows that lara croft is a 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.150
 character of a game and thus say 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.039
 petit stable and at that time a 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.260
 rumor that it was possible to see naked lara 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.940
 using some game codes and with 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.340
 sure there was a lot of the man who tried 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.560
 do this but you can not do this 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.140
 did not succeed because it did not 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.650
 of a myth 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.180
 [Music] 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.400
 Good thing I know there are several others. 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.630
 legends around because many have arisen 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.010
 through friends 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.140
 then surely you should already have 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.880
 heard other absurd stories but 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.979
 never saw anyone prove to you the 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.780
 true then if you know more 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.940
 some legend down here goes 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.710
 it's cool to read a new legend and of course 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.000
