00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:07.500
 hola que tal Today we will make a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.859
 hoop earrings with chains like this 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.859
 that I have 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.850
 so for that we're going to do 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.730
 need 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.730
 aluminum wire 2 mm 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.750
 this piece appointment to join it 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:32.599
 chain hooks for the earring something 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.230
 circular to do the shape of the 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.230
 pending 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:42.470
 the contact glue and the pliers 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:47.900
 then we will start 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:51.280
 I have cut the chain in strips of 3 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.280
 centimeters more or less 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:02.320
 So the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.320
 we take the wire and give it the shape 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.570
 with the glass 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.760
 now we put the piece 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.790
 and we're going to take a little 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.790
 glue so that it stays better fixed 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.800
 we have this way 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.800
 and the mimes 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.350
 and we will let it dry 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.080
 and we squeeze it a little bit and then what 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.080
 we let it dry 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.300
 and while what we are going to do is with 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.300
 the rings 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.780
 and putting a chain in each mile 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.470
 I have put 19 chains but it 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.500
 I found in the taste of if you want more if 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.250
 you want less in the longer ones it takes 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.900
 in the taste of each one 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.230
 then we are going to measure them 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.230
 stable 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.230
 we open 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.340
 frog 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.110
 and 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.760
 and so on until we have the 19 metidas 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.430
 and keep putting the washers through 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:50.079
 chain 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:52.100
 and then I tell you how to put on 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.290
 the ring is worth 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:59.420
 once we have all the chains already 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.250
 with the ring we take the hoop and we're going 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.580
 getting in 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.960
 by the washer 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.960
 and closing it 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.099
 we take the next one 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.099
 same we have to open a little bit 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.099
 plus 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.139
 i 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.479
 maybe 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.900
 you have to be careful not to be 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.900
 out 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.320
 and new closing 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.370
 and adjusting it so that it does not come out 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.370
 chain 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.300
 to 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.900
 and so we will do it with all 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.900
 we put 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.880
 and we close 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.810
 ah 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:32.110
 so let's continue until we have 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.110
 put the 19 chains 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.550
 Well, since we have all our 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:46.180
 little friends stuck in the hoop just 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.520
 missing the brooch we take the 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.699
 this hook brooch 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.419
 we open a little bit the washer that 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.419
 bring down 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.450
 we put it 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.890
 and we close 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:21.180
 and we have our earrings ready 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:25.460
 as you can see, it's a little easier 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:28.900
 laborious but there are still many 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.900
 I hope you are encouraged to do so 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.220
