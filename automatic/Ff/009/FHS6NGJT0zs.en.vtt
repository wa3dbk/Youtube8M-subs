00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:12.679
 Hello everyone today, I have chips pies 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.849
 convinced of this what fish sticks here 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.290
 so they look 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:22.369
 of them i'm going to make pies today 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:24.859
 dough recipe I write, Bring someone needed 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.769
 the process of kneading dough, too, put 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:33.250
 link to my video 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:33.250
 roll the sausage cut 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:07.310
 we roll on a class not as often 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:11.750
 asks why I do not take off completely 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.360
 The whole process did not think the following order 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.290
 that pies do not need to shoot either 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.890
 do it roll do people want me 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:28.130
 today decided to say how I roll 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:30.229
 how do i completely show all the cakes u 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:37.520
 i will be with fish tipsy 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:40.910
 these are such fish sticks i love him in 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:52.630
 any kind and therefore today I will be with 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:52.630
 these chopsticks from which all the pies 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:04.429
 the dough is in my cottage cheese 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:14.510
 Intensely in this sound always let 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:23.120
 flour, and so here we sculpt all the pies all 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:28.340
 I will not show how I like to give 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:34.670
 shape legs so roll out love everything and 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:37.370
 then we will fry the oil and turned it on 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:45.379
 check our oil drop a piece 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:49.760
 the dough was listed omit our pies 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:54.019
 stitch down I love the patties and immediately them 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.920
 lick I never let them lie down immediately 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.920
 pike 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:36.040
 the dough is very good very good 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:41.290
 rises and therefore its better more often 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.290
 you need to turn over cod 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:58.140
 all i want to say about pies all 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:04:00.780
 what do you fry in butter those dough not 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.480
 there must be so many fat topics 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.200
 the more fat you have in dough the more it is 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.760
 dough you absorb fat and frying it 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.099
 the same applies if you're with potatoes there 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.979
 fry these like rockets only there is 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:20.489
 also it should not be two coils are not 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:23.720
 there must be a lot of fat on too 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:27.060
 she soaks up the heel 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.570
 strongly absorbs the oil I'm not a major 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.570
 taste 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:42.450
 I will reduce me to the edge I will do on 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:46.730
 deuce these wand better give and then 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:58.860
 so that they then roasted look 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:05:01.760
 we spread on a napkin and so we go all 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.760
 rest 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.600
 here we are and the cakes are ready this a little bit 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:19.230
 more than a half

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:28.010
