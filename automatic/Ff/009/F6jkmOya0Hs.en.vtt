00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
they look the same there's a few minor

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.979 
they look the same there's a few minor
differences<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.390> I'm<00:03:15.569> gonna<00:03:15.690> talk<00:03:15.959> about

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
differences that I'm gonna talk about

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.589 
differences that I'm gonna talk about
here<00:03:16.410> in<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> little<00:03:16.739> bit<00:03:16.880> but<00:03:17.880> as<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.420> can<00:03:18.540> see

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
here in a little bit but as you can see

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.390 
here in a little bit but as you can see
they<00:03:18.900> they're<00:03:19.170> gonna<00:03:19.290> have<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.560> same<00:03:19.860> basic

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
they they're gonna have the same basic

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.870 
they they're gonna have the same basic
design<00:03:20.549> here<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.480> in<00:03:22.290> 1977<00:03:23.280> was<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.640> first

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
design here and in 1977 was the first

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.759 
design here and in 1977 was the first
electronic<00:03:24.360> battleship<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.049> basically<00:03:25.650> just

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
electronic battleship it basically just

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.069 
electronic battleship it basically just
had<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.160> sliders<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:27.540> think<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.810> has<00:03:27.930> some

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
had the sliders and I think it has some

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.690 
had the sliders and I think it has some
LED<00:03:28.410> lights<00:03:28.650> but<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.040> didn't<00:03:29.250> have<00:03:29.400> any<00:03:29.579> of<00:03:29.610> the

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
LED lights but it didn't have any of the

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.870 
LED lights but it didn't have any of the
awesome<00:03:30.120> songs<00:03:30.390> but<00:03:30.989> then<00:03:31.140> in<00:03:31.400> 1989<00:03:32.400> they<00:03:32.730> had

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
awesome songs but then in 1989 they had

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.509 
awesome songs but then in 1989 they had
the<00:03:33.060> electronic<00:03:33.930> talking<00:03:34.349> battleship<00:03:34.860> but

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
the electronic talking battleship but

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.890 
the electronic talking battleship but
this<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.849> the<00:03:35.970> latest<00:03:36.209> version<00:03:36.390> up<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.810> we're

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
this is the latest version up and we're

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.350 
this is the latest version up and we're
going<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.079> see<00:03:37.230> if<00:03:37.349> it<00:03:37.470> stacks<00:03:37.739> up<00:03:38.030> now<00:03:39.030> some<00:03:39.329> of

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
little bit different and of course you

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.780

can see the stickers well let's see what
a<00:03:47.970> game<00:03:48.269> of<00:03:48.450> this<00:03:48.600> is<00:03:49.970> I'm<00:03:50.970> not<00:03:51.150> going<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.389> show

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
a game of this is I'm not going to show

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.599 
a game of this is I'm not going to show
the<00:03:51.870> whole<00:03:51.900> game<00:03:52.319> maybe<00:03:52.799> just<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.280> little<00:03:53.310> bit

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
the whole game maybe just a little bit

00:03:53.609 --> 00:04:01.550 
the whole game maybe just a little bit
of<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:55.790> so<00:03:58.850> now<00:03:59.850> the<00:03:59.910> sound<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:00.480> very<00:04:00.810> very<00:04:01.260> good

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
of it so now the sound is very very good

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.129 
of it so now the sound is very very good
you<00:04:01.829> can<00:04:01.859> see<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.910> sound<00:04:03.120> like<00:04:03.299> very<00:04:03.510> good<00:04:03.870> and

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
coordinate penguin this was a little bit

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.080 
coordinate penguin this was a little bit
different<00:04:53.140> had<00:04:53.380> torpedoes<00:04:53.919> that<00:04:54.280> have<00:04:54.640> sonar

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
had these little airplanes like which

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.700 
had these little airplanes like which
they<00:04:58.270> brought<00:04:58.750> back<00:04:58.810> to<00:04:59.110> business

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
they brought back to business

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.000 
they brought back to business
the<00:04:59.890> airplanes<00:05:00.720> also<00:05:01.720> work<00:05:02.110> like<00:05:02.140> radar<00:05:02.710> and

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
the airplanes also work like radar and

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:09.930 
the airplanes also work like radar and
they<00:05:03.340> would<00:05:06.300> they<00:05:07.300> would<00:05:07.419> read<00:05:07.660> one<00:05:08.700> block<00:05:09.700> up

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
they would they would read one block up

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.790 
they would they would read one block up
when<00:05:10.180> walk<00:05:10.540> down<00:05:10.810> the<00:05:11.080> block<00:05:11.260> to<00:05:11.320> the<00:05:11.530> side

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
when walk down the block to the side

when walk down the block to the side
Cernan<00:05:12.639> would<00:05:12.790> search<00:05:13.180> for<00:05:13.210> enemy<00:05:14.310> warships

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
Cernan would search for enemy warships

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.090 
Cernan would search for enemy warships
in<00:05:15.639> this<00:05:16.270> case<00:05:16.540> I<00:05:16.930> think<00:05:17.380> it's<00:05:17.590> a<00:05:17.650> good<00:05:17.770> idea<00:05:17.889> to

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
in this case I think it's a good idea to

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.390 
in this case I think it's a good idea to
have<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:18.580> Navy<00:05:19.510> the<00:05:20.050> world<00:05:20.320> Navy<00:05:20.590> against

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
have the Navy the world Navy against

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.110 
have the Navy the world Navy against
aliens<00:05:21.880> because<00:05:22.090> in<00:05:22.780> nowadays<00:05:23.790> you<00:05:24.790> got<00:05:24.970> to

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
aliens because in nowadays you got to

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.030 
aliens because in nowadays you got to
admit<00:05:25.419> that

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
admit that

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.320 
admit that
there's<00:05:27.490> not<00:05:27.610> another<00:05:27.910> naval<00:05:29.280> power<00:05:30.280> that<00:05:31.120> is

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
there's not another naval power that is

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.510 
there's not another naval power that is
not<00:05:31.360> a<00:05:31.900> friend<00:05:32.470> of<00:05:32.560> America<00:05:32.650> but<00:05:33.280> we<00:05:33.370> would

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
not a friend of America but we would

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.600 
not a friend of America but we would
fight<00:05:33.730> against<00:05:34.000> unless<00:05:34.390> it<00:05:34.690> was<00:05:34.840> an<00:05:34.960> alien

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
fight against unless it was an alien
