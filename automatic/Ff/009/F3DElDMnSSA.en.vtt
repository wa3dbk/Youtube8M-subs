games<00:01:54.720> in<00:01:54.960> general<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.770> guess<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.340> is

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
games in general so I guess this is

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.280 
games in general so I guess this is
gearboxes<00:01:57.119> final<00:01:57.509> like<00:01:57.810> their<00:01:57.990> way<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.229> saying

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
gearboxes final like their way of saying

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.219
