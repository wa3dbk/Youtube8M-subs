00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.560
 that's it 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.180
 it was already a few days ago we were shooting in swamps 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.220
 conditions were excellent and called the snow glued to the gr 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.280
 province that would never pass again that is to present the same snow 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.610
 the mayor of course we decided to ride with jean bouilhou 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.010
 but 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.810
 lonmin 1 4% thousands of memories 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.909
 and then there was a way maybe I wanted to do I like when 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.860
 I had made his presence either 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.540
 I went up in sealskin to join face I stopped in this 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.450
 moment the reception of the final jump m finally brief 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.810
 Ben Laden 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.860
 even better than a few days before it subway info 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.190
 I engaged in the first turn the gimontois lean the seed 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.680
 to his body more 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.690
 and so on 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.730
 nicely played almost nothing else it was a river that's cool with 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.050
 me that was flowing on the springs rights acquired coulaines years in the corridor to 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.149
 left 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.199
 then% and gently the first turns were introduced to negotiate me 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:16.439
 seems and then it was so it was so much snow that I fought until the 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.969
 have me boarded by the staff 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.859
 and then and all in the end finally I could see claiming this quintet nicely from 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.319
 to sink is to see where I absolutely want to go to jump 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.409
 and I took the little momentum that remained to me I skipped stone go through 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.509
 above the rocks that had planned at the base 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:33.279
 and then% practically assured in the air who spent these rejections 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.779
 I put down the skis and I let myself a little fall his side that 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:41.510
 I was destabilized when we started early and then directly touching on 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.630
 floor 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.630
 with shame 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.309
 I felt that welcome from us 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:51.639
 to explain big pain in the lower back and he 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.730
 I have right away 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.659
 so that 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.549
 mobility of the toes so everything looks good for 100 ml with the case the second 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:01.980
 tower 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.659
 rogers m 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.999
 the day before 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:16.670
 to seize it directly 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.460
 then it's the doctor who also came to the stirrup I have the right 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.709
 to a good dose of 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.169
 pain relievers 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:28.150
 here they are warned everything is linked in barke movement I ask myself a little bit 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:30.049
 further down the handlebars 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.629
 % go up in echoes the direction the hospital of sion of the hague the 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.400

 last year the lambert unf 2 by chance i have not touched the spinal cord m 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:49.029

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:55.529
 without e 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:04:01.319
 who finishes early for this year so I finish my season she would have remained a 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.879
 little in the shadow of the team but I will continue to work 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.359
 So for all public relations looking for partners 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.599
 it is to communicate a little about our projects of this transfer it must not 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.269
 stop there and then the little train to leave next year with her 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:20.279
