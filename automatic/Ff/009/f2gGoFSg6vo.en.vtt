00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.269
 I have to welcome you to Hamburg 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.400
 My name is not a study from the company 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.500
 Steiff in Norderstedt and we are since 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.000
 25 years is the absolute specialist 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.260
 the issue of vehicle safety goes into 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.210
 I want to give you my video today 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.050
 an alarm installation imagine the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.879
 we have made here in two bmws 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.260
 that are bmwf 80 difference between 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.700
 The two bmws are not that 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.770
 are lowered but that is one 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.149
 Lte model and that of the predecessor so 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.950
 a facelift model does not exist yet 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.320
 so long that is the brand new and 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.960
 The owner of the case is directly out 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.489
 Munich factory from the pick up to me 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.379
 come to secure his vehicle 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.239
 why did he do that because he did 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.010
 moderator in the forum is very good 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.859
 knows how much is stolen how much 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.210
 is stolen and why is too much bmw 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.489
 stolen because that simply coveted 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.590
 Vehicles are navis are stolen 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.119
 Steering wheels are stolen the discs 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.040
 be hit and so on and so on 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.320
 so on and that does not have to be everything 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.150
 with a reasonable alarm system 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.250
 you will not have any stress with it and why 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.070
 simply stealing so much these days 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.650
 there are no border checks in europe 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.180
 the diesel for the most part 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.330
 they come with the eastern european region 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.479
 high quality vehicle parts vehicles 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.549
 act 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.439
 which uses us at night and 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.880
 call these cars apart and the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.500
 Most people can come to me 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.829
 Do not even imagine stealing 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.720
 becomes 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.369
 if you are the second or third time 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.689
 were victims and dealt with it 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.899
 they really do see that 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.790
 Mesh of organized criminals 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.909
 is bound and again these are 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.990
 bmws visited and cleared out now 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.790
 you say yes but why the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.100
 alarm system master cracked form of 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.290
 malaria but had the factory took 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.399
 This factory alarm system has the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.990
 disadvantage that they are simply a 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.670
 series production is and at one 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.520
 it is so serial production if he the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.439
 procured once can crack of bmw 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.090
 he does that with every and every system 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.380
 best computer the best software that 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.879
 best car has a weak spot and 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.110
 when the thieves have found the house 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.890
 then you can all out of the series 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.720
 crack 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.100
 On board diagnosis a huge topic 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.810
 we always want to because that's the 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.490
 Achilles heel of safety and these 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.310
 Vehicles are always on the on 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.990
 cracked board diagnosis and that must 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.340
 not be everything and that's not that 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.990
 it is a bmw problem unfortunately 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.400
 all car manufacturers if you look 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.590
 Surveillance videos look at these 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.880
 vehicles are stolen in minutes since 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.830
 the manufacturers can not 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.180
 against defense 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.650
 why are the systems that we obstruct? 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.750
 I can tell you that powerfully 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.060
 for the following reason because it is everything 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.290
 unique what we have installed here 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.150
 that was what you had built in there then 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.440
 have the standard alarm systems 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.850
 always sit at the same places and 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.709
 immobilizer what we install 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.650
 they are all unique we here more 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.090
 built by further called campus 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.890
 alarm systems this campus alarm system 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.120
 this works completely as follows 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.980
 residue-free can not see her 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.540
 can the system comfortable over the 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.820
 sharpening the factory key and 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.560
 defuse and you do not need one 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.350
 carry additional hand transmitter and 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.790
 which is very well done with the system 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.110
 have so-called multilevel armin though 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.180
 we are the finalists twice 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.560
 Sensors shut down for example here 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.630
 at this bmw also have from 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.430
 Empire attracts 200 GSM locating system 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.049
 installed with the pager function because 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.610
 this vehicle is towed or 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.120
 here in his container disappears 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.380
 and then the owner gets one immediately 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.810
 Notification can be made at any time 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.180
 So this is really cool 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.310
 made cost but costs 100 euro 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.340
 such a regulatory system 250 of the 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.510
 Radar sensor for prevention 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.860
 I can show you how it is 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.690
 works i guess the system 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.250
 and if I am here with the vehicle now 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.870
 I do not need the map at all 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.850
 to crawl that is the salary is the 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.570
 Rad field is infinitely adjustable by 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.220
 the size 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.209
 I approach the vehicle go here 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.019
 on and the alarm says already 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.670
 turnkey you have the car 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.630
 nothing is really to be found 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.700
 because mine is not mine 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.200
 Customer vehicle and that makes it easy 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.360
 so effective that is when the boys 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.890
 comply in Lithuania say call 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.560
 the thing again, by the way, nothing 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.180
 Lithuania against German african clown 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.590
 all of them are rogue everywhere 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.820
 I only come from Lithuania with us 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.590
 I would say a few more 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.940
 but anyway I'm leaving then 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.109
 Nobody does not need to 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.150
 crawl and the thing is already done 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.280
 the template looked close hau has it 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.480
 nothing to look for and the customers of us 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.160
 who have built such a system 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.630
 let in 25 years and we obstruct 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.560
 really not a little of the things in 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.750
 Germany market leader for the 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.370
 Wallanlagen have never been 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.680
 have to find loss and that's what it does 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.630
 1 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.919
 Real meaningful horny we made 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.490
 can everything come out again if the 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.410
 be a customer 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.460
 that was now no dare in a screen 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.720
 a private were but she has 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.470
 Of course, many company vehicles 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.930
 if they want to have that expanded we 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.880
 with us only the new one triggers the new one 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.620
 software one of the new car if he 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.740
 subsequently in five worth and x5 or else 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.560
 anything we build everything without 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.310
 traces and that's just how it is 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.860
 Sustainable we can do the next 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.530
 vehicle we take over the alarm systems 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.729
 of course, still protect the contacts 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.590
 trunk lid have contact ignition 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.690
 is over that was when i was 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.520
 now this vehicle would crack 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.259
 I would do that to the ignition 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.449
 quite well defuses the thing here 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.949
 just so the alarm system sharpens now 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.020
 is there a dollar perrot bullock 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.070
 exhausted means that the zone is open 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.440
 and now I want to try that 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:16.449
 steal church here so you hear it 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.030
 already is a very small learning 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.039
 and would like that to the super g for 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.349
 check 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:25.030
 the paint is further starts here 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.830
 Things to do here and 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.330
 Now here's the navi out there doing that 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:33.599
 No one does not do anything with the sharks 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.599
 learn there as well as win land for it 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.750
 so this is the hell of noise here now 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:44.169
 this will turn off if I am now 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.030
 vehicle back defuses that 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.520
 vehicle so now on it 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.590
 bath abbach mitigates the alarm system 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.150
 do not tell me to do business twice 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.789
 four magical ones during my absence 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.080
 I was so lame and then I can 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.000
 Ever wonder why you look and have me 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.800
 because a bump in the car purely hewn 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.860
 he has made a scratch 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.180
 and that shows me exactly the alarm system 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.039
 took care during my 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.020
 absence of this customer gets 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.060
 of course a call on his cellphone and 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.159
 will then be notified immediately 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.449
 alarm in absence was completely 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:15.070
 I certainly have in a video at 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:16.570
 a few things again 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.380
 But that's what it's all about 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.520
 not bad at all 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:27.669
 you can me 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:32.310
 call at 01 72 thank you very much 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:32.310
 done so like me could call 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.270
 check 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.940
 just to kabul
