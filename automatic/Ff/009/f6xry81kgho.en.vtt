here i'm going to show you the reload

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.830 
here i'm going to show you the reload
times<00:00:46.829> as<00:00:47.070> well<00:00:47.250> as<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.640> rate<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.940> fire<00:00:48.360> and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
times as well as the rate of fire and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.569 
times as well as the rate of fire and
you<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.079> see<00:00:49.200> they're<00:00:49.350> very<00:00:49.620> similar<00:00:49.890> with

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
you can see they're very similar with

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.520 
you can see they're very similar with
the<00:00:50.730> scar-h<00:00:51.149> being<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.570> little<00:00:51.780> bit<00:00:51.899> faster<00:00:52.320> but

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the scar-h being a little bit faster but

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.850 
the scar-h being a little bit faster but
the<00:00:52.710> recoil<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.699> very<00:00:54.000> low<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> an-94<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the recoil is very low for the an-94 and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.189 
the recoil is very low for the an-94 and
moderate<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.879> hide<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.239> between<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.750> scar-h

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
moderate to hide it between the scar-h

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.069 
moderate to hide it between the scar-h
and<00:00:58.649> i<00:00:58.949> know<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.370> really<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.719> gun

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
and i know it really it is what gun

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.840 
and i know it really it is what gun
you're<00:01:01.289> most<00:01:01.500> comfortable<00:01:01.739> with<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.489> these

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
you're most comfortable with and these

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.149 
you're most comfortable with and these
two<00:01:03.180> are<00:01:03.210> my<00:01:03.660> favorite<00:01:04.080> assault<00:01:04.530> rifles<00:01:04.920> in

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
two are my favorite assault rifles in

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.210 
two are my favorite assault rifles in
the<00:01:05.309> game<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.729> like<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.510> use<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> an-94<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.710> well

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the game I like to use the an-94 as well

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.460 
the game I like to use the an-94 as well
as<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> scar<00:01:08.729> h<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.510> we're<00:01:09.720> talking<00:01:09.930> about<00:01:10.200> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
as a scar h but we're talking about the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.130 
as a scar h but we're talking about the
an-94<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.790> first<00:01:12.060> two<00:01:12.330> rounds<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.900> each

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
an-94 the first two rounds of each

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.289 
an-94 the first two rounds of each
bursts<00:01:13.650> are<00:01:13.799> fired<00:01:14.100> at<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> faster<00:01:14.909> rate<00:01:14.939> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
bursts are fired at a faster rate and

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.179 
bursts are fired at a faster rate and
that<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.570> why<00:01:15.780> i<00:01:15.810> think<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> 94<00:01:16.950> wins

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
that is why i think the a 94 wins

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.219 
that is why i think the a 94 wins
overall<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.299> let<00:01:18.420> me<00:01:18.509> know<00:01:18.540> about<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:19.049> in

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
overall and let me know about this in

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.600 
overall and let me know about this in
comment<00:01:19.590> section<00:01:19.619> below<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.220> talk<00:01:20.400> about

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
comment section below is I talk about

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.660 
comment section below is I talk about
attachments<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.780> these<00:01:21.900> two<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.770> they<00:01:23.520> will

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
attachments for these two but they will

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.399 
attachments for these two but they will
work<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:24.030> well<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.420> see<00:01:24.930> here<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.380> have

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
the side so you can use a stock for both

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.330
