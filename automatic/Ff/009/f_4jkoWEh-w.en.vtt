00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:13.710
 yes, here you see the suitcase of the cars 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.890
 call development kit edition and me 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.289
 Christoph of gamesload just open it for him 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.539
 this sacred box 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.840
 maybe the biggest one is here 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.410
 revolution for a long time for the whole 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.189
 entertainment industry in it and me 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.469
 see you all again separately 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.489
 Here you see now the yukos throws off 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.680
 in the front a screened area because they 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.290
 the still a knob with which he 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.430
 the display to the rear and front 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.410
 so you can imagine distance regulated 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.289
 Now I'll show you the inner life 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.070
 the autobus throws here you see the two 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.649
 thick fat lentils where you through 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.870
 Look, you see, maybe here reflects 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.979
 My gopro is still with me 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.439
 foam padding and with ausgestallt 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.360
 is really very good because they still 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.770
 the closure tape-da can you 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.000
 still adjust the bands each 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.570
 head size here now has the okoro swift 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.540
 with four connections because they the the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.790
 hdmi connection the dvi connection the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.970
 micro-usb connection and the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.950
 power supply and here you can still 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.770
 make various settings at the hub 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.380
 for example, to minimize the contrast 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.630
 or increase as well yet again, 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.560
 brightness and here you can the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.909
 turn off an inscription 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.840
 maybe you remember I have 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.820
 recently a video about susanne online 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.280
 I have my first 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.930
 Experiences made of virtual fear 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.560
 but we also have other games 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.500
 tested including half life 2 us 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.670
 just can see and the special feature 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.250
 here is the mouse in half life 2 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.470
 cursor now detached, so to speak 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.190
 Use the mouse to move the cursor freely 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.459
 can you thank you with the inscription 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.020
 headtracking can look around the hate 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.350
 I really liked the game feeling 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.390
 and for me personally I see a 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.580
 huge potential and that may be 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.410
 twice as much fun 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.550
 but we do not just have hardware 2 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:33.600
 played but also later 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.940
 look alike minecraft we can you 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.069
 See the arm moves very funny like 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.330
 such a wooden name helped life 2 that 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.269
 whole is still one 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.959
 development is not mature yes here 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:49.920
 Do you see minecraft now and I have 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.870
 the mod minecraft installed can 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.870
 you are free to download one 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.640
 Unofficial motto itself 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.829
 calibration of the inscription and 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.560
 minecraft was the reference so far 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.900
 thanks to the unofficial motto the head 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.110
 tracking so that looked around very much 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.840
 Liquid and you did not feel 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:17.340
 that at all a delay in the game 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.799
 would be and the whole thing was really very 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.950
 mature yes you may wonder 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.440
 As the technology of cars calls at all 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.720
 I want you to do that 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.390
 So once briefly explain basically is 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.280
 be quite simple on a display 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.750
 Two pictures shown for each eye of one 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.940
 these are not identical they give way 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.090
 slightly different from each other as in the real one 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.480
 yes live the left eye sees one 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.549
 other picture section than the right one too 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.340
 this displaced picture will now be 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.920
 a so-called barrel historical 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.220
 signs added the picture 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.220
 world that is necessary because the lenses 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.940
 Otherwise the picture would be too distorted 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.910
 shader and lens lift up at the end 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.770
 so a pretty wide field of view with 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.590
 stereoscopic depth without any 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.880
 Distortion arises here you see 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.920
 still the free fall was very 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.200
 popular with minecraft because you could 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.519
 sometimes try one or the other 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.489
 fashion bad as well 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.160
 yes that was it first family cycle 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.330
 I can only say to you here comes 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.330
 which is very big for you
