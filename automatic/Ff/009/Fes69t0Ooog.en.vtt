 I'll give you three products on this topic 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:21.920
 once optimized in the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.920

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:45.210
 provide so-called Thyrow that I will be 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:49.020
 first bought the pharmacy 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.190
 basics inflamed around problematic 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.190
 prevent piercings 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.410
 we see little touching him a little 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.940
 drugs play with it because it is not 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.650
 It is actually a toy 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.500
 body jewelery and if somehow there 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.180
 with it or wants to play around it 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.799
 you can do that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.390
 but if you like yourself 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.490
 then do only want to see if sp 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.380

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:26.970

 inflamed place or to the first 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:41.400
 get it done that's not good 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:45.840
 and not with unwashed hands 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.530
 Just touch it a bit 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.530
 pay attention to hygiene 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.020
 and even a tip of another one of 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.469
 a bit to the basics is the bsi 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.799
 so do not worry about over 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.750
 often a day clean with something because 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.079
 in turn, too many movements 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.640
 on it comes and not too often during the day 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.190
 I use the products I use 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.890
 we just showed what we too 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.660
 the products 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.840
 have optimist is a colorful 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.040
 disinfectant that means so 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.140
 I'll just tell you how 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.459
 that's how I went before 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.580
 I'm always very good with that 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.620
 drove when I noticed the psn 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.420
 saved whatever inflames me 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.240
 I just have problems with that 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.090
 first used martini myself 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.280
 I never more than twice a day 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.280
 he uses only once 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.270
 I 've always looked what that from 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.910
 Medium also comes in the channel because 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:54.489
 the thing what that must mean as have 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.560
 I did that, for example 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.070
 my nose piercing is always inside 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.220
 sprayed out a bit 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:07.110
 back in and once turned 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.459
 finished well, I would have noticed now 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.810
 that does not help so I never have that 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:16.060
 used for more than a week and when 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.280
 it did not bring anything I thought 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.290
 okay if it has done so far 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.920
 then it does not help anymore, too 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.930
 really fresh then i need something 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.110
 harder then I am to my cellar 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.920
 gone or old church 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.220
 from the region and I have just that 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.780
 mentioned the usu ag recommend 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.100
 that's practically more than heard 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:46.030
 normal disinfectant you can 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.519
 or you should not know 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.160
 two to three times a day on the 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.420
 Apply affected area and also 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.160
 Do not use for more than a week 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.180
 that helped a lot with two 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.320
 so i have my problem i have 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.299

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.750
 Anyway, my had a problem 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.760
 example was the problematic 14 at 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.780
 me 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.489
 So I have the problem bed 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.109
 I can get that and that's great 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.709
 Anyone who recommends with his 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.560
 Piercing just longer than usual 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.120
 Zicken has the most natural and last 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.430
 medium that I would like to introduce you 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:33.960
 the theme is oil that i use all the way 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.920
 like to care for the piercings now and then 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.900
 if only really one now 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.120
 have slight inflammation or redness 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.670
 You can also try it if it is 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:47.560
 so that only goes away so I would 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:52.060
 just categorize first 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.700
 lightest middle and for the 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.390
 absolute among the piercings theory 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.130

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.870
 Any questions do not have something 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.660
 owe or any criticism 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.960

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.420
 I am not a trained Peter me 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.780
 tell you everything on your own 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:19.840
 experiences or due to the 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.430
 common sense and due to the 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.470
 knowing that I have appropriated myself 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:29.800
 since I'm born , that's it 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.990
 I hope the tips help you and if 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.669
 Their specific knowledge will come then 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.669
