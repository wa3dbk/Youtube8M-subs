it there's a secret location where you
can<00:00:47.579> find<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.480> not<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.870> hard<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.140> get<00:00:49.379> i

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
can find it it's not that hard to get i

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.799 
can find it it's not that hard to get i
got<00:00:49.739> i<00:00:49.950> got<00:00:50.010> mine<00:00:50.370> from<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.030> secret<00:00:51.329> location

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
got i got mine from the secret location

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.470 
got i got mine from the secret location
he<00:00:52.739> usually<00:00:52.920> spawns<00:00:53.370> every<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.059> 10<00:00:54.239> minutes

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
he usually spawns every like 10 minutes

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.560 
he usually spawns every like 10 minutes
or<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.309> it's<00:00:56.309> not<00:00:56.430> not<00:00:56.879> typical<00:00:57.239> at<00:00:57.329> all<00:00:57.420> to

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
or so so it's not not typical at all to

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.799 
or so so it's not not typical at all to
get<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:58.199> anyways<00:00:58.730> overall<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.940> car<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.539> GTA

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
get but anyways overall this car in GTA

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.640 
get but anyways overall this car in GTA
5<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:02.039> super<00:01:02.850> fast<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.570> at<00:01:04.080> times<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.619> can

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
5 it's super fast like at times it can

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.679 
5 it's super fast like at times it can
be<00:01:04.860> too<00:01:05.100> fast<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.790> when<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.000> want<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.299> just

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
be too fast like when you want to just

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.440 
be too fast like when you want to just
drive<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.740> normal<00:01:08.220> you'll<00:01:08.520> you'll<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.299> go

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
drive like normal you'll you'll just go

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.660 
drive like normal you'll you'll just go
way<00:01:09.689> too<00:01:09.750> fast<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.920> kind<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.250> gotta<00:01:11.430> watch

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
way too fast so you kind of gotta watch

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.969 
way too fast so you kind of gotta watch
out<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.810> drifting<00:01:13.500> why<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.710> this

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
out for that but drifting why is this

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.310 
out for that but drifting why is this
thing<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.340> actually<00:01:14.670> drift<00:01:14.939> pretty<00:01:15.210> good<00:01:15.479> I

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
thing can actually drift pretty good I

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.929 
thing can actually drift pretty good I
was<00:01:16.740> actually<00:01:16.890> surprised<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.610> thought<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.790> have

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
was actually surprised I thought I have

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.950 
was actually surprised I thought I have
too<00:01:18.090> much<00:01:18.119> power<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.430> spin<00:01:20.430> out<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> lot<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.210> it

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
too much power and spin out a lot but it

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.450 
too much power and spin out a lot but it
didn't<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.680> actually<00:01:22.860> drift<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.310> this

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
didn't you can actually drift to this

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.370 
didn't you can actually drift to this
thing<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:23.880> pretty<00:01:24.090> fun<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:25.170> looks
