it but if you're willing to build a

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
little bit more modular it should be but

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.740 
little bit more modular it should be but

even for an opal computers upgrading
things<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.170> trickier<00:02:49.770> than<00:02:49.800> say<00:02:50.310> with<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:50.700> a

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
things is trickier than say with just a

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.000 
things is trickier than say with just a
PC<00:02:51.120> where<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.420> pull<00:02:51.900> out<00:02:51.930> cards<00:02:52.410> put<00:02:52.739> in<00:02:52.860> new

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
PC where you pull out cards put in new

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.620 
PC where you pull out cards put in new
ones<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.430> even<00:02:53.940> then<00:02:54.090> if<00:02:54.209> you<00:02:54.300> want<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.510> get<00:02:54.570> a

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
ones and even then if you want to get a

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.300 
ones and even then if you want to get a
new<00:02:54.810> cpu<00:02:55.050> if<00:02:55.380> it's<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.590> few<00:02:55.770> years<00:02:55.800> old<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.190> need

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
new cpu if it's a few years old you need

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
new cpu if it's a few years old you need
to<00:02:56.400> get<00:02:56.489> a<00:02:56.550> new<00:02:56.580> motherboard<00:02:56.880> which<00:02:57.090> basically

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
to get a new motherboard which basically

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.510 
to get a new motherboard which basically
means<00:02:57.540> rebuilding<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.739> it's<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.250> lot<00:02:59.489> easier

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
means rebuilding it so it's a lot easier

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.699 
means rebuilding it so it's a lot easier
to<00:02:59.850> say<00:03:00.330> on<00:03:00.510> paper<00:03:00.780> we<00:03:01.050> should<00:03:01.200> be<00:03:01.320> able<00:03:01.410> to

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
to say on paper we should be able to

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.520 
to say on paper we should be able to
upgrade<00:03:01.920> things<00:03:02.430> as<00:03:02.670> we<00:03:03.239> go<00:03:03.270> modular<00:03:04.020> Lee<00:03:04.230> with

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
upgrade things as we go modular Lee with

upgrade things as we go modular Lee with
very<00:03:04.800> simple<00:03:05.040> pieces<00:03:05.640> but<00:03:06.540> effectively

very simple pieces but effectively

that's<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.830> big<00:03:07.980> question<00:03:08.510> also<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.630> new<00:03:09.720> stay

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
that's a big question also the new stay

it's<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.170> smart<00:03:25.530> one<00:03:25.709> where<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.100> can<00:03:26.130> wave<00:03:26.489> at

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
it's the smart one where you can wave at

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.190 
it's the smart one where you can wave at
it<00:03:26.820> and<00:03:26.970> it'll<00:03:27.239> turn<00:03:27.450> it<00:03:27.600> off<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:27.750> will<00:03:27.989> warn

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
it and it'll turn it off and will warn

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.229 
it and it'll turn it off and will warn
you<00:03:28.290> before<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.739> makes<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.980> loud<00:03:29.100> noise<00:03:29.340> if<00:03:30.060> it

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
you before it makes a loud noise if it

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.490 
you before it makes a loud noise if it
detects<00:03:30.480> anything<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:30.989> evidently<00:03:31.230> that's

detects anything and evidently that's

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.470 
detects anything and evidently that's
where<00:03:32.070> they<00:03:32.190> found<00:03:32.220> some<00:03:32.760> kind<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:32.970> problem<00:03:33.180> if

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
where they found some kind of problem if

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.509 
where they found some kind of problem if
you<00:03:33.540> look<00:03:33.690> at<00:03:33.810> their<00:03:34.560> their<00:03:34.830> blog<00:03:35.070> there<00:03:35.310> the

you look at their their blog there the

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.860 
you look at their their blog there the
statement<00:03:36.090> which<00:03:36.180> doesn't<00:03:36.480> have<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.600> lot<00:03:36.840> of

statement which doesn't have a lot of
details<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.380> what<00:03:37.620> exactly<00:03:37.890> not<00:03:38.250> wrong<00:03:38.400> with

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
details of what exactly not wrong with

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:39.979 
details of what exactly not wrong with
it<00:03:38.700> but<00:03:39.180> what<00:03:39.299> they<00:03:39.420> said<00:03:39.570> was<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:39.840> they

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
it but what they said was that they

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.479 
it but what they said was that they
observed<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.620> unique<00:03:40.920> combination<00:03:41.130> of

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
circumstances that caused them to

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.960 
circumstances that caused them to
question<00:03:43.799> whether<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.100> nest<00:03:44.340> wave<00:03:44.580> which<00:03:44.850> is

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
question whether the nest wave which is

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.070 
question whether the nest wave which is
the<00:03:45.090> feature<00:03:45.239> that<00:03:45.450> enables<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.810> turn<00:03:46.019> off

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
the feature that enables you to turn off

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.289 
the feature that enables you to turn off
the<00:03:46.410> alarm<00:03:46.620> could<00:03:47.400> be<00:03:47.519> unintentionally

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
the alarm could be unintentionally

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.120 
the alarm could be unintentionally
activated<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.260> idea<00:03:49.470> being<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:49.739> presumably

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
activated the idea being that presumably

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.590 
activated the idea being that presumably
there<00:03:50.340> could<00:03:50.430> be<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.519> fire<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:51.120> would<00:03:51.239> want<00:03:51.450> the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
there could be a fire you would want the

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.420 
there could be a fire you would want the
alarm<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:51.989> continue<00:03:52.410> being<00:03:52.560> on<00:03:52.799> yeah<00:03:53.250> but

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
alarm to continue being on yeah but

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.949 
alarm to continue being on yeah but
waving<00:03:54.060> your<00:03:54.150> arms<00:03:54.209> or<00:03:54.600> it<00:03:54.810> could

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
waving your arms or it could

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.900 
waving your arms or it could
accidentally<00:03:55.320> go<00:03:55.560> be<00:03:56.100> turned<00:03:56.310> off<00:03:56.489> by<00:03:56.519> some

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
accidentally go be turned off by some

accidentally go be turned off by some
way<00:03:57.060> this<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:57.959> kind<00:03:58.170> of<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.290> big<00:03:58.470> flaw<00:03:58.680> we<00:03:58.860> tested

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
way this is kind of a big flaw we tested

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.560 
way this is kind of a big flaw we tested
this<00:03:59.310> in<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.519> labs<00:03:59.730> we<00:04:00.000> didn't<00:04:00.239> see<00:04:00.360> anything

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
this in the labs we didn't see anything

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.720 
this in the labs we didn't see anything
wrong<00:04:00.810> with<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:01.049> no<00:04:01.380> although<00:04:01.620> we<00:04:01.830> don't<00:04:02.610> do<00:04:02.700> a

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
wrong with it no although we don't do a

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.009 
wrong with it no although we don't do a
whole<00:04:02.820> lot<00:04:02.910> of<00:04:03.060> stuff<00:04:03.180> with<00:04:03.299> fire<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.840> labs

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
whole lot of stuff with fire in the labs

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.729 
whole lot of stuff with fire in the labs
despite<00:04:04.410> my<00:04:04.530> pushing<00:04:04.860> for<00:04:05.040> it<00:04:06.739> it's

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
despite my pushing for it it's

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.280 
despite my pushing for it it's
questionable<00:04:08.610> but<00:04:08.940> at<00:04:09.120> this<00:04:09.239> point<00:04:09.480> nest<00:04:10.049> is

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
questionable but at this point nest is

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.229 
questionable but at this point nest is
they've<00:04:10.530> stopped<00:04:10.799> selling<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.310> they're<00:04:11.670> going

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
they've stopped selling it they're going

I think<00:04:27.440> they're<00:04:27.530> doing<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.740> right<00:04:27.860> thing<00:04:28.070> if

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
I think they're doing the right thing if

I think they're doing the right thing if
they<00:04:28.310> found<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:28.610> bug<00:04:28.760> they<00:04:28.880> should<00:04:29.030> definitely

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
they found a bug they should definitely

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.000 
they found a bug they should definitely
tell<00:04:29.570> consumers<00:04:29.960> about<00:04:30.260> it<00:04:30.440> but<00:04:30.770> I<00:04:30.800> wish<00:04:30.980> they

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
tell consumers about it but I wish they

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.080 
tell consumers about it but I wish they
would<00:04:31.220> give<00:04:31.310> us<00:04:31.400> just<00:04:31.550> a<00:04:31.640> little<00:04:31.670> bit<00:04:31.970> more

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
would give us just a little bit more

generally the better picture you can get
this<00:05:46.970> varies<00:05:47.840> a<00:05:47.870> lot<00:05:48.050> and<00:05:48.200> they're<00:05:48.320> off<00:05:48.440> some

this varies a lot and they're off some

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.640 
this varies a lot and they're off some
very<00:05:48.860> good<00:05:49.070> budget<00:05:49.460> models<00:05:49.760> but<00:05:50.540> usually<00:05:51.440> it's

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
very good budget models but usually it's

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.350 
very good budget models but usually it's
one<00:05:51.950> of<00:05:52.070> many<00:05:52.250> indicators<00:05:52.700> that<00:05:52.880> you'll<00:05:53.180> get<00:05:53.300> a

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
one of many indicators that you'll get a

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.850 
one of many indicators that you'll get a
better<00:05:53.540> picture<00:05:53.810> if<00:05:54.170> it<00:05:54.350> has<00:05:54.500> more<00:05:54.680> features

expensive<00:06:55.370> than<00:06:55.789> the<00:06:55.849> LIA<00:06:56.150> but<00:06:56.870> this<00:06:57.439> does

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
expensive than the LIA but this does

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.860 
expensive than the LIA but this does
feel<00:06:57.889> a<00:06:58.219> lot<00:06:58.580> better<00:06:58.729> preliminary<00:06:59.599> we're

going<00:07:00.050> to<00:07:00.110> have<00:07:00.199> a<00:07:00.229> review<00:07:00.409> next<00:07:00.620> week<00:07:00.740> and<00:07:01.069> it
