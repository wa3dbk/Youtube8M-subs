butter is well combined so that your

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.200 
butter is well combined so that your
dough<00:00:36.109> will<00:00:36.139> turn<00:00:36.469> out<00:00:36.589> better<00:00:36.679> that<00:00:36.800> way<00:00:37.210> then

counter top and you're going to roll up
the<00:01:08.840> dough<00:01:09.049> to<00:01:09.590> 1/8<00:01:10.159> of<00:01:10.630> an<00:01:11.630> inch<00:01:11.750> thickness<00:01:13.210> so

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
the dough to 1/8 of an inch thickness so

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.740 
the dough to 1/8 of an inch thickness so
the<00:01:16.130> best<00:01:16.310> way<00:01:16.549> to<00:01:16.609> roll<00:01:16.850> this<00:01:17.000> out<00:01:17.210> is<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:17.539> flip

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
the best way to roll this out is to flip

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.849 
the best way to roll this out is to flip
it<00:01:17.869> over<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:18.109> couple<00:01:18.289> times<00:01:18.409> so<00:01:18.679> there's<00:01:18.829> a

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
it over a couple times so there's a

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.580 
it over a couple times so there's a
little<00:01:18.979> bit<00:01:19.159> of<00:01:19.250> flour<00:01:19.399> on<00:01:19.640> each<00:01:19.759> side<00:01:20.060> and

I find the the 3 inch pokey cutter is

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.630 
I find the the 3 inch pokey cutter is
better<00:01:53.810> because<00:01:54.319> you<00:01:54.950> have<00:01:55.039> fewer<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.460> these

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
better because you have fewer of these

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.700 
better because you have fewer of these
little<00:01:55.909> circles<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.749> fold<00:01:56.929> over<00:01:57.109> and<00:01:57.259> it<00:01:57.469> saves

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
little circles to fold over and it saves

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.139 
little circles to fold over and it saves
you<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:57.889> little<00:01:57.950> bit<00:01:58.159> of<00:01:58.219> time<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:58.939> these

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
you a little bit of time and these

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.489 
you a little bit of time and these

around one half at the edge of each of
the<00:02:19.159> circles<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.730> recommend<00:02:20.569> that<00:02:20.659> you<00:02:20.750> do

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
the circles I recommend that you do

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.179 
the circles I recommend that you do
these<00:02:21.019> one<00:02:21.200> at<00:02:21.319> a<00:02:21.379> time<00:02:21.560> don't<00:02:21.829> use<00:02:22.069> a<00:02:22.159> whole

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:22.189 
these one at a time don't use a whole

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.160 
these one at a time don't use a whole
bunch<00:02:22.640> like<00:02:22.879> I'm<00:02:23.090> doing<00:02:23.299> now<00:02:23.420> because<00:02:23.450> by<00:02:24.110> the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
bunch like I'm doing now because by the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.440 
bunch like I'm doing now because by the
time<00:02:24.230> you<00:02:24.470> get<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.769> last<00:02:24.950> one<00:02:25.370> they<00:02:26.000> don't

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
time you get to the last one they don't

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.530 
time you get to the last one they don't
start<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.810> get<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:26.989> bit<00:02:27.140> soggy<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:28.640> when<00:02:29.329> you<00:02:29.390> put

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
start to get a bit soggy so when you put

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.240 
start to get a bit soggy so when you put
after<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.870> put<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.079> milk<00:02:30.230> on<00:02:30.409> put<00:02:30.769> about<00:02:30.980> 1/4

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
after you put the milk on put about 1/4

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.069 
after you put the milk on put about 1/4
teaspoon<00:02:31.519> to<00:02:31.879> a<00:02:31.909> 1/2<00:02:32.090> teaspoon<00:02:32.120> of<00:02:32.569> jam<00:02:32.780> this

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
teaspoon to a 1/2 teaspoon of jam this

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.009 
teaspoon to a 1/2 teaspoon of jam this
is<00:02:33.230> about<00:02:33.349> 1/2<00:02:33.620> teaspoon<00:02:33.879> because<00:02:35.019> the

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
is about 1/2 teaspoon because the

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.149 
is about 1/2 teaspoon because the
circles<00:02:36.349> are<00:02:36.409> a<00:02:36.440> little<00:02:36.530> bit<00:02:36.680> bigger<00:02:36.829> than<00:02:36.980> 2

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
circles are a little bit bigger than 2

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.089 
circles are a little bit bigger than 2
inches<00:02:37.629> don't<00:02:38.629> put<00:02:38.750> too<00:02:38.900> much<00:02:38.959> jam<00:02:39.349> because

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
inches don't put too much jam because

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.860 
inches don't put too much jam because
when<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.549> fold<00:02:40.790> them<00:02:40.939> over<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.480> jam<00:02:41.750> will

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
when you fold them over the jam will

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.210 
when you fold them over the jam will
squish<00:02:42.079> out<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.379> it'll<00:02:42.500> be<00:02:42.650> hard<00:02:42.829> to<00:02:42.890> us<00:02:43.069> to

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
squish out and it'll be hard to us to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.949 
squish out and it'll be hard to us to
seal<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.609> a<00:02:43.790> little<00:02:44.359> bit<00:02:44.510> in<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.690> middle<00:02:44.900> of

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
seal it a little bit in the middle of

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.920 
seal it a little bit in the middle of
each<00:02:45.109> fold<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.099> over<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.670> then<00:02:47.569> you're<00:02:47.810> gonna

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
each fold it over and then you're gonna

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.740 
each fold it over and then you're gonna
seal<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.470> edges<00:02:48.620> by<00:02:48.980> pinching<00:02:49.489> them<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:50.060> the

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
seal the edges by pinching them and the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.420 
seal the edges by pinching them and the
reason<00:02:51.109> you<00:02:51.200> put<00:02:51.349> the<00:02:51.470> milk<00:02:51.650> on<00:02:51.829> there<00:02:52.069> is<00:02:52.250> to

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
reason you put the milk on there is to

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.729 
reason you put the milk on there is to
help<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.780> dough<00:02:53.989> get<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.230> little<00:02:54.409> bit<00:02:54.530> sticky

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
help the dough get a little bit sticky

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.520 
help the dough get a little bit sticky
so<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.459> you're<00:02:55.639> able<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:56.150> hold<00:02:56.629> it<00:02:56.840> if<00:02:57.349> it's

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
so that you're able to hold it if it's

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.860 
so that you're able to hold it if it's
able<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.799> stick<00:02:58.069> together<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:59.480> make<00:02:59.720> it<00:02:59.840> a

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
able to stick together and make it a

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.140 
able to stick together and make it a
nice<00:02:59.959> seal<00:03:00.319> if<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.099> still<00:03:01.310> isn't<00:03:01.489> good<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.879> jam

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
nice seal if it still isn't good the jam

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.640 
nice seal if it still isn't good the jam
will<00:03:02.329> leak<00:03:02.510> out<00:03:02.629> all<00:03:02.780> over<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.019> place<00:03:03.079> thread

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
will leak out all over the place thread

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.319 
will leak out all over the place thread
