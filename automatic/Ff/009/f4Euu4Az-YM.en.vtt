00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.509
 You may not even realize it but today. 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:13.579
 we live a critical moment in Brazil a 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.589
 has been committed for more than 500 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:17.990
 years and now it was oxy hearts 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.269
 Definitories today different 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.420
 indigenous communities continue to be 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:25.519
 written from their lands 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.160
 indigenous lands are public and 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.970
 constitutes a right of these peoples Article 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.710
 231 of the Federal Constitution of 1988 are 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.860
 recognized to the Indians its organization 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.360
 social customs languages ​​beliefs and 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.890
 traditions and original rights 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.390
 on lands that have traditionally been 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.310
 occupy by competing with the union demarcates 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:52.550
 protect and enforce all their 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:54.050
 goods by Brazilian legislation to the 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.630
 land must be destined for 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.720
 first to indigenous peoples 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.240
 followed by the quilombolas after the 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.430
 traditional peoples units 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.040
 conservation and settlement of 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.410
 agrarian reform would only last 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.460
 be sold to the private producer 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.150
 ah ah ah who cares to disrespect 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.250
 this law 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.159
 the ruralists see the indigenous rights 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.380
 obstacles to your business by 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.300
 different political and legal paths 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.280
 are trying to end 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.110
 these legal mechanisms that guarantee 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:34.790
 rights to Quilombola indigenous peoples 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:37.460
 and traditional in an attempt to 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.890
 able to put pressure on the government to 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.260
 rural people are threatening to paralyze 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.310
 slaughter of cattle and the sale of grains to 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:49.780
 prove that without them the country does not survive 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.640
 because it will be we will see some data 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.520
 the ruralists that we can also call 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.080
 of landlords are essentially 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.570
 monoculture farmers use their land to 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.150
 produce on speculating in the 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.850
 international market soybean sugar 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.750
 cellulose orange juice coffee cotton 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.099
 connected then who produces our 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.889
 rice and beans 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.220
 the Brazilian government and ibge are 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:17.040
 unanimous 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.520
 70% of everything we eat in Brazil is 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.800
 produced by family farming 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.620
 cassava beans milk corn coffee rice 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.990
 wheat and poultry comes from agriculture 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.490
 family 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.550
 according to the IBGE family farming 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.610
 which produces 70% of our food occupies 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.620
 only 30.5 per cent of the total area of 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.630
 establishments in the country 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:46.050
 while the landowners produce 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:49.380
 mainly cane and livestock 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.970
 year, 32 million people are slaughtered in Brazil. 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.070
 bovine heads 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.190
 they are created transported and 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.350
 slaughtered in precarious conditions 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.630
 the ruralists argue that with this 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.740
 profits generate wealth help 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.100
 develop the country and create jobs 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.100
 but it will be 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.330
 of the money they earn practically 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.000
 nothing goes to the rural workers 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.430
 landowners use no more than 25% 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.730
 of the total number of persons employed in the 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.250
 are the small properties the great 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.710
 generating employment in the countryside 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.260
 to get an idea of ​​a big farm 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.260
 in the Amazon is directly employed a 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.110
 700 oxen who occupy an area of 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.760
 area of about a thousand hectares 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.640
 same area with family farming 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.940
 would employ at least 100 times more 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.270
 distributing the income much better 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.220
 addition in July the dirty list of 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.150
 slave labor also broke the record 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:56.310
 of convicted of this crime 500 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:04:00.720
 listed slavers of these 180 36% 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:05.130
 19 sugarcane planters are farmers and 13 are 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.890
 only those who do not comply with the 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.560
 labor legislation as well as 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.019
 comply with environmental legislation 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.180
 ah but let's not forget that it's them 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.519
 the champions in the use of poison in the 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.919
 agriculture compromising our health 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.770
 biodiversity 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.570
 the livestock sector is recognized by 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.640
 United Nations Organization for 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.520
 agriculture and food as one of the 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.950
 two or three major 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.650
 more serious environmental problems in 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.380
 all scales from local to global 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.450
 about 70% of deforested areas in 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.580
 are used as pastures and 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.890
 cultivated plantations for the production of 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.210
 animals which cover a large part of 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.210
 of the remaining 30% 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.500
 but despite producing less food 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.350
 employ few workers 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.290
 use slave labor and still 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.270
 polluting the rural environment 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.060
 receive a lot of government money 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.979
 only in the 2011/2012 harvest plan 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.270
 farmers received funding from 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:12.600
 always 7.2 billion against only 16 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.850
 billion for family farming 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.010
 but you know what makes ruralista nervous 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.840
 those who resist defending their 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.940
 land and its territory. 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.400
 owners of large quantities of 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.140
 do not put any effort into finishing 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.539
 everything that is in your 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.400
 way 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:34.610
 just last year in 2012 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.039
 there were 1,276 cases of 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.340
 against indigenous people including 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:43.070
 death threats homicide attempts 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:47.020
 of murder racism personal injury 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.020
 and sexual violence 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:53.040
 indigenous lands are not to produce 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.230
 are to live are also one of the most 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.780
 important instruments for the protection of 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:00.449
 forests and biodiversity one 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.370
 comparison in the month of June 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.389
 we had a record deforestation in the 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:08.699
 Amazon 184 square kilometers 63% 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:11.729
 of this destruction took place in 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:15.990
 privately owned or owned by farmers and 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:17.850
 0% on indigenous lands in the hands of 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.100
 landowners the main function of the 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.050
 land is not the production of food but 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.880
 served a business cycle for the 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.590
 accumulation of wealth 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.720
 it begins with the acquisition of land 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.090
 more obtaining public funding 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.310
 more forgiveness of debts by banks 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.680
 public more profit for the land but 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.410
 purchase more land more than 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.660
 more financing etc etc etc 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:42.630
 the owners go year after year 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:46.860
 fattening their pockets simply by 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:48.660
 until the delay of more than 20 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.510
 years in the demarcation of indigenous lands 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.910
 have widened the genocide status of 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.370
 people have been recurring for over 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.560
 five hundred and ten years because of the 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.840
 rural people occupy indigenous lands 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.729
 their logic of destruction of the 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.960
 nature and working conditions 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.960
 analogous to slavery
