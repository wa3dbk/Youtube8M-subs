Casius lymphadenitis there's a bunch of
diseases<00:01:12.539> that<00:01:12.810> we<00:01:13.080> try<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.259> keep<00:01:13.500> out<00:01:13.649> of<00:01:13.679> the

diseases that we try to keep out of the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.820 
diseases that we try to keep out of the
herd<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:15.000> relatively<00:01:15.810> clean<00:01:16.200> heard<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.800> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
herd so a relatively clean heard and a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.830 
herd so a relatively clean heard and a
lot<00:01:17.429> of<00:01:17.460> people<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.910> buy<00:01:18.179> or<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.630> goats

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
lot of people like to buy or the goats

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.560 
lot of people like to buy or the goats
from<00:01:18.990> us<00:01:19.259> because<00:01:19.470> we're<00:01:19.979> clean<00:01:20.220> we<00:01:21.030> have

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
from us because we're clean we have

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.990 
from us because we're clean we have
really<00:01:22.170> good<00:01:22.259> management<00:01:22.649> practices<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.789> we

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
really good management practices and we

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.240 
really good management practices and we
have<00:01:24.229> relatively<00:01:25.229> nice<00:01:25.500> animals<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.130> they

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
have relatively nice animals that they

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.640 
have relatively nice animals that they
can<00:01:26.429> get<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:27.060> isn't<00:01:27.330> all<00:01:27.390> red<00:01:27.600> doling<00:01:28.049> maybe

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
can get this isn't all red doling maybe

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.010 
can get this isn't all red doling maybe
had<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.000> our<00:01:30.090> first<00:01:30.390> one

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.630 

she's<00:01:33.650> probably<00:01:33.799> gonna<00:01:34.070> be<00:01:34.280> pretty<00:01:34.310> valuable

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
she's probably gonna be pretty valuable

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.640 
she's probably gonna be pretty valuable
these<00:01:35.060> people

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
these people

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.060 
these people
total<00:01:37.460> red<00:01:37.790> coat<00:01:38.090> color<00:01:38.360> genetics<00:01:39.049> it's<00:01:39.860> a

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
total red coat color genetics it's a

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.550 
total red coat color genetics it's a
recessive<00:01:40.430> gene<00:01:40.909> to<00:01:41.600> know<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.259> different

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
recessive gene to know the different

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.940 
recessive gene to know the different
colors<00:01:42.909> I<00:01:43.909> think<00:01:44.420> black<00:01:44.930> in<00:01:45.290> Gore<00:01:45.560> goats<00:01:45.860> is

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
colors I think black in Gore goats is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.230 
colors I think black in Gore goats is
the<00:01:46.040> most<00:01:46.250> recessive<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:46.940> that's<00:01:47.090> not

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
the most recessive and that's not

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.240 
the most recessive and that's not
actually<00:01:47.600> recognized<00:01:48.140> by<00:01:48.590> some<00:01:48.649> of<00:01:49.100> the

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
actually recognized by some of the

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.620 
actually recognized by some of the
showing<00:01:49.580> associations<00:01:50.210> we<00:01:50.390> don't<00:01:50.540> really

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
showing associations we don't really

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.899 
showing associations we don't really
show<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.020> goat<00:01:51.170> tear<00:01:51.409> but<00:01:51.649> we<00:01:52.430> still<00:01:52.610> like<00:01:52.790> to

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
show the goat tear but we still like to

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.859 
show the goat tear but we still like to
go<00:01:53.000> for<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.299> nice<00:01:53.899> conformation<00:01:54.649> and

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
go for the nice conformation and

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.300 
go for the nice conformation and
generally<00:01:56.869> like<00:01:57.080> nice-looking<00:01:57.890> animals

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
generally like nice-looking animals

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.609 
generally like nice-looking animals
because<00:01:58.640> we<00:01:58.759> do<00:01:58.909> sell<00:01:59.180> to<00:01:59.450> folks<00:02:00.289> in<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.590> area

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
because we do sell to folks in the area

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.580 
because we do sell to folks in the area
who<00:02:01.100> want<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.399> show<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:02.450> animals<00:02:05.440> so<00:02:06.440> the

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.660 

you

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.870 

and<00:03:19.760> in<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.900> spring<00:03:21.170> we<00:03:22.040> have<00:03:22.310> everybody

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
and in the spring we have everybody

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.120 
and in the spring we have everybody
kidding<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.540> that's<00:03:23.690> that's<00:03:24.050> our<00:03:24.260> main<00:03:24.800> focus

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
kidding and that's that's our main focus

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
kidding and that's that's our main focus
as<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.150> kids

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.900 

you

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.780 

so<00:03:41.600> then<00:03:41.750> when<00:03:41.930> kidding<00:03:42.290> actually<00:03:42.410> starts<00:03:43.100> all

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
so then when kidding actually starts all

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.940 
so then when kidding actually starts all
students<00:03:44.180> are<00:03:44.299> responsible<00:03:45.049> for<00:03:45.409> these<00:03:45.620> goats

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
and weigh the babies every week so that

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.740 
and weigh the babies every week so that
we<00:03:56.930> can<00:03:57.250> tell<00:03:58.269> producers<00:03:59.269> when<00:03:59.420> they<00:03:59.510> buy<00:03:59.689> the
