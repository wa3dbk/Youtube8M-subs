00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
one no one the next question is sadly

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.280 
one no one the next question is sadly
your<00:02:32.400> fire<00:02:32.579> is<00:02:32.610> beginning<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.299> go<00:02:33.450> out<00:02:33.720> what

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
your fire is beginning to go out what

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.479 
your fire is beginning to go out what
book<00:02:34.470> would<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.799> tear<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.129> last<00:02:35.310> few

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
book would you tear the last few

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.729 
book would you tear the last few
chapters<00:02:35.760> out<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.390> throw<00:02:36.690> into<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.140> fire<00:02:37.470> I

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
chapters out to throw into the fire I

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.470 
chapters out to throw into the fire I
guess<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.129> would<00:02:38.310> throw<00:02:38.459> breaking<00:02:38.790> down<00:02:39.239> by

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
guess I would throw breaking down by

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.930 
guess I would throw breaking down by
Stephenie<00:02:39.930> Meyer<00:02:40.140> as<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.530> whole<00:02:41.159> that<00:02:41.190> book<00:02:41.700> was

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
Stephenie Meyer as a whole that book was

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.940 
Stephenie Meyer as a whole that book was
just<00:02:42.329> not<00:02:42.510> good<00:02:42.840> for<00:02:43.140> me<00:02:43.260> but<00:02:43.530> if<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.739> had<00:02:43.920> to

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
just not good for me but if I had to

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.680 
just not good for me but if I had to
choose<00:02:44.129> a<00:02:44.370> book<00:02:44.700> where<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.000> last<00:02:45.359> few

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
choose a book where the last few

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.229 
choose a book where the last few
chapters<00:02:45.989> was<00:02:46.440> just<00:02:46.829> not<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.549> good<00:02:47.910> experience

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
chapters was just not a good experience

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.630 
chapters was just not a good experience
it<00:02:48.870> would<00:02:49.049> go<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.410> Suzanne<00:02:50.280> Collins

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
it would go to Suzanne Collins

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.550 
it would go to Suzanne Collins
Mockingjay<00:02:51.269> because<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.840> did<00:02:52.049> not<00:02:52.079> like<00:02:52.530> that

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
Mockingjay because I did not like that

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.830 
Mockingjay because I did not like that
ending<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.670> don't<00:02:53.790> know<00:02:53.879> if<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.090> reread<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.510> today

ending I don't know if I reread it today
if<00:02:55.019> I<00:02:55.140> would<00:02:55.349> feel<00:02:55.530> differently<00:02:56.129> because<00:02:56.459> I've

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
if I would feel differently because I've

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.460
