clean to it Cael I should have gone into

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.270 
clean to it Cael I should have gone into
my<00:01:39.090> solvers<00:01:39.540> tornadoes<00:01:40.020> T<00:01:40.259> because<00:01:40.890> he<00:01:41.100> lost

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280

nothing by clicking focused plastic turn

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.289 
nothing by clicking focused plastic turn
and<00:01:43.530> now<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.159> go<00:01:44.430> into<00:01:44.700> my<00:01:44.729> tornadoes

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
and now I can just go into my tornadoes

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.840 
and now I can just go into my tornadoes
t<00:01:45.509> as<00:01:46.020> he's<00:01:46.320> gonna<00:01:46.470> go<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.890> focus<00:01:47.520> bus

t as he's gonna go for the focus bus

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.370 
t as he's gonna go for the focus bus
once<00:01:48.149> again<00:01:48.479> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.959 
once again and
I<00:01:49.409> can<00:01:49.829> get<00:01:49.979> some<00:01:50.159> damage<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.729> mega

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
I can get some damage on this mega

I can get some damage on this mega
Gardevoir<00:01:51.420> with<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:51.780> hurricane<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.649> he's

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
Gardevoir with this hurricane but he's

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.410 
Gardevoir with this hurricane but he's
gonna<00:01:52.950> save<00:01:53.189> his<00:01:53.340> mega<00:01:53.520> Gardevoir<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.000> go

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.480 
gonna save his mega Gardevoir and go
into<00:01:54.689> his<00:01:54.990> Garchomp<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.710> looking<00:01:56.280> at<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
into his Garchomp and looking at the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.819 
into his Garchomp and looking at the
damage<00:01:56.670> he's<00:01:57.030> definitely<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.659> bulky<00:01:58.320> Garchomp

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
damage he's definitely a bulky Garchomp

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.800 
damage he's definitely a bulky Garchomp
so<00:01:59.039> I<00:01:59.070> can<00:01:59.340> hopefully<00:01:59.670> knock<00:02:00.030> up<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.420> get<00:02:00.600> rid

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
just gonna go for these stealth rocks

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.160 
just gonna go for these stealth rocks
which<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.160> fine<00:02:08.369> by<00:02:08.550> me<00:02:08.729> as<00:02:08.910> i<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.420> t<00:02:09.899> them

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
which is fine by me as i can t them

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.490 
which is fine by me as i can t them
later<00:02:10.470> with<00:02:10.800> melodia<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:12.330> expected<00:02:13.260> him<00:02:13.319> to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
later with melodia and I expected him to

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.080 
later with melodia and I expected him to
go<00:02:13.620> for<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.830> dragon<00:02:14.220> tail<00:02:14.430> here<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:14.880> that's

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
go for the dragon tail here so that's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.030 
go for the dragon tail here so that's
why<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.330> didn't<00:02:15.690> go<00:02:15.750> for<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.930> u-turn<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:16.620> I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
why I didn't go for the u-turn and I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.280 
why I didn't go for the u-turn and I
just<00:02:17.220> went<00:02:17.370> for<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.670> hurricane<00:02:17.849> as<00:02:18.330> he<00:02:19.080> goes

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
just went for the hurricane as he goes

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.110 
just went for the hurricane as he goes
into<00:02:19.620> zapdos<00:02:20.069> which<00:02:20.310> means<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:20.640> i<00:02:20.760> can<00:02:20.880> just

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
into zapdos which means that i can just

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.000 
into zapdos which means that i can just
simply<00:02:21.450> go<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.780> u-turn<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.319> bring<00:02:22.860> in

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
simply go to the u-turn and bring in

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.160 
simply go to the u-turn and bring in
Malatya<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.150> i<00:02:24.330> can<00:02:24.420> defogger<00:02:24.930> with

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
Malatya so that i can defogger with

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.050 
Malatya so that i can defogger with
these<00:02:25.349> South<00:02:25.590> rocks<00:02:25.860> because<00:02:26.580> these<00:02:26.760> stealth

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
these South rocks because these stealth

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.820 
these South rocks because these stealth
rocks<00:02:27.360> are<00:02:27.540> definitely<00:02:27.959> annoying<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.440> my<00:02:28.560> team

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830
