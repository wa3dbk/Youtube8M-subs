00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
where you want you know I go through the

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.500 
where you want you know I go through the
whole<00:04:54.330> thing<00:04:56.660> let<00:04:57.660> it<00:04:57.780> dry<00:04:59.240> second<00:05:00.240> thing<00:05:00.330> we

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
whole thing let it dry second thing we

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.620 
whole thing let it dry second thing we
did<00:05:00.750> what<00:05:01.050> Rex<00:05:02.040> said<00:05:02.310> to<00:05:02.460> do<00:05:02.669> which<00:05:02.940> worked<00:05:03.450> out

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
did what Rex said to do which worked out

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.379 
did what Rex said to do which worked out
perfect<00:05:04.139> because<00:05:04.290> I<00:05:04.440> was<00:05:04.620> nina<00:05:05.010> color<00:05:05.370> of<00:05:06.060> this

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
perfect because I was nina color of this

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:12.560 
perfect because I was nina color of this
color<00:05:06.690> was<00:05:07.620> after<00:05:08.610> black<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:11.000> used<00:05:12.000> this<00:05:12.210> color

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
color was after black I used this color

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.050 
color was after black I used this color
and<00:05:13.410> I<00:05:13.560> did<00:05:13.770> a<00:05:13.800> whole<00:05:14.010> process<00:05:14.610> and<00:05:14.820> I<00:05:14.880> went

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
and I did a whole process and I went

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.720 
and I did a whole process and I went
through<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.360> thing<00:05:16.280> but<00:05:17.280> I<00:05:17.310> wanted<00:05:17.610> to

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
through the thing but I wanted to

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.340 
through the thing but I wanted to
transition<00:05:18.270> from<00:05:18.480> these<00:05:18.900> two<00:05:19.110> colors<00:05:21.200> so<00:05:22.200> what

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
transition from these two colors so what

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.760 
transition from these two colors so what
I<00:05:22.380> did<00:05:22.470> was<00:05:22.620> I<00:05:22.919> mixed<00:05:23.460> them<00:05:23.580> in<00:05:24.169> on<00:05:25.169> his<00:05:25.410> video

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
I did was I mixed them in on his video

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.620 
I did was I mixed them in on his video
he<00:05:26.040> actually<00:05:26.220> mixes<00:05:26.790> I<00:05:26.910> believe<00:05:27.180> these<00:05:27.360> two

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
he actually mixes I believe these two

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.140 
he actually mixes I believe these two
same<00:05:27.930> colors<00:05:28.380> but<00:05:29.010> it<00:05:29.160> makes<00:05:29.340> them<00:05:29.460> it<00:05:29.820> makes<00:05:30.030> a

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
same colors but it makes them it makes a

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.840 
same colors but it makes them it makes a
really<00:05:30.180> nice<00:05:30.570> color<00:05:30.900> that<00:05:31.200> transitions<00:05:31.850> down

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
really nice color that transitions down

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.440 
really nice color that transitions down
into<00:05:33.270> this<00:05:33.419> green<00:05:34.610> so<00:05:35.610> spray<00:05:36.030> these<00:05:36.210> together

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
into this green so spray these together

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.440 
into this green so spray these together
make<00:05:37.080> a<00:05:37.110> nice<00:05:37.350> little<00:05:37.560> puddle<00:05:38.150> make<00:05:39.150> sure<00:05:39.360> you

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
make a nice little puddle make sure you

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.230 
make a nice little puddle make sure you
get<00:05:39.630> it<00:05:39.780> all<00:05:39.900> where<00:05:40.139> you<00:05:40.169> want<00:05:40.470> it<00:05:41.000> now<00:05:42.000> get

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
get it all where you want it now get

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.969 
get it all where you want it now get
another<00:05:42.510> sponge<00:05:42.870> don't<00:05:43.229> use<00:05:43.350> the<00:05:43.470> same<00:05:43.680> sponge

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
another sponge don't use the same sponge

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.710 
another sponge don't use the same sponge
but<00:05:44.280> make<00:05:44.490> sure<00:05:44.520> you<00:05:44.760> test<00:05:45.030> it<00:05:45.180> each<00:05:45.330> time<00:05:45.360> you

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
but make sure you test it each time you

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.370 
but make sure you test it each time you
get<00:05:45.840> a<00:05:45.900> new<00:05:46.110> sponge<00:05:46.410> to<00:05:46.740> to<00:05:47.520> get<00:05:47.729> a<00:05:47.760> very<00:05:48.380> small

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
get a new sponge to to get a very small

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.650 
get a new sponge to to get a very small
dots<00:05:49.830> kind<00:05:50.400> of<00:05:50.550> instead<00:05:50.940> of<00:05:51.030> one<00:05:51.180> big<00:05:51.210> you

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
dots kind of instead of one big you

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.560 
dots kind of instead of one big you
don't<00:05:51.810> want<00:05:51.960> a<00:05:52.020> big<00:05:52.200> globs<00:05:53.120> and<00:05:54.120> won't<00:05:54.330> it

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
don't want a big globs and won't it

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.120 
don't want a big globs and won't it
won't<00:05:54.720> turn<00:05:54.990> out<00:05:55.050> right<00:05:55.410> and<00:05:55.620> I<00:05:55.710> look<00:05:55.919> horrible

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
won't turn out right and I look horrible

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.730 
won't turn out right and I look horrible
so<00:05:56.789> find<00:05:57.570> a<00:05:57.660> piece<00:05:57.840> of<00:05:57.870> the<00:05:58.110> sponge<00:05:58.440> where

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
so find a piece of the sponge where

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.920 
so find a piece of the sponge where
there's<00:05:58.919> just<00:05:59.340> tiny<00:05:59.850> bits<00:06:00.210> touching<00:06:00.750> but

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
there's just tiny bits touching but

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.040 
there's just tiny bits touching but
you'll<00:06:01.530> end<00:06:01.680> up<00:06:01.770> with<00:06:01.830> that<00:06:02.039> digital<00:06:02.610> look<00:06:03.050> so

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
you'll end up with that digital look so

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.600 
you'll end up with that digital look so
I<00:06:04.080> just<00:06:04.229> do<00:06:04.350> that<00:06:04.470> test<00:06:04.800> it<00:06:05.010> and<00:06:05.190> then<00:06:05.310> start

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
I just do that test it and then start

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.880 
I just do that test it and then start
working<00:06:05.669> your<00:06:06.090> gun<00:06:06.270> spray<00:06:07.140> more<00:06:07.440> if<00:06:07.560> you<00:06:07.710> need

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
working your gun spray more if you need

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:20.030 
working your gun spray more if you need
to<00:06:08.070> mix<00:06:08.310> it<00:06:08.520> up<00:06:08.900> keep<00:06:09.900> dominant

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.190 

and<00:06:20.640> then<00:06:20.730> at<00:06:20.880> the<00:06:21.030> end<00:06:21.060> I've<00:06:21.660> used<00:06:21.840> a<00:06:21.990> little

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
and then at the end I've used a little

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.020 
and then at the end I've used a little
bit<00:06:22.290> of<00:06:22.410> this<00:06:22.620> stuff<00:06:22.890> I<00:06:23.100> didn't<00:06:23.370> really<00:06:23.640> care

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
bit of this stuff I didn't really care

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.970 
bit of this stuff I didn't really care
for<00:06:24.420> this<00:06:24.630> color<00:06:27.110> in<00:06:28.110> the<00:06:28.230> location<00:06:28.770> and<00:06:28.890> i'm

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
for this color in the location and i'm

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.410 
for this color in the location and i'm
at<00:06:29.190> its<00:06:29.400> not<00:06:29.610> its<00:06:30.500> desert<00:06:31.500> sage<00:06:32.100> brush<00:06:32.520> II<00:06:32.580> kind

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:33.420 
at its not its desert sage brush II kind

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.400 
at its not its desert sage brush II kind
of<00:06:33.570> stuff<00:06:33.840> but<00:06:35.270> the<00:06:36.270> the<00:06:36.600> other<00:06:36.720> colors<00:06:37.050> work

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
of stuff but the the other colors work

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.000 
of stuff but the the other colors work
better<00:06:37.650> in<00:06:37.860> my<00:06:38.010> area<00:06:38.960> so<00:06:39.960> I<00:06:40.260> did<00:06:40.530> a<00:06:40.560> little<00:06:40.620> bit

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
better in my area so I did a little bit

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.410 
better in my area so I did a little bit
of<00:06:41.040> this<00:06:41.220> not<00:06:42.030> too<00:06:42.240> much<00:06:43.970> and<00:06:44.970> then<00:06:45.180> I<00:06:45.240> went

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:45.420 
of this not too much and then I went

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.720 
of this not too much and then I went
back<00:06:45.510> to<00:06:45.810> the<00:06:45.930> coyote<00:06:46.350> brown<00:06:46.530> where<00:06:47.490> I<00:06:47.520> had

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730 
back to the coyote brown where I had

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.760 
back to the coyote brown where I had
spots<00:06:48.180> where<00:06:48.360> there's<00:06:48.630> too<00:06:48.870> much<00:06:49.050> black<00:06:49.380> I

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
spots where there's too much black I

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.100 
spots where there's too much black I
would<00:06:50.430> just<00:06:50.610> dab<00:06:50.820> this<00:06:51.030> over-the-top<00:06:51.420> had

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
would just dab this over-the-top had

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.420 
would just dab this over-the-top had
dark<00:06:52.470> areas<00:06:52.860> that<00:06:53.040> just<00:06:53.280> seem<00:06:53.520> to<00:06:53.820> pop<00:06:54.180> out<00:06:54.480> I

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.430 
dark areas that just seem to pop out I

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.010 
dark areas that just seem to pop out I
would<00:06:56.430> I<00:06:56.640> would<00:06:56.790> you<00:06:57.330> know<00:06:57.360> I<00:06:57.480> tone<00:06:57.840> him<00:06:57.960> down
