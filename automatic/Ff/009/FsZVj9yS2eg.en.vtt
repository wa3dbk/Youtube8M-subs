00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.910 
he's gave a place so when you see
something<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.290> put<00:01:52.290> your<00:01:52.470> dirt<00:01:52.710> hole

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
something like that put your dirt hole

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.070 
something like that put your dirt hole
in<00:01:53.190> somewhere<00:01:53.700> well<00:01:54.090> you've<00:01:54.240> got<00:01:54.480> a<00:01:54.510> clump<00:01:54.960> of

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
in somewhere well you've got a clump of

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.550 
in somewhere well you've got a clump of
grass<00:01:55.230> to<00:01:55.710> block<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.610> cow<00:01:56.880> down<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:58.440> where

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
grass to block that cow down to where

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.649 
grass to block that cow down to where
he's<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:58.980> to<00:01:59.010> naturally<00:01:59.250> step<00:01:59.850> now<00:02:00.479> you'll

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
he's going to naturally step now you'll

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.080 
he's going to naturally step now you'll
notice<00:02:01.340> this<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.610> front<00:02:02.970> of<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.150> hole

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
notice this is the front of the hole

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.280 
notice this is the front of the hole
that's<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.390> front<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.810> hole<00:02:06.990> he<00:02:07.170> was

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
that's the front of the hole he was

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.869 
that's the front of the hole he was
digging<00:02:07.680> at<00:02:08.330> it's<00:02:09.330> not<00:02:09.690> straight<00:02:10.649> out<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.639> goes

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
digging at it's not straight out it goes

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.170 
digging at it's not straight out it goes
off<00:02:12.180> on<00:02:12.209> an<00:02:12.540> angle<00:02:12.840> this<00:02:13.019> way<00:02:13.459> and<00:02:14.459> he<00:02:14.969> also

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
off on an angle this way and he also

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.570 
off on an angle this way and he also
stood

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
stood

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.640 
stood
over<00:02:18.580> here<00:02:18.850> and<00:02:19.060> dugout<00:02:19.510> completely<00:02:20.410> over

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
over here and dugout completely over

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.220 
over here and dugout completely over
here<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.070> you've<00:02:21.220> got<00:02:21.460> two<00:02:21.700> patterns<00:02:22.240> this<00:02:22.960> one

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
here so you've got two patterns this one

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.970 
here so you've got two patterns this one
is<00:02:23.350> completely<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.190> side<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:26.800> one

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
is completely to the side and this one

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.350 
is completely to the side and this one
goes<00:02:27.100> out<00:02:27.310> on<00:02:27.460> a<00:02:27.490> 45<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.240> the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
goes out on a 45 and this is the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.000 
goes out on a 45 and this is the
beginning<00:02:31.510> but<00:02:31.840> look<00:02:32.020> how<00:02:32.170> this<00:02:32.380> natural

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
beginning but look how this natural

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.250 
beginning but look how this natural
rough<00:02:34.470> ugly<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:36.100> is<00:02:36.370> but<00:02:36.640> that's<00:02:36.820> exactly

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
rough ugly that is but that's exactly

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.720 
rough ugly that is but that's exactly
what<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> count<00:02:38.590> would<00:02:38.770> expect<00:02:39.250> when<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.460> comes

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
what a count would expect when it comes

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.780 
what a count would expect when it comes
across<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.090> hole<00:02:40.830> out<00:02:41.830> in<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.190> woods<00:02:42.400> if<00:02:42.640> he's

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
across a hole out in the woods if he's

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.830 
across a hole out in the woods if he's
looking<00:02:42.940> for<00:02:43.210> something<00:02:43.390> because<00:02:43.540> this<00:02:43.780> is

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
looking for something because this is

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.660 
looking for something because this is
what<00:02:44.200> he<00:02:44.350> did<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:44.770> he<00:02:44.920> knows<00:02:45.130> this<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.370> pretty

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
what he did so he knows this is pretty

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.480 
what he did so he knows this is pretty
freakin<00:02:46.060> safe<00:02:46.300> if<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.470> mimic<00:02:47.920> something<00:02:48.340> like

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
freakin safe if you mimic something like

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.160 
freakin safe if you mimic something like
that<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.760> mean<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.210> pattern<00:02:49.660> spread<00:02:49.990> out<00:02:50.140> over

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
that I mean that pattern spread out over

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.360 
that I mean that pattern spread out over
over<00:02:50.830> three<00:02:51.130> yards<00:02:52.500> there's<00:02:53.500> no<00:02:53.740> little<00:02:54.070> sweet

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
over three yards there's no little sweet

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.860 
over three yards there's no little sweet
spots<00:02:54.730> there's<00:02:55.240> no<00:02:55.420> nothing

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
spots there's no nothing

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.350 
spots there's no nothing
but<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.710> love<00:02:57.070> this<00:02:57.580> little<00:02:57.910> clump<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.240> grass

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
but I love this little clump of grass

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.750 
but I love this little clump of grass
that<00:02:59.230> he's<00:02:59.440> got<00:02:59.680> almost<00:02:59.890> directly<00:03:00.310> from<00:03:00.610> that

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
that he's got almost directly from that

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.090 
that he's got almost directly from that
hole<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.180> it<00:03:01.780> forced<00:03:02.200> him<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.680> can<00:03:02.770> see<00:03:02.920> the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
hole and it forced him you can see the

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.860 
hole and it forced him you can see the
hallmarks<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.910> forced<00:03:04.240> him<00:03:04.330> he's<00:03:04.660> probably

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
hallmarks it forced him he's probably

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.730 
hallmarks it forced him he's probably
going<00:03:05.080> after<00:03:05.350> crawdad<00:03:05.800> on<00:03:06.310> this<00:03:07.000> side<00:03:07.300> over<00:03:08.110> on

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
going after crawdad on this side over on

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.650 
going after crawdad on this side over on
that<00:03:08.980> side<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:09.310> if<00:03:09.580> you<00:03:09.610> had<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:09.880> trap<00:03:10.210> on<00:03:10.420> this

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
that side so if you had a trap on this

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.560 
that side so if you had a trap on this
side<00:03:10.960> if<00:03:11.170> you<00:03:11.260> mimicked<00:03:11.680> this<00:03:11.890> set<00:03:12.450> picked<00:03:13.450> a

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
side if you mimicked this set picked a

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.270 
side if you mimicked this set picked a
place<00:03:13.750> with<00:03:13.990> a<00:03:14.020> clump<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.410> grass<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:15.100> you<00:03:15.160> have

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
place with a clump of grass and you have

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.970 
place with a clump of grass and you have
a<00:03:15.310> trap<00:03:15.550> over<00:03:15.760> here<00:03:16.150> you've<00:03:17.020> got<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.260> dead<00:03:17.740> cow

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
a trap over here you've got a dead cow

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.340 
a trap over here you've got a dead cow
walking<00:03:19.350> natural<00:03:20.350> is<00:03:20.470> always<00:03:21.010> better
