 file to the ird that explains you 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.590
 in case I did not understand this video 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.500

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.000
 file to read that they explain a 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.600
 class you go into a narrow patch 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.799
 once you are there you have a 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.220
 african democracy three languages 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.299
 sector here or double click on it 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.640
 there is a small window as if who 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.620
 appears here it does not take 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.560
 loaded here I am here and there you can 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.550
 choose your language so if you ever 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.659
 do not want to admit in French you 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.600
 can put in Japanese there is no 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.990
 worries still alas in Bulgarian has no 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.210
 problem 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.880
 and I do it in France is not 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.320
 know them then you can 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.180
 let 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.250
 default settings here the iphone 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.380
 is the place feels the record in 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.170
 which game is installed so by 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.990
 default it is neither on steam steam apps 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.950
 like a democracy 3 so if you have 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.260
 installed game via steam 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.119
 no problem it's by default it's at 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.860
 good place so you can leave if 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.450
 you install it elsewhere it's 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.090
 probably you downloaded it 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.590
 illegally and it's very bad 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.430
 of the coup do you roughly need to 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.590
 put the right folder 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.720
 it's not very complicated you replace 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.479
 the path by the way up 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.090
 democracy 3 and finally make murray 6-3 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.090
 slash data not very complicated 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.090
 and 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.870
 all in all it's over you for 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.620
 leave everything by default you do 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.820
 app-line it will load a few seconds 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.340
 here comes the guen is ready and 34 years 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.230
 the t-130 mater and translated into French 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.000
 do you want to launch it you say yes that 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.950
 in this game and it's in French and 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.950
 it's over you can leave his 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.370
 even delete both folders and then the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.540
 finally copy all the everything 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.330
 it takes the right place 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.060
 we can delete that and here you have 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.230
 your game democracy 3 in French so 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.730
 it's the end of tutorials and it was 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.390
 very short there is not much to do 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.739
 it's very simple and that's it and I 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.200
