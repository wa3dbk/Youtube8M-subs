keeping my hands up n so I don't want to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.780 
keeping my hands up n so I don't want to
make<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:26.849> video<00:02:27.030> too<00:02:27.330> long<00:02:28.040> my<00:02:29.040> edges<00:02:29.489> are

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
make this video too long my edges are

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.390 
make this video too long my edges are
coming<00:02:30.420> back<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:31.319> I<00:02:31.470> think<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.920> was<00:02:32.130> from

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
coming back and I think it was from

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.160 
coming back and I think it was from
pregnancy<00:02:32.670> because<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.480> her<00:02:33.599> other<00:02:33.780> people

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
pregnancy because of her other people

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.000 
pregnancy because of her other people
say<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:35.069> have<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.360> shed<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:37.470> they<00:02:37.560> are<00:02:37.680> coming

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
say you have a shed so they are coming

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.620 
say you have a shed so they are coming
back<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.430> it's<00:02:38.549> easier<00:02:38.970> for<00:02:39.000> me<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.209> twist

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
back and it's easier for me to twist

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.780 
back and it's easier for me to twist
those<00:02:39.930> little<00:02:40.260> edges<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:41.220> with<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.580> bigger

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
those little edges and with the bigger

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.440 
those little edges and with the bigger
twist<00:02:42.799> so<00:02:43.799> it's<00:02:43.980> not<00:02:44.100> own<00:02:44.400> sticking<00:02:45.180> out<00:02:45.299> as

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
twist so it's not own sticking out as

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.110 
twist so it's not own sticking out as
much<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:46.620> hopefully<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.250> helps<00:02:47.670> again<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
much so hopefully this helps again the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.860 
much so hopefully this helps again the
terror<00:02:48.390> essentials<00:02:48.870> mud<00:02:49.739> wash<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.870> the
