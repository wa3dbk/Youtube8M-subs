00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
enough so I heard the Thanksgiving song

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.050 
enough so I heard the Thanksgiving song
today<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> car<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.730> you<00:00:20.730> know<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:20.910> can

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
today in the car and you know you can

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.400 
today in the car and you know you can
pretty<00:00:21.210> much<00:00:21.330> figure<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.960> out<00:00:22.080> just<00:00:22.109> by

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
pretty much figure it out just by

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.410 
pretty much figure it out just by
listening<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.189> it's<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:24.359> a

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
listening to it it's it's a

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.230 
listening to it it's it's a
harmonization<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.230> major<00:00:25.439> scale<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.789> he

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
harmonization of the major scale so he

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.330 
harmonization of the major scale so he
puts<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.599> capo<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:27.990> 2nd<00:00:28.410> fret<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.920> because

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
puts a capo on the 2nd fret and because

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.020 
puts a capo on the 2nd fret and because
we're<00:00:29.519> using<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.849> capo<00:00:30.060> I'm<00:00:30.359> gonna<00:00:30.539> call<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.170> e

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
we're using a capo I'm gonna call this e

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.490 
we're using a capo I'm gonna call this e
even<00:00:33.030> though<00:00:33.239> it's<00:00:33.390> really<00:00:33.690> sounding<00:00:34.350> or

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
even though it's really sounding or

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.190 
even though it's really sounding or
hearing<00:00:34.980> f-sharp

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
hearing f-sharp

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.380 

but<00:00:38.200> I<00:00:38.230> think<00:00:38.500> capo<00:00:38.980> rules<00:00:39.340> tell<00:00:39.910> us<00:00:40.090> that<00:00:40.270> when

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
but I think capo rules tell us that when

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.320 
but I think capo rules tell us that when
you<00:00:40.510> use<00:00:40.660> a<00:00:40.690> capo<00:00:41.230> you<00:00:41.650> talk<00:00:42.340> like<00:00:42.640> you're

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
you use a capo you talk like you're

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.170 
you use a capo you talk like you're
still<00:00:44.140> like<00:00:44.590> this<00:00:44.739> is<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.070> nut<00:00:45.280> right<00:00:45.910> and

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
still like this is the nut right and

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.130 
still like this is the nut right and
this<00:00:46.300> is<00:00:47.790> this<00:00:48.790> is<00:00:48.850> still<00:00:49.180> an<00:00:49.300> open<00:00:49.450> even

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
this is this is still an open even

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.639 
this is this is still an open even
though<00:00:50.230> we're<00:00:50.410> hearing<00:00:50.710> f-sharp

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.360 

the<00:00:53.890> rules<00:00:54.100> of<00:00:54.300> transposition<00:00:55.449> so<00:00:56.079> it's<00:00:56.230> e

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
the rules of transposition so it's e

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.630 
the rules of transposition so it's e
and<00:00:58.670> that's<00:00:59.120> open<00:00:59.920> second<00:01:00.920> second

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
and that's open second second

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.890 
and that's open second second
open<00:01:03.390> two<00:01:03.750> two<00:01:04.320> one<00:01:05.129> open

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.760 

and<00:01:08.440> then<00:01:08.800> the<00:01:08.890> second<00:01:09.280> chord<00:01:09.580> is<00:01:10.440> two<00:01:11.440> minor

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
and then the second chord is two minor

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.440 
and then the second chord is two minor
chord<00:01:12.250> which<00:01:13.210> is<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.790> could<00:01:15.970> play<00:01:16.180> it<00:01:16.300> like

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
chord which is you could play it like

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.870 
chord which is you could play it like
this<00:01:16.630> with<00:01:16.900> just<00:01:17.080> one<00:01:17.350> finger<00:01:17.640> over<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.850> top

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880

people like to claw it like that I
prefer<00:01:25.720> like<00:01:25.990> this<00:01:26.350> I<00:01:26.620> use<00:01:26.830> my<00:01:27.040> third<00:01:27.280> finger

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
fleshy part of my finger can those

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:58.920 
fleshy part of my finger can those
strings<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:56.560> rid<00:01:56.830> them<00:01:56.950> on<00:01:57.070> that<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:58.180> then<00:01:58.810> at

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
strings we rid them on that and then at

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.240 
strings we rid them on that and then at
some<00:01:59.080> point<00:01:59.140> he<00:01:59.470> hits<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.950> four<00:02:00.160> chord<00:02:02.250> which

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
some point he hits the four chord which

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.690 
some point he hits the four chord which
is<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:04.170> major<00:02:05.170> seven<00:02:05.800> chord<00:02:05.830> right<00:02:06.370> so<00:02:07.290> it's

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
is a major seven chord right so it's

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.650 
is a major seven chord right so it's
let's<00:02:09.700> see<00:02:11.370> again<00:02:12.370> no<00:02:12.700> low<00:02:12.970> E<00:02:13.000> string<00:02:13.209> this<00:02:13.600> is

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
let's see again no low E string this is

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.580 
let's see again no low E string this is
a<00:02:14.520> again<00:02:15.520> we're<00:02:15.700> hearing<00:02:16.209> be<00:02:16.959> because<00:02:17.410> we're

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
a again we're hearing be because we're

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.110 
a again we're hearing be because we're
transpose<00:02:18.280> but<00:02:18.580> what<00:02:18.820> kind<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.060> call<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.450> a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
transpose but what kind of call it a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.170 
transpose but what kind of call it a
well<00:02:22.120> let's<00:02:22.480> call<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.810> open<00:02:23.310> second

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
well let's call it open second

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.340 
well let's call it open second
and<00:02:25.420> then

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
and then

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:36.780 
and then
first<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.560> all<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:29.700> open<00:02:30.330> two<00:02:31.050> one<00:02:31.740> two

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:45.000 

back<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.569> one<00:02:37.720> chord<00:02:37.750> again<00:02:39.750> Jim<00:02:41.849> says<00:02:44.010> he

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
back to the one chord again Jim says he

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:53.270 
back to the one chord again Jim says he
goes<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.579> five<00:02:45.819> chord<00:02:46.239> so<00:02:47.019> it's<00:02:47.200> a

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.230 

and<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:53.850> don't<00:02:54.140> commute<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.320> low<00:02:55.470> e-string

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
and you don't commute the low e-string

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:20.960 
and you don't commute the low e-string
using<00:02:57.240> my<00:02:57.360> little<00:02:57.630> finger<00:02:57.960> here<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:20.670> then<00:03:20.880> at

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
using my little finger here and then at

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.630 
using my little finger here and then at
the<00:03:21.090> very<00:03:21.120> end<00:03:21.360> he<00:03:21.870> he<00:03:22.770> hits<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.160> forecourt

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
the very end he he hits the forecourt

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:34.830 
the very end he he hits the forecourt
again<00:03:24.000> happy<00:03:24.870> thanks
