millimeter<00:00:52.510> bead<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:54.129> beads<00:00:54.400> come<00:00:54.640> in<00:00:54.760> all

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
millimeter bead now beads come in all

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.600 
millimeter bead now beads come in all
shapes<00:00:55.089> sizes<00:00:55.710> forms<00:00:56.710> and<00:00:57.010> whatever<00:00:57.250> you<00:00:57.489> can

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
do is so you can build anything the

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.039 
do is so you can build anything the
trick<00:00:59.979> is<00:01:00.220> to<00:01:00.250> take<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.850> beads<00:01:01.089> and<00:01:01.420> lay<00:01:01.900> them

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
trick is to take the beads and lay them

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.350 
trick is to take the beads and lay them
out<00:01:02.229> in<00:01:02.559> a<00:01:03.309> row<00:01:03.430> for<00:01:03.549> your<00:01:03.640> fashion<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:04.210> what

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
out in a row for your fashion and what

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.840 
out in a row for your fashion and what
happens<00:01:04.780> is<00:01:04.930> as<00:01:05.110> you<00:01:05.229> can<00:01:05.260> see<00:01:05.409> here<00:01:06.040> I'll<00:01:06.549> have

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
happens is as you can see here I'll have

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.270 
happens is as you can see here I'll have
a<00:01:06.909> white<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.420> an<00:01:07.720> off-white<00:01:07.979> well<00:01:08.979> basically

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
so you want to go into a foaming bead

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.359 
so you want to go into a foaming bead
system<00:01:16.539> and<00:01:16.780> then<00:01:17.469> what<00:01:17.590> you'll<00:01:17.770> do<00:01:17.950> is<00:01:18.130> you'll

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
system and then what you'll do is you'll

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:19.950 
system and then what you'll do is you'll
turn<00:01:18.520> around<00:01:18.579> and<00:01:18.820> build<00:01:18.969> yourself<00:01:19.329> a<00:01:19.450> pattern

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
turn around and build yourself a pattern

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.370 
turn around and build yourself a pattern
because<00:01:20.619> gobies<00:01:21.280> are<00:01:21.460> striped<00:01:21.909> and<00:01:22.689> you<00:01:23.229> want

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
because gobies are striped and you want

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.480 
because gobies are striped and you want
to<00:01:23.439> build<00:01:23.560> yourself<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:24.009> pattern<00:01:24.310> like<00:01:24.460> that

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
to build yourself a pattern like that

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.969 
to build yourself a pattern like that
now<00:01:25.329> what<00:01:25.479> you<00:01:25.570> got<00:01:25.689> to<00:01:25.719> keep<00:01:25.899> in<00:01:26.109> mind<00:01:26.409> is<00:01:26.679> a

what's my pattern well my normal pattern

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:44.999 
what's my pattern well my normal pattern
for<00:01:43.450> searching<00:01:43.840> for<00:01:44.049> fish<00:01:44.289> would<00:01:44.590> be<00:01:44.619> a

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
for searching for fish would be a

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.160 
for searching for fish would be a
rounder<00:01:45.549> blade<00:01:45.789> not<00:01:46.090> in<00:01:46.210> Indiana<00:01:46.600> but<00:01:46.869> more<00:01:47.079> of

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
rounder blade not in Indiana but more of

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.739 
rounder blade not in Indiana but more of
a<00:01:47.259> standard<00:01:47.890> Colorado<00:01:48.549> blade<00:01:48.909> maybe

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:49.749 
a standard Colorado blade maybe

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:52.230 
a standard Colorado blade maybe
something<00:01:50.139> into<00:01:50.319> custom<00:01:50.799> paint<00:01:51.039> so<00:01:51.789> the<00:01:52.030> trick

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
something into custom paint so the trick

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.010 
something into custom paint so the trick
is<00:01:52.420> I<00:01:52.569> want<00:01:52.840> my<00:01:52.899> blade<00:01:53.789> to<00:01:54.789> not<00:01:54.969> to<00:01:55.240> hit<00:01:55.420> my<00:01:55.600> hook

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
is I want my blade to not to hit my hook

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
to make sure my I got enough beads on

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:02.940 
to make sure my I got enough beads on
there<00:02:00.909> so<00:02:01.509> if<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.689> go<00:02:01.840> with<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:02.020> goby<00:02:02.380> blade<00:02:02.649> like

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
there so if I go with a goby blade like

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.289 
there so if I go with a goby blade like
this<00:02:03.009> here<00:02:03.579> I<00:02:05.609> want<00:02:06.609> to<00:02:06.670> make<00:02:06.819> sure<00:02:06.850> that<00:02:07.149> when

this here I want to make sure that when

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:08.940 
this here I want to make sure that when
this<00:02:07.420> thing<00:02:07.569> makes<00:02:07.749> a<00:02:07.840> rotation<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.560> cup<00:02:08.800> of

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
this thing makes a rotation the cup of

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.309 
this thing makes a rotation the cup of
the<00:02:08.979> blade<00:02:09.310> does<00:02:09.580> not<00:02:09.729> cut<00:02:09.910> my<00:02:10.060> line<00:02:10.270> so<00:02:11.200> what

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
the blade does not cut my line so what

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.160 
the blade does not cut my line so what
I'll<00:02:11.440> do<00:02:11.590> is<00:02:11.620> I'll<00:02:11.920> add<00:02:12.160> another<00:02:12.490> bead<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:14.020> make

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
I'll do is I'll add another bead to make

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.690 
I'll do is I'll add another bead to make
sure<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.530> when<00:02:15.040> this<00:02:15.160> blade<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.490> going

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
sure that when this blade is going

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.780 
sure that when this blade is going
around<00:02:15.820> it<00:02:16.210> will<00:02:16.330> not

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
around it will not

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.089 
around it will not
so<00:02:16.909> not<00:02:17.090> on<00:02:17.239> my<00:02:17.330> hook<00:02:17.590> but<00:02:18.590> it'll<00:02:18.709> make<00:02:18.830> plenty

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
so not on my hook but it'll make plenty

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.280 
so not on my hook but it'll make plenty
of<00:02:19.220> action<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:20.510> then<00:02:20.629> basically<00:02:21.019> we're<00:02:21.260> just

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
of action so then basically we're just

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.149 
of action so then basically we're just
going<00:02:21.439> to<00:02:21.560> take<00:02:21.739> and<00:02:21.950> start<00:02:22.099> stacking<00:02:22.700> these

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
going to take and start stacking these

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.199 
going to take and start stacking these
dark<00:02:25.159> first<00:02:25.489> because<00:02:25.730> that's<00:02:25.879> the<00:02:26.000> back<00:02:26.180> of

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
dark first because that's the back of

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:33.460 
dark first because that's the back of
the<00:02:26.450> tail<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:28.310> goby<00:02:28.670> stripe<00:02:32.290> another<00:02:33.290> root

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
the tail the goby stripe another root

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.740 
the tail the goby stripe another root
beer<00:02:34.420> another<00:02:35.420> up<00:02:35.599> their<00:02:35.720> barrel<00:02:36.079> foam<00:02:36.349> head

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
beer another up their barrel foam head

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.819 
beer another up their barrel foam head
and<00:02:38.750> we're<00:02:38.840> gonna<00:02:38.900> drop<00:02:39.140> our<00:02:39.319> beads<00:02:39.530> on<00:02:39.680> like

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
and we're gonna drop our beads on like

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.050 
and we're gonna drop our beads on like
so<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.250> that's<00:02:41.180> what<00:02:41.299> you'll<00:02:41.480> see<00:02:43.000> on<00:02:44.000> a

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
so and that's what you'll see on a

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.259 
so and that's what you'll see on a
normal<00:02:44.780> spinner<00:02:45.170> rig<00:02:45.670> you'll<00:02:46.670> see<00:02:46.879> the<00:02:47.000> goby

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
normal spinner rig you'll see the goby

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.759 
normal spinner rig you'll see the goby
pattern<00:02:47.599> starting<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.959> develop

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
pattern starting to develop

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.619 
pattern starting to develop
so<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.430> starts<00:02:49.670> looking<00:02:49.849> like<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.120> small<00:02:50.420> bait

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
so it starts looking like a small bait

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.740 
so it starts looking like a small bait
fish<00:02:51.819> then<00:02:52.819> what<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.060> got<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.299> do<00:02:53.359> is<00:02:53.480> pick<00:02:53.690> a

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
fish then what you got to do is pick a

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.129 
fish then what you got to do is pick a
clevis<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.470> go<00:02:54.590> with<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:56.269> trick<00:02:56.599> and<00:02:56.810> clevis

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
clevis to go with the trick and clevis

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.830 
clevis to go with the trick and clevis
picking<00:02:57.680> is<00:02:57.950> do<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.310> want<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.609> blood-red<00:02:59.120> throat

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
picking is do I want a blood-red throat

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.360 
picking is do I want a blood-red throat
because<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.349> clevis<00:03:00.590> is<00:03:00.829> the<00:03:00.980> throat<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.340> the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
because the clevis is the throat of the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.970 
because the clevis is the throat of the
middle<00:03:01.730> so<00:03:02.599> I<00:03:02.629> like<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:03.049> throw<00:03:03.230> on<00:03:03.319> a<00:03:03.379> blood<00:03:03.590> red

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.830 

to<00:03:06.980> put<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.250> clevis<00:03:07.609> on<00:03:08.030> let's<00:03:08.359> take<00:03:08.540> a<00:03:08.629> look<00:03:08.750> at

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
to put a clevis on let's take a look at

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.860 
to put a clevis on let's take a look at
this<00:03:08.930> folks<00:03:09.670> because<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.760> put<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:10.970> clevis<00:03:11.269> on

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
this folks because to put a clevis on

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.490 
this folks because to put a clevis on
here's<00:03:12.709> your<00:03:12.859> clevis<00:03:13.599> and<00:03:14.599> as<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:15.079> can<00:03:15.230> see

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
here's your clevis and as you can see

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.199 
here's your clevis and as you can see
it's<00:03:15.709> got<00:03:15.859> a<00:03:15.889> hook<00:03:16.069> in<00:03:16.190> one<00:03:16.220> side<00:03:16.670> open<00:03:16.849> on<00:03:17.090> the

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
it's got a hook in one side open on the

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.599 
it's got a hook in one side open on the
other<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.889> it's<00:03:18.889> going<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.069> be<00:03:19.159> pulling<00:03:19.579> that

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
other and it's going to be pulling that

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.339 
other and it's going to be pulling that
way<00:03:19.940> in<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.180> water<00:03:20.329> my<00:03:20.629> blade<00:03:20.870> is<00:03:20.989> gonna<00:03:21.139> sit

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
way in the water my blade is gonna sit

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.559 
way in the water my blade is gonna sit
across<00:03:21.440> here<00:03:22.099> so<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:22.849> want<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.000> make<00:03:23.150> sure<00:03:23.180> it's

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
across here so I want to make sure it's

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.150 
across here so I want to make sure it's
read<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:23.840> from<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.079> backside<00:03:24.290> forward

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
read it from the backside forward

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.890 
read it from the backside forward
because<00:03:26.030> there<00:03:26.180> is<00:03:26.299> a<00:03:26.329> right<00:03:26.569> and<00:03:26.720> wrong<00:03:26.750> way

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
because there is a right and wrong way

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.659 
because there is a right and wrong way
if<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.379> put<00:03:27.590> them<00:03:27.650> on<00:03:27.769> wrong<00:03:28.040> your<00:03:28.370> blade<00:03:28.549> will

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
if you put them on wrong your blade will

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.069 
if you put them on wrong your blade will
come<00:03:28.790> running<00:03:28.970> off<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.359> it<00:03:29.449> will<00:03:29.569> not<00:03:29.750> track

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
come running off and it will not track

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.770 
come running off and it will not track
so<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.069> put<00:03:31.250> them<00:03:31.340> on<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.579> way<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.150> you'll

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
so you put them on that way and you'll

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.550 
so you put them on that way and you'll
thread<00:03:33.109> that<00:03:33.290> down<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:34.989> then<00:03:35.989> what<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.379> want

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
thread that down and then what you want

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.670 
thread that down and then what you want
to<00:03:36.650> do<00:03:36.769> is<00:03:36.889> since<00:03:37.069> you<00:03:37.190> already<00:03:37.549> have<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:39.440> rig

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
to do is since you already have the rig

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.530 
to do is since you already have the rig
laid<00:03:39.919> out<00:03:40.099> for<00:03:40.310> you<00:03:40.430> now<00:03:40.579> get<00:03:41.060> your<00:03:41.239> crawler

laid out for you now get your crawler

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.259 
laid out for you now get your crawler
your<00:03:41.989> goby<00:03:42.379> pattern<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:43.280> your<00:03:43.459> clevis<00:03:43.940> now

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
your goby pattern and your clevis now

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.210 
your goby pattern and your clevis now
you<00:03:44.329> want<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.569> clip<00:03:44.780> your<00:03:44.810> blade<00:03:45.139> on<00:03:45.169> and<00:03:46.099> like
