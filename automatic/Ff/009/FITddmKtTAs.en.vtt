00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
you do the code correctly if you don't

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.100 
you do the code correctly if you don't
just<00:01:01.739> go<00:01:01.890> back<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.730> again<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.180> there

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
just go back and do it again and there

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.440 
just go back and do it again and there
it<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.350> there's<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> Mickey<00:01:05.129> Mouse<00:01:05.339> ride<00:01:05.670> so

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
you can unlock with a secret code false

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.289 
you can unlock with a secret code false
that<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.650> false<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.729> go<00:01:11.850> back<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.210> to

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
that is false if you go back in to

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.530 
that is false if you go back in to
