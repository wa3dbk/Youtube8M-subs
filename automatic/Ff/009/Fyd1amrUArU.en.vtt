00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:30.579
 bragging about replenishment in my collection 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:36.339
 times of the knives of the times of the Soviet Union 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:38.420
 I need a review of this copy which 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:44.750
 the factory was manufactured and in vain 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:46.059
 Davydkovo climate here and cost 1 ruble 50 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.610
 kopecks for those times 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.989
 the knife was quite popular again my 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.909
 peers here may have been on the pocket 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:01:00.019
 because he was 1 available enough 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:03.159
 growth and included the most necessary 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:12.380
 features such as 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:20.200

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:34.370
 such an ornament is present 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.970
 here is a popular space those times 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.210
 ornament always wanted to be either 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.420
 cosmonauts or firefighters that is 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.400
 so here 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:49.430
 embroider from the cinema too Soviet 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:52.299
 The astronaut called such a thing that means 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.299
 concerns the Kli . 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.990
 chrome carbon blade length 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.190
 centimeters at 6 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.470
 made as chic food downhill 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.319
 two-sided from the butt that is, it is a riza 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:14.209
 choke blade thickness of the blade on the butt 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:16.340
 about one and a half millimeter to two points 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.819
 may persist the city may persist very 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.910
 even so awake 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.610
 mechanism 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.990
 fixing the slip point like we have now 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.340
 will have to call it all call me yes and 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.440
 represents them ie the same system 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.680
 which uses its quizzes 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.370
 Knives usually such a lamellar 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.030
 spring that captures the clinic in 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.030
 preset position 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.900
 we see that these springs are attached 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.990
 just enough with 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.180
 One of the rivets was modified when 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.950
 so these are the spring and consisting 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.650
 inside they just had here here 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.350
 so here's the ear went out a little bit out and 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.370
 troops were fixed and already so on top 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.230
 have it simplified the assembly as a whole but it 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:09.040
 something like this 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:11.780
 technological was more acceptable here 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.910
 corkscrew integral part all such 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.500
 knives they were usually out of pocket 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.690
 people who loved to go birdies 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.550
 hiking some picnic skewers there and 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.240
 yes and yes they just very often 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.670
 living in the kitchen is exactly what they had 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:33.370
 the most necessary set that is a corkscrew 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:38.510
 opener concert knife weight 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.030
 devices of one hundred hundred grams 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.280

 who lived to our times that's what 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.440
 still say means 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.260
 quite a good design very many 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.650
 my peers also remember this one 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:06.740
 knife surely in consumption was 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.740
 very very many people in those times 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.090
 That something like this 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.080
 we will probably soon be doing some 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.200
 stand where we are all ours 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.500
