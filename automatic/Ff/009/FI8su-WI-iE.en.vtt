00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
anyway the first thing I do is I pop up

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.450 
anyway the first thing I do is I pop up
the<00:01:25.049> image<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.530> want<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.799> edit<00:01:25.920> then<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the image that I want to edit then the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.249 
the image that I want to edit then the
first<00:01:26.670> thing<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.880> do<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.390> check<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.840> canvas

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
first thing I do is I check the canvas

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.240 
first thing I do is I check the canvas
and<00:01:28.409> there<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.619> an<00:01:28.740> inch<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.040> canvas

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
and there is an inch of the canvas

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.469 
and there is an inch of the canvas
versus<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:29.939> sometimes<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.420> don't

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
versus because sometimes I don't

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.510 
versus because sometimes I don't
necessarily<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> way<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.100> photo<00:01:32.310> is

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
necessarily like the way the photo is

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.830 
necessarily like the way the photo is
showing<00:01:32.850> everything<00:01:33.090> sometimes<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.659> just

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
showing everything sometimes I just

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.480 
showing everything sometimes I just
needed<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.170> show<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> little<00:01:34.650> bit<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.159> what<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.369> do

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
needed to show a little bit so what I do

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.789 
needed to show a little bit so what I do
is<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.000> into<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.509> fixed<00:01:36.869> ratios<00:01:37.500> I

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
is I go into one of the fixed ratios I

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.160 
is I go into one of the fixed ratios I
double<00:01:38.250> click<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.520> whatever<00:01:38.909> size<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.720> want

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
down here and then from there I go in

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.840 
down here and then from there I go in
and<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.770> kind<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.070> rearranged<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> photo

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
and I just kind of rearranged the photo

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.830 
and I just kind of rearranged the photo
to<00:01:44.970> how<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.630> it

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
and I'm not taking very much aw and then

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.429

the brightness in this case I might

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.279 
the brightness in this case I might
raise<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.430> brightness<00:04:39.820> to<00:04:40.090> -<00:04:40.389> I<00:04:40.840> might<00:04:41.110> race

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
raise the brightness to - I might race

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.250 
raise the brightness to - I might race
the<00:04:41.530> contrast<00:04:42.250> who<00:04:42.610> maybe<00:04:42.849> five<00:04:43.479> just<00:04:43.960> to<00:04:44.110> make

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
into saturation I'm I trace the color

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.950 
into saturation I'm I trace the color
just<00:05:12.340> a<00:05:12.580> little<00:05:12.610> bit<00:05:13.060> to<00:05:13.270> give<00:05:13.419> me<00:05:13.570> a<00:05:13.599> little

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
just a little bit to give me a little

bit<00:05:14.199> more<00:05:14.440> color<00:05:14.740> and<00:05:15.039> then<00:05:15.220> from<00:05:15.400> here<00:05:15.430> I'm

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
bit more color and then from here I'm

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.939 
bit more color and then from here I'm

basically done and I click finalize and

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.490 
basically done and I click finalize and
I'll<00:05:18.370> go<00:05:18.610> into<00:05:19.030> in<00:05:19.330> stuff<00:05:19.630> it<00:05:19.870> and<00:05:20.199> what<00:05:20.349> that

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
I'll go into in stuff it and what that

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.839 
I'll go into in stuff it and what that
does<00:05:20.620> is<00:05:20.830> it<00:05:21.010> gives<00:05:21.250> you<00:05:21.430> that<00:05:21.550> blurry

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
does is it gives you that blurry

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.000 
does is it gives you that blurry
background<00:05:22.330> on<00:05:22.419> the<00:05:22.570> side<00:05:22.810> or<00:05:23.260> you<00:05:23.620> can<00:05:23.800> go

because<00:06:02.420> sometimes<00:06:02.900> when<00:06:03.050> you<00:06:03.080> do<00:06:03.290> the

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
because sometimes when you do the

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.990 
because sometimes when you do the
brightness<00:06:03.860> or<00:06:04.040> the<00:06:04.070> exposure<00:06:04.490> or<00:06:04.790> ticket

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
brightness or the exposure or ticket

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.220 
brightness or the exposure or ticket
that<00:06:05.090> tends<00:06:05.270> to<00:06:05.330> take<00:06:05.510> away<00:06:05.690> the<00:06:05.810> warm<00:06:06.050> from

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230 
that tends to take away the warm from

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.840 
that tends to take away the warm from
the<00:06:06.320> picture<00:06:06.680> and<00:06:06.890> then<00:06:07.070> one<00:06:07.490> of<00:06:07.580> the<00:06:07.640> last
