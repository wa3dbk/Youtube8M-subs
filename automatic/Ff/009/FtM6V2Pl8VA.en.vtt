00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.010
 we have to improve 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.930
 What a pink wave, how are you? I'm a cousin 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.400
 blue and good I hope it's very good in 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.770
 this time I have them I do not forget about 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.210
 people do uncomfortable online and well let's go 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.619
 to be having this vehicle which 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.300
 It was called Pete Guardian is a vehicle 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.430
 that came in with the update 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.930
 bank robberies the gates contains 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.210
 call and well have they been asking me 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.830
 that tune what is this vehicle so 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.960
 Well let him enter the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.970
 saints that are let's see how much 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.440
 it is reversed and how it is not 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.750
 vehicle the truth looks pretty good 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.730
 so well let's see what fart with 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.579
 he is an industrial vehicle is supposed 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.410
 it's like he says he created but good 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.140
 shielding and we're going to put a score 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.190
 high so no no no no no what 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.980
 destroy so fast and it's worth 28,500 now 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.590
 let's brake brakes career yo 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.020
 I believe no or street stray or 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.539
 non-career careers I believe for 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.680
 slow down a little faster engine as 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.449
 obviously more chingón 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.090
 now we go to the escape and we're going to 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.680
 apply or look has escape as of 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.680
 trailer or good we will select 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.230
 these now we are going to flex with this 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.340
 new support nothing lights 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.560
 those of xenon obviously now we go to 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.290
 repainted we can put the colors 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.530
 so I do not know what you know would be good 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.260
 paint it but I think that 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:34.460
 which will be good simón or some wall 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.530
 painted then if I paint it with colors 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.000
 they say it looks like pallás and I do not know 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.509
 what the fuck so good to 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.380
 paint with decent cited this color 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.080
 I liked it is this midnight blue blue yes 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.790
 it's already midnight so we select them 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.100
 we go out we are going to nacarado pearly 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.799
 let's leave the same I believe or you're 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.470
 ultra does not go alone ultra now we go out 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.590
 we go to the secondary ones I do not know what is 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.080
 paints the truth with the secondary or 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.080
 tanks and defenses is I think that 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.239
 We will paint a color or black or 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.009
 radio I think you have to be the facts the 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.310
 selected forgiveness and good we came out 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.489
 we go now where is said suspension 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.350
 the suspension obviously not here I have not 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.930
 here I did not manage to put the last me 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.080
 I think that of the competition I think 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.060
 follow the competition and now we are going to 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.860
 transmission here would be the transmission of 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.600
 careers I think also to give a 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.520
 little bit more speed the turbo 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.640
 obviously it's 28 minutes 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.200
 the tree does not come out that expensive wheels good 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.510
 there should be a wheelchair type 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.230
 industrial or something which we put here all 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.660
 ground one is all terrain but they know 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.140
 I do not think that premiums 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.800
 series 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:53.700
 it would be good these render of like to 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.410
 being here we go let's not what 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.990
 it would be rim color I think we're going 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.000
 to leave black also I think so 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.340
 same to leave it black and good we left 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.320
 let's go to what would be accessory of 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.920
 tires we are going to put the names and 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.440
 the bulletproof tires obviously blue in 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.700
 the smoke came out and well what we have 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.500
 Now what are the windows already 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.150
 you know heads and I'm going to put everything 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.180
 darker black would look more chinky 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.209
 we selected it we went out and we have 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.070
 what is the vehicle forgive me a little bit 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.810
 sick walks a little sick and I do not know 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.400
 remove but good here we have the 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.200
 vehicle the truth is very chingón 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.450
 let's see how the truth runs 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.330
 tolita when what I read did not run 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.100
 both ran very very slowly and when I was 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.500
 laps was also very very like very 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.209
 rough but not good here you already feel 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.850
 better the stability is a bit more than 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.370
 speed too so well I think 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.630
 that is well it did not look good 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.470
 let's look at the vehicle actions 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.230
 solicitous 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.150
 Now look at 225 what they do not think 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.340
 you think it went very well 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.640
 the vehicle is very good I think that 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.590
 We spent the vehicle it cost us to see 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.300
 let's see how much really worth 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:06.720
 vehicle over here is I think here is 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:10.080
 375 and we spend like 100 thousand 120 thousand 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.850
 put 400 thousand 500 thousand more or less 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.530
 that we invest him, I think he's 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.620
 pretty good not for a heavy vehicle 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.720
 like this the one never crashed like this with a 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.970
 vehicle so dry we will not see what 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.180
 so what happens we will collide with 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.340
 this wey is not like the armored the 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.440
 armored if you take it out flying this one is not 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.420
 shíbata is a little bit more but 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.740
 anyway, it's very good 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.570
 I think you 're going to have a good time 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.160
 with this vehicle and good to walk 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.320
 throwing desmadre and contras be friends 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.210
 because I think it's fine so 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.870
 I hope you liked it a lot
