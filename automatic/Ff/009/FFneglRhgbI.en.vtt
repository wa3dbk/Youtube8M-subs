I taught me the clean sheet you know I
could<00:03:29.010> see<00:03:29.130> delay<00:03:29.310> time<00:03:29.489> but<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:30.870> know

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
could see delay time but you know

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.840 
could see delay time but you know
another<00:03:31.380> fantastic<00:03:31.890> result<00:03:32.190> for<00:03:32.340> us<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.700> just

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
another fantastic result for us and just

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.250 
another fantastic result for us and just
keeps<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.180> momentum<00:03:33.390> going<00:03:33.630> that<00:03:33.870> we<00:03:34.110> need

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
keeps that momentum going that we need

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.550 
keeps that momentum going that we need

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
have to go up and see what the picture

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.330 
have to go up and see what the picture
is<00:03:57.840> like<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.260> see<00:03:58.799> what<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.040> way<00:03:59.129> there's

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
is like and see what the way there's

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.679 
is like and see what the way there's
like<00:03:59.459> as<00:03:59.610> well<00:03:59.760> could<00:04:00.180> be<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.299> completely

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
like as well could be a completely

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.990 
like as well could be a completely
different<00:04:00.900> ballgame<00:04:01.230> as<00:04:01.500> well<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:01.920> it'll<00:04:02.879> be

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
different ballgame as well so it'll be

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.170 
different ballgame as well so it'll be
hard<00:04:03.030> this<00:04:04.010> it's<00:04:05.010> not<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.519> best<00:04:05.700> place<00:04:05.909> to<00:04:05.940> go

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
hard this it's not the best place to go

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.660 
hard this it's not the best place to go
at<00:04:06.329> Christmastime<00:04:07.019> so<00:04:07.290> what<00:04:08.220> we<00:04:08.340> have<00:04:08.489> but

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
at Christmastime so what we have but

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.100 
at Christmastime so what we have but
we're<00:04:09.000> looking<00:04:09.060> forward<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:09.659> no<00:04:09.780> ads<00:04:09.959> I

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
we're looking forward to it no ads I

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.809 
we're looking forward to it no ads I
wasn't<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.769> no<00:04:10.890> just<00:04:11.099> for<00:04:11.220> as<00:04:11.310> many<00:04:11.489> games<00:04:11.670> as

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
wasn't the no just for as many games as

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.970 
wasn't the no just for as many games as
possible<00:04:11.879> so<00:04:12.480> hopefully<00:04:13.379> we<00:04:13.470> can<00:04:13.500> keep<00:04:13.799> this

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
possible so hopefully we can keep this

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.550 
possible so hopefully we can keep this
spread<00:04:14.370> out<00:04:14.489> in<00:04:14.549> the<00:04:14.609> floor<00:04:14.849> for<00:04:15.480> some<00:04:16.350> play

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
spread out in the floor for some play

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.370 
spread out in the floor for some play
and<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.799> can<00:04:17.010> go<00:04:17.639> another<00:04:17.729> Gordon<00:04:18.329> often<00:04:19.199> gone

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
and I can go another Gordon often gone

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.770 
and I can go another Gordon often gone
run<00:04:19.859> as<00:04:19.979> well<00:04:20.160> for<00:04:20.370> them<00:04:20.549> no<00:04:21.150> we<00:04:21.359> played

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
run as well for them no we played

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.810 
run as well for them no we played
fantastic<00:04:22.289> iconic<00:04:22.680> on<00:04:23.130> Saturday<00:04:23.610> and

hopefully we can just continue now to
see<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.370> end<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.550> season<00:04:26.789> and<00:04:27.060> we're<00:04:27.150> in<00:04:27.270> good

League

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.330 
League
no<00:04:34.020> I<00:04:34.050> think<00:04:34.229> wherever<00:04:34.710> we<00:04:34.830> go<00:04:35.010> we<00:04:35.160> know<00:04:35.280> it

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
no I think wherever we go we know it

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.890 
no I think wherever we go we know it
should<00:04:35.370> be<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.580> tough<00:04:35.789> being<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.180> it's<00:04:36.720> a<00:04:36.810> great

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
should be a tough being a it's a great

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.170 
should be a tough being a it's a great
achievement<00:04:37.080> for<00:04:37.440> us<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.680> be<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.039> you<00:04:39.030> never

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
achievement for us to be and you never

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.520 
achievement for us to be and you never
know<00:04:39.389> where<00:04:39.570> I<00:04:39.810> can<00:04:39.960> take<00:04:40.080> us<00:04:40.229> in<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.380> next

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
know where I can take us in the next

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.260 
know where I can take us in the next
room<00:04:40.740> so<00:04:40.919> we've<00:04:41.310> stopped<00:04:41.490> for<00:04:41.729> too<00:04:41.850> little<00:04:41.910> I

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
room so we've stopped for too little I

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.600 
room so we've stopped for too little I
think<00:04:43.110> you<00:04:43.350> know<00:04:43.560> there<00:04:43.770> are<00:04:43.860> all<00:04:43.919> good<00:04:44.370> teams

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
think you know there are all good teams

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.279 
think you know there are all good teams
obviously<00:04:45.210> it's<00:04:45.630> going<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.840> be<00:04:45.900> a<00:04:45.930> tough<00:04:46.110> game

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
obviously it's going to be a tough game

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.469 
obviously it's going to be a tough game
so<00:04:46.590> we<00:04:47.190> just<00:04:47.370> need<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:47.610> prepare<00:04:47.760> well<00:04:48.120> for<00:04:48.150> it

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
so we just need to prepare well for it

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.490 
so we just need to prepare well for it
and<00:04:50.030> you<00:04:51.030> know<00:04:51.150> anything<00:04:51.419> can<00:04:51.600> happen<00:04:51.720> I<00:04:52.080> would

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
and you know anything can happen I would
