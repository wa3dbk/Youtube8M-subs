00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
going to leave it to off hopefully they

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.350 
going to leave it to off hopefully they
didn't<00:01:35.220> screw<00:01:35.460> anything<00:01:35.490> up<00:01:35.790> hitting<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.210> so

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
didn't screw anything up hitting that so

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.920 
didn't screw anything up hitting that so
many<00:01:36.450> times<00:01:36.920> sit<00:01:37.920> back<00:01:38.659> you<00:01:39.659> know<00:01:39.780> there

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
many times sit back you know there

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.999 
many times sit back you know there
should<00:01:40.079> be<00:01:40.200> some<00:01:40.350> sort<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.680> Save<00:01:40.979> button

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
should be some sort of like Save button

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.090 
should be some sort of like Save button
so<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.759> know<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.240> actually<00:01:42.600> worked

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
so I that I know it actually worked

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100 
so I that I know it actually worked
because<00:01:44.100> when<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.430> hit<00:01:44.549> back<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:45.840> still

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
because when I hit back it's still

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.789

well at least try to go to creative
where<00:03:47.820> I<00:03:47.850> notice<00:03:48.150> they<00:03:48.270> write<00:03:48.360> their<00:03:48.510> survival

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
where I notice they write their survival

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.260 
where I notice they write their survival
there's<00:03:49.470> not<00:03:49.680> or<00:03:49.980> when<00:03:50.160> i<00:03:50.190> switch<00:03:50.460> to<00:03:50.490> creative

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
there's not or when i switch to creative

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.790 
there's not or when i switch to creative
there's<00:03:51.480> not<00:03:51.660> a<00:03:51.690> switch<00:03:52.020> for<00:03:52.230> always<00:03:52.380> day

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
there's not a switch for always day

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.190 
there's not a switch for always day
which<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:54.000> should<00:03:54.209> pop<00:03:54.450> up<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:54.780> i<00:03:54.810> can<00:03:54.900> do<00:03:55.170> that

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
which you should pop up so i can do that

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.410 
which you should pop up so i can do that
but<00:03:55.530> either<00:03:55.800> way<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.190> still<00:03:56.459> says<00:03:56.700> survival<00:03:57.240> so

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
but either way it still says survival so

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:04.040 
but either way it still says survival so
and<00:03:57.660> I<00:03:58.230> died<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:59.840> there<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:00.870> can<00:04:01.110> fly<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:03.050> if

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
and I died and there I can fly and if

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.560

issues with the game mode switcher but

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.550 
issues with the game mode switcher but
other<00:05:24.419> than<00:05:24.570> that<00:05:24.630> haven't<00:05:24.960> had<00:05:25.110> any<00:05:25.260> crashes

other than that haven't had any crashes

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.700 
other than that haven't had any crashes
in<00:05:25.919> beta<00:05:26.669> 1<00:05:26.880> beta<00:05:27.060> 2<00:05:27.210> had<00:05:27.630> that<00:05:27.780> one<00:05:28.050> crash<00:05:28.380> in

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
in beta 1 beta 2 had that one crash in

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.700 
in beta 1 beta 2 had that one crash in
beta<00:05:28.919> 3<00:05:29.630> that<00:05:30.630> froze<00:05:31.020> my<00:05:31.200> device<00:05:31.410> completely

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
beta 3 that froze my device completely

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.290 
beta 3 that froze my device completely
and<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:32.070> know<00:05:32.160> there's<00:05:32.400> other<00:05:32.520> reports<00:05:33.060> there

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
and I know there's other reports there

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.480 
and I know there's other reports there
but<00:05:33.600> like<00:05:34.050> I<00:05:34.200> said<00:05:34.260> another<00:05:34.590> video<00:05:34.950> it<00:05:35.250> could

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
but like I said another video it could

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.150 
but like I said another video it could
just<00:05:35.669> be<00:05:35.790> because<00:05:36.270> my<00:05:36.450> tablet<00:05:37.110> is<00:05:37.290> overclocked

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
just be because my tablet is overclocked

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.680 
just be because my tablet is overclocked
and<00:05:38.400> then<00:05:38.490> it<00:05:38.729> doesn't<00:05:38.850> have<00:05:39.030> enough<00:05:39.240> voltage

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
and then it doesn't have enough voltage

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.330 
and then it doesn't have enough voltage
or<00:05:39.990> something<00:05:40.229> like<00:05:40.320> that<00:05:40.380> and<00:05:40.560> it<00:05:40.710> crashes<00:05:40.979> it

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
or something like that and it crashes it

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.490 
or something like that and it crashes it
because<00:05:42.210> generally<00:05:42.599> I'm<00:05:42.930> walking<00:05:43.229> around<00:05:43.349> it

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
because generally I'm walking around it

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.870 
because generally I'm walking around it
doesn't<00:05:43.740> do<00:05:43.830> that<00:05:43.950> but<00:05:44.130> it's<00:05:44.280> doing<00:05:44.520> when<00:05:44.760> it's

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
doesn't do that but it's doing when it's

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.950 
doesn't do that but it's doing when it's
doing<00:05:45.060> something<00:05:45.150> more<00:05:45.419> graphically

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
doing something more graphically

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.230 
doing something more graphically
intensive<00:05:46.470> like<00:05:46.770> breaking<00:05:47.520> a<00:05:47.580> block<00:05:47.789> and<00:05:48.030> have

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
intensive like breaking a block and have

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.360 
intensive like breaking a block and have
little<00:05:48.509> parts<00:05:48.870> fly<00:05:49.110> everywhere<00:05:49.470> something

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
little parts fly everywhere something

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.580 
little parts fly everywhere something
like<00:05:50.520> that<00:05:50.819> is<00:05:51.090> when<00:05:51.270> it's<00:05:51.419> crashed<00:05:51.870> before<00:05:52.080> so

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
like that is when it's crashed before so

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.930 
like that is when it's crashed before so
I<00:05:52.620> don't<00:05:52.860> know<00:05:52.979> if<00:05:53.039> it's<00:05:53.220> necessarily<00:05:53.520> a

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
I don't know if it's necessarily a

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.420 
I don't know if it's necessarily a
Minecraft<00:05:54.479> fault<00:05:54.810> or<00:05:55.050> if<00:05:55.740> it's<00:05:55.889> my<00:05:56.009> tablet's
