spark<00:00:07.080> map<00:00:07.290> feature<00:00:07.589> today<00:00:07.890> we're<00:00:08.099> taking<00:00:08.220> a

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
spark map feature today we're taking a

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.000 
spark map feature today we're taking a
look<00:00:08.550> at<00:00:08.970> flappy<00:00:09.330> bird<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.590> know<00:00:10.679> you're

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
look at flappy bird and I know you're

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.390 
look at flappy bird and I know you're
thinking<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.550> flappy<00:00:12.120> bird<00:00:12.559> and<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:14.099> true

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
thinking of flappy bird and it is true

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.640 
thinking of flappy bird and it is true
it's<00:00:14.759> plaguing<00:00:15.420> mobile<00:00:15.809> devices<00:00:16.260> it's<00:00:16.440> all

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
it's plaguing mobile devices it's all

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.200 
it's plaguing mobile devices it's all
over<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.010> App<00:00:17.130> Store<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:17.490> with<00:00:17.699> nothing<00:00:18.090> but

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
over the App Store so with nothing but

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.590 
over the App Store so with nothing but
remakes<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.609> yeah<00:00:20.609> why<00:00:20.880> why<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.480> so

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
remakes of it and yeah why why is it so

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.570 
remakes of it and yeah why why is it so
special<00:00:21.840> here<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.350> console<00:00:22.769> well<00:00:22.920> that's

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
special here on the console well that's

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.099 
special here on the console well that's
kind<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.210> think<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:24.869> map<00:00:25.080> is

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
kind of it I I think that this map is

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.529 
kind of it I I think that this map is
special<00:00:25.529> because<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:26.099> shows<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.150> sheer<00:00:27.510> power

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
special because it shows the sheer power

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.839 
special because it shows the sheer power
of<00:00:28.050> project<00:00:28.740> spark<00:00:29.010> which<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.369> had<00:00:29.580> no<00:00:29.820> idea

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
of project spark which I had no idea

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.089 
of project spark which I had no idea
that<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:31.050> game<00:00:31.289> was<00:00:31.439> capable<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:32.040> doing

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
that that this game was capable of doing

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.400 
that that this game was capable of doing
something<00:00:32.550> like<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.880> basically<00:00:33.750> someone<00:00:34.260> is

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
something like this basically someone is

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.780 
something like this basically someone is
being<00:00:34.559> able<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.070> speaking<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.430> somebody

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
being able to and speaking of somebody

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.190 
being able to and speaking of somebody
the<00:00:35.910> reason<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.180> say<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.480> I'm<00:00:36.660> not<00:00:36.809> able<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the reason I say that is I'm not able to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.590 
the reason I say that is I'm not able to
give<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> author<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.940> map<00:00:39.180> because

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
give you a author of this map because

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.630 
give you a author of this map because
unfortunately<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.829> version<00:00:41.129> i'm<00:00:41.250> playing<00:00:41.460> is

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
unfortunately the version i'm playing is

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
makes this cool is the fact that they

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.770 
makes this cool is the fact that they
have<00:01:05.280> been<00:01:05.369> able<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.729> take<00:01:06.000> flappy<00:01:06.390> birds<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
have been able to take flappy birds a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.750 
have been able to take flappy birds a
nap<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.200> put<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.710> into<00:01:07.860> projects<00:01:08.340> park<00:01:08.520> and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
nap and put it into projects park and

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.789 
nap and put it into projects park and
get<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.030> one<00:01:09.390> hundred<00:01:09.840> percent<00:01:09.869> accurate

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
get a one hundred percent accurate

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.530 
get a one hundred percent accurate
representation<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.820> game<00:01:11.970> within<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
representation of the game within the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.120 
representation of the game within the
console<00:01:12.990> which<00:01:13.140> are<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.560> or<00:01:13.830> your<00:01:14.010> computer

console which are the or your computer
whatever<00:01:14.460> i<00:01:14.729> think<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.299> really<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.720> cool

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
whatever i think it's really really cool

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.090 
whatever i think it's really really cool
that<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.320> inside<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.740> game<00:01:16.890> I

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
that you can do that inside the game I

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.530 
that you can do that inside the game I
mean<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.729> exact<00:01:18.030> same<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
mean it's the exact same you have a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.660 
mean it's the exact same you have a
point<00:01:18.780> score<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.320> top<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.740> screen<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
point score the top of the screen the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.039 
point score the top of the screen the
pipes<00:01:20.880> work<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> same<00:01:21.330> way<00:01:21.390> they<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.750> really

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
pipes work the same way they have really

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.690 
pipes work the same way they have really
annoying<00:01:22.380> hit<00:01:22.590> boxes<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.130> if<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.369> get<00:01:23.520> hit

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
annoying hit boxes so if you get hit

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.330 
annoying hit boxes so if you get hit
even<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.330> slightest<00:01:24.720> bit<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.049> restart<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
even the slightest bit you restart the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.160 
even the slightest bit you restart the
bird<00:01:26.640> jumps<00:01:27.090> about<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> same<00:01:27.570> height<00:01:27.750> it's

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
bird jumps about the same height it's

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.380 
bird jumps about the same height it's
just<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.740> frustrating<00:01:29.250> as<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> original<00:01:29.759> just

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
just as frustrating as the original just
