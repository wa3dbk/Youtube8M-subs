00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
progression and its practical theory

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.460 
progression and its practical theory
nothing<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.390> be<00:05:12.479> afraid<00:05:12.570> of<00:05:12.870> it<00:05:13.020> because<00:05:13.260> once

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
nothing to be afraid of it because once

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.510

and overextended it but it's something
that<00:05:26.229> does<00:05:26.940> take<00:05:27.940> some<00:05:28.120> time<00:05:28.180> to<00:05:28.569> develop<00:05:28.750> and

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
that does take some time to develop and

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.779 
that does take some time to develop and
be<00:05:29.199> patient<00:05:29.590> but<00:05:29.770> it's<00:05:29.949> more<00:05:30.220> than<00:05:30.400> worth<00:05:30.460> it
