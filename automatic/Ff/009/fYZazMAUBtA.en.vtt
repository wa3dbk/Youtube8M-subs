00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.130 

and<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:33.660> is<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.530> steel<00:01:35.430> piece<00:01:35.930> that<00:01:36.930> was

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
and this is a steel piece that was

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.109 
and this is a steel piece that was
custom<00:01:37.680> fitted<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.250> believe<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.910> was

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
custom fitted I believe that this was

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.719 
custom fitted I believe that this was
cut<00:01:39.510> for<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.080> beams<00:01:40.410> but<00:01:41.190> these<00:01:41.369> used<00:01:41.580> to<00:01:41.640> be

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
cut for the beams but these used to be

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.100 
cut for the beams but these used to be
beams<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.110> porterdale<00:01:43.410> mill<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.660> we

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
beams and the porterdale mill and so we

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.700 
beams and the porterdale mill and so we
put<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.560> there<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.270> believe<00:01:48.560> that<00:01:49.560> that

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
put that in there I believe that that

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.170 
put that in there I believe that that
can<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:49.979> removed<00:01:50.130> I'd<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.700> talk<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.000> Dave

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
can be removed I'd have to talk to Dave

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.969 
can be removed I'd have to talk to Dave
though<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.660> might<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.410> it's<00:01:52.530> clear<00:01:52.770> codes

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
