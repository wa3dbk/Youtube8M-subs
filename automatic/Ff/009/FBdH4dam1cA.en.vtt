ideally<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.570> where<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.810> want<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:24.990> be<00:01:25.049> at<00:01:25.259> that's

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
ideally is where we want to be at that's

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.719 
ideally is where we want to be at that's
where<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:25.860> want<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.070> be<00:01:26.130> at<00:01:26.369> but<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
where we want to be at but the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.910 
where we want to be at but the
intimidate<00:01:27.180> kind<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.630> fucked<00:01:27.810> us<00:01:27.960> over<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.439> I

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
intimidate kind of fucked us over and I

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.289 
intimidate kind of fucked us over and I
guess<00:01:29.130> that'll<00:01:29.579> come<00:01:29.670> into<00:01:29.820> play<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.240> a

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
guess that'll come into play here in a

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.789 
guess that'll come into play here in a
little<00:01:30.390> while<00:01:30.479> because<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.170> think<00:01:31.350> some<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.619> his

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
little while because I think some of his

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.230 
little while because I think some of his
Pokemon<00:01:32.130> end<00:01:32.250> up<00:01:32.340> living<00:01:32.520> hits<00:01:32.790> which<00:01:32.939> kind<00:01:33.180> of

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
Pokemon end up living hits which kind of

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.660 
Pokemon end up living hits which kind of
sucks<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.290> what<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.340> when<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.549> go

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
sucks but it is what it is so when we go

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.730 
sucks but it is what it is so when we go

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
went for the safe Dragon Claw and it

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.410 
went for the safe Dragon Claw and it
doesn't<00:02:47.160> matter<00:02:47.280> now<00:02:47.370> because<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:48.000> girls<00:02:48.330> is

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.320 
dead but still he goes with a king
shield<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.640> actually<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:51.180> thought

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
shield and I actually the thought

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.670 
shield and I actually the thought
actually<00:02:51.540> crossed<00:02:51.840> my<00:02:51.990> mind<00:02:52.200> he<00:02:52.350> was<00:02:52.410> gonna<00:02:52.530> go

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
actually crossed my mind he was gonna go

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.200 
actually crossed my mind he was gonna go
for<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.890> king<00:02:53.070> shield<00:02:53.310> here<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:54.000> could<00:02:54.180> go

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
for a king shield here and I could go

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.750 
for a king shield here and I could go
for<00:02:54.420> another<00:02:54.450> dragon<00:02:54.930> dance<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.430> finally<00:02:56.430> be

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
for another dragon dance and finally be

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.030 
for another dragon dance and finally be
completely<00:02:57.210> set<00:02:57.420> up<00:02:57.450> but<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.530> was<00:02:58.620> whatever<00:02:58.800> I

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
completely set up but it was whatever I

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.680 
completely set up but it was whatever I
figured<00:02:59.490> even<00:02:59.700> if<00:02:59.880> he<00:02:59.940> goes<00:03:00.060> for<00:03:00.210> shadow<00:03:00.450> sneak

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
figured even if he goes for shadow sneak

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.210 
figured even if he goes for shadow sneak
and<00:03:00.930> less<00:03:01.290> he<00:03:01.410> gets<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.590> swords<00:03:01.890> dance<00:03:02.010> up

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
and less he gets the swords dance up

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.880 
and less he gets the swords dance up
he's<00:03:02.400> not<00:03:02.430> gonna<00:03:02.730> kill<00:03:03.030> not<00:03:03.600> from<00:03:03.840> 69<00:03:04.590> points

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
he's not gonna kill not from 69 points

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.160 
he's not gonna kill not from 69 points
