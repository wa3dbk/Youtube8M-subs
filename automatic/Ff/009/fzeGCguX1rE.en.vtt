00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.530 
as the the power gene unless you have a
high-performance<00:02:15.070> vehicle<00:02:15.820> that<00:02:16.000> really

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
high-performance vehicle that really

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.480 
high-performance vehicle that really
can't<00:02:16.780> breathe<00:02:17.020> through<00:02:17.320> a<00:02:17.350> paper<00:02:17.920> air<00:02:18.160> filter

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
can't breathe through a paper air filter

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.330 
can't breathe through a paper air filter
it<00:02:18.550> has<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.880> breathe<00:02:19.060> through<00:02:19.650> like<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.830> n<00:02:21.040> or

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
it has to breathe through like a n or

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.090 
it has to breathe through like a n or
breathe<00:02:21.790> straight<00:02:22.120> through<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.890> it's<00:02:24.010> going

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
breathe straight through but it's going

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.470 
breathe straight through but it's going
to<00:02:24.190> give<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.459> slightly<00:02:24.760> slight<00:02:25.300> power

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
to give you a slightly slight power

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.610 
to give you a slightly slight power
crease<00:02:25.780> which<00:02:25.990> is<00:02:26.110> going<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.290> give<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.560> a

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
crease which is going to give you a

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.280 
crease which is going to give you a
slight<00:02:26.860> mile<00:02:27.250> per<00:02:27.490> gallon<00:02:27.520> increase<00:02:28.200> over<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
slight mile per gallon increase over the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.140 
slight mile per gallon increase over the
likely<00:02:29.590> your<00:02:29.709> vehicle<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.430> canon<00:02:30.790> filter

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
likely your vehicle the canon filter

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.530 
likely your vehicle the canon filter
will<00:02:31.540> pay<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:32.470> will<00:02:32.590> pay<00:02:32.739> itself<00:02:33.040> back<00:02:33.480> by<00:02:34.480> the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
will pay it will pay itself back by the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.630 
will pay it will pay itself back by the
fact<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:34.959> it<00:02:35.110> gives<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.530> slight<00:02:35.980> slight

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
fact that it gives you slight slight

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.540 
fact that it gives you slight slight
miles<00:02:36.940> per<00:02:37.060> gallon<00:02:37.420> increase<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:39.340> can

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
miles per gallon increase and you can

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.850 
miles per gallon increase and you can
wash<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:41.760> put<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.910> back<00:02:43.090> in<00:02:43.360> yearly<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:44.800> you

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
wash it and put it back in yearly so you

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.810 
wash it and put it back in yearly so you
don't<00:02:45.130> have<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.370> buy<00:02:45.519> it<00:02:45.580> on<00:02:45.760> them<00:02:45.940> basically

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
don't have to buy it on them basically

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.000 
don't have to buy it on them basically
so<00:02:48.930> that's<00:02:49.930> that<00:02:50.200> I'm<00:02:50.410> going<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.650> put<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.890> new

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
so that's that I'm going to put a new

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.540 
so that's that I'm going to put a new
filter<00:02:51.190> in<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.550> Sunfire<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:51.970> can<00:02:52.239> get<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.450> going

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
filter in the Sunfire I can get it going

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.670 
filter in the Sunfire I can get it going
okay<00:02:54.550> so<00:02:54.760> with<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:57.150> housing<00:02:58.150> back<00:02:58.360> up<00:02:58.680> make

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
okay so with the housing back up make

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.650 
okay so with the housing back up make
sure<00:02:59.709> you<00:02:59.980> put<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.310> right<00:03:00.910> down<00:03:00.970> in<00:03:01.330> there<00:03:01.540> and

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
sure you put it right down in there and

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.750 
sure you put it right down in there and
it's<00:03:02.070> in<00:03:03.070> there<00:03:03.280> correctly

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.059 

push<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:10.099> housing<00:03:11.099> down<00:03:11.280> start<00:03:11.609> the<00:03:11.700> screws

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
push the housing down start the screws

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:21.709 
push the housing down start the screws
and<00:03:14.069> tighten<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.579> screws<00:03:20.269> I'm<00:03:21.269> going<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.540> try

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:21.719 
and tighten the screws I'm going to try

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.089 
and tighten the screws I'm going to try
to<00:03:21.750> start<00:03:22.140> them<00:03:22.319> all<00:03:24.500> make<00:03:25.500> sure<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:25.709> got<00:03:25.889> them

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
to start them all make sure I got them

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:44.569 
to start them all make sure I got them
in<00:03:26.659> before<00:03:27.659> I<00:03:27.719> tighten<00:03:27.959> any<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.379> them<00:03:28.469> up<00:03:43.579> then

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
in before I tighten any of them up then

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.379 
in before I tighten any of them up then
you<00:03:44.700> want<00:03:44.879> to<00:03:44.909> tighten<00:03:45.209> them<00:03:45.889> so<00:03:46.889> they're<00:03:47.389> snug

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
you want to tighten them so they're snug

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:59.089 
you want to tighten them so they're snug
but<00:03:48.989> not<00:03:49.220> overly<00:03:50.220> tight<00:03:57.739> and<00:03:58.739> then<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:58.950> last

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
but not overly tight and then the last

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.409 
but not overly tight and then the last
step<00:03:59.340> is<00:03:59.489> if<00:03:59.639> you<00:03:59.760> just<00:04:00.000> have<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.209> go<00:04:00.329> with

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
step is if you just have to go with

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.270 
step is if you just have to go with
