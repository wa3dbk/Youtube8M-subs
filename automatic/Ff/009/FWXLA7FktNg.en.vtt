00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
him forever ago and i think this is the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.719 
him forever ago and i think this is the
one<00:01:17.750> dark<00:01:18.750> latias<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.259> well<00:01:19.500> i'm<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.950> sure<00:01:20.189> it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
one dark latias as well i'm not sure it

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.080 
one dark latias as well i'm not sure it
might<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:21.030> actually<00:01:21.270> be<00:01:21.509> mine<00:01:22.189> but<00:01:23.189> this

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
might just actually be mine but this

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.330 
might just actually be mine but this
thing<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.330> pretty<00:01:24.570> dang<00:01:24.780> strong<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.950> do

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
thing is pretty dang strong it can do

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.429 
thing is pretty dang strong it can do
lots<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.360> lots<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.689> damage<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.290> has<00:01:28.409> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
lots and lots of damage and it has a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.289 
lots and lots of damage and it has a
shell<00:01:28.740> bell<00:01:28.979> because<00:01:29.700> usually<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.090> have<00:01:30.150> a

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
shell bell because usually I have a

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.670 
shell bell because usually I have a
sandstorm<00:01:30.689> out<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.259> take<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> lot<00:01:31.619> of

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
sandstorm out so it can take a lot of

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.649 
sandstorm out so it can take a lot of
hits<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.159> didn't<00:01:32.520> use<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.060> sandstorm<00:01:33.450> it's

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
hits but I didn't use the sandstorm it's

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.789 
hits but I didn't use the sandstorm it's
around<00:01:33.890> but<00:01:34.890> anyways<00:01:35.990> omastar<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.350> takes

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
around but anyways omastar just takes

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.800 
around but anyways omastar just takes
the<00:01:37.950> judgment<00:01:38.939> pretty<00:01:39.119> well<00:01:39.270> because<00:01:39.479> you

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
the judgment pretty well because you

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.319 
the judgment pretty well because you
know<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:40.020> not<00:01:40.110> very<00:01:40.290> effective<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:41.329> muses

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
know it's not very effective and muses

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.590 
know it's not very effective and muses
me<00:01:42.750> first<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.590> failed<00:01:44.009> yes<00:01:44.909> it's<00:01:45.270> failed

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
me first but it failed yes it's failed

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.580 
me first but it failed yes it's failed
because<00:01:46.380> its<00:01:47.340> rails<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.170> they<00:01:49.170> switch<00:01:49.439> out

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
because its rails and they switch out

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.819 
because its rails and they switch out
Arceus<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.340> they<00:01:50.579> send<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.119> Celebi<00:01:51.780> which<00:01:52.439> I

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
Arceus and they send in Celebi which I

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.410 
Arceus and they send in Celebi which I
was<00:01:53.250> not<00:01:53.399> actually<00:01:53.640> expecting<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> switch

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
was not actually expecting the switch

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.639 
was not actually expecting the switch
out<00:01:54.600> i<00:01:54.630> thought<00:01:54.840> they<00:01:54.960> would<00:01:55.079> just<00:01:55.110> stay<00:01:55.439> in

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
out i thought they would just stay in

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.499 
out i thought they would just stay in
but<00:01:55.979> i<00:01:56.219> guess<00:01:56.549> they're<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.729> predicting<00:01:57.329> you

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
but i guess they're just predicting you

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.080 
but i guess they're just predicting you
know<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> second<00:01:58.079> surf<00:01:58.259> which<00:01:58.950> i<00:01:59.130> did<00:01:59.310> use<00:01:59.579> but

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
know the second surf which i did use but

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.499 
know the second surf which i did use but
i<00:02:00.390> was<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.680> know<00:02:01.710> not<00:02:02.219> really<00:02:02.880> caring<00:02:03.210> because

then they just start winning like no
that's<00:03:39.830> not<00:03:40.100> how<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.310> works<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:40.930> they<00:03:41.930> send

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
that's not how it works and they send
