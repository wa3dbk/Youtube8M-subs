hi everybody this is part 2 of jessuin
the<00:00:05.490> composition<00:00:06.270> notebook<00:00:06.830> I<00:00:07.830> glued<00:00:08.519> two

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
the composition notebook I glued two

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.749 
the composition notebook I glued two
pages<00:00:09.570> together<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:11.599> with<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> glue<00:00:12.960> stick<00:00:13.759> the

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
pages together and with a glue stick the

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.580 
pages together and with a glue stick the
Scotch<00:00:15.389> wrinkle-free<00:00:15.960> glue<00:00:16.500> stick<00:00:17.900> I<00:00:18.900> thought

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
Scotch wrinkle-free glue stick I thought

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.950 
Scotch wrinkle-free glue stick I thought
about<00:00:19.830> getting<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.369> tape<00:00:20.640> dispenser<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.779> for

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
about getting a tape dispenser but for

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.710 
about getting a tape dispenser but for
now<00:00:22.109> I've<00:00:22.289> got<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.189> then<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:24.150> don't<00:00:24.390> have

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
now I've got that and then I don't have

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.320 
now I've got that and then I don't have
a<00:00:24.750> bone<00:00:25.170> folder<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.859> used<00:00:26.220> my<00:00:26.369> metal<00:00:26.849> ruler

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
a bone folder so I used my metal ruler

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.169 
a bone folder so I used my metal ruler
and<00:00:27.630> just<00:00:28.439> burnished<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.279> made<00:00:29.550> sure<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.000> was

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
and just burnished it made sure it was

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.370 
and just burnished it made sure it was
straight<00:00:30.859> as<00:00:31.859> straight<00:00:32.160> as<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.460> could<00:00:32.669> get<00:00:32.880> it

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
straight as straight as I could get it

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:41.540 
straight as straight as I could get it
and<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:35.790> other<00:00:36.000> two<00:00:36.360> pages<00:00:36.750> i<00:00:37.380> used<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:40.550> dryer

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and the other two pages i used the dryer

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.650 
and the other two pages i used the dryer
on<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.270> blow<00:00:42.510> dry<00:00:42.840> oh<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:45.210> they're<00:00:45.390> sticking

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
on the blow dry oh and they're sticking

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.160 
on the blow dry oh and they're sticking
together<00:00:45.960> even<00:00:46.440> though<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.590> dried<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.100> I

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
together even though I dried it I

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:56.119 
together even though I dried it I
removed<00:00:49.170> my<00:00:49.469> soft<00:00:52.520> wax<00:00:53.520> paper<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.649> could<00:00:55.890> use

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
removed my soft wax paper so I could use

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.119 
removed my soft wax paper so I could use
it<00:00:56.160> again<00:00:58.520> these<00:00:59.520> are<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> single<00:01:00.000> pages<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
it again these are the single pages and

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.350 
it again these are the single pages and
the<00:01:02.129> second<00:01:02.520> page<00:01:02.730> did<00:01:03.030> wrinkle<00:01:04.250> through<00:01:05.360> so

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the second page did wrinkle through so

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.609 
the second page did wrinkle through so
actually<00:01:06.979> almost<00:01:07.979> three<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.090> wonder<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.020> think<00:01:10.560> I

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
actually almost three I wonder I think I

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.380 
actually almost three I wonder I think I
made<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:10.979> makes<00:01:11.310> me<00:01:11.460> think<00:01:11.700> three<00:01:12.119> pages

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
made that makes me think three pages

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.300 
made that makes me think three pages
might<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.990> good<00:01:13.200> we'll<00:01:13.830> see<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.939> actually

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
might be good we'll see so actually

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.270 
might be good we'll see so actually
after<00:01:17.310> its<00:01:17.520> oh<00:01:18.500> it's<00:01:19.500> sort<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.860> stuck<00:01:20.070> together

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
after its oh it's sort of stuck together

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.149 
after its oh it's sort of stuck together
I<00:01:20.759> was<00:01:21.330> thinking<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:22.020> gluing<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.500> after<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
I was thinking of gluing it after the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.460 
I was thinking of gluing it after the
fact<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.270> page<00:01:24.450> behind<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.259> it's

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
fact to the page behind it but it's

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.460 
fact to the page behind it but it's
really<00:01:26.340> uneven<00:01:27.030> probably<00:01:27.930> because<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
really uneven probably because of the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.760 
really uneven probably because of the
gesso<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.810> don't<00:01:30.810> know<00:01:30.900> if<00:01:31.049> I'll<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.200> able<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
gesso I don't know if I'll be able to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.520 
gesso I don't know if I'll be able to
but<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.880> quite<00:01:33.299> wrinkled<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.990> took<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.320> long

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
but it is quite wrinkled it took a long

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.030 
but it is quite wrinkled it took a long
time<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:35.040> dry<00:01:35.400> dry<00:01:35.909> both<00:01:36.150> sides<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.040> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
time to dry dry both sides and the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.289 
time to dry dry both sides and the
second<00:01:38.400> page<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.759> wrinkled<00:01:39.150> too<00:01:40.070> okay<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.820> now

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
second page is wrinkled too okay so now

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.450 
second page is wrinkled too okay so now
we're<00:01:43.259> going<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.470> experiment<00:01:44.280> with

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
we're going to experiment with

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.389 
we're going to experiment with
two<00:01:46.460> pages<00:01:46.930> then<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:48.049> may<00:01:48.259> do<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.560> three<00:01:49.100> page

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.539 

layout<00:01:52.630> will<00:01:53.630> try<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.080> gesture<00:01:54.590> with<00:01:54.830> three

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
layout will try to gesture with three

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.149 
layout will try to gesture with three
pages<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.210> see<00:01:56.420> if<00:01:56.720> that's<00:01:56.990> even<00:01:57.409> better<00:01:57.740> with

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
pages and see if that's even better with

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.690 
pages and see if that's even better with
I<00:01:58.990> know<00:01:59.990> that<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.439> junk<00:02:00.710> journal<00:02:03.700> doesn't

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
I know that the junk journal doesn't

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.399 
I know that the junk journal doesn't
matter<00:02:05.119> a<00:02:05.330> lot<00:02:05.539> of<00:02:05.659> people<00:02:05.780> like<00:02:06.049> it<00:02:06.289> to

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
matter a lot of people like it to

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.009 
matter a lot of people like it to
wrinkle<00:02:06.860> but<00:02:07.610> I'm<00:02:07.759> just<00:02:07.970> practicing<00:02:08.509> with

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
wrinkle but I'm just practicing with

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.040 
wrinkle but I'm just practicing with
they<00:02:09.860> like<00:02:10.069> that<00:02:10.280> texture<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:11.060> funkiness<00:02:11.630> of

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
they like that texture the funkiness of

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.910 
they like that texture the funkiness of
it<00:02:13.480> but<00:02:14.480> I'm<00:02:14.630> just<00:02:14.870> learning<00:02:15.050> about<00:02:15.290> gesso<00:02:15.890> and

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
it but I'm just learning about gesso and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.090 
it but I'm just learning about gesso and
so<00:02:16.480> does<00:02:17.480> all<00:02:17.660> experiment<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.410> me<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:18.769> yes<00:02:18.950> I

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
so does all experiment to me and yes I

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.680 
so does all experiment to me and yes I
have<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.310> book<00:02:19.580> upside<00:02:19.910> down<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.209> had<00:02:20.450> turned

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
have the book upside down I had turned

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.070 
have the book upside down I had turned
it<00:02:20.840> around<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.470> was<00:02:22.280> drawing<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.180> I'm<00:02:23.840> just

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
it around I was drawing it so I'm just

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.160 
it around I was drawing it so I'm just
left<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.769> way<00:02:25.569> so<00:02:26.569> i'm<00:02:26.690> not<00:02:26.840> going<00:02:27.019> to<00:02:27.049> add

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
left it that way so i'm not going to add

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.660 
left it that way so i'm not going to add
water<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:27.739> time<00:02:29.410> use<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.709> gesso<00:02:31.190> straight

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
water this time use the gesso straight

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.030 
water this time use the gesso straight

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
our liver and so now I'm gonna have to

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.620 
our liver and so now I'm gonna have to
go<00:02:56.810> back<00:02:57.079> to<00:02:57.910> michaels<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.060> see<00:02:59.269> what<00:02:59.450> their

getting made it to junkie should go what
is<00:05:02.220> this<00:05:05.060> so<00:05:06.060> I<00:05:06.090> could<00:05:06.920> just<00:05:07.920> put<00:05:09.350> papers<00:05:10.350> in

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710
