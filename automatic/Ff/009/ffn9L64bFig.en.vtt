for<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.600> trick<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.080> then<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.289> can't<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:22.619> that

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
for that trick and then we can't do that

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:41.160 
for that trick and then we can't do that
here

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:53.819 

we<00:00:42.170> haven't<00:00:42.440> had<00:00:42.649> any<00:00:42.920> sauce

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.880 

they're<00:00:54.969> also<00:00:55.969> really<00:00:56.300> like<00:00:56.570> this<00:00:56.809> I<00:00:56.960> think<00:00:57.079> we

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
they're also really like this I think we

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.160 
they're also really like this I think we
will<00:00:58.040> begin<00:00:58.280> pretty<00:00:58.670> GE<00:00:58.940> on<00:00:59.149> that<00:00:59.329> but<00:01:00.050> I<00:01:00.079> think

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
will begin pretty GE on that but I think

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.380 
will begin pretty GE on that but I think
it's<00:01:00.379> a<00:01:00.440> really<00:01:00.650> good<00:01:00.829> force<00:01:01.159> because<00:01:01.820> I<00:01:02.089> think

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
it's a really good force because I think

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.420 
it's a really good force because I think
it's<00:01:02.510> equally<00:01:03.199> challenging<00:01:03.949> for<00:01:04.159> kind<00:01:04.369> of

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
it's equally challenging for kind of

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.249 
it's equally challenging for kind of
heavy<00:01:04.610> skater

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
sometimes when of course like this your

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.100 
sometimes when of course like this your
disguise<00:01:07.729> you<00:01:08.119> know<00:01:08.240> you'll<00:01:08.420> have<00:01:08.540> a<00:01:08.600> bump<00:01:08.930> to

because just a format it's so easy I

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.550 
because just a format it's so easy I
enjoy<00:01:23.330> that<00:01:23.510> it's<00:01:23.930> a<00:01:24.020> different<00:01:24.380> kind<00:01:24.530> of
