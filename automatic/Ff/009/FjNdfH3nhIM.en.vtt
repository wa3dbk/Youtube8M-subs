the bee and this is 101 ways to make

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.139 
the bee and this is 101 ways to make
fire<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:31.309> lot<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.399> people<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.759> told<00:00:32.940> me<00:00:33.059> they

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
fire a lot of people have told me they

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.690 
fire a lot of people have told me they
they<00:00:33.600> get<00:00:33.780> an<00:00:33.899> ember<00:00:34.200> very<00:00:34.410> easily<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:35.550> they

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
they get an ember very easily but they

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.299 
they get an ember very easily but they
struggle<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.180> blow<00:00:36.690> their<00:00:37.260> MB<00:00:37.559> into<00:00:37.800> flame<00:00:38.040> so

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
struggle to blow their MB into flame so

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.410 
struggle to blow their MB into flame so
today<00:00:38.550> I'm<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> show<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.180> way<00:00:39.390> of

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
today I'm going to show you a way of

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.840 
today I'm going to show you a way of
doing<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.190> requires<00:00:41.190> no<00:00:41.460> breath<00:00:41.700> at

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
doing this that requires no breath at

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.690 
doing this that requires no breath at
all<00:00:41.969> but<00:00:42.809> first<00:00:43.170> we're<00:00:43.649> going<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.010> go<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.430> hunt

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
all but first we're going to go and hunt

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:55.480 
all but first we're going to go and hunt
some<00:00:45.210> grass

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.490 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.440 

so<00:00:56.490> we<00:00:56.610> have<00:00:56.700> a<00:00:56.760> little<00:00:56.970> ball<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.120> grass

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
so we have a little ball of grass

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.810 
so we have a little ball of grass
cuttings<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.800> not<00:00:59.040> particularly<00:00:59.520> dry<00:00:59.760> in

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
cuttings it's not particularly dry in

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.310 
cuttings it's not particularly dry in
fact<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.270> still<00:01:00.450> quite<00:01:00.660> damp<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.200> touch

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
fact it's still quite damp to the touch

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.800 
fact it's still quite damp to the touch
and<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:02.430> still<00:01:02.640> green<00:01:02.880> as<00:01:03.150> you<00:01:03.330> can<00:01:03.630> see

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
and it's still green as you can see

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.500 
and it's still green as you can see
hopefully<00:01:04.020> but<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.160> is<00:01:05.550> going<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.060> be<00:01:06.240> our

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
hopefully but that is going to be our

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.550 
hopefully but that is going to be our
smolder

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
smolder

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.310 
smolder
might<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> word<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.580> made<00:01:08.760> up<00:01:08.870> so<00:01:09.870> normally

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
might be a word I made up so normally

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.410 
might be a word I made up so normally
when<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.740> see<00:01:10.770> people<00:01:11.130> trying<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.760> start<00:01:12.300> a

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
when you see people trying to start a

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.450 
when you see people trying to start a
fire<00:01:12.690> from<00:01:13.110> an<00:01:13.229> ember<00:01:15.830> they'll<00:01:16.830> be<00:01:17.040> doing<00:01:17.250> that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
fire from an ember they'll be doing that

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.520 
fire from an ember they'll be doing that
sort<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.700> thing<00:01:17.760> blowing<00:01:18.120> onto<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:19.260> that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
sort of thing blowing onto it is that

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.290 
sort of thing blowing onto it is that
what<00:01:19.740> they<00:01:19.890> call<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.160> blow<00:01:20.490> job<00:01:20.520> now<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
what they call a blow job now the

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.000 
what they call a blow job now the
concentration<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> Earth's<00:01:22.740> atmosphere

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
concentration of the Earth's atmosphere

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.040 
concentration of the Earth's atmosphere
is<00:01:23.640> about<00:01:23.940> 78%<00:01:24.780> nitrogen<00:01:25.170> 21%<00:01:26.420> oxygen<00:01:27.420> and

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
is about 78% nitrogen 21% oxygen and

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.719 
is about 78% nitrogen 21% oxygen and
another<00:01:28.950> 1%<00:01:29.630> other<00:01:30.630> gases<00:01:31.170> all<00:01:31.710> gone<00:01:32.040> most<00:01:32.340> but

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
another 1% other gases all gone most but

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.090 
another 1% other gases all gone most but
as<00:01:32.850> far<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:33.119> combustion<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:33.960> concerned<00:01:34.410> we're

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
as far as combustion is concerned we're

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:43.520 
as far as combustion is concerned we're
interested<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.410> 21%<00:01:37.410> oxygen<00:01:42.259> as<00:01:43.259> we

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
interested in that 21% oxygen as we

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.969 
interested in that 21% oxygen as we
breathe<00:01:44.720> gases<00:01:45.720> are<00:01:45.869> exchanged<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.590> our<00:01:46.710> lungs

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
breathe gases are exchanged in our lungs

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.130 
breathe gases are exchanged in our lungs
but<00:01:47.610> four<00:01:47.910> five<00:01:48.180> percent<00:01:48.660> of<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.530> oxygen<00:01:49.649> is

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
but four five percent of the oxygen is

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.430 
but four five percent of the oxygen is
exchanged<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.440> carbon<00:01:53.130> dioxide<00:01:53.729> which<00:01:54.180> is

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
exchanged for carbon dioxide which is

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.249 
exchanged for carbon dioxide which is
produced<00:01:55.440> as<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.770> result<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.050> processes<00:01:58.050> in

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
produced as a result of the processes in

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.980 
produced as a result of the processes in
our<00:01:58.410> body<00:01:58.470> so<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.429> air<00:01:59.580> we<00:01:59.789> exhale<00:02:00.360> only<00:02:00.869> has

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
our body so the air we exhale only has

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.100 
our body so the air we exhale only has
about<00:02:01.259> 16<00:02:01.770> percent<00:02:01.979> oxygen<00:02:02.429> now<00:02:03.300> when<00:02:03.720> we<00:02:03.869> try

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
about 16 percent oxygen now when we try

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.400 
about 16 percent oxygen now when we try
to<00:02:04.140> heat<00:02:04.560> up<00:02:04.830> our<00:02:05.100> tinder<00:02:05.399> bundle<00:02:06.110> to<00:02:07.110> its

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
to heat up our tinder bundle to its

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.219 
to heat up our tinder bundle to its
ignition<00:02:07.709> temperature<00:02:08.660> we're<00:02:09.660> relying<00:02:10.020> on

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
ignition temperature we're relying on

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.740 
ignition temperature we're relying on
the<00:02:10.380> chemical<00:02:10.800> reaction<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:12.180> smoke<00:02:12.510> of

get to it the other problem with breath

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.210 
get to it the other problem with breath
is<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.540> contains<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:25.140> significant<00:02:25.950> amount

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
is that it contains a significant amount

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.320 
is that it contains a significant amount
of<00:02:26.520> water<00:02:27.300> vapor<00:02:27.660> or<00:02:28.140> raw<00:02:28.650> all<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.760> walls<00:02:30.060> are
