00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.560 
definite increase if you're trying to
attack<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.430> push<00:01:44.670> into<00:01:44.820> an<00:01:44.970> opponent's<00:01:45.420> base

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
attack and push into an opponent's base

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.810 
attack and push into an opponent's base
however<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.740> will<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> opposite<00:01:47.729> effect

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
however it will have the opposite effect

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.389 
however it will have the opposite effect
as<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.689> know<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.869> lot<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.140> Protoss<00:01:49.619> players<00:01:49.920> were

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
as I know a lot of Protoss players were

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.389 
as I know a lot of Protoss players were
trying<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.030> or<00:01:51.240> would<00:01:51.750> try<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.049> charge<00:01:52.470> their

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
attacks on their own production

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.899 
attacks on their own production
buildings<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:55.920> sometimes<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.490> player<00:01:56.700> would

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
buildings so sometimes a player would

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.660 
buildings so sometimes a player would
place<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> proxy<00:01:57.899> pylon<00:01:58.100> attack<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.280> proxy

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
place a proxy pylon attack the proxy

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.730 
place a proxy pylon attack the proxy
pylon<00:01:59.820> until<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.299> got<00:02:00.450> fully<00:02:00.689> charged<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.259> then

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
pylon until I got fully charged and then

move in with move in for that hill with
this<00:02:04.680> damage<00:02:05.430> bonus<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.540> going<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> be<00:02:06.810> a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
this damage bonus it is going to be a

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.570 
this damage bonus it is going to be a
little<00:02:07.079> bit<00:02:07.200> more<00:02:07.439> difficult<00:02:07.619> because<00:02:08.039> that

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
little bit more difficult because that

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.059 
little bit more difficult because that
void<00:02:09.179> ray<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.569> now<00:02:09.720> dealing<00:02:10.050> 10<00:02:10.440> damage<00:02:10.679> for

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
void ray is now dealing 10 damage for

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.320 
void ray is now dealing 10 damage for
attack<00:02:11.280> instead<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.700> five<00:02:11.910> we're<00:02:12.120> talking

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
attack instead of five we're talking

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.460 
attack instead of five we're talking
about<00:02:12.420> double<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.870> amount

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
about double the amount

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.650 
about double the amount
so<00:02:14.430> if<00:02:14.730> you're<00:02:15.030> not<00:02:15.150> careful<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.630> may

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
so if you're not careful you may

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.390 
so if you're not careful you may
actually<00:02:15.930> accidentally<00:02:16.680> destroy<00:02:17.190> your<00:02:17.370> own

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
actually accidentally destroy your own

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.240 
actually accidentally destroy your own

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
pile on in the process damage level 2

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.060 
pile on in the process damage level 2
however<00:02:20.490> has<00:02:20.850> been<00:02:21.090> decreased<00:02:21.660> from<00:02:22.200> 10<00:02:22.770> and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
however has been decreased from 10 and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.660 
however has been decreased from 10 and
25<00:02:24.000> verses<00:02:24.360> armored<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:25.050> 8<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.530> 16<00:02:26.100> vs<00:02:26.400> armored

25 verses armored to 8 and 16 vs armored

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.280 
25 verses armored to 8 and 16 vs armored
and<00:02:26.820> this<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.120> something<00:02:27.360> that's<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.570> very<00:02:27.900> very

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
and this is something that's a very very

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.740 
and this is something that's a very very
drastic<00:02:28.800> change<00:02:29.010> for<00:02:29.190> void<00:02:29.460> rays<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.880> have<00:02:30.450> I

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
drastic change for void rays I have I

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.480 
drastic change for void rays I have I
didn't<00:02:31.050> even<00:02:31.110> comprehend<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.010> particular

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
didn't even comprehend this particular

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.520 
didn't even comprehend this particular
change<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.970> did<00:02:33.450> lose<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.870> avoid<00:02:34.050> raise<00:02:34.260> pretty

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
change I did lose to avoid raise pretty

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.440 
change I did lose to avoid raise pretty
recently<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.490> void<00:02:35.700> rays<00:02:35.880> out<00:02:36.060> my<00:02:36.210> front<00:02:36.390> door

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
recently to void rays out my front door

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.870 
recently to void rays out my front door
so<00:02:36.660> i<00:02:36.690> am<00:02:36.930> happy<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.320> see<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.680> change<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.280> I'm

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
so i am happy to see this change and I'm

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.970 
so i am happy to see this change and I'm
nice<00:02:39.780> all<00:02:40.050> right<00:02:40.170> I'm<00:02:40.260> glad<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.620> see<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:40.860> it

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
nice all right I'm glad to see that it

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.620 
nice all right I'm glad to see that it
is<00:02:41.100> very<00:02:41.280> difficult<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.820> get<00:02:42.000> critical<00:02:42.300> mass

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
is very difficult to get critical mass

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.350 
is very difficult to get critical mass
now<00:02:42.930> on<00:02:43.200> void<00:02:43.500> rays<00:02:43.710> so<00:02:43.890> void<00:02:44.130> rays<00:02:44.370> no<00:02:45.030> longer

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
now on void rays so void rays no longer

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.270 
now on void rays so void rays no longer
dealing<00:02:45.540> 25<00:02:46.110> damage<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:46.650> attack<00:02:46.860> now<00:02:47.040> dealing

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
dealing 25 damage for attack now dealing

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.360 
dealing 25 damage for attack now dealing
16<00:02:47.850> finally<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.020> fluctuating<00:02:49.590> speed<00:02:50.040> upgrade

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
16 finally the fluctuating speed upgrade

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.210 
16 finally the fluctuating speed upgrade
instead<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:50.940> being<00:02:51.410> 1.25<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.680> now<00:02:52.830> just<00:02:53.070> a

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
instead of being 1.25 is now just a

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.920 
instead of being 1.25 is now just a
point<00:02:53.490> zero<00:02:53.790> point<00:02:54.270> seven<00:02:54.450> zero<00:02:54.900> three

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
point zero point seven zero three

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.840 
point zero point seven zero three
upgrade<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.560> believe<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:56.100> gives<00:02:56.580> them<00:02:56.730> a

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
upgrade so I believe that gives them a

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.320 
upgrade so I believe that gives them a
movement<00:02:57.209> speed<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.510> 2.95<00:02:58.230> or<00:02:59.180> somewhere<00:03:00.180> it

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
movement speed of 2.95 or somewhere it

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.840 
movement speed of 2.95 or somewhere it
within<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.570> vicinity<00:03:00.750> maybe<00:03:01.140> 2.91<00:03:01.850> somewhere

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
within the vicinity maybe 2.91 somewhere

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.030 
within the vicinity maybe 2.91 somewhere
around<00:03:03.000> there<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.480> same<00:03:03.630> speed<00:03:03.959> as<00:03:04.170> an<00:03:04.350> SCV<00:03:04.709> as

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
around there the same speed as an SCV as

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.640 
around there the same speed as an SCV as

it<00:05:18.340> would<00:05:18.460> really<00:05:18.669> suffer<00:05:19.360> or<00:05:19.540> the<00:05:19.960> Zerg

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
it would really suffer or the Zerg

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.510 
it would really suffer or the Zerg
player<00:05:20.290> we<00:05:20.440> really<00:05:20.710> suffer<00:05:21.070> and<00:05:21.250> then<00:05:21.370> just

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
player we really suffer and then just

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.730 
player we really suffer and then just
take<00:05:21.940> a<00:05:21.970> lot<00:05:22.180> of<00:05:22.210> critical<00:05:22.780> damage<00:05:22.990> in<00:05:23.290> tort<00:05:23.560> in

about the Thor is that the Thor the Thor

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
straight on to the Thor so I like this

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.260 
straight on to the Thor so I like this
change<00:05:59.440> I<00:05:59.650> also<00:06:00.130> like<00:06:00.520> the<00:06:00.550> fact<00:06:00.700> that<00:06:01.000> it's

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
change I also like the fact that it's

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.320 
change I also like the fact that it's
based<00:06:01.840> on<00:06:01.930> a<00:06:01.990> 50<00:06:02.530> second<00:06:02.830> cooldown<00:06:03.040> and<00:06:03.370> the

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
based on a 50 second cooldown and the

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.080 
based on a 50 second cooldown and the
Thor<00:06:04.660> has<00:06:04.990> it<00:06:05.229> the<00:06:05.500> second<00:06:06.010> it<00:06:06.100> is<00:06:06.190> researched

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
Thor has it the second it is researched

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.630

so<00:06:07.750> as<00:06:08.050> soon<00:06:08.200> as<00:06:08.350> I<00:06:08.440> am<00:06:08.620> Thor<00:06:08.919> pops<00:06:09.190> out<00:06:09.400> he<00:06:09.610> is

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
so as soon as I am Thor pops out he is

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.550 
so as soon as I am Thor pops out he is
able<00:06:09.880> to<00:06:10.060> use<00:06:10.150> that<00:06:10.180> 50<00:06:10.570> millimeter<00:06:10.930> or<00:06:11.140> a<00:06:11.169> 200

the<00:06:21.010> corruption<00:06:21.520> ability<00:06:22.229> has<00:06:23.229> a<00:06:23.260> 45<00:06:23.860> second

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
the corruption ability has a 45 second

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.070 
the corruption ability has a 45 second
cooldown<00:06:24.340> and<00:06:24.550> it<00:06:24.700> comes<00:06:25.000> out<00:06:25.180> with<00:06:25.570> that<00:06:25.690> 45

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
cooldown and it comes out with that 45

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.020 
cooldown and it comes out with that 45
second<00:06:26.350> cooldown<00:06:26.590> the<00:06:27.160> reason<00:06:27.550> for<00:06:27.820> this<00:06:27.970> is

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
second cooldown the reason for this is

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.270 
second cooldown the reason for this is
more<00:06:28.540> of<00:06:28.570> a<00:06:28.780> balanced<00:06:29.200> reason<00:06:29.560> you<00:06:30.010> got<00:06:30.130> to

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
more of a balanced reason you got to

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.150 
more of a balanced reason you got to
remember<00:06:30.400> that<00:06:30.700> first<00:06:31.450> of<00:06:31.630> all<00:06:31.860> corruption<00:06:32.860> is

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
remember that first of all corruption is

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.360 
remember that first of all corruption is
not<00:06:33.430> researched<00:06:34.030> so<00:06:34.720> if<00:06:35.110> you<00:06:35.770> do<00:06:35.890> not<00:06:36.010> have<00:06:36.220> to

not researched so if you do not have to

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.980 
not researched so if you do not have to
