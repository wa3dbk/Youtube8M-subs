00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 and it's a bit too 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.799
 my mood around either there 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.110
 but what I had feared 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.599
 the scenery starts a bit too you 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.049
 impressive a lot of what 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.869
 is there from a quarter of an hour and was 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.369
 it does not stay that way anyway 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.010
 of course, the question he would go 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.869
 now someone believe they are responding and 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.490
 is certainly praised but praised 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.400
 stopped would have said too much and now 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:51.629
 comes the backdrop announcement patrick and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:55.219
 oxygen for the police under proof 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:59.930
 that was shit or missed and honey 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:02.760
 and that has face kevin wolze me it 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.380
 hurry the kind of his over him I can 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.299
 at the moment, however, to the good spirit of this 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.659
 I wanted to fight the team if I had something 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.900
 say in the autumn the wheel 50 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.759
 minutes recession word martin dausch 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.710
 along with a superior overview 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:26.040
 and everything back to zero is one too 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.509
 one and ten kilo are protected and it 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.509
 was like so often in the last 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.400
 two years the table on the finds 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.360
 the performance went in front of jerseys 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.079
 on the road and has to deliver immediately 11 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.460
 everything is blue again 120 minutes we are 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.530
 i was also shocked when he andreas 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.320
 last week our for the tenth against 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.810
 window set in the portal 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.799
 I hope that such performance comes here 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.210
 should be on the way to the certain 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.210
 heavy traffic continues 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:30.010
 I know I do not care how it works 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:33.459
 i go out with michael gardawski ball 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.430
 on me in the strongest defense of the league 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:42.580
 a park so much what's going on here 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:44.830
 is back and the kids just up 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.250
 also from the body language to optics what 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.430
 going where I let go of what they give 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.880
 Schwerin is going on freedom and jena 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.100
 especially at two minutes is it to 2 1 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.260
 curriculum vitae 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.260
 I turn the wheel that I can be true 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.959
 of all people michael gardawski of the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.200
 Some have said you can do that 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.450
 oberhausen class cup defeat the 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.900
 By the way , I do not give a damn if that's me 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.269
 say here he comes back again 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.239
 and made her bude i will wolf and 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.250
 how also with whom he head 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.830
 Football decides to write him 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.989
 much simpler house anyway 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.480
 but you were not supposed to 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.940
 He has now the shelves secure the 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.100
 kept itself has what the 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.650
 already for a game after 22 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.049
 minutes or even a game is then 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.790
 I play my jacket off of 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.940
 to rest a little and nothing to do 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.940
 pick up 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.810
 sorry I did but I am sitting 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.560
 So I want to change was so air 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.260
 and around 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.060
 but in second place in this 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.069
 now that was the game and he is 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.500
 So further fuel demand has 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.480
 the candle searched again with car 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.239
 that's what we want to drive in then it's loud 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.760
 asmussen represents so away was 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.799
 exemplary in a unique way and 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.900
 wise this guide hit it 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.400
 has prepared that was great as 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:24.760
 shoot a body in or not 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:28.580
 question is whether earlier contributes to the parade 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.270
 Secondly, trying for his feet 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.240
 to talk 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:37.190
 we are only 23 minutes is the team 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.320
 needs something like that is back in the 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.229
 important today therefore always after 23 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.120
 minutes 42 on top of that enough with the 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.440
 analysis in between is a throw 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.070
 for the keelers on the center line 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:52.580
 there's the sign ebels ahead of that 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:55.010
 he just got the tigers and now again 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.229
 driver was also chrysler until this year 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.970
 Comes convincing are just not giving 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.410
 it mostly mean sometimes 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.410
 Ausbaugegner or something else 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.169
 it is 2 1 for the zebras 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.270
 And there is the price from their own 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:16.539
 Half even brought me in the matter 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.539
 You do not just attawar the two gates 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.069
 after the gerd so we need 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.830
 Microphone poor is that boredom and 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:30.680
 but again tobias stieler is behind 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.139
 like no friend duisburger and 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.880
 Body is judged to be the day for 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:39.110
 repeated a duisburger 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:42.560
 back where you but a thing the 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.300
 sharpness but there are so many 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.220
 really careful in their own half 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:51.979
 to the diagonal sets far forward 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.259
 and get exclusive children more 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.210
 There is a candle in the sleep of the pc 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:57.530
 browser though what he plays a solid 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.360
 roll and his header extension 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.180
 but then normal from the second row 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.400
 expensive nice exception from the psv that is 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.780
 now a fight on and bend 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.539
 break and red bull that is 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.729
 inimitable with three kilo remains because 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:12.520
 owns and harbor policy mÃ¼nster firm 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.479
 Winner if you are on the verge 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.370
 garnished does not arrive 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:17.900
 the interim results as I said 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.940
 suddenly we just deliver you 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.650
 temporary there where it really matters to 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.659
 I can say the first ball out of it 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.460
 dortmund 2 against dynamo dresden as 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:29.449
 single leads against prussian minster 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:33.919
 everything else is going to be relaxed here 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:35.870
 there is the throw in and out 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:37.300
 patrick herrmann for the kita almost on 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.229
 height of the penalty area 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:44.270
 until then finally time to concentrate 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:46.190
 to throw in and there comes the ball now 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.699
 to the short corner Schaeffler but undercut 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.900
 Well, what's the ball in there or what ? 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:53.060
 Not 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.039
 and I say that honestly who celebrate 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.699
 we have accompanied each other for four years 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:07:01.460
 but that after the such that the 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:03.919
 heavy after the long failure after 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.930
 the disease in the round here so 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:08.090
 has come back almost not for 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.590
 possibility of fire area service of the railway 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.630
 captain or that does not work at all 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.969
 against steffen wood of this team and 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.849
 one of the columns and a debate of the 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:18.860
 the msv the folk of the zebras round 

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:20.750
 tied with arminia bielefeld 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.180
 know in the moment and 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.920
 on 102 of course and in the moment would be 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:30.020
 we went up and now there 

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:32.720
 it is a simple for the zebras of the 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.670
 but a bit more 

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.410
 relocated where he has none 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.930
 ambitions increasingly to ship need 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.460
 Not even where we work two Chinese 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.980
 a boat out at the height of the penalty area 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.290
 last course is new again 

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.420
 lead that whole kevin wolze 

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.040
 although it's already strong like his 

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.320
 body the cases again and again 

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.000
 claims and that is very, very difficult 

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:57.280
 to play and defend there 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.280
 just briefly played the middle
