 tour they saw everyone and their signature since 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.400
 I was on the other side because there was 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.800
 attacked in the previous one and closed at 15 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.870

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.310
 with once he accelerated to face and 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.280
 to be able to kick later there was no one 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.960
 catching rebounds and he was knight and 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.030
 the striker emerged in racing shot him 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.950
 Rodriguez Rodriguez did what he could 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.229
 before this tremendous Israeli colque auction 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.369
 to 0 that changed the pace that happened between 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.110
 the legs of one of the powers 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.119
 independent with a little fortune 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.470
 maybe to drag the ball and 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.360
 gentleman attentive as there should be a 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.130
 centroatacante to capture any 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.390
 situation that comes your way 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.340
 open the score in less than a quarter 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.530
 of one hour had taught each one 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.259
 in the second one that arrived was breakage and 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.850
 puts in advantage new reaction is what 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.100
 Felipe complains about it when a 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.229
 archer pulled the ball true and his 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.300
 comment with brother for me is not 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.480
 against him I want 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.540
 and no help that bounces could 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.790
 say of an archer who covered a 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.020
 first and second goal by Pablo Cavallero 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.870
 so far the championship in 11 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.340
 matches the former racing footballer 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.340
 sprung up here at the age sant club 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.409
 with Sanchez floor against Pisano 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.630
 coffee rummaging to ensure victory 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.299
 tula that marked little on the map 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.970
 but worse in the end for ferro I tell you 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.060
 for my future ball for my penalty for 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.290
 west rail 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:20.380
 drug addiction comes to your site 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:25.220
 Rodriguez moves smooth to the side 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:28.520
 I got Eduardo Tuzzio out 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.069
 strong playground cold wave still looks like 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.560
 independent 1 to 0 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.120
 if he's still independent, he's going to 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.310
 lament ferro possibly because it is 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.569
 take double advantage of the first time 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.760
 he wants to hit hard he wants 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.989
 ensure he points a stick and war almost 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.719
 for a meter of bardot he used the former 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.760
 independent and is taking advantage of this chance 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.500
 west railway still alive is still in 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.519
 independent party that must also 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.750
 improve what I wanted to ask you about 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.790
 anise to find out if vidal follows us 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.930
 but selecting the first goal play or in 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.370
 the previous one because when to work with 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.040
 almost goal that did not put the leg 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.260
 are going to be three minutes encourages the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.480
 public of ferro pass of chest of 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.239
 back to insúa raises but it is going 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.400
 staying in montenegro saves incorvaia what 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.110
 that was a goal almost nailed the mind 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.470
 mint for carranza this is hand in hand 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.030
 against an eye and look at faces and sky 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.700
 plucking carranza that ripped frame 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.959
 is long shot carranza saved 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.629
 independent frame well or looks good 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.159
 stopped to which he gave yesterday did one more 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.049
 center of valleys other silly centers already 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.060
 Crazy wins so that they go down to 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.310
 penn with the domina penco the sun does not fall 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.690
 There's a criminal I came to play Penco outside 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.940
 which puts which Parra because it is 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.840
 for pool to place a center wins 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.840
 you head to goal 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.030
 do not 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.280
 a file but your head is the 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.140
 last he had so much of a certain 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.819
 I breathe and ask you to play badly all 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.510
 the night but painted won from above by 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.890
 that they put it and the party is 11 and 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.450
 again 5 showing the few 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.590
 minutes that you give that can be valuable 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.849
 especially in this type of game the 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.560
 He fought and the fight in the area demands a 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.569
 lack incorvaia that there was no 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.340
 they fought tula overturned to the attack vine and 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.799
 swimming pool and also entered well 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.760
 getting several possible centers 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.900
 devices and this was the head of 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.180
 Penco with the penal point 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.590
 followed the action he combed her head to 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.720
 despite having a tremendous cut in the 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.820
 facing the mind against the stick 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.560
 unattachable for him and murcia closed 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.090
 endured independent ends without 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.120
 ideas depended on a miracle the miracle 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.430
 it came and it existed it was called swimming pool for the 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.340
 center and penco for the header 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.660
 independent tie of the lousy match 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.910
 but he went to look for it with the heart in the 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.620
 final the change in ferro she continues 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.300
 inside the 16 gómez he went with the 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.410
 number 10 wed Marines since the change 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.370
 it was before they should have 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.320
 done before said something of felipe of anything 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.710
 they shouted like crazy you 're not the final 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.710
 of the world 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.420
 he's going to stick disneyland to the limousine 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:00.160
 on 8 marin and now the end 8 marin and 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.140
 pressing the bighead because he was 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.910
 saying continue to continue with the theme of 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.770
 add and then he left cristian 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.790
 cristian continue to follow and they did not believe him 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.790
 much the ferro had 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.140
 courage or penco that I think the 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.140
 Monday on parchment is 5 and 10 more 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.110
 sack limousin has tied independent 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.730
 in caballito an urn took out the 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.180
 set of avellaneda has played badly 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.770
 but the head made it funnel 1 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.030
 the match before the game dominated them 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.590
 if someone asked independent 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.080
 can the luxury of matching five dates 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.030
 at the end against Ferro because he does not have 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.280
 that to win now for like Mr. Shake is 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.960
 almost a win we go down with a couple 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.420
 of notes when they are approaching 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.540
 protagonists with daniel and with that 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.540
 the
