thinking<00:05:43.160> a<00:05:43.250> piece<00:05:43.460> of<00:05:43.490> metal<00:05:43.820> in<00:05:44.120> there<00:05:44.860> and

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
thinking a piece of metal in there and

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.120 
thinking a piece of metal in there and
then<00:05:47.110> so<00:05:48.110> yeah<00:05:48.260> that's<00:05:48.440> about<00:05:48.560> it<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:49.010> has<00:05:49.100> a
