00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.740
 many countries today I you 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.110
 find for a brand new tutorial 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.720
 matter so after doing my complexion 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.670
 with so organic creams and 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.290
 my eyebrows as usual with the 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.240
 end for stone will find since she 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.800
 simpler I go to make-up of 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.689
 eyes so here I'm going to apply an aqua 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.270
 cream from make up forever it's a 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.399
 gold tint very very pleasure and it's 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.050
 so that of course allows us to do 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.760
 better hold the eyeshadow by the 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.620
 following and especially from my side of us 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.270
 give by their very bright sides 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.500
 so there because I like to do with 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.760
 this kind of cream products it's the 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.620
 apply to the finger on the eyelid 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.480
 mobile and is then did with a 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.490
 synthetic brush in the hollow of 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.470
 eyelids and after that I often 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.240
 come back with a finger app for 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.400
 have included neither really intense enough 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.530
 so I stay one stretching and 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.500
 slightly outward and then 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.900
 I go flush with the lower lashes with 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.700
 here is a small brush type brushes to 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.710
 lips there is nothing extraordinary good 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.210
 and I do not forget to do well 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.130
 junction especially between their acids 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.509
 interior and the open lighthouse that we have 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.220
 applied above gesture have well and I 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.500
 wood a little couac or super m that 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.360
 I love then then so I take 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.400
 this hue a little bit tough purple 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.000
 delany which 3rd Olympic Games in 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.530
 flat brush sent back over the 4th 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.659
 that we had posed before her daughter goes 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.340
 to appear the lighthouse very violated 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.869
 but it's true that good yet in the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.429
 a sore that looks a lot bluish 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.929
 finally this lighthouse is still very 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.340
 nice but it was not even obvious 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.149
 Applied month is the flagship of 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.709
 at home indicated very mat like that are 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.200
 difficult to apply and especially to fade 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:44.459
 so we're really going there slowly as 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.520
 you see management by the choirs 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.079
 brush is are afraid we're pulling towards 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.060
 outside to have a high side of 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.380
 hunting it's really the purpose of this 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.659
 makeup so here I go up quickly 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.640
 the other side and that's a gesture we can 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.959
 and pulling out the eye shadow to 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.060
 eyelids and we work well the 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.340
 stocks then the Serbian indispensable and 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.200
 I do my inner roots then I 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.920
 take this eyeshadow whose white 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.899
 rosÃ© match this time always from the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.420
 night who take the piquette roll 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.340
 imply that you're acting 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.680
 turning though if it's on the other hand for the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.629
 inner corner I apply the pigment 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.340
 vanilla from mac who is really 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.680
 great to give a small side 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.810
 bright a makeup that was pretty 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.140
 dark of peace that medium or short 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.660
 term and then I go to the pencil in 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.430
 the nape with a grease pencil 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.260
 intensive brief here I did it when we 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.970
 is down this armament absolutely 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.799
 horrible I think I cut that off 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.139
 who can to avoid showing you the 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.230
 repetition I am then wandered 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:49.530
 stomp with a pencil brush from chez pac 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.349
 and jean but the weevils the rating 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.090
 superior and I feel very gently 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.930
 stretching outward and I will love you 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.930
 that's the other side 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.370
 tell me if you too find yourself this 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.660
 absolutely horrible moment because 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.580
 frankly me I can not bear 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.900
 the application of the griot in mucous membranes 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.420
 especially on the upper eyelid 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.640
 horrible silver what then so I 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.980
 step by step mascara with mascara 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.650
 from home bow he steals quartz like 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.480
 usually up and down it's fine 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.400
 sure essential with a makeup of 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.440
 that guy then to go to the complexion 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.000

 contouring brushes of the same brand 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.430
 that I find absolutely great is 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.960
 in a synthetic voice and more they 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.180
 have really very very well they lose 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.380
 not their hairs and favorites are very 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.040
 but I really find them 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.610
 superb 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.730

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.790
 the whole face to give a 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.740
 little side go by an opportunity and I 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.450
 quickly make a small outline of a 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.020

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.760
 two volumes in the face and then I
