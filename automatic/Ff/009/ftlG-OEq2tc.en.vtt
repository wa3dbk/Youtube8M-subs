00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.130 

first<00:00:56.610> thing<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.940> note<00:00:57.090> about<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.570> lens<00:00:57.809> is

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
first thing to note about the lens is

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.970 
first thing to note about the lens is
the<00:00:58.730> bulbous<00:00:59.730> sort<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.770> elements<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the bulbous sort of elements on the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.149 
the bulbous sort of elements on the
front<00:01:02.219> if<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.430> like<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.660> also<00:01:03.890> when<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.979> zoom

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
front if you like and also when you zoom

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.010 
front if you like and also when you zoom
the<00:01:05.339> lens<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.659> travels

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the lens you can see that that travels

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.550 
the lens you can see that that travels
in<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.260> out<00:01:07.490> now<00:01:08.659> you<00:01:09.659> can't<00:01:09.960> really<00:01:10.110> put<00:01:10.500> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
in and out now you can't really put a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.899 
in and out now you can't really put a
filter<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> front<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.490> lens<00:01:11.670> like

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
filter on the front of this lens like

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.310 
filter on the front of this lens like
you<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.180> with<00:01:12.330> most<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.659> your<00:01:12.750> other<00:01:12.900> lenses

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
you can with most of your other lenses

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.550 
you can with most of your other lenses
the<00:01:13.950> only<00:01:14.159> real<00:01:14.340> option<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.909> do<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:16.049> kit

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the only real option to do that is a kit

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.440 
the only real option to do that is a kit
which<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.979> developed<00:01:17.340> by<00:01:17.460> Lee<00:01:17.880> filters<00:01:18.299> I

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
which is developed by Lee filters I

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.160 
which is developed by Lee filters I
think<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> SW<00:01:20.150> 150<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.330> 105<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.080> it's

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
think it's the SW 150 or 105 and it's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.730 
think it's the SW 150 or 105 and it's
about<00:01:22.530> 310<00:01:23.400> pounds<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.000> UK<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.470> a

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
about 310 pounds in the UK so it is a

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.679 
about 310 pounds in the UK so it is a
fair<00:01:26.130> old<00:01:26.310> investment<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.090> protect<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.479> front

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
fair old investment to protect the front

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.149 
fair old investment to protect the front
that<00:01:27.810> lens<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.259> make<00:01:28.439> sure<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.890> keep<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> cap

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
that lens so make sure you keep the cap

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.010 
that lens so make sure you keep the cap
on<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.090> look<00:01:30.240> after<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.570> as<00:01:30.630> best<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.930> can

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
on and you look after it as best you can

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.830 
on and you look after it as best you can
and<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.530> say<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.920> does<00:01:32.159> move<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.479> out<00:01:33.600> so

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and as I say it does move in and out so

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.679 
and as I say it does move in and out so
the<00:01:33.930> front<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.590> exposed<00:01:35.310> slightly<00:01:36.210> when

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
the front of it is exposed slightly when

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.190 
the front of it is exposed slightly when
when<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.619> zoomed<00:01:37.920> all<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.490> way<00:01:38.700> out<00:01:39.020> okay

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
when you zoomed all the way out okay

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.080 
when you zoomed all the way out okay
other<00:01:40.799> things<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.159> note<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.610> got<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> gold

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
other things to note it's got the gold

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.249 
other things to note it's got the gold
ring<00:01:42.329> around<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.840> everyone<00:01:43.020> knows<00:01:43.200> that

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
ring around so everyone knows that

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.830 
ring around so everyone knows that
you're<00:01:43.500> carrying<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.890> pro<00:01:44.159> Nikon<00:01:44.759> lens<00:01:45.000> we're

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
good thing or a bad thing I'm not quite

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.819 
good thing or a bad thing I'm not quite
sure<00:01:47.399> or<00:01:47.700> sometimes<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:49.500> got<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.680> gold

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829

sure or sometimes and it's got the gold
then<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.130> for<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.729> nano<00:01:50.909> crystal<00:01:51.390> code<00:01:51.600> which

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
then on for the nano crystal code which

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.200 
then on for the nano crystal code which
reduces<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.409> amount<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:53.030> reflections<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
reduces the amount of reflections and

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.870 
reduces the amount of reflections and
flare<00:01:55.700> got<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.850> manual<00:01:57.630> zoom<00:01:57.930> ring<00:01:58.710> as<00:01:58.979> well

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
flare got the manual zoom ring as well

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.530 
flare got the manual zoom ring as well
nice<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.899> smooth<00:02:01.439> nice<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:01.890> quiet<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:03.450> you

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
nice and smooth nice and quiet so you

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.240 
nice and smooth nice and quiet so you
can<00:02:03.750> use<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.049> for<00:02:04.140> video<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:04.860> not<00:02:05.040> really

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
can use it for video and it's not really

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.069

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
you want to it also focus for you really

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.550 
you want to it also focus for you really
quick<00:02:30.180> focusing<00:02:30.660> as<00:02:30.750> well<00:02:30.900> on<00:02:31.020> these<00:02:31.140> lenses

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
quick focusing as well on these lenses

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.120 
quick focusing as well on these lenses
is<00:02:32.430> super<00:02:32.910> super<00:02:33.120> fast<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:33.870> it's<00:02:34.770> not<00:02:34.830> really<00:02:35.100> a

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
is super super fast so it's not really a

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.680 
is super super fast so it's not really a
big<00:02:35.340> player<00:02:35.550> for<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:35.850> lens<00:02:36.120> in<00:02:36.390> particular

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
big player for this lens in particular

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.560 
big player for this lens in particular

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
but for the other pro Nikon lenses it is

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.240 
but for the other pro Nikon lenses it is
definitely<00:02:40.380> quick<00:02:40.530> enough<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.830> do<00:02:40.950> sports

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250
