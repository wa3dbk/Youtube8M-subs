00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.740
 hello channel with you 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.210
 plants reproach 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.470
 and with us today the seeds of cyclamen 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.140
 often the very question arises if 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.600
 planting cyclamen seeds will not 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.280
 blossom in the first year but we all 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.950
 know very well that cyclamen is 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.110
 bulbous plant from a seed to him 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.180
 first you need to develop the onion then 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.820
 she will bloom 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.680
 therefore, it is again assumed that 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.260
 Cyclamen blooms 2 q 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.530
 it happens that it blooms on the third 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.920
 year and wait for him to bloom the first year 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.470
 just pointless completely in such 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.220
 5 seeds go to the packaging itself 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.409
 saying germination is not one hundred percent 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.260
 no problem with them landing in anything 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:01:01.760
 no just you land either in 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.940
 small pots or tape each 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.920
 seed separately and preferably of course in 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.540
 center of the pot so that when forming 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.300
 bulbs 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.080
 there was no friction about the pot itself 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.440
 bulbs planted watered 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.400
 and water moderately should the land 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.230
 dry periodically to air 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.260
 Cyclamen sprout quickly enough 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.330
 leaves appear small leaves 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.950
 little problem for a month and 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.410
 then the formation of the bulb begins 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.060
 put wook diffused light and not 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.100
 over-irrigate to 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.140
 nascent onion is simply not 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.910
 rotted 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.190
 in two two and a half years your 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.040
 cyclamen will bloom will give us the first flowers 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.350
 and as we all know every year 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.479
 cyclamen bulbs growing its need 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.600
 will replant a larger pot 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.550
 but the bigger the bulbs the bigger 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.400
 foliage on the cyclamen ones and the more 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.100
 bloom again want to remind you that 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.470
 if you put a cyclamen shadow then 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.810
 he won't bring alice to him 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.950
 so much so try to give 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.080
 him scattered light 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.380
 but not direct sunlight to 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.120
 avoid burns on foliage 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.380
 even when cyclamen does not bloom it 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.260
 foliage is enough 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.000
 beautiful sight so try 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.110
 so that there is no burn 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.780
 no stains planted cyclamens 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.080
 grow them grow your bulbs 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.950
 to good size depending on 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.330
 This taste will be much more and 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.400
 cyclamen bloom will delight you 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.410
 all the time you want 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.410
 all the best, see our channel
