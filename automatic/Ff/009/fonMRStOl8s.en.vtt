00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
in deep brain stimulation there are a

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.230 
in deep brain stimulation there are a
number<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.750> targets<00:00:07.290> that<00:00:07.440> we<00:00:07.620> can<00:00:07.830> select<00:00:08.340> the

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
way that we choose those targets can be

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.879 
way that we choose those targets can be
sometimes<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.969> little<00:00:12.179> bit<00:00:12.330> subjective<00:00:12.710> it<00:00:13.710> can

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
sometimes a little bit subjective it can

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.400 
sometimes a little bit subjective it can
be<00:00:14.009> based<00:00:14.190> on<00:00:14.429> our<00:00:14.639> own<00:00:14.960> experience<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.230> our

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
be based on our own experience and our

be based on our own experience and our
own<00:00:16.560> skills<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:18.029> can<00:00:18.240> also<00:00:18.359> be<00:00:18.539> based<00:00:18.869> on

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
own skills that it can also be based on

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.550 
own skills that it can also be based on
patient's<00:00:20.279> specific<00:00:21.060> symptoms<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.810> other

factors for example the subthalamic

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.640 
factors for example the subthalamic
nucleus<00:00:26.000> that's<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.150> great<00:00:27.390> target<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:28.410> treat

nucleus that's a great target to treat

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.710 
nucleus that's a great target to treat
most<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.279> symptoms<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.480> Parkinson's

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
most of the symptoms of Parkinson's

most of the symptoms of Parkinson's
disease<00:00:31.260> including<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.279> tremor<00:00:32.640> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
slowness the stiffness and it helps them

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.250 
slowness the stiffness and it helps them
to<00:00:35.730> reduce<00:00:35.880> their<00:00:36.239> medications<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:37.050> most

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
to reduce their medications in most

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.590 
to reduce their medications in most
cases<00:00:37.670> one<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.879> problems<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
cases one of the problems with the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.440 
cases one of the problems with the
subthalamic<00:00:39.840> nucleus<00:00:40.160> is<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.180> can

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
subthalamic nucleus is that it can

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.200 
subthalamic nucleus is that it can
sometimes<00:00:42.989> cause<00:00:43.800> some<00:00:43.829> cognitive<00:00:44.430> problems

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
sometimes cause some cognitive problems

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.690 
sometimes cause some cognitive problems
or<00:00:45.480> problems<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:46.170> patients<00:00:46.469> thinking<00:00:47.219> after

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
or problems with patients thinking after

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.450 
or problems with patients thinking after
the<00:00:47.850> surgery<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.719> also<00:00:48.870> affect<00:00:49.460> depression

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the surgery can also affect depression

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.270 
the surgery can also affect depression
so<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.600> screen<00:00:52.020> patients<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.739> make<00:00:52.920> sure<00:00:53.129> that

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
so we screen patients to make sure that

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.250 
so we screen patients to make sure that
they're<00:00:53.489> not<00:00:53.640> at<00:00:53.789> high<00:00:54.149> risk<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.719> developing

they're not at high risk of developing

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.560 
they're not at high risk of developing
those<00:00:55.860> types<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.460> problems<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.030> if<00:00:57.180> they<00:00:57.360> are

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
those types of problems and if they are

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.630 
those types of problems and if they are
we<00:00:58.140> would<00:00:58.320> choose<00:00:58.530> another<00:00:58.920> target<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
we would choose another target the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.729 
we would choose another target the

predominantly have a tremor problem then
that<00:01:07.590> would<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.070> target<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.580> choice<00:01:09.140> in

that would be the target of choice in

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.270 
that would be the target of choice in
some<00:01:11.159> patients<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:12.330> might<00:01:12.720> choose<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.590> Globus

of the subthalamic nucleus does and so

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.719 
of the subthalamic nucleus does and so
deciding<00:01:33.750> which<00:01:33.869> target<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.619> choose<00:01:35.189> it's

deciding which target to choose it's

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.749 
deciding which target to choose it's
often<00:01:36.450> not<00:01:36.950> straightforward<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.280> often<00:01:38.610> need

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
often not straightforward we often need

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.700 
often not straightforward we often need
to<00:01:38.820> go<00:01:39.090> through<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.360> process<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:40.049> assessing<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
to go through a process of assessing the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.010 
to go through a process of assessing the
patient<00:01:41.159> very<00:01:41.369> thoroughly<00:01:41.700> with<00:01:42.150> clinical

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
patient very thoroughly with clinical

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.020 
patient very thoroughly with clinical
psychology<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.950> neuropsychology<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
psychology and neuropsychology and

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.719 
psychology and neuropsychology and
that's<00:01:45.149> why<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:46.079> those<00:01:46.290> things<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.009> then

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
that's why we do those things and then

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.429 
that's why we do those things and then
we<00:01:47.939> look<00:01:48.149> at<00:01:48.240> what<00:01:48.450> symptoms<00:01:48.780> they've<00:01:49.140> got

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
we look at what symptoms they've got

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.710 
we look at what symptoms they've got
what<00:01:49.770> things<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.670> bother<00:01:50.909> them<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.479> most

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
what things that bother them the most

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.370 
what things that bother them the most
are<00:01:52.020> about<00:01:52.470> their<00:01:52.770> condition<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.780> we<00:01:54.780> put<00:01:55.259> all

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
are about their condition and we put all

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.990 
are about their condition and we put all
of<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.560> together<00:01:55.920> when<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.340> say<00:01:56.520> okay<00:01:56.820> this

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
of that together when we say okay this

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.370 
of that together when we say okay this
is<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.270> target<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.810> we're<00:01:57.960> gonna<00:01:58.170> select

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
is the target of the we're gonna select

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.899 
is the target of the we're gonna select
if<00:01:59.369> we<00:02:00.060> pick<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> target<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:01.860> don't<00:02:02.729> have

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
if we pick a target and we don't have

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.450 
if we pick a target and we don't have
any<00:02:03.090> luck<00:02:03.479> during<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.079> surgery<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.770> trying

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
any luck during the surgery and trying

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.240 
any luck during the surgery and trying
to<00:02:05.640> reduce<00:02:05.790> their<00:02:06.299> symptoms<00:02:06.899> then<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:08.099> can

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
to reduce their symptoms then we can
