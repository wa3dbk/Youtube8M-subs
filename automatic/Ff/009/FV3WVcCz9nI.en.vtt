00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.010
 similar in playstation 4 and that has 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.380
 looked like the field 4 bat like that first 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.390

 New generation theme blah blah blah blah 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.930

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.000
 appeared between that 4 but I'm not going to 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.129
 enter what is playstation 4 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.620
 it's still worth I'm going to dedicate only one video 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.079
 to playstation 4 in the future but I wanted 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.360
 do is one talking about debate fill 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.430
 4 and before you know I had good before 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.110

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.340
 but hey who knows the case is guys 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.350
 is that 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.720
 I have uploaded a call of duty video to 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.000
 soft good welcoming them to 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.770
 this new delivery to this new 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.350
 generation of consoles that will be in 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.290
 the channel and guys I tell you that if I see 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.180
 an overvaluation of the videos and I see 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.070
 that many likes I'm going to bring you a video 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.690
 super soon as recording videos 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.280
 from playstation 4 and upload them to youtube 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.990
 It is valid for all those that you have said in 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.000
 the video that what is only giving the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.260
 button share not yet there is no 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.630
 option that allows us to upload 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.979
 automatically videos to youtube can 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.930
 that there is in the future but while 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.550
 I do not have it because I want to bring you 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.590
 is not an explanatory video like this or more 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.960
 less than how to tell you how to insure yourself 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.610
 a way to record videos for 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.590
 youtube for monkey if you want 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.240
 put in this world of youtube 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.220
 etcetera etcetera but good guys I'm going 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.350
 to talk about battlefield 4 obviously 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.590
 I will not say if it's a piece of jose 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.180
 it's not a piece of game or that mazda does not 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.340
 the fact is that I have played quite a bit 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.410
 in fact I have played only today so 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.289
 what guys my first impressions have 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.030
 been simply spectacular vouchers 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.630
 I will make a video of first impressions of 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.509
 codes of what I thought 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.140
 It has been simply creepy skids 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.009
 you on YouTube you can not notice 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.140
 unfortunately we are in a new 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.330
 generation of consoles which the jump 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.760
 from play 3 to play 4 has not been noticed as much 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.620
 such as 2 to play but still play 3 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.959
 youtube guys is that not going to 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.940
 I can not know how to live, you will not have to 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.830
 play it you have to take control 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.760
 you have to see it in a 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.440
 screen of whatever 1080p HD is that 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.780
 it's just amazing the quality of 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.239
 graphics that has bat fill 4 that well 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.910
 it's done that comes this I do not know everything 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.040
 compact them to so many things that are 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.989
 happening at the same time and to so much 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.940
 resolution does not take away from me that I know 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.250
 we all thought we all thought that 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.250
 combat filters we had arrived that 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.870
 be an epic moment in the graphics 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.830
 etcetera et cetera but is that this bat 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.330
 fi 4 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.220
 it has been incredible not the gameplay 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.840
 I still love more have put the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.549
 call of duty controls that to me 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.440
 honestly I have always liked more 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.810
 but good the case is also that 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.019
 even the new playstation 4 control 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.299
 makes the debate gameplay better 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.720
 fill 4 and of gothic colo also but not 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.390
 I'm going to talk 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.340
 the guys also to say one thing and it's 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.960
 that in the reply you are seeing there is no 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.060
 volume the truth do not ask me 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.430
 because I do not have the slightest idea 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.080
 like we go 28 billion times 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.390
 more than you were listening because 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.880
 I would still not be more realistic, I do not know 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.020
 put and it's even more in the gameplay 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.880
 but good guys the case is that it has not 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.470
 I could bring you the volume, not me 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.970
 you ask because I hope he does not return to 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.400
 go through the call of duty video yes that 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.900
 there was volume in this not things that happen 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.400
 the truth but in the end yes with my 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.320
 first impressions have been that 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.590
 this shooter this bat fil 4 is going to be 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.990
 best shooter of the year and we go without any 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.750
 kind of doubt or the best graphics 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.030
 seen in my whole life and it does not give me 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.740
 afraid to say it the best graphics that 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.230
 seen in all my life I do not care what 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.970
 game you are talking about your shooter 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.970
 adventures whatever is not seen no 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.160
 graphics like that in my life or my mother 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.950
 guys the graphics there and guys 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.470
 the really bad things I've seen in 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.720
 bates and 4 so first glance are the 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.240
 servers fall a lot is that 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.480
 we go for every five games or for 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.260
 Take fingers 100% sure I can not find 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.090
 games 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.919
 up to 9 you ask why but let's go 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.290
 I find assault games but never 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.639
 I find games of conquest I do not have 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.370
 no idea why and I wanted to play 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.800
 because in assault for the moment at least 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.260
 right now we can not play 64 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.910
 only 32 players that are already more 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.010
 that in playstation 3 but good the case 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.389
 is that I wanted to play with 64 and 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.889
 attentive here because I put the bomb and 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.510
 my mother I turned around and was there 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.120
 all my team put there on my back 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.610
 piece of huaraz os but good the case 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.949

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.449
 checking in the case guys is that 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:07.240
