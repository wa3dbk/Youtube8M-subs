the fifth fret of the g string with a

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.460 
the fifth fret of the g string with a
little<00:01:58.640> bit<00:01:58.729> of<00:01:58.789> a<00:01:58.849> bend<00:01:58.970> there<00:01:59.179> and<00:01:59.439> then<00:02:00.439> I

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
little bit of a bend there and then I

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.979 
little bit of a bend there and then I
resolve<00:02:00.890> here<00:02:01.189> on<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.489> a<00:02:01.520> move<00:02:02.060> that's<00:02:02.750> why

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
resolve here on the a move that's why

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:04.630 
resolve here on the a move that's why
this<00:02:03.319> works<00:02:03.590> over<00:02:03.739> top<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:03.950> that<00:02:04.099> a<00:02:04.250> seven

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
this works over top of that a seven

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.460 
this works over top of that a seven
chord<00:02:07.780> alright<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:08.899> moving<00:02:09.019> on<00:02:09.289> the

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
chord alright so moving on the

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.039 
chord alright so moving on the
progression<00:02:09.799> would<00:02:10.069> then<00:02:10.280> move<00:02:10.519> to<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:11.209> D

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
progression would then move to the D

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.130 
progression would then move to the D
chord<00:02:12.319> so<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.220> need<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.519> find<00:02:13.760> this<00:02:14.000> D<00:02:14.569> nu<00:02:14.810> and

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
chord so I need to find this D nu and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.509 
chord so I need to find this D nu and
