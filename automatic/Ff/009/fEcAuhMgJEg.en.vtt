00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.110
 hello in this tutorial I'll tell you 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.870
 how can we make a picture with 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.470
 watercolors and then add a small 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.670
 butterflies so that we stay like this 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.710
 we need a framework that has a 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.790
 depth to allow us to add 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.399
 objects like in my case the butterflies 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:30.189
 we need watercolor and we need a 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:33.969
 leaf to be able to draw in watercolor 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:37.120
 is in a blog of drawings and in which the 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:39.520
 leaf is a little thick 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.489
 let's start painting our picture 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.500
 for our frame then I cut 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:50.769
 a piece of paper from a drawing blog 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.110
 the size of the frame and let's start 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.909
 paint with watercolors I will use 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.909
 a bristle brush 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.360
 and with the edge I'm going to make a kind 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.920
 of field then we wet a little the 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.640
 Brush 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:13.770
 and we started with the edge quoted to paint 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.560
 make the twigs of the lawn forest 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:23.700
 in this way little by little we are going 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.700
 doing the drawing of the field 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:36.420
 until filling the bottom 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:39.820
 then we will make flowers and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.340
 everything you want can be 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.130
 do 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.770
 as the water dries up 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.100
 taking a stronger tone if the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.930
 we would like more clear we wet a little 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.700
 the brush 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.100
 and wetting and painting 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.090
 always very careful when it comes to 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.579
 fill the water brush so it does not 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.209
 spoil us because if we do not know 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:13.599
 the paint would be very diluted as in 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.209
 this case nothing happens because then you 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.540
 we would give the tonalities with the brush 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.920
 a little drier in the part that has 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.920
 stayed more aouate 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.180
 then now with the brush we dry them 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.860
 a little bit to absorb all the water 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.550
 I had and we took some paint 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:43.120
 drier 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.120
 and the shades are darker 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.540
 let's make the flowers clean the 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.760
 Brush 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.170
 with water 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.170
 and with an absorbent paper 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.010
 and what we are going to do now once 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.750
 we already have the clean brush we are going to 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.340
 use a little bit of yellow 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:18.340
 orange then with a little bit of 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.750
 paint a little drier we are going to 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.750
 make some twigs like that 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.380
 so that it has several colors 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.450
 we clean the brush and the 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.090
 dry because it has too much water and 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.010
 let's use another tonality then 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.069
 I'm going to use a little bit of yellow 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:56.079
 to do as if it were 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:58.859
 and the spikes that are in the field that 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.859
 Sometimes we meet 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.660
 and it happens a little bit 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:10.750
 always with the tip of the east 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.750
 let's make the ears 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:18.549
 we wet a little and we are going to do as 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.769
 little flowers then the flowers either 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.070
 in watercolor they have to have a form 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:27.400
 in concrete we can give it the form that 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.770
 more we like, we want more 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.660
 dark the darker tones 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:40.920
 we give more more dry paint 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.920
 always with the edge of the brush 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.340
 once we have finished 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.460
 draw our flowers and it has already 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.770
 drying what we're going to do is put 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.720
 some little butterflies that we have made 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.850
 with recycled paper and stick them on 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.790
 our box so that they remain 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.270
 original we can put them as more 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:09.150
 we like it since our frame we're going 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.490
 to use has a depth that we 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.060
 allows you to add objects inside it 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:18.950
 then we are going to paste butterflies to 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.950
 then put them inside the frame 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.760
 once stuck to the butterflies we were 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:29.220
 it would be like this now what we do is 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.220
 put it within our framework 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.370
 and we put the lid 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.100
 we close ourselves well so that we are not 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.100
 go 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:44.570
 and we would have our picture 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:49.210
 I hope you liked this tutorial 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.210
 and see you in the next thanks
