00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
to be honest I don't really think the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.000

fireball camp game works though it does
it<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.340> mean<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.849> was<00:00:30.210> semi-decent<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:31.019> like<00:00:31.140> oh

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
it I mean it was semi-decent in like oh

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.530 
it I mean it was semi-decent in like oh
six<00:00:31.560> but<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.160> was<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> game<00:00:33.120> was<00:00:33.300> slower

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
six but that was in the game was slower

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.270 
six but that was in the game was slower
and<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.770> at<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.219> point<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:37.040> style<00:00:38.040> like

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
and that this at this point a style like

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.350 
and that this at this point a style like
that<00:00:38.309> you're<00:00:38.670> just<00:00:38.700> gonna<00:00:38.910> lose<00:00:39.120> stage

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
that you're just gonna lose stage

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.150 
that you're just gonna lose stage
control<00:00:39.750> not<00:00:39.930> get<00:00:40.079> much<00:00:40.230> damage<00:00:40.649> more<00:00:40.890> snow

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
dab smash they're probably not

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.460 
dab smash they're probably not
yep<00:01:54.729> see<00:01:55.000> every<00:01:55.299> time<00:01:55.479> mario<00:01:55.780> gets<00:01:55.990> in<00:01:56.140> he<00:01:56.380> has

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
yep see every time mario gets in he has

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.160 
yep see every time mario gets in he has
to<00:01:56.650> get<00:01:56.770> like<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.700> optimal<00:01:58.240> look<00:01:58.570> maximum

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
to get like the optimal look maximum

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.539 
to get like the optimal look maximum
damage<00:01:59.439> or<00:01:59.890> kill

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
damage or kill

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.050 
damage or kill
and<00:02:01.090> there's<00:02:02.100> he's<00:02:03.100> just<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:03.460> so<00:02:03.700> much<00:02:03.820> work

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
and there's he's just so so much work

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.760 
and there's he's just so so much work
for<00:02:04.090> Mario<00:02:04.630> he<00:02:04.750> had<00:02:04.930> Mars<00:02:05.200> corner<00:02:05.590> and

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
for Mario he had Mars corner and

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.880 
for Mario he had Mars corner and
couldn't<00:02:06.040> do<00:02:06.100> anything<00:02:06.340> with<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:07.110> yet<00:02:08.110> it's<00:02:08.800> a

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
couldn't do anything with it yet it's a

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.110 
couldn't do anything with it yet it's a
struggle<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.369> struggle<00:02:09.399> was<00:02:09.759> real<00:02:11.910> nice<00:02:12.910> up

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
struggle the struggle was real nice up

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.770 
struggle the struggle was real nice up
there<00:02:13.150> pushing<00:02:13.720> off<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.870> stage<00:02:14.260> I<00:02:15.660> think<00:02:16.660> he's

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
there pushing off the stage I think he's

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.840 
there pushing off the stage I think he's
adapting<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.830> aerials<00:02:18.160> on<00:02:18.340> stage<00:02:18.610> from

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
adapting to the aerials on stage from

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.479 
adapting to the aerials on stage from
pokey<00:02:19.120> Knutson<00:02:19.680> gets<00:02:20.680> important<00:02:21.100> yeah<00:02:22.120> if

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
pokey Knutson gets important yeah if

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.559 
pokey Knutson gets important yeah if
every<00:02:24.489> times<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.910> tried<00:02:25.090> he<00:02:25.270> could<00:02:25.390> he

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
every times a tried he could he

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:26.910 
every times a tried he could he
definitely<00:02:25.959> get<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.140> best<00:02:26.350> of<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.620> aerial

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
definitely get the best of the aerial

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.729 
definitely get the best of the aerial
battle<00:02:27.190> but<00:02:27.400> well<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.269> was<00:02:28.360> nice<00:02:28.540> cape<00:02:31.739> he's

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
battle but well that was nice cape he's

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.440

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
doing it again he has to realize that he

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.229 
doing it again he has to realize that he
can't<00:02:34.660> just<00:02:34.780> leap<00:02:34.959> in<00:02:35.200> yep<00:02:35.739> when<00:02:36.730> Marcelo

could<00:03:18.820> have<00:03:18.910> done<00:03:19.060> anything<00:03:19.299> just<00:03:19.510> their

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
could have done anything just their

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.130 
could have done anything just their
coconuts<00:03:21.130> but<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:22.720> doesn't<00:03:22.959> matter

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
coconuts but that doesn't matter

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.380 
coconuts but that doesn't matter
yeah<00:03:23.950> that's<00:03:24.190> probably<00:03:24.670> going<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.850> be<00:03:24.940> it<00:03:25.120> yep

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
yeah that's probably going to be it yep

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.440 
yeah that's probably going to be it yep
yeah<00:03:25.840> that<00:03:26.310> was<00:03:27.310> actually<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.700> lot<00:03:27.850> closer<00:03:28.120> than

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
yeah that was actually a lot closer than

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:49.270 
yeah that was actually a lot closer than
I<00:03:28.510> thought<00:03:28.600> it<00:03:28.870> would<00:03:28.930> be

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:57.820 

Oh<00:03:50.020> Martha<00:03:51.020> oh<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:56.230> came<00:03:57.230> to<00:03:57.500> back<00:03:57.710> to
