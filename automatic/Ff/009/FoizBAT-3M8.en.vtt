flicking<00:01:53.500> your<00:01:53.590> front<00:01:53.830> finger<00:01:54.070> off<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.310> nose

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
flicking your front finger off the nose

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.219 
flicking your front finger off the nose
of<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.670> board<00:01:54.850> there's<00:01:55.240> two<00:01:55.570> ways<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.810> can<00:01:56.110> go

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
of the board there's two ways you can go

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:56.969 
of the board there's two ways you can go
about<00:01:56.259> doing<00:01:56.710> it

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
about doing it

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.710 
about doing it
the<00:01:57.190> first<00:01:57.430> Rainbows<00:01:57.820> flicking<00:01:58.300> a<00:01:58.360> key<00:01:58.509> look

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
the first Rainbows flicking a key look

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.630 
the first Rainbows flicking a key look
out<00:01:58.899> in<00:01:59.259> front<00:01:59.530> of<00:01:59.649> you<00:01:59.770> which<00:02:00.190> gets<00:02:00.399> it<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.610> a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
out in front of you which gets it to a

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.880 
out in front of you which gets it to a
90<00:02:01.000> degree<00:02:01.240> angle<00:02:01.270> at<00:02:02.170> this<00:02:02.320> point<00:02:02.590> you<00:02:02.680> stop

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
90 degree angle at this point you stop

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.139 
90 degree angle at this point you stop
it<00:02:03.039> from<00:02:03.130> rotating<00:02:03.280> we<00:02:03.580> need<00:02:03.700> two<00:02:03.820> fingers

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
it from rotating we need two fingers

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.850 
it from rotating we need two fingers
whether<00:02:04.330> it's<00:02:04.479> in<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.750> air<00:02:04.899> catching<00:02:05.380> it<00:02:05.500> or

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
whether it's in the air catching it or

on<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.250> ground<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:06.789> then<00:02:06.940> you<00:02:07.060> can<00:02:07.210> use

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
on the ground and then you can use

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.999 
on the ground and then you can use
finish<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.690> rest<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.050> rotation<00:02:08.470> with

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
finish the rest of the rotation with

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.380 
finish the rest of the rotation with
your<00:02:09.190> two<00:02:09.310> fingers<00:02:09.340> already<00:02:09.880> on<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.239> board

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
either one of these methods it just

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.170 
either one of these methods it just
comes<00:02:23.950> down<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.130> a<00:02:24.280> matter<00:02:24.489> of<00:02:24.610> how<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.790> throw

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
comes down to a matter of how you throw

for<00:02:28.060> learning<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.330> first<00:02:28.510> method<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.110> can

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
for learning the first method you can

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.509 
for learning the first method you can
see<00:02:29.410> if<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.590> just<00:02:29.769> throw<00:02:29.950> my<00:02:30.100> hand<00:02:30.280> out<00:02:30.370> in<00:02:30.459> front

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
see if I just throw my hand out in front

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.280 
see if I just throw my hand out in front
of<00:02:30.760> me<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.239> board<00:02:31.450> rotates<00:02:31.630> 90<00:02:31.959> degrees<00:02:34.290> and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
of me the board rotates 90 degrees and

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.390 
of me the board rotates 90 degrees and
if<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.500> flick<00:02:35.709> out<00:02:35.799> my<00:02:35.920> hand<00:02:36.130> going<00:02:36.340> the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
if I flick out my hand going the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.979 
if I flick out my hand going the
opposite<00:02:36.790> direction<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.450> board<00:02:37.630> does<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.780> full

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
opposite direction the board does a full

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.940 
opposite direction the board does a full
180<00:02:38.230> degrees<00:02:38.680> right<00:02:38.950> away<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.620> here's<00:02:41.829> an

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
180 degrees right away so here's an

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.319 
180 degrees right away so here's an
example<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.370> doing<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.610> backside<00:02:42.970> heelflip

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
example of doing a backside heelflip

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.030 
example of doing a backside heelflip
where<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.600> flick<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.810> away<00:02:43.930> from<00:02:44.320> you<00:02:44.500> at<00:02:44.739> 90

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
where you flick it away from you at 90

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.710 
where you flick it away from you at 90
degrees

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
degrees

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.540 
degrees
and<00:02:47.350> then<00:02:47.470> here's<00:02:47.650> an<00:02:47.740> example<00:02:48.100> of<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.220> backside

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
and then here's an example of a backside

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.190 
and then here's an example of a backside
heelflip<00:02:48.880> reflux<00:02:49.420> straight<00:02:49.750> back<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.110> the

heelflip reflux straight back in the
opposite<00:02:50.530> direction<00:02:55.680> well<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.800> concludes

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
opposite direction well that concludes

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.220 
opposite direction well that concludes
