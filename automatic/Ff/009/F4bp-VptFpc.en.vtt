00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.820 
most important thing Louise I think this
is<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.310> classic<00:03:38.910> example<00:03:39.080> where<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.170> FA<00:03:40.500> should

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
is a classic example where the FA should

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.530 
is a classic example where the FA should
follow<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.340> advice<00:03:41.670> that<00:03:41.730> was<00:03:42.030> given<00:03:42.120> them

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540
