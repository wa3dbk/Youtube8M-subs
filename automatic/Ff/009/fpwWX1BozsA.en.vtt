 being delicate yesterday at night he had a 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.780
 small complication box let's say and 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.880
 he had to be transfused with platelets that was 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.010
 something that was not programmed these then 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.390
 about half past twelve at night and 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.000
 after this morning he started very 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.220
 early with scheduled dialysis type 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.960
 6 and a half was already on dialysis and 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.240
 They also took advantage of that moment to 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.450
 give a blood transfusion and 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.390
 who are trying to prop it up what 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.860
 the doctor told us informally in the 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.830
 dialysis is that the analyzes were there 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.320
 you saw the red blood cells are low and 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.960
 this makes any perspective of 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.060
 I had high today for not 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.880
 is going to be the truth that 's how 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.820
 that the idea is to keep propping up today 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.590
 receives an important transfusion together 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.950
 with dialysis and let's see how 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.020
 the body responds this transfusion 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.620
 awake he was just eating 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.540
 ravioli that viviana apple roasted well 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.720

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.370
 own media has no power 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.870
 intravenous and I was tired you see comes 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.740
 hit with so much invasive treatment 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.470
 so 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.440
 up here is what we know what we 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.620
 doctors say and good is with 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.540
 we thanks to transfusions 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.720
 Marina yesterday talking with your sister we 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.770
 transmitted certain one side obviously 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.750
 there is anguish and how it should be one is 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.090
 worried as it is role as what 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.190
 we are all in other measures by the 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.930
 Your child's health at one time used the 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.720
 miracle word like that in order to 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.700
 week there had been a miracle that 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.530
 your dad really was very bad in order 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.400
 of week 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:05.129
 and that's the way it is, the truth is that it's like that 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.659
 when they asked me how to explain the 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.459
 explosion of a day on the day of the 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.459
 photos of the season's launch and 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.230
 that has a single explanation that is 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.360
 I filled up before taking the pictures 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.849
 a meeting with doctors and 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.099
 they raised the worst of the horizons you 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.260
 gave the worst of the forecasts is well 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.540
 what happens is that good is something that in 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.409
 that moment we knew only us and 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.569
 we can not walk around trying to 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.700
 that the world justifies us by the fact 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.889
 of having a bad time or having a 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.280
 dad interned but the truth is is the 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:40.950
 prognosis on Wednesday was black and of 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.780
 done on Wednesday night when I 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.780
 I get there, it's like the 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.700
 pick up in those hours I'm talking about 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.430
 8 o'clock at night or so 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.209
 and good and on Thursday morning that I 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.620
 I came to dialysis the one that brought them to me 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.440
 who also puts his share of joy 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.319
 to all this the doctor told me his father 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.300
 is the phoenix told him when I came 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.459
 to the room do at night and what 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.130
 I saw eating I could not believe it as 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.170
 the doctor himself was surprised this 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.030
 dad's resurrection luck when 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.609
 I think even they expected what 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.969
 worse and the truth is that 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:23.000
 This is the picture is not going as passing 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:25.819
 recovering from different crises but the 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.969
 base box this is irreversible this 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:32.090
 we know it and it's about these days 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:33.979

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.229

 extend life as much as possible 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.069
 transfusions and transfusions are key 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:44.740
