00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
it that but this is really cool now I

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.499 
it that but this is really cool now I
don't<00:01:38.100> know<00:01:38.189> if<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.520> an<00:01:38.610> actual<00:01:39.030> figure

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
don't know if this is an actual figure

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.690
