00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.510
 Hello, what are we going to do? 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.310
 very funny that they are eggs 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.860
 dinosaur or reptile and how the 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.620
 you want to call we're going to need eggs 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.820
 cooked and food coloring of the 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.190
 colors that you want I am going to use 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.530
 several different we are also going to 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.539
 need some plastic bags me 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.449
 we have these freezing but you 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.160
 It's worth any supermarket bag 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.080
 Once the eggs are cooked and cold 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.359
 so that we burn jce we're going to 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.850
 break a little you can do like that with 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:36.409
 tapping or pressing and making them 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.079
 roll by the table 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:40.999
 weise cow trachea lando without it 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.979
 the shell comes to fall simply 

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:46.620
 we want to make a few cracks 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:49.590
 in the shell of the egg 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.870
 very carefully better do it little to 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.530
 little the egg has to be fine 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.530
 Cooked 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.050
 we do the same with the rest of eggs 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.390
 u and this one has broken a little bit does not happen 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.490
 nothing we do the next 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.770
 you can break it everywhere or 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.510
 only by one half for the part of 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.510
 up or down if you want 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.700
 well then once we have already 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.610
 our eggs ready we are going to 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.310
 go putting them in a bag each in 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.560
 a different one that we're going to dye each 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.320
 one of a color 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.990
 we open our bag we put the egg 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.490
 inside down completely with care and 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.579
 now we are going to add a few drops of 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.140
 coloring remember that it is food 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.740
 sold in confectionery stores 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.920
 in some supermarkets and it has to be 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.500
 liquid 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.080
 or as much in gel but it does not work 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.640
 powder coloring if you want in this 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.560
 point you can add a few drops of 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.080
 vinegar to fix the color better 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.360
 I'm not going to do it 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.400
 we are going to close it with a knot so that 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.410
 do not leave or you can put a clip 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.920
 a rubber band or something so that the 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.259
 liquid is simply we move it a 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.600
 little so that the coloring goes entering 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.820
 through the cracks of the egg will dye 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.590
 also a little the shell and what 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.680
 we let it rest while we do the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.659
 others 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.190
 you see just a trickle of 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:23.590
 coloring in this case yellow 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.400
 and repeat as many times as you want with 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.400
 different eggs 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.460
 the one that had broken me that is 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.460
 I'll also do it to see what happens 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.540
 Well, you leave it there for a little while. 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.120
 moving so that it covers well with the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.820
 coloring all the egg you expect 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.710
 minutillos five minutitos more or less 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.260
 for the dye to act on 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.170
 the eggs here I have all I like 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.570
 you have made 55 different colors and 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.190
 now it's time to open them I'm going to put 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.610
 some gloves as you are seeing from these 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.470
 latex not to stain me because the 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.780
 dye stains a lot the hands do not pass 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.430
 nothing is cleaned but just in case there is 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.870
 I think I cut the tip of my finger 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.700
 to the glove 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.440
 well then we open the bags here I have 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.690
 first 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.990
 read carefully let's peel our 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.990
 egg 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.520
 the dye has entered inside yet 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.660
 it's wet then we 're going to have to 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.660
 let dry a little 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.700
 and in this case it has not been very 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.230
 crackle has not made many figurines 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.190
 and let's check with the others but 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.990
 You see and coloring has dyed different 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.790
 way different parts of the egg like this 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.530
 we have left this each one is left 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.630
 different that you can not control 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.240
 depending on the lines that have been 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.880
 stayed in the shell 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.620
 This one has more drawings and I'm going to 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.560
 paste only in half to leave the 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.620
 half of the shell 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.880
 as if it were a freshly broken egg 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.290
 The following is the red or pink 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.290
 It has also been very good 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.209
 and I'm going to open the rest to go peeling and 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.100
 placing here 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.639
 to then continue cleaning the ones 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.639
 a little bit better 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.790
 between egg and egg you are not seeing 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.330
 but I 'm cleaning my gloves for 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.800
 Do not color the other eggs 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.660
 Well now that cleaned a little bit 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.880
 here with a napkin or paper 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.070
 kitchen we are going to remove a little 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.370
 Excess dye or moisture in the 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.000
 Web 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.980
 we see carefully does not have too much and 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.350
 if there will be remains of shell also what 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.120
 we remove 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.630
 some have stuck some 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.630
 little ones 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.100
 as you see, what I do not rub 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.110
 the egg is to make it roll by the 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.520
 napkin 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.590
 so keep the coloring 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.379
 if you have put vinegar the color 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:10.220
 will be much more fixed because here I have 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:11.659
 the 5 more than pretty eggs and now what 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.280
 what I'm going to do is prepare them for 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.770
 present 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.389
 I'm going to put them in a bowl and 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.370
 that you see a species at the top 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.170
 of nest I will put kitchen paper 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.060
 down because if I would not go to the 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.630
 eggs down and I'm going to cover it with paper 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.630
 green silk 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.120
 you really do not have to do with 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.010
 edible things and you're going to eat them 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.740
 like eg lettuce leaves that I 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:37.100
 I do not have and grated carrot or celery or 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.930
 any vegetable that you have 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.730
 I'm going to present them like this but not 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.720
 they would be edible because the paper is going 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.430
 to stick a little on the eggs 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.540
 I just do it to make it 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.540
 nice and I chose to throw it 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.169
 and if the decoration users by 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.169
 example I do not know for easter or something 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.940
 now with white paper as I tell you how 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.890
 I have little vegetables 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.750
 with onions for example to imitate 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.550
 twigs of the nest 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.050
 I'm going to do is with this super scissor that 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.190
 I bought that cuts many strips to 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.190
 I'm going to cut some strips 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:16.300
 and I will do as you see 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:18.760
 the pieces to imitate a nest 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.040
 dinosaur in this case they do not get 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.430
 nests but good a nest of eggs 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.410
 reptile can be for example 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.910
 They are very nice for Easter as you 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:32.060
 I said not only to surprise the 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.060
 children at a dinner but to decorate 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.460
 You can serve accompanied as you 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.500
 I say of vegetables 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.090
 they are totally edible because 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.050
 remember that the ink that we have 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.819
 used the food coloring 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.699
 you always ask me if they can be used 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:49.500
 Temperas and another type of painting yes yes 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.750
 They are for decoration but if they are for eating 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.120
 do not 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.550
 he put them here on top and they would have them 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.490
 ready look how nice 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.470
 ready I hope you liked this 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.420
