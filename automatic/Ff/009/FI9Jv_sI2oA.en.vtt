what he originally set out to do that

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.530 
what he originally set out to do that
that's<00:00:34.770> not<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.010> good<00:00:35.250> thing<00:00:35.309> because<00:00:35.700> judging

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
that's not a good thing because judging

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.889 
that's not a good thing because judging
by<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.780> quality<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:38.040> story<00:00:38.480> him<00:00:39.480> him

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
by the quality of this story him him

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.860 
by the quality of this story him him
straying<00:00:40.620> off<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:41.250> path<00:00:41.610> would<00:00:42.420> not<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:42.840> a

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
straying off that path would not be a

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.229 
straying off that path would not be a
good<00:00:42.930> thing<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.649> I'm<00:00:44.550> kind<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.090> middle

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
good thing and I'm kind of in the middle

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.790 
good thing and I'm kind of in the middle
here<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.899> feel<00:00:46.230> as<00:00:46.379> if<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.620> author

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
here because I feel as if the author

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.119 
here because I feel as if the author
knows<00:00:47.309> what<00:00:48.120> what<00:00:48.510> he<00:00:48.690> wants<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.410> but<00:00:50.039> at
