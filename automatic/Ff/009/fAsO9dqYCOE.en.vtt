00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.199
 hello and welcome to the seventh chapter 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.790
 of electronics I am winter freud and today 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:30.080
 I'm going to make a secret door like this 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.930
 we see that it is a door of only one 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.700
 block width may be 2 to 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.500
 it will be more cooler but good 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.059
 decided to do it like that because it's much more 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.770
 simple is finished before and total for 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.340
 do a double alone would have to double 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.230
 the circuit very well 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.020
 I'm going to take a look around so that 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.880
 you see that you do not see anything, that is, it is not 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.560
 hard to hide it really good 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.670
 it's been so big because 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.190
 well I made a small cabin 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.170
 to show that you can get 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.460
 a room easily and all bad without 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.780
 more I'll move on to do the rebuild 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.440
 in the following way first of all 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.300
 we use four sticky pistons like that 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.850
 another two so we see here we place the 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.290
 two stone blocks that are going to be the 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.230
 move to plug the entrance 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.900
 we build a stone arch that 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.340
 well and now we come to feed these 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.030
 pistons that are fed so we place 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.860
 those two blocks of wool we put here 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.450
 the redstone here a torch of the rest 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.580
 a hole here here here and here and 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.540
 we started to fill active reston 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.910
 on top of the wool block well here goes 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:40.220
 a repeater that goes in the last 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:44.330
 position here reston and here torch of 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.479
 rest well on this rest torch 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.400
 let's put a block of wool and over 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.840
 rest dust here a repeater and 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.230
 finally I think it's already filled 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.270
 the rest of the structure 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.680
 with our material that in my case is 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.910
 stone simple stone without more and good 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.430
 would that color we could place here 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.760
 the switch or without more bring not only 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.760
 here 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.920
 right here we are going to check if it works 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.840
 we open and close well we see that 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.980
 it works as you can see it's a circuit 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.430
 very simple has not taken me anything 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.980
 make it very easy and very cool very well 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.590
 Well, what else can I say about this? 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.350
 you want to hide this switch is 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.730
 say bring it underground or similar is 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.970
 as simple as coming here and doing so 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.680
 we put here here and here I do 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.540
 in case someone is not used to 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.920
 do this kind of 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.870
 of circuits is silly but good 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.470
 we live here and for example when not 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.470
 I know exactly 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.050
 where I am but let's get it out 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.050
 here 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:59.430
 and here this block and for being the subtract 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.590
 under this block in theory 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.049
 when you give it, the rest that 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.859
 underneath this we would take it this not what 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.049
 we can work because then 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.670
 we cut the reston connection like 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.219
 you can see but good can be placed 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.769
 a half block and still makes an effect 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:17.659
 of tapado although in fact it leaves is 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:20.700
 half block of air below and 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.469
 just one more thing if you want to be able 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.290
 close the door from inside very thing 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.969
 logic then you can use for example 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.400
 a stable beat rs or memory of a beat 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:30.569
 like the one that I described where I think no 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.060
 I'm sure I think it's the second 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.409
 video of this series of electronics the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.599
 second, nothing to build and it is a 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:41.189
 stable rs of those and you could activate it 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.340
 well from inside from outside and so 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:45.750
 just handle is the state 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.599
 this entry 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.849
 then open or closed because nothing else 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.069
 it's all I hope you liked it if it's 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.989
 so you can give like or subscribe to 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.079
 more tutorials and other videos thanks and 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.079
 a greeting
