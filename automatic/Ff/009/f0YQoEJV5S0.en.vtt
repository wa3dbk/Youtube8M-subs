00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:11.480
 how it works snow plow relieve 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:13.150
 from inconvenience the node is cut in thicker 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.750
 snow and quickly and effortlessly 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.230
 clearing the path 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.840
 in 1 minute it can recycle 12 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.050
 cubic meters of snow is about 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.930
 the size of the car he throws snow 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.160
 speed 70 kilometers per hour stacking 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.160
 its far-path 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.780
 definitely better and shovels 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.520
 do it all snowplow 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.020
 allows for a huge version of a very simple 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:47.670
 gwint fixtures 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.670
 screws bring snow from place to place 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.930
 but how does he do it 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.640
 snowplow device engine pump 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.500
 mechanically driven which 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.500
 pushes them through the discharge hatch 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.159
 the pump runs insanely fast due to 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.899
 its size 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.969
 but he can only take small 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:17.920
 amount of snow otherwise it will clog into 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:19.960
 this moment comes the turn of the cafe 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.819
 as cleaner believes forward coke 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.590
 picks up a lot of snow and 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:26.229
 guides it through the screw 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.679
 conveyor to the pump that runs on 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.679
 speed limit 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.819
 but to fully understand how everything is 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.689
 nothing is left but 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:36.689
 take it apart 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.299
 the front of the cleaner is just a genius 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.799
 huge cove that works like 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:28.109
 funnel collects a large number 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:31.670
 snow and two screw conveyors which 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:34.549
 move the bucket collected snow pump 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.870
 there are 2 years to each screw and 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:40.170
 the blade rotates around the screw 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.090
 almost as soon as 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.510
 the engine starts the blade starts 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.510
 rotate 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.480
 the first blade smashes into by pulling through the floor 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.480
 turnover comes to his place 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.390
 when the conveyor screws rotate they 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.720
 perform two functions first they 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.250
 distinguish snow 2 add it to the pump 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.250
 that's how it happens 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.459
 on the blades of in-t located notches 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.260
 quite capable and cut even remove 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:16.239
 if it contains solid layers of us 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.019
 one by one blade cut the snow and up 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.019
 this on earth 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.280
 this way the snow breaks into small 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.080
 pieces 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.050
 it's much easier now to skip this one 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.050
 snow through the pump otherwise pump for 130 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.680
 there is something unusual about these 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.540
 blades they are angled this 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.910
 corner allows them to do very 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.660
 important work they transform 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.250
 rotational energy linear blade 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.250
 rotate and push death along 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.950
 straight line exactly at the pump and when we 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.340
 speak push we exactly had it 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.770
 in view of 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.070
 because the lion increases the rotational 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:04.040
 force is physics 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:05.990
 simple and ingenious when the wine passes 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.360
 half a turn he makes half the way 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:15.080
 before pushing snow yes snow then 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.150
 making a far smaller path in 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.890
 As a result, this path difference increases 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:24.920
 force through which pushed 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:27.530
 snow and where the snow it gets 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.900
 goes straight pump with 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.730
 propeller rotating with insane 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.540
 speed he breaks out of the discharge 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.340
 hatch 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.020
 at a speed of 70 kilometers per hour 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.020
 snow plow is more than a pump 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.340
 absorbing snow at insane speed 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.410
 This is an amazing device in which 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.680
 huge screws are used as 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.020
 transporters these screws are very important they 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.270
 move the snow break into pieces and 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.370
 sent to the pump for a very short 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.060
 time 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.060
 impressive
