00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.440 

one<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.490> questions<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.910> get<00:00:14.969> every<00:00:15.269> single

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
one of the questions I get every single

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.630 
one of the questions I get every single
season<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.289> how<00:00:16.560> do<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.770> go<00:00:17.039> ahead<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.340> read<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
season is how do I go ahead and read the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.939 
season is how do I go ahead and read the
coverages<00:00:18.029> before<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.570> snap<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.770> what<00:00:19.920> I

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
coverages before this snap and so what I

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.080 
coverages before this snap and so what I
thought<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.220> would<00:00:20.430> do<00:00:20.550> with<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:20.730> video

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
thought I would do with this video

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.910 
thought I would do with this video
breakdown<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.900> show<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.170> how<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.350> like<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.650> read

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
breakdown to show you how I like to read

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.320 
breakdown to show you how I like to read
it<00:00:22.949> coverages<00:00:23.400> rather<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.820> be<00:00:23.910> man<00:00:24.150> or<00:00:24.300> zone

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
it coverages rather it be man or zone

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.509 
it coverages rather it be man or zone
coverage<00:00:24.930> as<00:00:25.199> soon<00:00:25.740> as<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> defense<00:00:26.310> breaks

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
coverage as soon as the defense breaks

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.429 
coverage as soon as the defense breaks
the<00:00:26.699> huddle<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.119> generally<00:00:27.480> tell<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
the huddle I can generally tell and the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.290 
the huddle I can generally tell and the
reason<00:00:28.680> for<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.310> if<00:00:29.580> you're<00:00:29.880> really<00:00:30.060> good

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
reason for that is if you're really good

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.849 
reason for that is if you're really good
quarterback<00:00:30.779> at<00:00:30.990> least<00:00:31.140> for<00:00:31.260> me<00:00:31.349> anyways<00:00:31.650> over

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
quarterback at least for me anyways over

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:32.900 
quarterback at least for me anyways over
the<00:00:31.949> years<00:00:32.070> I've<00:00:32.189> been<00:00:32.279> pretty<00:00:32.489> good<00:00:32.579> at<00:00:32.759> being

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
the years I've been pretty good at being

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.549 
the years I've been pretty good at being
a<00:00:32.969> quarterback<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.660> reason<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.350> as

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
a quarterback and the reason that is as

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.560 
a quarterback and the reason that is as
far<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:34.860> video<00:00:35.160> games<00:00:35.190> go<00:00:35.670> not<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> real

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
far as video games go not a real

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.790 
far as video games go not a real
quarterback<00:00:36.930> obviously<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:37.559> as<00:00:37.620> far<00:00:37.739> as

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
quarterback obviously but as far as

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.040 
quarterback obviously but as far as
video<00:00:38.100> games<00:00:38.129> go<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:39.600> reason<00:00:39.840> I've<00:00:39.930> had

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
video games go the reason I've had

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.360 
video games go the reason I've had
really<00:00:40.260> success<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:40.860> far<00:00:41.010> as<00:00:41.100> being<00:00:41.250> a

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
really success as far as being a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.740 
really success as far as being a
quarterback<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.969> because<00:00:42.180> I'm<00:00:42.300> known<00:00:42.540> where

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
quarterback it's because I'm known where

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.049 
quarterback it's because I'm known where
to<00:00:42.780> throw<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> ball<00:00:43.350> before<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.489> even<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.940> to

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
to throw the ball before I even have to

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.360 
to throw the ball before I even have to
snap<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> ball<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.870> by<00:00:46.050> knowing<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
snap the ball and by knowing that and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.590 
snap the ball and by knowing that and
then<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.640> allows<00:00:47.760> me<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.300> go<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.510> and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
then that allows me to go in and

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.270 
then that allows me to go in and
complete<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> high<00:00:49.110> percentage<00:00:49.379> passes<00:00:50.070> now

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
complete a high percentage passes now

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.580 
complete a high percentage passes now

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
is going to work against the computer

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.040 
is going to work against the computer
every<00:00:54.120> single<00:00:54.390> time<00:00:54.539> because<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.809> computer

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
every single time because the computer

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.479 
every single time because the computer
is<00:00:55.140> not<00:00:55.230> going<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.469> make<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> doubles<00:00:56.100> however

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489

if you're playing against an opponent
especially<00:00:58.770> someone<00:00:59.010> as<00:00:59.129> pretty<00:00:59.340> smart<00:00:59.760> knows

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
especially someone as pretty smart knows

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.160 
especially someone as pretty smart knows
what<00:01:00.059> they're<00:01:00.180> doing<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.449> defense<00:01:00.480> probably

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
what they're doing on defense probably

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.420 
what they're doing on defense probably
what<00:01:01.289> they're<00:01:01.410> going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.949> once<00:01:02.280> they

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
what they're going to do is once they

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.009 
what they're going to do is once they
break<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.760> huddle<00:01:02.910> they're<00:01:03.629> probably<00:01:03.840> going

break the huddle they're probably going

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.600 
break the huddle they're probably going
to<00:01:04.110> come<00:01:04.290> out<00:01:04.379> say<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> zone<00:01:04.949> defense<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.549> they

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
to come out say a zone defense and they

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.609 
to come out say a zone defense and they
may<00:01:05.790> want<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.150> bottle<00:01:06.540> into<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> man<00:01:07.049> defense<00:01:07.470> if

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
may want to bottle into a man defense if

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.840 
may want to bottle into a man defense if
they<00:01:07.740> do<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.159> then<00:01:08.369> you're<00:01:08.490> not<00:01:08.610> going<00:01:08.790> to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
they do that then you're not going to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.789 
they do that then you're not going to
really<00:01:09.000> tell<00:01:09.270> as<00:01:09.390> well<00:01:09.570> unless<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.869> do<00:01:10.049> some

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
really tell as well unless you do some

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.870 
really tell as well unless you do some
type<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:10.979> motion<00:01:11.280> or<00:01:11.490> something<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:11.790> that

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
type of motion or something like that

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.460 
type of motion or something like that
however<00:01:12.210> if<00:01:12.540> they<00:01:12.659> don't<00:01:12.869> audible<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.380> you're

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
however if they don't audible and you're

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.810

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.610 
if you do that you should get a pretty
good<00:02:35.120> sense<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.720> what's<00:02:35.900> going<00:02:36.080> on<00:02:36.320> here<00:02:36.530> as

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
good sense of what's going on here as

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.960 
good sense of what's going on here as
far<00:02:36.770> as<00:02:36.920> brenell<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.220> reduce<00:02:37.490> coverages<00:02:37.910> and

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
far as brenell to reduce coverages and

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.280 
far as brenell to reduce coverages and
for<00:02:38.240> me<00:02:38.360> this<00:02:38.510> is<00:02:38.660> what<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:38.840> do<00:02:38.930> every<00:02:39.020> single

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
for me this is what I do every single

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.230 
for me this is what I do every single
season<00:02:39.770> this<00:02:40.550> is<00:02:40.640> probably<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:40.970> first<00:02:41.150> thing

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
season this is probably the first thing

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.270 
season this is probably the first thing
I<00:02:41.480> do<00:02:41.540> is<00:02:41.690> say<00:02:42.080> I<00:02:42.110> got<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.470> figure<00:02:42.680> out<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.860> way<00:02:43.100> at

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
I do is say I got to figure out a way at

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.260 
I do is say I got to figure out a way at
the<00:02:43.370> brillo<00:02:43.550> tell<00:02:43.760> if<00:02:43.850> it's<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:43.970> man<00:02:44.120> or<00:02:44.150> zone

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
if it's zone coverage I pretty much know

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.750 
if it's zone coverage I pretty much know
how<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.320> attack<00:02:48.770> it<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:49.220> time<00:02:49.430> has<00:02:49.580> come

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760
