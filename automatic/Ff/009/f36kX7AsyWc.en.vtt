00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.400 
was no standardization there was no
competitions<00:03:25.360> it<00:03:25.720> was<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.709> true<00:03:27.250> for<00:03:27.700> construed

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
competitions it was a true for construed

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.390 
competitions it was a true for construed
and<00:03:29.410> that<00:03:30.340> is<00:03:30.579> where<00:03:30.820> my<00:03:31.120> mind<00:03:31.390> goes<00:03:31.690> to

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
and that is where my mind goes to

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.340 
and that is where my mind goes to
because<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.790> was<00:03:33.940> an<00:03:34.060> instrument<00:03:34.600> primarily

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
because it was an instrument primarily

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.890 
because it was an instrument primarily
for<00:03:35.680> dance<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.120> children<00:03:37.360> were<00:03:37.600> picked

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
for dance so the children were picked

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.030 
for dance so the children were picked
out<00:03:38.110> with<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.769> feet<00:03:39.040> on<00:03:40.350> hard<00:03:41.350> shoes<00:03:41.680> on<00:03:41.980> a

out with the feet on hard shoes on a
hard<00:03:42.489> floor<00:03:42.820> and<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:44.650> Pipers<00:03:45.540> sat<00:03:46.540> down<00:03:46.810> to

hard floor and the Pipers sat down to
play

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
play

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.940 
play
