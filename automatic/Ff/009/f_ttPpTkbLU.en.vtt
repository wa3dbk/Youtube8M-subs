00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.780
 Opened 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.780
 It is this tile 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:27.279
 The time is 1803 where the place is the same as the picture drawn by Shingo 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:27.279
 I am drawing a 5.4-meter-wide ship on the coast of Ibaraki prefecture 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:34.290
 Kim did not look at this straw version and drew a picture of the Gion novel 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:41.090
 Hmm 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.090
 And above all , does this form of UFO actually exist? 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:53.540
 This is exactly what a lens family is 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:55.040
 Speak so studied the Yuefuo around the world including many of the book over a period of 30 years hatch 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.550
 With a person 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.160
 Junko 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:06.040
 Because the lens mold ufo convex lens was two combined 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:12.300
 It has a similar shape and is rounded. 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.300
 After all in the Edo period probably ufo was flying 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.860
 Ha 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.730
 1 o'clock 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.850
 Hello, everyone is here uss 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:27.470
 My name is ufo Kirk University Institute 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.850
 uss it is that of a science graduate who say 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:38.880
 Yupo size school 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:40.520
 Let's study and study the Seth's Yoho Science Mouth for future expansion over 100 years ahead 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.220
 ngo 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.770
 It is a lifelong educational institution 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.770
 It was a message from uss 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.260
 The technology that appears to be UFO in the compiled shorthand 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:04.880
 If it is the oldest temple in Japan held in Reki 596 November, at the completion memorial ceremony 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:14.410
 I hope there is a Buddhist recession in Japan 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:18.570
 Shotoku Taiko and Soga Bako were present 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.570
 But I saw a boat 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.950
 Became the main of 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.520
 Those in the form of bitterling prognosis 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.520
 from the sky 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.590
 Second to none 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:38.930
 Looking at how to emit five colors of light 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:41.740
 People hands together and must Thankfully Takashi YoshimiHiroshi 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.990
 Often to fly away 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.380
 Apply 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:50.980
 The dragon appears with the legendary Kamimitsu 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:54.519
 yu fo also emerges with light 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.780
 4th from the 5th place with great speed 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.740
 Hmm 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.100
 Baked as an afterimage of human eyes 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:08.150
 It looks like the preparation of the dragon is not off 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.150
 If indicated by the Kiekidan by Ieyasu Tokugawa and Prince Shotoku 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.170
 I wonder if there is nothing else 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:23.630
 And even now 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:27.320
 In January this year Kagoshima Prefecture was witnessed by a number of residents with slightly injured and mysterious flying objects 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.510
 The flying object falls as it burns 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.080
 And that probably that rose to pillar of fire 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.010
 But still 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.010
 I remember 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:42.730
 No trace of the accident found 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.730
 What is what I saw of what was at all 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:51.720
 Ushikusa remains were wrapped in mystery 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.720
 When we continue to investigate the example 4 is also referred to as the future 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:03.510
 I did my Taketori story 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:07.920

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:12.630

 I saw one of the bamboo section are buying strangely 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.519
 And face around 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:26.460
 It's a cute baby when you open it 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.460
 It became chest number beautiful number one 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.720
 It is said that came this much Well I to eye us often come to the wonderful people in's your daughter-in-law 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.030
 Though 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:41.340
 She won't feel like riding alone It looks like it's a night when it's gonna be an evening 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.940
 Like to sigh 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.129
 And when the flame and meet 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.889
 I bought a name 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:50.010
 I stood in the true 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.490
 After all it is a lottery to say 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.280
 The eight patterns are sloppy 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.760
 Well , I guess those who say vehicles 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.670

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.970
 Good 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:23.390
 I wonder if it's related to me Oh this is amazing 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:28.449
 I think that's right, according to what I think that if you ride something close to high speed 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:32.289
 It becomes a time zone different from the rest of the world in time is delayed 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:35.439
