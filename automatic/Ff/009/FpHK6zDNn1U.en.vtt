00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
talk about how to deadhead flowers so

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.770 
talk about how to deadhead flowers so
it's<00:00:10.950> really<00:00:11.219> not<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.490> complicated

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
it's really not that complicated

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.259 
it's really not that complicated
my<00:00:13.349> theory<00:00:13.710> in<00:00:13.920> my<00:00:14.099> garden<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.700> if<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.059> looks

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
my theory in my garden is if it looks

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.810 
my theory in my garden is if it looks
lush<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.839> beautiful<00:00:15.900> leave<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.650> alone<00:00:16.920> if<00:00:17.340> it

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
lush and beautiful leave it alone if it

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.450 
lush and beautiful leave it alone if it
looks<00:00:18.029> dead<00:00:18.330> cut<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.779> out<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.279> deadheading<00:00:20.279> is

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
looks dead cut it out and deadheading is

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.340 
looks dead cut it out and deadheading is
just<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.029> sounds<00:00:21.270> you're<00:00:21.660> just<00:00:21.869> cutting

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
just like it sounds you're just cutting

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.700 
just like it sounds you're just cutting
the<00:00:22.800> heads<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.939> dead<00:00:24.180> flowers<00:00:24.630> out<00:00:24.840> so

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
the heads of the dead flowers out so

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.920 
the heads of the dead flowers out so
right<00:00:25.949> now<00:00:26.189> these<00:00:26.550> acid<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.150> Thera<00:00:27.390> have<00:00:27.720> done

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
right now these acid and Thera have done

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.240 
right now these acid and Thera have done
blooming<00:00:28.199> but<00:00:28.500> there's<00:00:28.650> still<00:00:28.800> some<00:00:29.010> blooms

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
blooming but there's still some blooms

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.970 
blooming but there's still some blooms
on<00:00:29.490> them<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.449> bottom<00:00:30.900> part<00:00:31.140> looks<00:00:31.349> tacky

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
on them but the bottom part looks tacky

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.549 
on them but the bottom part looks tacky
so<00:00:32.309> I'll<00:00:32.489> just<00:00:32.669> cut<00:00:32.910> these<00:00:33.149> little<00:00:33.480> parts<00:00:34.440> that

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
so I'll just cut these little parts that

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.620 
so I'll just cut these little parts that
are<00:00:34.980> done<00:00:35.190> blooming<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:35.760> or<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.239> pull<00:00:36.480> them

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
are done blooming out or I can pull them

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.040 
are done blooming out or I can pull them
right<00:00:36.660> out<00:00:36.840> too<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.620> lot<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.700> times<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.540> you

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
right out too a lot of times if you

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.500 
right out too a lot of times if you
leave<00:00:40.290> them<00:00:40.440> they'll<00:00:40.590> go<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.829> seed<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.579> then

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
leave them they'll go to seed and then

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.209 
leave them they'll go to seed and then
you<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:42.809> spread<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.200> seeds<00:00:43.440> around<00:00:43.620> but<00:00:44.070> with

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
you can spread the seeds around but with

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.279 
you can spread the seeds around but with
deadheading<00:00:44.760> you're<00:00:45.270> pretty<00:00:45.600> much<00:00:45.780> cutting

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
deadheading you're pretty much cutting

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.930 
deadheading you're pretty much cutting
them<00:00:46.469> out<00:00:46.590> before<00:00:47.070> they<00:00:47.100> go<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.370> seed<00:00:47.610> as<00:00:47.760> soon

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
them out before they go to seed as soon

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.310 
them out before they go to seed as soon
as<00:00:48.059> they<00:00:48.180> look<00:00:48.360> tacky<00:00:48.600> you're<00:00:48.870> chopping<00:00:49.200> them

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
as they look tacky you're chopping them

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.740 
as they look tacky you're chopping them
out<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:50.520> I'm<00:00:50.610> kind<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.879> just<00:00:50.940> pulling<00:00:51.510> these

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
out so I'm kind of just pulling these

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.479 
out so I'm kind of just pulling these
out<00:00:52.020> that's<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.500> good<00:00:52.649> way<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> do<00:00:53.129> it

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
out that's a good way to do it

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.880 
out that's a good way to do it
I've<00:00:54.090> got<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.480> agapanthus<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.620> done

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
I've got this agapanthus it's done

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.189 
I've got this agapanthus it's done
blooming<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.730> color<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.210> gone<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.840> making

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
blooming the color is gone it's making

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.889 
blooming the color is gone it's making
seed<00:00:58.440> pods<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> deadhead<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.600> I'm<00:01:00.719> actually

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
seed pods so to deadhead it I'm actually

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.479 
seed pods so to deadhead it I'm actually
going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.469> cut<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.980> ground<00:01:02.129> and

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
going to just cut it to the ground and

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.240 
going to just cut it to the ground and
cut<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.850> stem<00:01:03.120> out<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.719> these<00:01:04.409> are<00:01:04.470> actually

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
cut the stem out and these are actually

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.850 
cut the stem out and these are actually
seed<00:01:05.549> pods<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.720> my<00:01:06.900> rule<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.170> thumb<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.560> they're

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
seed pods so my rule of thumb is they're

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.219 
seed pods so my rule of thumb is they're
not<00:01:08.010> completely<00:01:08.580> dry<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.900> there's<00:01:10.080> still

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
not completely dry but there's still

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.560 
not completely dry but there's still
seeds<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.830> there<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.670> instead<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.420> throwing

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
seeds in there so instead of throwing

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.719 
seeds in there so instead of throwing
them<00:01:12.720> away<00:01:12.900> what<00:01:13.439> I've<00:01:13.560> done<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.460> cut

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
them away what I've done to is just cut

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.719 
them away what I've done to is just cut
them<00:01:14.880> out<00:01:15.500> I'm<00:01:16.500> cutting<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.890> greens<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.400> and

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
them out I'm cutting the greens out and

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.880 
them out I'm cutting the greens out and
I'm<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.509> letting<00:01:18.720> those<00:01:18.960> seeds<00:01:19.290> drop<00:01:19.619> back

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
I'm just letting those seeds drop back

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.789 
I'm just letting those seeds drop back
down<00:01:20.159> by<00:01:20.520> my<00:01:20.729> agapanthus<00:01:21.180> or<00:01:21.210> Lily<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.590> Nile

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
down by my agapanthus or Lily the Nile

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.170 
down by my agapanthus or Lily the Nile
and<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.070> lot<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.220> times<00:01:23.520> they'll<00:01:23.790> start<00:01:24.060> new

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and a lot of times they'll start new

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.690 
and a lot of times they'll start new
starts<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.810> way<00:01:25.070> same<00:01:26.070> with<00:01:26.250> my<00:01:26.400> calla

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
starts that way same with my calla

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.240 
starts that way same with my calla
lilies<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.450> lot<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.110> times<00:01:28.320> towards<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> end<00:01:29.130> of

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
lilies a lot of times towards the end of

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.280 
lilies a lot of times towards the end of
the<00:01:29.369> blooming<00:01:29.729> cycle<00:01:30.270> you'll<00:01:30.869> get<00:01:31.110> what's

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
the blooming cycle you'll get what's

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.310 
the blooming cycle you'll get what's
called<00:01:31.530> seed<00:01:31.920> pods<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.460> these<00:01:33.390> actually<00:01:33.780> are

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
called seed pods and these actually are

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.120 
called seed pods and these actually are
pods<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.460> bulbs<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.990> I'm<00:01:37.140> deadheading<00:01:37.409> but<00:01:38.009> I'm

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
pods of bulbs so I'm deadheading but I'm

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.149 
pods of bulbs so I'm deadheading but I'm
actually<00:01:38.369> saving<00:01:39.060> these<00:01:39.390> seed<00:01:39.689> pods<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.380> so

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
actually saving these seed pods and so

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.249 
actually saving these seed pods and so
my<00:01:41.520> rule<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.759> thumb<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.509> don't<00:01:42.659> usually<00:01:42.960> hold

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
my rule of thumb is I don't usually hold

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.109 
my rule of thumb is I don't usually hold
anything<00:01:43.590> because<00:01:44.009> I'm<00:01:44.159> too<00:01:44.490> busy<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.939> deal

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
anything because I'm too busy to deal

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.569 
anything because I'm too busy to deal
with<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.450> later<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.409> will<00:01:46.799> turn<00:01:46.950> around<00:01:47.100> as

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
with it later so I will turn around as

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.840 
with it later so I will turn around as
soon<00:01:47.729> as<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.939> deadhead<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.630> plant<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.850> seed

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
soon as I deadhead and plant that seed

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.810 
soon as I deadhead and plant that seed
pod<00:01:51.119> back<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> ground<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.979> might<00:01:53.430> not<00:01:53.670> do

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
pod back in the ground it might not do

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.219 
pod back in the ground it might not do
anything<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.390> few<00:01:54.540> years<00:01:54.810> but<00:01:55.079> eventually

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
anything for a few years but eventually

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.260 
anything for a few years but eventually
it<00:01:55.890> will<00:01:55.920> grow<00:01:56.340> that's<00:01:56.700> what<00:01:56.880> I've<00:01:57.000> always

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
it will grow that's what I've always

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.690 
it will grow that's what I've always
been<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.570> amazed<00:01:57.899> about<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.530> same<00:01:59.280> with<00:01:59.460> these

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
been so amazed about the same with these

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.080 
been so amazed about the same with these
canna<00:02:00.630> lilies<00:02:01.049> they're<00:02:01.740> done<00:02:02.009> blooming<00:02:02.219> but

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
canna lilies they're done blooming but

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.270 
canna lilies they're done blooming but
the<00:02:03.210> stem<00:02:03.479> right<00:02:03.509> here<00:02:03.780> looks<00:02:04.530> tacky<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.219> I'm

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
the stem right here looks tacky so I'm

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.160 
the stem right here looks tacky so I'm
just<00:02:05.430> chopping<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.210> where<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.689> leaf<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
just chopping it to where the leaf is a

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.889 
just chopping it to where the leaf is a
leaf<00:02:07.530> still<00:02:07.799> healthy<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.879> again<00:02:09.330> I've<00:02:09.569> got<00:02:09.720> all

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
leaf still healthy so again I've got all

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.470 
leaf still healthy so again I've got all
these<00:02:10.050> little<00:02:10.289> seed<00:02:10.679> pods<00:02:10.849> so<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:11.879> could<00:02:12.360> just

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
these little seed pods so I could just

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.230 
these little seed pods so I could just
clear<00:02:12.780> those

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
clear those

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.560 
clear those
out<00:02:13.330> but<00:02:13.900> again<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.760> always<00:02:15.760> gives<00:02:15.970> plants<00:02:16.330> a

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
out but again I always gives plants a

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.900 
out but again I always gives plants a
chance<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:17.080> grow<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:17.650> I'm<00:02:17.740> actually<00:02:17.950> cutting

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
chance to grow so I'm actually cutting

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.700 
chance to grow so I'm actually cutting
the<00:02:19.240> seeds<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:19.960> could<00:02:20.140> save<00:02:20.410> them<00:02:20.590> and

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
the seeds and I could save them and

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.140 
the seeds and I could save them and
plant<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.040> next<00:02:21.310> spring<00:02:21.610> or<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:21.940> could<00:02:22.120> throw

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
plant a next spring or I could throw

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.340 
plant a next spring or I could throw
them<00:02:22.360> in<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.510> ground<00:02:22.750> now

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
them in the ground now

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.560 
them in the ground now
but<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.070> kind<00:02:24.610> of<00:02:24.640> just<00:02:24.700> take<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.180> seeds<00:02:25.450> and

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
but I kind of just take the seeds and

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.210 
but I kind of just take the seeds and
sprinkle<00:02:26.050> them<00:02:26.110> around<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:26.680> over<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.920> years

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
sprinkle them around and over the years

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.040 
sprinkle them around and over the years
I<00:02:27.370> find<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.760> get<00:02:27.910> lots<00:02:28.120> more<00:02:28.270> plants<00:02:28.810> in<00:02:28.930> the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
I find I get lots more plants in the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.920 
I find I get lots more plants in the
future<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.760> lot<00:02:30.910> of<00:02:31.000> times<00:02:31.180> when<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.420> deadhead

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
future so a lot of times when I deadhead

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.620 
future so a lot of times when I deadhead
too<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.920> know<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.520> still<00:02:33.790> blooming<00:02:34.390> but

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
too you know this is still blooming but

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.210 
too you know this is still blooming but
it<00:02:34.720> just<00:02:34.870> kind<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.260> fallen<00:02:35.680> over<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:35.920> looks<00:02:36.130> a

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
it just kind of fallen over and looks a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.500 
it just kind of fallen over and looks a
little<00:02:36.280> bit<00:02:36.490> tacky<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.030> I'm<00:02:37.120> actually<00:02:37.270> going

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
little bit tacky so I'm actually going

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.750 
little bit tacky so I'm actually going
to<00:02:37.570> cut<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.930> out<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.350> these<00:02:39.070> too<00:02:39.490> a<00:02:39.520> lot<00:02:39.670> of

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
to cut it out and these too a lot of

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.520 
to cut it out and these too a lot of
times<00:02:39.940> just<00:02:40.150> by<00:02:40.390> straighten<00:02:41.260> them<00:02:41.380> out<00:02:41.470> a

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
times just by straighten them out a

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.380 
times just by straighten them out a
little<00:02:41.740> bit<00:02:41.980> they'll<00:02:42.400> look<00:02:42.550> a<00:02:42.670> lot<00:02:42.850> better<00:02:43.030> and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
little bit they'll look a lot better and

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.710 
little bit they'll look a lot better and
they<00:02:43.900> won't<00:02:44.170> fall<00:02:44.440> over<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.640> so<00:02:46.060> it's<00:02:46.510> not

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
they won't fall over and so it's not

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.660 
they won't fall over and so it's not
necessarily<00:02:46.780> just<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.770> blooms<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.370> cut

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
necessarily just the blooms that I cut

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.580 
necessarily just the blooms that I cut
out<00:02:48.850> anything<00:02:49.210> that<00:02:49.390> turns<00:02:49.780> brown<00:02:50.110> or<00:02:50.410> looks

everything<00:03:28.120> I'll<00:03:28.360> find<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.350> it<00:03:29.500> just<00:03:29.530> looks

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
everything I'll find that it just looks

everything I'll find that it just looks
better<00:03:30.070> and<00:03:30.400> I<00:03:31.030> do<00:03:31.090> this<00:03:31.330> only<00:03:31.570> maybe<00:03:31.900> every

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
once or twice a month and it seems to

once or twice a month and it seems to
make<00:03:35.560> all<00:03:35.740> the<00:03:35.890> difference<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.490> it<00:03:36.640> makes<00:03:36.880> it

make all the difference and it makes it

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.640 
make all the difference and it makes it
a<00:03:37.150> lot<00:03:37.300> easier<00:03:37.510> task<00:03:37.960> at<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.230> end<00:03:38.470> of<00:03:38.560> the
