00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.039
 hello good afternoon I faced the bloc 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.880
 talk today 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.579
 and a subject that I am half worried about a while ago in relation to 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:11.329
 the women that we work 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:12.489
 percent 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:14.969
 percent I think he played when 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.990
 as well as that the people of umbria without that I emphasize that women 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.029
 We have a good reputation and well deserved for being 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.849
 responsible female workers dedicated to these legal 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:28.890
 social in general 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.310
 I also want the lack of models that we have had in general 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.720
 they are not the ones that are older than I but also young people 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.320
 so sometimes I end up not very clear 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.840
 as an element of comfort to not feel very good work in the physical 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.220
 as I say behave, I mean 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.359
 but sometimes 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.939
 in an effort to be demos to the professionals you would go 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.600
 responsible june 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.450
 I do not think so 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.140
 we leave aside two things that are vital 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.850
 our charisma 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.130
 english humanity 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.200
 I always hear in ancient Rome that women today when they work are 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.250
 very hard 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.690
 that maybe the most difficult boss that 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.640
 we are complicated 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.680
 I was doing 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.120
 percent hit us speeches 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.840
 in the past 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.899
 If I still want what the differences are worth, the time has already passed. 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.429
 we women have to prove them that we could or that they had to be so 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:26.850
 good as men 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.020
 also that almost 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.560
 to destinations like them or 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.180
 I think he hears 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.090
 we are also two strips that we can not give the best aerocares 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.970
 show us how we are in gaza 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.710
 and is that humanity is something that that mind what they mentioned 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.160
 by thirteen people and 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.810
 the inm a few weeks ago 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.299
 defining a criminal and a family theme of the busy student 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.290
 I discussed it with close collaborators 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.920
 i him some drawer many years 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.090
 i 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.440
 insulza said 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.810
 my son 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.890
 I did not know what was so wrong 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.139
 millennium what fell on me like a bucket of cold water and egypt 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.269
 this hotel as you can see 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.420
 and nothing apparently the office would be presented and informal 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.430
 a deal does not mix the personal with the no 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.029
 It worked and monagas distances and respect great respect 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:24.619
 this made his counselors 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:26.069
 why that simple 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.259
 that we do not leave transmitted truly 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:33.009
 the sensitivity we have was in our fragile side 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.249
 the prelates baby why not 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:39.409
 women like men as shermer electra grow up bad moments 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.269
 and that does not make us any less good boss - good employees workers 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.469
 and I think that on the contrary shows he achieved complete in this dimension 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.989
 human and pti 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.439
 Argentines is much more and as a person much more interesting as leaders 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.929
 and there's who more to teach and to show 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:03:01.139
 then this will be one of the lots I was passing was like a dog 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.709
 he listened to his several people before and he happens to us with women especially so 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.959
 that located a suggestion recommendation to young calama 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.849
 show all yours 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.670
 and what do we do if we have no tantrum or attacks from the new one that does not 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.010
 it's worth it, no crying or anything, but it's completely natural 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.959
 the one who suffered conflict 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.959
 and at the same time he has more than 40 like me 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.299
 I believe that india already demonstrated who we are and we know who we are 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.399
 today we have to worry more about each other 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:37.679
 and that they know that they are not provocations to 103 years 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:39.619
 thanks to this peace
