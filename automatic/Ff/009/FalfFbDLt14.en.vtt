00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.840
 once awake I look around 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.310
 and he saw a corrupt cave like the other 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.100
 only that it seemed to have swallowed 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.860
 a house maybe that was formerly 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.140
 a town I did not know and decided 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.290
 continue exploring until you reached 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.260
 a kind of well that exuded a 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.850
 black magic 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:34.930
 suddenly something exploded in the distance 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.930
 Jon again took a look 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.280
 the house had exploded leaving the 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:52.100
 discovered an exit and there while 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.680
 he went up was the first time he saw him 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.600
 It was only a second but I thought 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.939
 have seen a person who looked at him and 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.750
 he was leaving so he had no other 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.750
 back home 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.890
 so many emotions so many efforts 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.720
 they had left physically and mentally 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.390
 Exhausted 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.550
 and above the rain was not something nice 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.550
 and that it was very cold on campus 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.670
 John dreamed of the warmth of his home and 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.670
 with sleeping in his bed 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:36.730
 a little was already missing to get to his house 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.730
 but when he arrived he realized something 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.700
 his house had also been destroyed by 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.700
 corruption 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.840
 Although the bed was still standing, I could not 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.879
 Rest in the open in the rain 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.450
 so there was no other 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:03:01.140
 Jon decided to go to rest at the farm 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.790
 that his parents had been a farm 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.099
 that had been taken from them 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.880
 a long time for the traitors of the 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.160
 willow family 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.130
 it was not a nice place and obviously to 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.530
 I did not like it since those people 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.820
 he had rejected and cheated his 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.820
 parents a long time ago 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.329
 but I really needed to sleep 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.609
 he needed to clarify his ideas that was 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.099
 everything I had seen that was what 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.109
 happened in that place the reason of the 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.750
 corruption the reason of the sounds 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.790
 strangers who was that strange person 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.350
 I had seen going up while 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.290
 I was trying to escape from the cave 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.080
 that was that the well the questions 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.110
 they assaulted the mind of jong but the mind 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.980
 lesson only thought of one thing and that 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.980
 thing was sleeping 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.599
 all he needed now was 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.500
 get into a bed and sleep 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:03.680
 as much as I could 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.930
 maybe I would dream like before falling into 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.930
 that strange cave I did not know 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.550
 he was so sleepy that he seemed to see 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.910
 things that were not there where the 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:20.720
 people that was a cow that happened to 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.109
 the most cows houses this was not a 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.109
 farm 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.919
 the rain kept falling and the only thing 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.919
 what could he think was 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.330
 they say that when you are inside a 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.760
 nightmare you see the world from the eyes of 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.710
 another person 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.820
 that was what was happening to 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.820
 john at that time 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.220
 the rain fell heavily in front of 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.700
 his eyes and prevented him from advancing to great 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.009
 speed because everything was so slow 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.409
 It was what was happening 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.999
 suddenly John realized that 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.740
 I was in the cave where I had 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:07.289
 been recently 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.180
 the corrupt stone was different than how 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.720
 you saw the normal stone 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.250
 the well again 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.250
 and then I had crossed it 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.620
 what was happening 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.810
 because the world looked so black or 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.370
 maybe that was another world 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.370
 I could only do one thing 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.620
 the bad dream was over but the 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.740
 nightmare had not done anything more than 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.740
 start 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:47.280
 I knew I should look for answers 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.280
 look for those responsible for this 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.700
 maybe right now you think he was the 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.009
 responsible by unleashing the madness of the 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:58.460
 corruption in that cave 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.530
 I knew that no 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.930
 the day that I had seen that 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.960
 corruption in the village next to the 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.180
 willow farm why that was now headed 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.520
 towards there 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.610
 although there was something that I had not seen 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.660
 long ago a ray of light that appeared 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.660
 in the middle of the town 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.950
 Jon intrigued that he should look 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.100
 to the person responsible for this 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.640
 And it seems 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.640
 he found 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.590
 you should not be here 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.960
