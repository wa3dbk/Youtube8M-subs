00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
kind of a dare up front we've done a

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.180 
kind of a dare up front we've done a
couple<00:00:17.870> of<00:00:17.990> vehicles<00:00:18.380> in<00:00:18.500> the<00:00:18.560> past<00:00:18.770> most

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.190 
couple of vehicles in the past most

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.519

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
notably the new Kaiser and then the J 12

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.759 
notably the new Kaiser and then the J 12
truck<00:00:21.859> where<00:00:22.550> we<00:00:22.760> we<00:00:23.240> grafted<00:00:23.720> on<00:00:23.900> the

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
truck where we we grafted on the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.540 
truck where we we grafted on the
full-size<00:00:25.039> look<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:26.179> front<00:00:26.480> end<00:00:26.660> onto<00:00:26.960> a

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
full-size look the front end onto a

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.730 
full-size look the front end onto a
Wrangler<00:00:28.720> Wranglers<00:00:29.720> grown<00:00:30.080> big<00:00:30.320> enough<00:00:30.349> in

Wrangler Wranglers grown big enough in

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.010 
Wrangler Wranglers grown big enough in
size<00:00:30.949> and<00:00:31.460> I<00:00:31.699> think<00:00:31.939> we<00:00:32.060> we<00:00:32.480> hit<00:00:32.660> a<00:00:32.689> sweet<00:00:32.960> spot

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
size and I think we we hit a sweet spot

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.490 
size and I think we we hit a sweet spot
where<00:00:33.260> that<00:00:33.470> kind<00:00:33.830> of<00:00:33.980> works<00:00:34.930> the<00:00:35.930> response<00:00:36.320> to

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
where that kind of works the response to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.030 
where that kind of works the response to
those<00:00:36.620> first<00:00:36.830> two<00:00:37.040> vehicles<00:00:37.460> was<00:00:37.670> so<00:00:37.880> so<00:00:38.390> great

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
those first two vehicles was so so great

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.680 
those first two vehicles was so so great
this<00:00:40.040> was<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.430> natural<00:00:40.550> progression<00:00:40.850> let's

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
this was the natural progression let's

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.570 
this was the natural progression let's
do<00:00:41.810> that<00:00:41.960> let's<00:00:42.230> go<00:00:42.350> on<00:00:42.500> do<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:42.890> full<00:00:43.070> Cherokee

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
do that let's go on do the full Cherokee

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.910 
do that let's go on do the full Cherokee
so<00:00:43.940> this<00:00:44.120> is<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.300> first<00:00:44.480> time<00:00:44.660> we've<00:00:44.810> done

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
so this is the first time we've done

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.380 
so this is the first time we've done
what's<00:00:45.920> called<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.220> razor<00:00:46.430> grill<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.090> 20

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
what's called the razor grill the 20

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.600 
what's called the razor grill the 20
slaughter<00:00:47.830> and<00:00:48.830> really<00:00:49.160> if<00:00:49.280> you<00:00:49.370> think<00:00:49.550> about

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
slaughter and really if you think about

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.610 
slaughter and really if you think about
where<00:00:50.030> we<00:00:50.150> went<00:00:50.630> with<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:50.900> Cherokee<00:00:51.380> their
