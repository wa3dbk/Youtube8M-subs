00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509 
all set up and I already started drawing

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.480 
all set up and I already started drawing
something<00:00:12.080> here<00:00:12.639> which<00:00:13.639> is<00:00:13.790> a<00:00:13.820> cat<00:00:15.279> and<00:00:16.279> I've

something here which is a cat and I've
got<00:00:16.610> to<00:00:16.700> say<00:00:16.849> that<00:00:16.970> this<00:00:17.149> this<00:00:17.750> model<00:00:18.380> is<00:00:18.739> much

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
got to say that this this model is much

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.220 
got to say that this this model is much
different<00:00:19.460> than<00:00:19.520> the<00:00:19.730> entry<00:00:20.599> was<00:00:20.720> for<00:00:21.020> is

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
different than the entry was for is

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.970 
different than the entry was for is
because<00:00:21.470> it<00:00:21.710> has<00:00:21.890> the<00:00:22.189> the<00:00:23.149> old<00:00:23.739> Express<00:00:24.739> keys

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
because it has the the old Express keys

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.429 
because it has the the old Express keys
like<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.340> interest<00:00:25.759> 3<00:00:26.000> with<00:00:26.779> the<00:00:26.809> zoom<00:00:27.110> in<00:00:27.320> on

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
like the interest 3 with the zoom in on

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.609 
like the interest 3 with the zoom in on
this<00:00:27.619> side<00:00:27.829> and<00:00:28.340> it<00:00:28.849> has<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:29.059> same<00:00:29.619> Express

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619

this side and it has the same Express
keys<00:00:30.770> over<00:00:30.919> here<00:00:31.340> so<00:00:32.300> that<00:00:32.450> way<00:00:32.599> if<00:00:32.780> left

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
keys over here so that way if left

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.310 
keys over here so that way if left
hannah<00:00:33.200> you<00:00:33.350> could<00:00:33.560> draw<00:00:33.860> with<00:00:34.070> this<00:00:34.250> hand<00:00:34.580> and

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
hannah you could draw with this hand and

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.040 
hannah you could draw with this hand and
you<00:00:36.320> use<00:00:36.800> Express<00:00:37.190> keys<00:00:37.460> on<00:00:37.640> this<00:00:37.790> side<00:00:38.000> but<00:00:38.690> if

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
you're right handed like me you use this

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.090 
you're right handed like me you use this
side<00:00:41.360> for<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.140> Express<00:00:42.440> keys<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:42.890> you<00:00:42.950> should

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
side for the Express keys and you should

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.450 
side for the Express keys and you should
use<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:44.240> right<00:00:44.510> hand<00:00:44.750> to<00:00:44.930> draw<00:00:45.220> this<00:00:46.220> has<00:00:46.430> a

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
use the right hand to draw this has a

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.130 
use the right hand to draw this has a
stand<00:00:46.910> on<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:47.270> back<00:00:49.240> and<00:00:50.240> if<00:00:50.390> I<00:00:50.480> put<00:00:50.720> the<00:00:50.750> stand

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
stand on the back and if I put the stand

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:02.440 
stand on the back and if I put the stand
down<00:00:54.040> that<00:00:55.040> I<00:00:57.610> can<00:00:59.410> rotate<00:01:01.060> because<00:01:02.060> it<00:01:02.300> has<00:01:02.420> a

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
down that I can rotate because it has a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.479 
down that I can rotate because it has a
rotate<00:01:02.930> module<00:01:03.649> on<00:01:03.770> the<00:01:03.890> back<00:01:04.100> with<00:01:04.280> it<00:01:04.399> I

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
rotate module on the back with it I

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:04.719 
rotate module on the back with it I
guess

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
guess

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.310 
guess
oh<00:01:06.700> yeah<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:07.760> has<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:07.909> little<00:01:08.120> circle<00:01:08.540> thing<00:01:09.080> on

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
oh yeah it has a little circle thing on

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.050 
oh yeah it has a little circle thing on
the<00:01:09.380> back<00:01:09.560> you<00:01:10.190> could<00:01:10.310> just<00:01:10.520> rotate<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:10.970> if

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
the back you could just rotate it if

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.820 
the back you could just rotate it if
you're<00:01:11.210> on<00:01:12.490> you<00:01:13.490> know<00:01:14.409> you<00:01:15.409> want<00:01:15.470> to<00:01:15.680> make<00:01:15.800> a

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
you're on you know you want to make a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.370 
you're on you know you want to make a
little<00:01:16.070> angle<00:01:16.490> over<00:01:16.610> here<00:01:16.970> or<00:01:17.090> something

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.640 

you<00:01:22.980> need<00:01:23.160> a<00:01:23.190> turn<00:01:23.520> either<00:01:23.550> side<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.480> like<00:01:24.650> get

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
you need a turn either side to like get

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.740 
you need a turn either side to like get
a<00:01:25.680> certain<00:01:26.040> future<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.760> the<00:01:26.880> nose<00:01:29.330> or<00:01:30.330> if<00:01:30.600> you

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
if you're sitting down you could use a

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.880 
if you're sitting down you could use a
tablet<00:01:33.450> much<00:01:33.720> easier<00:01:34.130> without<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.490> stand<00:01:36.890> you
