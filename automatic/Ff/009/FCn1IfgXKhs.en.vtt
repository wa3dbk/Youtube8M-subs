you what do you want to start with
Heather<00:00:17.730> well<00:00:18.359> there<00:00:18.810> are<00:00:18.840> several<00:00:19.109> different

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
Heather well there are several different

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.990 
Heather well there are several different
modes<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.250> don't<00:00:20.460> know<00:00:20.580> which<00:00:20.699> mode<00:00:20.970> I

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
modes and I don't know which mode I

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.060 
modes and I don't know which mode I
should<00:00:21.359> use<00:00:21.539> what<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.740> difference

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
should use what is the difference

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.929 
should use what is the difference
between<00:00:23.189> p.s<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.779> am<00:00:25.080> well<00:00:25.680> M<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.460> manual

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
between p.s a and am well M is manual

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.900 
between p.s a and am well M is manual
mode<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.230> called<00:00:28.500> manual<00:00:28.980> because<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
mode it is called manual because you the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.060 
mode it is called manual because you the
photographer<00:00:30.689> choose<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.470> shutter<00:00:31.740> speed

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
photographer choose the shutter speed

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.510 
photographer choose the shutter speed
and<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.430> aperture<00:00:33.000> what<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> shutter

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
and the aperture what is a shutter

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.240 
and the aperture what is a shutter
seriously<00:00:35.520> ok<00:00:36.510> let's<00:00:36.989> back<00:00:37.290> up<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.860> second

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
seriously ok let's back up for a second

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.580 
seriously ok let's back up for a second
and<00:00:38.340> cover<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.790> basics<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.450> how<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.930> photograph

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
and cover the basics of how a photograph

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.610 
and cover the basics of how a photograph
is<00:00:40.800> made<00:00:41.070> there<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.210> three<00:00:42.480> components<00:00:42.899> that

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
is made there are three components that

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.830 
is made there are three components that
each<00:00:43.800> play<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> part<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.910> creating<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.719> is

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
each play a part in creating what is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.440 
each play a part in creating what is
called<00:00:46.140> an<00:00:46.289> exposure<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:47.670> called<00:00:48.000> exposure

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
called an exposure it's called exposure

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.080 
called an exposure it's called exposure
because<00:00:49.230> when<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.620> used<00:00:49.829> film<00:00:50.250> light<00:00:50.789> came

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
because when we used film light came

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.090 
because when we used film light came
through<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.449> lens<00:00:51.690> into<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.500> camera<00:00:52.739> and

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
through the lens into the camera and

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.270 
through the lens into the camera and
struck<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.670> film<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.590> film<00:00:55.860> was<00:00:56.039> exposed

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
struck the film so the film was exposed

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.330 
struck the film so the film was exposed
to<00:00:56.760> light<00:00:56.940> are<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.960> following<00:00:58.440> along<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.039> far

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
to light are you following along so far

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.779 
to light are you following along so far
yes<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.809> makes<00:01:01.050> sense<00:01:01.309> what<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> shutter

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
yes that makes sense what is the shutter

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.329 
yes that makes sense what is the shutter
do<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.510> shutter<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> physical<00:01:04.680> moving<00:01:05.070> part

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
do the shutter is a physical moving part

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.880 
do the shutter is a physical moving part
inside<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.700> digital<00:01:06.180> SLR<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.350> most<00:01:07.590> modern

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
inside a digital SLR and on most modern

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.370 
inside a digital SLR and on most modern
cameras<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> stage<00:01:09.750> curtain<00:01:10.260> that

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
cameras it is like a stage curtain that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.130 
cameras it is like a stage curtain that
comes<00:01:10.680> down<00:01:10.890> from<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.369> top<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.790> stage<00:01:12.180> it

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
comes down from the top to the stage it

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.499 
comes down from the top to the stage it
is<00:01:13.350> closed<00:01:13.740> until<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.610> want<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.909> take<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> photo

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
is closed until you want to take a photo

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.929 
is closed until you want to take a photo
and<00:01:15.869> then<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.380> opens<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.950> brief<00:01:17.250> period<00:01:17.280> of

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
and then it opens for a brief period of

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.120 
and then it opens for a brief period of
time<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.750> let<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> lanc<00:01:19.259> pass<00:01:19.560> through<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
time to let the lanc pass through to the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.730 
time to let the lanc pass through to the
digital<00:01:20.280> sensor<00:01:20.850> behind<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.600> allows<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
digital sensor behind it that allows the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.260 
digital sensor behind it that allows the
sensor<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.369> record<00:01:23.759> all<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.119> light

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
sensor to record all of the light

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.999 
sensor to record all of the light
information<00:01:24.960> passing<00:01:25.439> through<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> lens

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
information passing through the lens

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.940 
information passing through the lens
great<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.659> light<00:01:28.200> comes<00:01:28.470> through<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.770> lens

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
great so light comes through the lens

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.800 
great so light comes through the lens
and<00:01:29.100> shines<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.700> cameras<00:01:30.060> digital<00:01:30.360> sensor

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
and shines on the cameras digital sensor

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.679 
and shines on the cameras digital sensor
when<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> shutter<00:01:31.290> opens<00:01:31.680> got<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.729> what<00:01:33.570> is

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
when the shutter opens got it what is

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.020 
when the shutter opens got it what is
the<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> mode<00:01:34.140> used<00:01:34.409> for<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> mode<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.759> called

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
the a mode used for the a mode is called

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.690 
the a mode used for the a mode is called
aperture<00:01:36.659> priority<00:01:36.900> mode<00:01:37.280> do<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.369> know<00:01:38.520> what

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
aperture priority mode do you know what

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.719 
aperture priority mode do you know what
an<00:01:38.820> aperture<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.479> um<00:01:39.780> no<00:01:40.470> does<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.520> make<00:01:41.700> me

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
an aperture is um no does that make me

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.899 
an aperture is um no does that make me
stupid<00:01:42.060> well<00:01:42.810> yes<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:44.070> you're<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> hot<00:01:44.549> blonde

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
stupid well yes but you're a hot blonde

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.420 
stupid well yes but you're a hot blonde
in<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.180> tiny<00:01:45.390> pink<00:01:45.750> dress<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.979> makes<00:01:47.220> up

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
in a tiny pink dress so that makes up

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.600 
in a tiny pink dress so that makes up
for<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.759> let's<00:01:48.570> keep<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:49.229> an<00:01:49.890> aperture<00:01:50.460> is

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
for it let's keep going an aperture is

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.639 
for it let's keep going an aperture is
the<00:01:50.759> opening<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.299> lens<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:52.140> lets<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
the opening in the lens that lets the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.010

light<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.729> come<00:02:05.969> through<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:07.049> will<00:02:07.170> talk

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
light can come through we will talk

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.169 
light can come through we will talk
about<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.829> when<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.250> choose<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.489> larger<00:02:09.000> or

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
about the when to choose a larger or

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.570 
about the when to choose a larger or
smaller<00:02:09.209> aperture<00:02:10.080> later<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:11.370> all

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
smaller aperture later is this all

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.630 
smaller aperture later is this all
making<00:02:11.849> sense<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:12.510> far<00:02:12.540> hunts

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
making sense so far hunts

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.809 
making sense so far hunts
yes<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:15.260> we<00:02:15.710> have<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> shudder<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.430> lets<00:02:16.610> light

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
yes so we have a shudder that lets light

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.550 
yes so we have a shudder that lets light
hit<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.120> sensor<00:02:17.420> for<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.660> specific<00:02:17.930> amount<00:02:18.410> of

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
hit the sensor for a specific amount of

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.320 
hit the sensor for a specific amount of
time<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:19.130> we<00:02:19.370> have<00:02:19.520> an<00:02:19.640> opening<00:02:19.940> in<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.090> lens

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
time and we have an opening in the lens

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.510 
time and we have an opening in the lens
that<00:02:20.720> lets<00:02:20.900> light<00:02:21.140> through<00:02:21.380> but<00:02:22.160> why<00:02:22.310> is<00:02:22.370> it

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
that lets light through but why is it

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.320 
that lets light through but why is it
called<00:02:22.700> aperture<00:02:23.209> priority<00:02:23.420> mode

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330

the<00:02:25.990> priority<00:02:26.290> means<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.100> since<00:02:27.460> you<00:02:27.700> chose

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
the priority means that since you chose

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.480 
the priority means that since you chose

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
makes sense however you said there were

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.520 
makes sense however you said there were

a second and you change the ISO to 400
the<00:03:31.690> sensor<00:03:32.140> is<00:03:32.290> now<00:03:32.500> twice<00:03:32.860> as<00:03:33.130> sensitive<00:03:33.370> so

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
the sensor is now twice as sensitive so

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.210 
the sensor is now twice as sensitive so
the<00:03:34.300> shutter<00:03:34.540> only<00:03:34.930> needs<00:03:35.140> to<00:03:35.350> stay<00:03:35.590> open<00:03:35.800> for

the shutter only needs to stay open for

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.270 
the shutter only needs to stay open for
half<00:03:36.400> of<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.760> time<00:03:37.050> so<00:03:38.050> it<00:03:38.500> will<00:03:38.739> only<00:03:38.920> stay

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
half of the time so it will only stay

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.430 
half of the time so it will only stay
