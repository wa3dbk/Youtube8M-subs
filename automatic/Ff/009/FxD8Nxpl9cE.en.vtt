 message to the nation the auto president 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.700
 perez molina compatriots the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.679
 recent events have produced 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.860
 a generalized feeling of 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.719
 discontent and social protest that have 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.600
 mobilized different sectors of the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.150
 Guatemalan society in the city and in 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.340
 the interior of the country with the demand for 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.949
 reforms to different laws and 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.680
 purging the political class and the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.710
 three powers of the state ignore the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.530
 manifest demands of the population in 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.829
 its citizen exercise expressed in the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.770
 current situation at the national level is a 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.890
 high risk the higher end is 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.950
 protect the institutionality and 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.449
 advance in the urgent transformations 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.879
 in the political legal and administrative the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.059
 citizen outrage is focused without 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.899
 doubt that the public treasury is seen 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.149
 like a booty from which they take advantage 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.760
 officials and authorities 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.780
 unscrupulous in the previous sense the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.390
 Friday 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.520
 the public prosecutor and the cicig 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.590
 they made serious accusations that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.890
 They intend to link me with the case 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.580
 known as the line and requested a 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.479
 Prejudice against my person is more 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.670
 they place as the head of the structure 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.670
 he categorically stated that he rejected my 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.729
 connection to it and having 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.700
 received any money from that operation 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.869
 from fraud to gift was my conscience 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.869
 in that sense he is calm I will give the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.800
 face and I will demonstrate in front of the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.960
 institutionality that in law corresponds 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.229
 through due process that I have not 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.690
 been part and much less recipient of 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.960
 those ill-gotten funds to the detriment of the 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.600
 Guatemalan people understand the logic of 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.909
 the prosecutors but I want you to understand 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.780
 all the people of Guatemala that there is no 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.750
 one line is two and so far 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.140
 appeared the one that receives but not the one that 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.590
 pay no doubt rooted in the sector 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.920
 business and that I hope will soon appear 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.380
 in all its magnitude since the same 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.970
 investigations indicate its character 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.190
 historical however the facts are the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.670
 facts and with the same strength and 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.040
 character with which I deny my connection 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.380
 I can stop recognizing that this has 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.290
 happened in my government and by 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.110
 nearby officials or those you designate 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.920
 this forces me to ask for an apology 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.190
 public and to say what is born from the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.160
 bottom of my heart to apologize to the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.950
 Guatemalans on the other hand is not 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.970
 acceptable that in guatemala is intended 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.300
 install an interventionist strategy 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:07.080
 which aims to dictate to us that 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.610
 do not do and break democracy if a 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.100
 certain sectors of the community 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.220
 international and some power groups 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.579
 of the country do not seem appropriate 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.530
 candidates to lead Guatemala first 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.230
 they should still do 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.290
 side their particular interests and by 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.590
 end see for the interest of the people and the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.870
 Guatemalan nation will undoubtedly have the 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.319
 opportunity to objectively audit 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.260
 to the next government today that I receive the 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.510
 political and media attack of these 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.770
 groups tell them that I will assume my 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.510
 responsibility and I will accept the law but 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.330
 if something positive we have from the 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.450
 events is that guatemala change 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.880
 and that change has to ensure that the law 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.880
 is for everyone equally without distinction 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.239
 some independently of the 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.970
 political conjuncture in our country what 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.830
 important is that you do not break the order and 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.250
 the democratic tradition of our 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.700
 people the citizenship must understand 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:15.200
 that the only legal way to choose 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:19.290
 its authorities is by way of the vote 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.680
 conscious and responsible for each and every 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.200
 one of the citizens 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.190
 compatriots I call on you to 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.180
 manifest 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.280
 in all its strength that deep guatemala 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.720
 the social organizations that 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.180
 rural guatemala that has been in the 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.850
 center of my attention is to guatemala 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.800
 plural and diverse I see them today as 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.350
 never to defend our incipient 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.680
 democracy to look with optimism the future 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.200
 and do the deep transformations 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.760
 of the state that will open the way to 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.620
 a more secure, fairer guatemala more 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.460
 transparent more participatory and more 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:03.330
 prosperous in that perspective and in that end 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:07.020
 I assure you that I will not resign and 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.780
 that with all fortitude I will face and 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.900
 I will subject to the processes that in law 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.020
 Good evening, good God! 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.020
 bless
