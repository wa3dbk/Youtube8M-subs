 weeks specifically moves 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.769

 good foundation and during these new 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.349
 weeks we have prepared and defined 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.509
 so you can opt for that cover of 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.640
 agreement then what we will do now 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.439
 given some basic guidelines of what 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.029
 has done during this time so that 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.940
 have an idea and then we'll see it from 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.220
 According to the diet, I have done it by going down 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.870
 hydrates professionally as he has 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.850

 his super detail of your mouth also the 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.830
 body ssa was correct we could 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.979
 do it progressively we have 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.229
 kept maintained by has agents 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:53.900
 according to the chicken and the fish 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:56.390
 I always pay for the white fish 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.460
 we tried to keep the tone 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.360
 muscle and we've used it fats 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.390
 like olive oil and but limiting it 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.340
 especially at the end of agreement in whole 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.000
 we used that you usually use here 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.000
 habitually 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.430
 according to ups and downs to walk 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.100
 soft after eating and working in 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.330
 super series of agreement for example the 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.210
 advances that we have spoken with 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.340
 the challenge of isma work super series 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.590
 does one muscle group does another and then 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.940
 makes a compound movement to move 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.330
 a lot of blood and to have more 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.250
 congestion and burn more gas 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.380

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.310
 prepared in a completely natural way and 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.710
 have used caffeine and want caffeine 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.170
 before you train for energy 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.370

 maximum possible muscle mass of 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.540

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.580

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.860
