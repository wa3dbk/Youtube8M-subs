00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.330
 no no 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.399
 hi friends from youtube here your friend the 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.049
 game freak and this time we go back 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:10.449
 with the sixth part of the curiosities 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.309
 of video games a section that 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:13.690
 allows gamers to know 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.910
 some curious facts about their 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.970
 favorite video games and that at the same time 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.690
 I would be interested to hear them good without more 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.750
 what to say 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.240
 let's start number one 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.250
 in super smash bros 1000 and for gamecube 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.529
 the design of the character known as 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.020
 mister game and was is actually a 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.660
 model in 3d although in the game it seems 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.730
 in 2d but from the graphic engine of the 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.040
 game makes the character does not look like 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.140
 three-dimensional but have the design 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.739
 characteristic of this character and his 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.640
 movements in 8 bits and in 2d 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.079
 differentiating it from the other characters 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.030
 in game number 2 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.339
 the main reason why both the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.199
 family and the super nintendo have a 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.570
 lever or a button to eject the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.670
 cassette was not because it took out the cartridge 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.969
 the force was bad for the game or the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.449
 rom 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.430
 in fact the lens in 264 does not have this 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.039
 lever and cartridges were removed to the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.960
 strength but that is because by being 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.330
 of nintendo thought that the consoles 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.000
 should entertain children even 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.430
 when it's over in the game cancer 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.310
 number 3 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.230
 the arcade video game king kong in a 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.170
 beginning was going to be a popeye game 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.510
 the marine mario would be popeye paolin 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.330
 it would be olive and don king kong would be raw 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.729
 but time later nintendo lost the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.650
 rights to create the game although in 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.510
 certain way the idea of ​​the characters 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.640
 he helped miyamoto for what he has not 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.229
 willing to abandon the project 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.170
 replaced the characters of popeye with 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.860
 your own characters for this game 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.990
 number 4 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.960
 in the stereo pokemon game for 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.750
 nintendo 64 elect bus was wrong 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.040
 mind made with six fingers in each hand 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.190
 very different from the other games of the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.620
 saga where it appears with five fingers what 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.979
 more curious is that in the sequel pokemon 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.420
 is and a 2 this error was not corrected 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.920
 giving them to understand that recycled in the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.190
 same skin of the game character 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.080
 last number 5 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.510
 during the development of the playstation 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.030
 2 it was planned you can update the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.600
 internal console software 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.400
 transferring data from the 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.770
 update from a memory card to 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.080
 a very similar function like the one 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.780
 used in ps x that only came out in 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.180
 Japan although this idea was implemented in 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.530
 a beginning at the end of the development are 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.770
 and chose to leave that 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.720
 feature years later this option 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.520
 inside the console was found by 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.890
 some hackers who subsequently 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.930
 They used this option to create 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.329
 the number 6 console 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.609
 the white label that has no calls in its 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.549
 chest in its initial design was going to have 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.590
 originally the nike logo on certain 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.390
 At the time, it was planned to promote 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.120
 this sports brand through this 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.879
 character but comes to the end changed the 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.950
 marks a growing design this is 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.290
 owed to a failed agreement on the part of 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.099
 the nike company although I think that with 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.520
 that design would not look very different 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.230
 number 7 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.200
 according to the crash developer 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.940
 bandicoot Mr. andy gaming commented 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.730
 in an interview that based the design and 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.800
 the personality of the neocortex doctor in 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.840
 a known warner bros character 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.210
 as brain of the vulgar caricature 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.280
 pinky and brain number 8 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.780
 in an interview it was revealed that during 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.420
 the production of that in local app 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.400
 time charles martinet the voice that 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.650
 mario represents him in their games 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.260
 asked shigeru miyamoto that he wanted to be 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.210
 the voice of the link in your next game by 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.250
 what miyamoto answered very clearly 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:45.440
 that the link would never have voice number 9 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.930
 the dreamcast logo is supposed to 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.000
 symbolizes the origin of power since the 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.940
 universe is like a vortex or more 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.160
 specifically as spiral the logo 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.110
 of the European version of the console was 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.350
 changed from the original that was colored 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.720
 orange by the blue elbow this because 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.930
 to avoid possible legal problems with 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.030
 Ball company public as they 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.290
 they used an orange spiral on their 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.420
 logo number 10 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.909
 many will assume that the name of wario 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.419
 you must invest the mario m giving 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:21.729
 as a result his alter ego the w but not 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.919
 it's just because of this case it turns out that 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:26.410
 the Japanese word for bad is war yo 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.900
 there that wario is really a 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.680
 abbreviation of wario mario that has 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.750
 this would be mario bad indeed 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.680
 same goes with luigi giving result I 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.280
 war and luigi war luigi these because of 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.260
 this adventure 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.150
 number 11 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.910
 during the development of the tenth game 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.950
 game of android angry birds rovio el 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.660
 game designer commented that the reason 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.120
 why the antagonists of the angry 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.460
 birds were pigs and were designed 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.140
 that way it was because it was based 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.320
 in the global flu epidemic 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.140
 swine ah1n1 that hit the planet in the 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.270
 year 2008 to create these characters 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.950
 in fact the green color of the hills 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.910
 it also refers to said 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:14.030
 disease number 12 in the version of 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.220
 dum to be 32x if you use chips or 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.870
 tricks to pass the game 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.390
 the game will not allow you to watch dinner 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.490
 secret of the end of the game in its place 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.090
 the game will show you a legend that 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.910
 says that two points islands and two like 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.530
 those classic computer commands 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.410
 blocking the game prevented not seeing 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.440
 nothing and the only way out of this 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.340
 screen is resisting the console 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.980
 causing that we could not see the 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.510
 secret video clip of the game this was 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.310
 done by the game programmers 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.310
 to punish all those players 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.220
 that cheat to pass the game 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.670
 number 13 the director of super smash 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.520
 bros 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.920
 masahiro sakurai hid a picture of 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.620
 your cat in a game scene like 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:01.510
 we see on screen 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:04.030
 what nice kitten number 14 the design of 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.699
 the enemies of mario in the form of a wall 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.440
 that crushes you in the game are based 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:11.199
 in the mythological creatures of folklore 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.880
 Japanese called nurikabe these 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:14.710
 creatures are said to take the form of 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.520
 a wall to deceive or trap their 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:20.160
 travelers number 15 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.979
 in street fighter the special technique of 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.310
 river well known as the hadouken is the 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:27.629
 word in Japanese to say kamehameha 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.550
 so the technique he uses 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.250
 our fighter gives a clear reference 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.240
 to the character technique ocu of the 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.240
 follow dragon ball z
