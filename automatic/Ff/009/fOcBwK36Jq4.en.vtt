00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hello friends and Sergey Mist this 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.889
 car audio school and today we will touch with 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.700
 you have such a topic how to choose a subwoofer was 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.449
 Well, it's no secret that many people buy equipment 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.000
 was up to buy the very different including 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.250
 and auto sound well because we want 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.330
 save because we want for the same 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.109
 money can be bought 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.199
 let's say there is one subwoofer 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.160
 level and subwoofer higher level 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.079
 but former consumption and today just 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.899
 talk about what you should pay 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:45.530
 attention when buying a subwoofer with hands 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:49.800
 because the thing is you can buy trash 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.489
 idle and some kind of completely left 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.100
 Well, for starters, the first thing is that the subwoofers 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.170
 important is the safety of voice coils 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.650
 and we have to check them and in this for us 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:12.240
 will help the most ordinary battery from 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:12.689
 screwdriver now tell you how and what 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.610
 Nadia 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.890
 Well, that is, imagine here with us 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.740
 there can be any battery by itself 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.700
 ordinary crown there well that is generally 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.180
 Any musa woofer have conclusions plus and 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.409
 minus 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.409
 we take the wires we catch them here 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:39.810
 and here we make this wire short 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:44.000
 touch on the coil so see x max we and 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.710
 look our subwoofer should move 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.430
 must move ie it shows 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.430
 us what 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.420
 live coils well i mean they are in 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.580
 principle not torn what is it to me 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.070
 torn off there and so on so on 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.860
 further that is what the coil wish but it 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.260
 not all the further we need 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.260
 of course a multimeter 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.280
 simple enough not 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.910
 sure it must be some kind of there 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.190
 super expensive device there 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.810
 fluke or is there some other enough 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:29.459
 here is a simple chinese multimeter for 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:31.170
 150 rubles we insert probes but the same 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.800
 the very thing we did with the battery but 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.310
 now we need to know the resistance 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:43.730
 these coils 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:48.480
 yes that is, we take probes and put here 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.790
 here and see what we get well 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.510
 naturally we are here we have 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.060
 scale see here 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.980
 resistance put up here it is this scale 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.560
 and circled yes that is what we put well 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.930
 what we expect resistance to up to 200 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.239
 m naturally that is, we are this one 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.409
 switch put here here well or 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.840
 similarly if you have some other 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.599
 model multimeter on what we pay 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.500
 attention if we have a valid sub with 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.790
 4 ohm coil here on 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.010
 indicator we should see approximately 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.569
 the same indicators that is there cheat 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.230
 about four he may be a little bit 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:32.230
 more may be a little bit less 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.849
 plus or minus up usually a little more 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.159
 why because it is internal 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.829
 device resistance to 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:41.170
 you just have to see the probes 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:45.400
 attach on each other we will allow you 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:48.000
 showed here 4 4 ​​ohms you took a pike each 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.470
 friend closed that is like this probes 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.569
 closed Ivan here showed there 0 4 ohms 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.900
 04 respectively here is 0 4 ohm this 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:04.690
 internal error of the device and coil 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:07.000
 here so there are four minds if the device yet 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:12.699
 one respectively if 2 ohms coil 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.849
 the date here should show 2 m 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:19.329
 suddenly you have 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:22.079
 4 ohm coil and the device shows there 1 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.079
 and 5 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.949
 208 God forbid, yes well, that is 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:31.379
 resistance is much lower than stated 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.569
 the producer is for you to be 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.819
 the alarm is most likely with 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:38.539
 coils not okay that is here 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:42.629
 it is not necessary to buy this 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:45.030
 they are not worth buying toasted if 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:50.879
 wife resistance close to the stated 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:53.490
 denomination then everything is fine so well 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:56.490
 Here we dismantled with coils and now 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.180
 it is necessary to decide what to pay 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.849
 attention when buying a subwoofer means 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.400
 watch it all be cool 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:09.060
 coils can be whole can be ringing 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.009
 and so on but not the fact that the subwoofer 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:16.439
 workable what you need to do 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:19.020
 then you need to take and try as 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:21.180
 again this is if there is no possibility of its 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.800
 enable listen yes you need to understand that 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.110
 here let's say you can't listen 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.210
 now we just hold the speaker hands 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.460
 that is, take and 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.740
 he should walk easily ie take 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.479
 just neat well i mean without there 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.500
 bad power because we can 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:39.900
 damage and take just push down 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.810
 speaker he should easily go down and 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.880
 also easily possible that is take the bottom 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.730
 here 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.230
 press it with your fingers easily and 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.080
 about the same distance 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:53.210
 walk up and down 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.340
 here at the same time should not cling anything 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.880
 nothing should crackle ie move 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.850
 must be silent ideally of course 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.130
 turn on to listen here so what 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.930
 still should pay attention look 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.490
 on the general condition 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.620
 dynamics well it is clear that some 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.870
 start to watch a magnet well how would it 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.150
 generally without cracks carries no evil not 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.430
 broken then nothing else 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.340
 there is no terrible dirt on the volume 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:24.310
 affects here pay attention here is how 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.260
 glued suspension here water pay 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:30.580
 attention to the integrity of this whole thing 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:33.340
 that is, whether somewhere in the hood does not come unstuck 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.950
 dust here this here's This 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.900
 the ring as it glued there are no gaps 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.480
 is there something loose about fingers 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.020
 felt allowed somewhere to click 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.360
 it will be at the sounds 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.820
 when working there will be snapping sounds 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.450
 be further pay attention to these 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.910
 places 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.190
 centering washer as far as she is 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.470
 glued to the basket around the circle to 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.180
 see if there is any direct try 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.950
 tempo 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:03.880
 move and yes and still pay attention 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:07.660
 here on this place there are these 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.700
 places we look yes as centering washer 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:13.140
 and pay attention to these 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:15.460
 Seats 2 washer is attached to the coil 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:18.490
 be sure to look because there are 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:21.940
 there are tears and there and so on well in general 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.950
 otherwise ideally of course necessary 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:27.880
 subwoofer listen but if suddenly not 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:30.040
 it turns out you can not 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.490
 tricky ways fast enough 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.490
 diagnose 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.240
 subwoofer performance that is 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.010
 we check coils alive and lifeless 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.390
 battery and checked resistance 

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:47.280
 Did they measure the par value? 

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:49.590
 physically inspected propelled by the engine 

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.870
 clinging nowhere crunching nowhere 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:54.780
 rubs well then everything is fine in 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:58.050
 In principle, such uncomplicated 

00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:00.720
 manipulations you can choose 

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:03.840
 ok powerful subwoofer and which 

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.330
 will please you for many years 

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.280
 strictly speaking on this i am with you 

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.170
 I say goodbye today if the video was for you 

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.300
 put your fingers on top
