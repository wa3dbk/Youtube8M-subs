way that this works is as you can see

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.819 
way that this works is as you can see
boom<00:00:56.640> there's<00:00:56.910> portal<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:58.140> goes<00:00:58.379> all<00:00:58.770> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
way over there so basically how this

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.640 
way over there so basically how this
works<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:02.719> what<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.840> do<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.229> make<00:01:04.379> a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
works is what you do is you make a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.969 
works is what you do is you make a
standard<00:01:05.280> room<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.840> then<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.960> make<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.409> little

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
standard room and then you make a little

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.890 
standard room and then you make a little
hole<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.369> wall<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.820> then<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.600> make<00:01:09.720> like

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
hole in the wall and then you make like

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.530 
hole in the wall and then you make like
the<00:01:10.260> portal<00:01:10.650> looking<00:01:11.070> thing<00:01:11.310> obviously<00:01:11.850> but

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the portal looking thing obviously but

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.719 
the portal looking thing obviously but
then<00:01:12.750> what<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:13.950> walk

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
then what you do is you just walk

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.630 
then what you do is you just walk
through<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.650> what<00:01:16.650> do<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.799> know<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
through and what do you know it's the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.859 
through and what do you know it's the
same<00:01:17.880> room<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.979> you<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.130> walk<00:01:20.310> back<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:21.600> it's

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
same room and you can walk back and it's

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.350 
same room and you can walk back and it's
the<00:01:21.930> same<00:01:22.110> room<00:01:22.460> now<00:01:23.460> basically<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> way<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
the same room now basically the way that

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.020 
the same room now basically the way that
this<00:01:24.570> works<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.200> there<00:01:26.040> are<00:01:26.189> multiple<00:01:26.369> rooms

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
this works is there are multiple rooms

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.819 
this works is there are multiple rooms
every<00:01:27.509> each<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.960> these<00:01:28.110> I'm<00:01:28.439> going<00:01:28.680> through

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
every each of these I'm going through

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.050 
every each of these I'm going through
into<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.189> different<00:01:29.490> room

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
into a different room

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.100 
into a different room
so<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.290> can<00:01:31.380> see<00:01:31.439> here<00:01:32.390> there's<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.750> four

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
so as you can see here there's like four

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.719 
so as you can see here there's like four
different<00:01:34.229> rooms<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.400> I'm<00:01:35.549> actually

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
different rooms that I'm actually

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.440 
different rooms that I'm actually
walking<00:01:36.210> through<00:01:36.890> now<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.250> figured<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.270> out

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
walking through now I figured this out

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.120 
walking through now I figured this out
because<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.900> saw<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.350> other<00:01:40.560> guy<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:41.009> on

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
because I saw this other guy do it on

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.700 
because I saw this other guy do it on
YouTube<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.210> thought<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.750> saw<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> brief

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
YouTube and I thought I saw like a brief

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.649 
YouTube and I thought I saw like a brief
part<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.460> video<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:44.939> figured<00:01:45.270> oh<00:01:45.390> that

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
part of the video and I figured oh that

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.260 
part of the video and I figured oh that
must<00:01:45.960> not<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.890> difficult<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.850> didn't

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
must not be that difficult but I didn't

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.270 
must not be that difficult but I didn't
think<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.509> would<00:01:48.570> actually<00:01:48.720> work<00:01:49.159> but<00:01:50.159> it

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
think it would actually work but it

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.270 
think it would actually work but it
actually<00:01:50.579> does<00:01:51.030> surprisingly<00:01:51.689> well<00:01:52.250> so<00:01:53.250> I

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
actually does surprisingly well so I

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.630 
actually does surprisingly well so I
mean<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:54.140> you<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.409> see<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.799> if<00:01:56.460> you

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
mean like you can just see like if you

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.850 
mean like you can just see like if you

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
pretty awesome and it's really fun just

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.670 
pretty awesome and it's really fun just
to<00:02:12.510> build<00:02:12.840> just<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.349> build

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
to build just to build

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.069 
to build just to build
that<00:02:14.010> like<00:02:14.189> blows<00:02:15.060> your<00:02:15.269> mind<00:02:15.299> every<00:02:15.780> time<00:02:15.810> you

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
that like blows your mind every time you

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.429 
that like blows your mind every time you
walk<00:02:16.260> through<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:16.950> basically<00:02:17.659> that's<00:02:18.659> very

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
walk through it so basically that's very

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.360 
walk through it so basically that's very
simple<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.159> make<00:02:20.219> and<00:02:20.730> it's<00:02:21.269> pretty<00:02:21.719> darn<00:02:21.989> cool

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
simple to make and it's pretty darn cool

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.209 
simple to make and it's pretty darn cool
I<00:02:23.370> do<00:02:23.819> not<00:02:24.180> take<00:02:24.420> credit<00:02:24.569> for<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.049> I<00:02:25.349> watched

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
I do not take credit for this I watched

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.080 
I do not take credit for this I watched
another<00:02:26.519> guy<00:02:26.879> make<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.409> but<00:02:28.409> and<00:02:29.060> then<00:02:30.060> I

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
another guy make it but and then I

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.119 
another guy make it but and then I
figured<00:02:30.540> why<00:02:30.750> not<00:02:30.780> do<00:02:31.109> it<00:02:31.139> myself<00:02:31.379> and<00:02:31.829> see<00:02:32.040> if

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
figured why not do it myself and see if

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.920 
figured why not do it myself and see if
it<00:02:32.219> actually<00:02:32.400> works<00:02:32.849> cuz<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.239> never<00:02:33.450> figured

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
it actually works cuz I never figured

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.679 
it actually works cuz I never figured
this<00:02:34.049> would<00:02:34.200> actually<00:02:34.349> work<00:02:34.819> but<00:02:35.819> um<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.450> dies

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
this would actually work but um it dies

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:40.670 
this would actually work but um it dies
and<00:02:37.079> it<00:02:37.469> works<00:02:37.650> quite<00:02:37.859> well<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.930> also<00:02:39.930> like<00:02:40.530> I

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
and it works quite well so also like I

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.910 
and it works quite well so also like I
said<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.950> will<00:02:41.370> be<00:02:41.519> doing<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:42.379> actual<00:02:43.379> total

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
said I will be doing a actual total

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.500 
said I will be doing a actual total
adventure<00:02:44.250> map<00:02:44.400> but<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.969> will<00:02:45.150> take<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.359> very

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
adventure map but that will take a very

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.050 
adventure map but that will take a very
long<00:02:46.049> time<00:02:46.109> however<00:02:46.829> when<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.310> actually<00:02:47.669> build

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
long time however when I actually build

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.149 
long time however when I actually build
it<00:02:48.239> successfully<00:02:49.019> it<00:02:49.409> would<00:02:49.650> be<00:02:49.769> based<00:02:50.010> on

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
it successfully it would be based on

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.099 
it successfully it would be based on
portal<00:02:50.609> 2<00:02:50.849> because<00:02:51.329> that<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:51.810> one<00:02:51.900> I've

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
portal 2 because that is the one I've

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.780 
portal 2 because that is the one I've
played<00:02:52.409> and<00:02:52.650> beaten<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:53.159> have<00:02:53.459> not<00:02:53.639> played

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
played and beaten I have not played

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.140 
played and beaten I have not played
portal<00:02:54.269> 1<00:02:54.480> other<00:02:55.409> than<00:02:55.650> just<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:55.950> demo<00:02:56.280> but

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
portal 1 other than just the demo but

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.119 
portal 1 other than just the demo but
basically<00:02:57.959> it<00:02:58.290> will<00:02:58.409> be<00:02:58.469> a<00:02:58.590> portal<00:02:58.980> to

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
basically it will be a portal to

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.059 
basically it will be a portal to
adventure<00:02:59.700> map<00:02:59.909> and<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.689> will<00:03:00.719> have<00:03:01.069> the

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
adventure map and it will have the

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.979 
adventure map and it will have the
biggest<00:03:02.549> map<00:03:02.939> it<00:03:03.180> will<00:03:03.269> probably<00:03:03.450> take<00:03:03.689> up<00:03:03.870> an

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
biggest map it will probably take up an

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.830 
biggest map it will probably take up an
entire<00:03:04.340> superflat<00:03:05.340> world<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:06.299> make<00:03:07.280> but<00:03:08.280> um

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
entire superflat world to make but um

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.080 
entire superflat world to make but um
yeah<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:09.870> that'll<00:03:10.620> be<00:03:10.739> cool<00:03:10.849> that'll<00:03:11.849> take<00:03:12.060> a

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
yeah so that'll be cool that'll take a

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.240 
yeah so that'll be cool that'll take a
while<00:03:12.419> though<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:13.169> but<00:03:13.650> once<00:03:13.829> I'm<00:03:14.010> done

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
while though so but once I'm done

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.039 
while though so but once I'm done
building<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:14.909> will<00:03:15.209> probably<00:03:15.450> do<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.780> let's

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
building it I will probably do a let's

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.979 
building it I will probably do a let's
play<00:03:16.169> about<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.790> that'll<00:03:18.359> be<00:03:18.479> fun

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
play about that so that'll be fun

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.180 
play about that so that'll be fun
