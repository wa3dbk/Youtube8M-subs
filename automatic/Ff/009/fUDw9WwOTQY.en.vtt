00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.530
 hello together i welcome you here 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.450
 again back to a small one 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.700
 Imagination is minecraft like gaming 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.630
 fantasy servers this time it should be 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.070
 here really only a short video 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.630
 I will have a cold because of that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.609
 I'll try this one now 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.680
 few minutes without coughing and sneezing here 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.330
 to survive and me back in mine 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.699
 small part of the server to show on 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.619
 at the beginning, yes, if the memory 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.090
 you own a minecraft server yourself 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.949
 wanted to meet me then with a friend 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.739
 then you can just play on www 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.149
 home.de you can go for one 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.149
 really good price you too one 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.270
 buy small server and yes then directly 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.370
 Let's gamble or get enough of it 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.870
 now a little yes a part out 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.160
 not so much the ones now 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.379
 Most would not say it now 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.840
 which was very special what was built here 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.899
 but it gives the server as I think so 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.090
 a touch because just yes 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.120
 it is not big but it is not 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.680
 what to do when you get to the server where 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.989
 you do not show at the end where that is 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.360
 you would not immediately this area 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.130
 your thinking but it's just like that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.540
 that everywhere on the server, even if it is 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.369
 is still so small or if this is against 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.770
 yet filed is something to put down 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.180
 Something was being built 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.270
 and yes so here at this little 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.610
 in part on the bridge, it is the first time 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.080
 Two directions go here became something 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.000
 bigger built up there I'll be in 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.520
 other notions show stromrechnung 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.259
 here once on the right the way long 200 itself 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.560
 just to years a small town 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.329
 a few houses and I find something 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.650
 always very nice is also a bit 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.079
 isolated and here a bit yes 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.000
 nested if so yes 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.170
 small things emerged on the server 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.049
 they are also a bit remote 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.130
 are of the real attractions 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.299
 because then you see that the people themselves 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.960
 really hard given here 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.210
 to keep in a certain style so that you 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.420
 I already think such a flair of 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.729
 the old farm have here 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.350
 I think so what you had then to 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.390
 me and no elevator with which one in 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.060
 could bring things to the upper city 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.430
 here was still somehow here 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.100
 planted a few things like that 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.000
 harvesting a little could eat dearest 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.130
 and so yes it is so I have the feeling 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.180
 that here is not one hundred percent 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.140
 Everything was finished because such a thing 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.040
 few furnishings are still missing 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.530
 to what extent here at this point 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.920
 I am still working but I like it 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:31.080
 It is definitely quite good here 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:41.760
 I was not even long 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:44.120
 or nice view of the sea here 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.120
 ahead 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.519
 yes I have the feeling what the server 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:58.110
 Generally speaking, you have quite a lot 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:03:00.630
 placed great value on details and 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.100
 as I said at the end of this 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.010
 over it so you can see how 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.750
 that this is actually the way it is 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.480
 here, too, the server nicely decorated 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.489
 probably his kitchen but here with 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.489
 so not deduction or what that should be 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.700
 small attic is special on it 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.700
 to see 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:37.470
 so now even further 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:42.480
 radware harbor even behaves with water 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:45.540
 you look at the sea so look 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.520
 back see it is nothing now 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.440
 especially big but i find it 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:04:01.020
 Nevertheless , you have built yourself nice 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:04:02.730
 also trouble with given are over lights 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.580
 in the forest I do not know maybe 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.090
 Here's something else 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.720
 probably should be expanded 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.720
 become 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.450
 I think they are leading us now 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.580
 the lights here but again a step 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:18.750
 go back somewhere 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:22.230
 another way long here for the second 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.250
 house no here I was but 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.630
 I have to go somewhere here 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.950
 because he knows why he still behind 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.970
 a second, slightly larger house stands 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.360
 Just snake through the forest 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.580
 Here we follow the lights, hopefully 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.590
 Do not lead us crazy 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.540
 no here, yes , I can still do that 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.610
 The way to the end are built therefore 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.419
 here are the lights built 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:48.169
 yes, here you can see something here 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.169
 bigger house 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:02.360
 which again very nice the floor 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:04.560
 This is namely expanded from workbench 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.940
 What you do not at first glance 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.759
 would it really was very, very 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:13.800
 You can look good over now 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:14.729
 actually make something of it but works 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:27.090
 definitely cool with 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:29.810
 rear output to get out is obtained 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.810
 even a better view 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:42.030
 I think I was not exactly like that 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:43.650
 There is something else there as well 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.030
 lit I have the feeling too 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:52.130
 that something should be built here 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:54.389
 then sit down 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:59.310
 Well, here we were just thinking 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:06:01.669
 is there anything so there's 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.810
 really a lot to discover 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.190
 The chandeliers are so right 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.039
 Chandelier built that you really cool 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:11.159
 Well then I'll just go now 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:14.639
 a bit fly here and then 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:17.250
 show the remote that's what I am 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.849
 Here we were just a way through the 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.979
 forest gone 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:21.599
 yes and you see there is still too 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:24.900
 what makes him such a smaller house everywhere 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:26.669
 built smaller actually built 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.319
 from the actual happening of the server 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:33.060
 are pretty far away up here 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:35.000
 Here I come to that is there 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.110
 starting walked along 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.440
 flies again briefly to the house here 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.440
 ahead 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:57.320
 Here you can get a look at the door 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:57.320
 even here without interior hhk 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.230
 So here you do not actually come 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.750
 high probably will be 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:06.060
 built at the end 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.630
 yes it comes without furnishings yes it 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.540
 maybe not yet 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:12.170
 one hundred percent done so on 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.170
 every case very nice 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:20.190
 well then it should already be 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.760
 I've been flying here again 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:25.920
 direction sunset time again 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.140
 here where we have just found us 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.020
 houses as I said so something 

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.550
 shorter video something yes smaller things 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.500
 I have the hope that it has presented 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.860
 you still like it and see you 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.860
 next time
