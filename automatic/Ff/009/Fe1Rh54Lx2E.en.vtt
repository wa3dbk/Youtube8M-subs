about<00:00:04.500> serving<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.700> techniques<00:00:06.120> that<00:00:06.270> go

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
about serving and the techniques that go

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.950 
about serving and the techniques that go
along<00:00:06.540> with<00:00:06.750> serving<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:08.190> we'll<00:00:08.340> worry<00:00:08.520> about

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
along with serving and we'll worry about

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.049 
along with serving and we'll worry about
where<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.139> ball<00:00:10.290> has<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.710> co<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.730> court

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
where the ball has to co in the court

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.390 
where the ball has to co in the court
and<00:00:12.330> I'll<00:00:13.110> give<00:00:13.260> you<00:00:13.349> some<00:00:13.559> court<00:00:13.830> guidelines

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
and I'll give you some court guidelines

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.330 
and I'll give you some court guidelines
later<00:00:14.760> for<00:00:15.120> singles<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.660> doubles<00:00:16.020> tennis<00:00:16.340> but

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
later for singles and doubles tennis but

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.390 
later for singles and doubles tennis but
for<00:00:17.520> now<00:00:18.230> when<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.349> see<00:00:19.560> TV<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.189> see<00:00:20.369> a

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
for now when you see TV and you see a

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.089 
for now when you see TV and you see a
professional<00:00:20.610> tennis<00:00:21.360> player<00:00:21.509> and<00:00:22.110> the

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:23.099 
professional tennis player and the

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:24.800 
professional tennis player and the
serving<00:00:23.579> the<00:00:23.669> ball<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.119> always<00:00:24.390> looks<00:00:24.630> so

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
serving the ball it's always looks so

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.010 
serving the ball it's always looks so
fluid<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.470> natural<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.419> this<00:00:27.419> is<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.720> way<00:00:27.869> it

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
fluid and natural and this is the way it

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.940 
fluid and natural and this is the way it
should<00:00:28.050> look<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> start<00:00:30.410> you<00:00:31.410> take<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.770> ball

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
should look to start you take the ball

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.970 
should look to start you take the ball
like<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> edge<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> racket<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.980> just

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
like to the edge of the racket and just

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.630 
like to the edge of the racket and just
like<00:00:35.129> this<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.730> your<00:00:36.600> knees<00:00:36.780> are<00:00:37.019> up<00:00:37.399> my<00:00:38.399> right

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
like this and your knees are up my right

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.110 
like this and your knees are up my right
knee<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.000> up<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.449> a<00:00:39.539> little<00:00:39.690> bit<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:41.120> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
knee is up just a little bit and the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.729 
knee is up just a little bit and the
next<00:00:42.359> thing<00:00:42.539> i<00:00:42.660> would<00:00:42.719> do<00:00:42.929> is<00:00:42.989> toss<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.589> ball

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
next thing i would do is toss the ball

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.700 
next thing i would do is toss the ball
in<00:00:43.949> the<00:00:44.010> air<00:00:44.449> now<00:00:45.449> i<00:00:45.480> would<00:00:45.750> i<00:00:46.140> would<00:00:46.260> suggest

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
in the air now i would i would suggest

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.340 
in the air now i would i would suggest
that<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.730> work<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.300> tossing<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.899> ball<00:00:49.019> first

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that you work on tossing the ball first

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.880 
that you work on tossing the ball first
before<00:00:49.829> even<00:00:50.039> hitting<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.429> ball<00:00:50.749> and<00:00:51.890> just

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
before even hitting the ball and just

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.000 
before even hitting the ball and just
catching<00:00:53.429> it<00:00:54.140> to<00:00:55.140> where<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.350> might<00:00:55.679> be

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
catching it to where you might be

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.399 
catching it to where you might be
comfortable<00:00:56.879> ever<00:00:57.659> being<00:00:57.929> a<00:00:58.079> certain<00:00:58.289> level

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
comfortable ever being a certain level

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.869 
comfortable ever being a certain level
and<00:00:59.300> next<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.719> want<00:01:00.839> to<00:01:00.989> hit<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.260> ball<00:01:01.879> now

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
and next you want to hit the ball now

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.000 
and next you want to hit the ball now
keep<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.239> mind<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.839> tennis<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.650> could<00:01:04.800> always

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
keep in mind in tennis you could always

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.210 
keep in mind in tennis you could always
catch<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.640> ball<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.869> bad<00:01:07.020> toss<00:01:07.320> or<00:01:07.740> if

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
catch the ball if it's a bad toss or if

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.950 
catch the ball if it's a bad toss or if
you're<00:01:08.340> not<00:01:08.460> ready<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.880> hit<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.540> without

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
you're not ready to hit it and without

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.999 
you're not ready to hit it and without
fault<00:01:10.500> without<00:01:11.220> an<00:01:11.369> error<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> fluid<00:01:13.619> motion

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
fault without an error so a fluid motion

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:22.340 
fault without an error so a fluid motion
looks<00:01:14.250> somewhat<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:21.200> now<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.229> don't

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
looks somewhat like this now I don't

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.990 
looks somewhat like this now I don't
know<00:01:22.590> if<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.860> ball<00:01:23.009> was<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.430> go<00:01:23.579> in<00:01:23.759> but

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
know if that ball was going to go in but

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.260 
know if that ball was going to go in but
we're<00:01:24.119> focusing<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.630> technique<00:01:25.079> right<00:01:25.259> now<00:01:25.439> a

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
we're focusing on technique right now a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.899 
we're focusing on technique right now a
nice<00:01:27.270> fluid<00:01:27.630> motion<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:32.520> want<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.789> hit

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
nice fluid motion and you want to hit

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.490 
nice fluid motion and you want to hit
the<00:01:33.090> ball<00:01:33.270> more<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.469> here<00:01:35.039> as<00:01:35.659> to<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.259> that

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
the ball more up here as to so that

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.149 
the ball more up here as to so that
you're<00:01:37.619> coming<00:01:38.009> down<00:01:38.450> towards<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.630> net<00:01:40.159> some

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
you're coming down towards the net some

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.539 
you're coming down towards the net some
mistakes<00:01:41.549> I've<00:01:41.789> seen<00:01:42.000> people<00:01:42.180> do<00:01:42.539> in<00:01:43.549> serving

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
mistakes I've seen people do in serving

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.700 
mistakes I've seen people do in serving
is<00:01:45.119> hitting<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.509> ball<00:01:45.689> too<00:01:45.869> quick<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.469> this

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
is hitting the ball too quick like this

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.380 
is hitting the ball too quick like this
maybe<00:01:49.710> hitting<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.280> ball<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.609> a<00:01:50.670> bad<00:01:50.939> toss

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
maybe hitting the ball on a bad toss

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.070 
maybe hitting the ball on a bad toss
like<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:54.390> now<00:01:54.539> a<00:01:54.570> metal<00:01:54.899> balls

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.490 

or<00:01:57.860> some<00:01:58.820> people<00:01:59.090> try<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.360> hit<00:01:59.630> it<00:01:59.780> you<00:02:00.380> know

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
or some people try to hit it you know

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.280 
or some people try to hit it you know
just<00:02:00.800> to<00:02:00.920> get<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.190> over<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.520> net<00:02:01.870> which<00:02:02.870> isn't

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
just to get it over the net which isn't

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.710 
just to get it over the net which isn't
so<00:02:03.470> bad<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:03.980> start<00:02:06.940> but<00:02:07.940> it's<00:02:08.119> that<00:02:08.300> old<00:02:08.509> adage

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
so bad to start but it's that old adage

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.540 
so bad to start but it's that old adage
you<00:02:09.080> know<00:02:09.200> why<00:02:09.410> learn<00:02:09.710> something<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.369> wrong

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
you know why learn something the wrong

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.110 
you know why learn something the wrong
way<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:11.260> practice<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.500> wrong<00:02:12.680> way<00:02:12.740> if<00:02:13.310> you

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
way and practice it the wrong way if you

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.640 
way and practice it the wrong way if you
can<00:02:14.240> learn<00:02:14.390> something<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.840> right<00:02:15.050> way<00:02:15.110> and

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
can learn something the right way and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.960 
can learn something the right way and
get<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.160> in<00:02:16.570> just<00:02:17.570> a<00:02:17.690> little<00:02:17.870> more<00:02:18.140> time<00:02:20.200> and

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
get it in just a little more time and

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.560 
get it in just a little more time and
that's<00:02:22.970> serving<00:02:23.570> for<00:02:24.410> me
