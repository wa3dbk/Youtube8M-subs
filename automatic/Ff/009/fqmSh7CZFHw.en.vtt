00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.189
 Together I am from the pc games 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.719
 hardware and I have with me again 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.490
 Taken in the editorial that it is short 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.380
 after the ifa 2014 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.570
 there were force displays a big point 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.789
 and of course the topic ultra 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.580
 wide screen gaming and that's where I want it today 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.769
 Give a brief outline of it and also 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.980
 watch what all this discussion 16 is about 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.730
 9 21 to 9 did not curved body at all 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.109
 should bring 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.970
 We'll have a look at some players for that 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.890
 who maybe the first thing 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.270
 can gaming video has seen the has 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.600
 I saw that last time 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.000
 a 21 to 9 monitor and with 3 16 9 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.239
 monitor rome experimented this 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.350
 I have three 21.10 new ones 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.780
 displayed monitors 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.160
 that's over 7000 pixels in width 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.780
 and 1080 pixels in height 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.000
 the performance is with such an older one 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.289
 play like here just cause 2 right 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.289
 neat and still sees the game 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.300
 still very good thanks to request eightfold 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.329
 edge smoothing in c and in such a 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.760
 horse person game makes this extreme 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.920
 picture width also a lot of fun because you 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.960
 just a bigger panorama view 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.560
 has as a regular 16 9 or 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.810
 even with a 21 to the new monitor 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.630
 however, one has to say 21 times to three times 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.670
 9 makes the whole no 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.890
 that brings only with such 3d 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.840
 play or just at racing games 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.689
 certain advantage because game I show 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.060
 Immediately so I have me again 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.030
 ingrid autosport said this time with 321 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.130
 10 9 monitors and how to look good 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.299
 Can not my mileage 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.340
 excellent for that is that 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.040
 Speed â€‹â€‹feeling extremely good thanks 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.840
 the three monitors with the wide picture 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.869
 relationship and, indeed, focuses 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.740
 still in the middle but through the 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.990
 show more in the peripheral 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.060
 look field comes the whole again 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.420
 little horny huber than on one 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.880
 monitor makes 3 x 21 inch multi 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.990
 monitoring fun really has the whole 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.430
 of course a little bit of performance as well 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.369
 we're just about cost 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.170
 40 fps and that though we have 992 iks 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.409
 have built and also strong 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.599
 overclocked is at the same time a game 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.470
 in the 21 10 9 in triple format 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.290
 much less joy 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.930
 we are in portal 2 and we already see 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.180
 can fit the loading screens 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.430
 not at all on this three times 21 9 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.960
 format and everything extremely distorted in the 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.930
 game will fit again 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.730
 but somehow the two bring 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.400
 external monitors no additional 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.480
 gain in the immersion or similar 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.750
 because that just works 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.550
 disturbing the whole because the perspective 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.030
 is extremely distorted to the 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.530
 margins and a bit bad 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.010
 is even similar to the case of opel 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.100
 does not apply to everyone 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.870
 suitable the whole a short 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.060
 interim conclusion is that I am multi 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.290
 monitoring with three classic 16 9 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.209
 Monitors like we already are in one 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.209
 have shown other video in total 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.780
 much better than like 3 x 21 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.420
 to 9 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.890
 that has the just shown reasons that 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.990
 for example, in sheds, etc 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.520
 the perspective is so extremely distorted 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.860
 that actually no additional 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.240
 playing fun arises and now I want 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.590
 also really like the bow to the 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.780
 cast monitors beat me on 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.519
 beginning've talked to and that 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.070
 I wanted to do the following 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.900
 demonstrate hoffmann make goals and 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.570
 my eyes are like this if 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.590
 man monitor has a big one 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:32.170
 screen diagonal of 34 inches and more in the 21st 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.280
 9 bildformat then you have namely the 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.530
 advantage that you do not like 29 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.670
 inch screen like this one right here 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.590
 somehow to the right or to the left 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.269
 wants to watch to see what's going on 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.690
 actually just off the screen 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.799
 at a 25 23 21 16 9 model is mine 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.030
 the whole somehow again 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.430
 too small there is no 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.080
 Great postcards and panorama effect 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.640
 around there you stay at one 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.610
 plastic 16 9 format 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.980
 that's why i can well imagine 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.130
 that for larger monitors in the body 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.180
 make a lot of sense 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.580
 It looks different if we do 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.880
 the multi monitor operation looks at us 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.500
 I think there are 16 devices with craft 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.090
 displays the much more interesting 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.680
 alternative simply because the 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.960
 perspective distortions less 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.940
 is 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.060
 Different games do not matter if racing game 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.810
 ego-shooter puzzle game or too 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.610
 person action game 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.430
 In addition, you can then very much 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.110
 pleasant position here in the semicircle 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.210
 and just has a more pleasant 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.980
 I do not look very far 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.200
 the edges extends but just still 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.240
 a healthy mediocre image provides that 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.550
 you can capture everything with one glance 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.520
 and enough vertical and horizontal picture 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.930
 I'm curious about information 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.610
 what kind of equipment will be available soon 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.110
 the editorial will land and there will 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.000
 I keep you informed 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.340
 As the body display trend then 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.050
 also really developed and what the 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.240
 first experiences in the test lab with it 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.240
 until then I'm out and ciao
