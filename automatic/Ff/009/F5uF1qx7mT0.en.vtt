00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.970 

the<00:00:11.960> speed<00:00:12.259> of<00:00:12.290> light<00:00:12.440> is<00:00:13.450> basically<00:00:14.500> as<00:00:15.500> fast

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
the speed of light is basically as fast

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.089 
the speed of light is basically as fast
as<00:00:16.340> you<00:00:16.640> ever<00:00:16.789> get<00:00:17.110> what<00:00:18.110> is<00:00:18.230> it<00:00:18.259> in<00:00:18.470> American

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
as you ever get what is it in American

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.120 
as you ever get what is it in American
units<00:00:19.430> something<00:00:19.759> like<00:00:20.740> 186,000<00:00:21.740> miles<00:00:21.890> a

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
units something like 186,000 miles a

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.490 
units something like 186,000 miles a
second<00:00:22.550> but<00:00:23.240> in<00:00:23.360> our<00:00:23.539> clouds<00:00:23.960> you<00:00:24.169> can<00:00:24.289> slow

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
second but in our clouds you can slow

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.740 
second but in our clouds you can slow
them<00:00:24.650> down<00:00:24.680> to<00:00:25.009> 38<00:00:25.430> miles<00:00:25.759> an<00:00:25.970> hour<00:00:26.119> that's

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
them down to 38 miles an hour that's

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.450 
them down to 38 miles an hour that's
what<00:00:26.930> we<00:00:27.020> did<00:00:27.169> in<00:00:27.230> our<00:00:27.320> first<00:00:27.380> experiments<00:00:28.279> and

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
what we did in our first experiments and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.639 
what we did in our first experiments and
then<00:00:29.210> we<00:00:29.360> actually<00:00:29.540> slowed<00:00:30.050> them<00:00:30.230> down<00:00:30.259> all

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:30.649 
then we actually slowed them down all

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.860 
then we actually slowed them down all
the<00:00:30.770> way<00:00:30.890> to<00:00:30.919> two<00:00:31.640> one<00:00:31.820> mile<00:00:32.059> an<00:00:32.239> hour<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:32.750> then

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
the way to two one mile an hour and then

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.020 
the way to two one mile an hour and then
you<00:00:32.960> can<00:00:33.110> actually<00:00:33.559> you<00:00:34.100> can<00:00:34.250> basically<00:00:34.460> crawl

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
you can actually you can basically crawl

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.510 
you can actually you can basically crawl
faster<00:00:35.510> than<00:00:35.660> light<00:00:35.809> what<00:00:36.620> we<00:00:36.770> do<00:00:36.950> is<00:00:37.129> we<00:00:37.340> take

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
faster than light what we do is we take

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.970 
faster than light what we do is we take
a<00:00:37.579> bunch<00:00:37.820> of<00:00:38.030> amps<00:00:38.420> and<00:00:38.600> we<00:00:39.170> use<00:00:39.350> what<00:00:39.890> I<00:00:39.920> call

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
a bunch of amps and we use what I call

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.799 
a bunch of amps and we use what I call
sodium<00:00:40.610> atoms<00:00:40.910> exactly<00:00:41.360> what<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:41.600> have<00:00:41.780> in

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
sodium atoms exactly what you have in

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.980 
sodium atoms exactly what you have in
table<00:00:42.260> salt<00:00:42.289> and<00:00:42.739> then<00:00:43.640> we<00:00:43.790> first<00:00:44.480> manipulate

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
table salt and then we first manipulate

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.050 
table salt and then we first manipulate
these<00:00:45.170> atoms<00:00:45.590> in<00:00:45.800> very<00:00:46.100> special<00:00:46.400> ways<00:00:46.610> with

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
these atoms in very special ways with

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.880 
these atoms in very special ways with
laser<00:00:47.510> beams<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:48.110> then<00:00:48.230> we<00:00:48.350> can<00:00:48.530> cool<00:00:48.740> the

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
laser beams and then we can cool the

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.710 
laser beams and then we can cool the
atoms<00:00:49.160> down<00:00:49.340> to<00:00:49.550> a<00:00:49.610> few<00:00:49.820> billionths<00:00:50.360> of<00:00:50.450> a

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
atoms down to a few billionths of a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.940 
atoms down to a few billionths of a
degree<00:00:50.750> above<00:00:51.110> absolute<00:00:51.350> zero

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
degree above absolute zero

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.069 
degree above absolute zero
so<00:00:52.430> that's<00:00:52.550> of<00:00:52.670> course<00:00:52.790> really<00:00:53.360> freezing<00:00:53.630> cold

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
so that's of course really freezing cold

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.840 
so that's of course really freezing cold
exactly<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.530> code<00:00:54.739> is<00:00:54.890> placed<00:00:55.130> in<00:00:55.220> universe

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
exactly the code is placed in universe

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.840 
exactly the code is placed in universe
and<00:00:56.750> then<00:00:56.840> once<00:00:57.050> we<00:00:57.200> create<00:00:57.500> a<00:00:57.530> cloud<00:00:57.829> of<00:00:58.100> such

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
and then once we create a cloud of such

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.090 
and then once we create a cloud of such
really<00:00:59.239> cold<00:00:59.480> atoms<00:00:59.899> we<00:01:00.380> illuminate<00:01:00.680> that

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
really cold atoms we illuminate that

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.430 
really cold atoms we illuminate that
cloud<00:01:01.370> with<00:01:01.550> one<00:01:01.820> laser<00:01:02.060> beam<00:01:02.360> and<00:01:02.660> then<00:01:03.320> we

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
cloud with one laser beam and then we

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.249 
cloud with one laser beam and then we
send<00:01:03.649> a<00:01:03.710> light<00:01:03.890> person<00:01:04.810> into<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.899> cloud<00:01:06.110> from

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
send a light person into the cloud from

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.560 
send a light person into the cloud from
the<00:01:06.380> other<00:01:06.530> side<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.100> we<00:01:07.189> can<00:01:07.220> now<00:01:07.520> slow<00:01:08.360> that

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
the other side and we can now slow that

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.480 
the other side and we can now slow that
light<00:01:08.750> pulse<00:01:09.049> down<00:01:09.290> to<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.100> speed<00:01:10.310> of<00:01:10.430> a

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
light pulse down to the speed of a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.910 
light pulse down to the speed of a
bicycle<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:11.210> it<00:01:11.329> sort<00:01:11.509> of<00:01:11.600> chops<00:01:11.930> along<00:01:12.259> and

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
bicycle and it sort of chops along and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.289 
bicycle and it sort of chops along and
then<00:01:13.070> if<00:01:13.280> we<00:01:13.399> feel<00:01:13.610> like<00:01:13.790> we<00:01:14.030> can<00:01:14.149> actually

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
then if we feel like we can actually

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.300 
then if we feel like we can actually
completely<00:01:15.020> stop<00:01:15.290> that<00:01:15.500> light<00:01:15.710> pulse<00:01:16.010> inside

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
completely stop that light pulse inside

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.030 
completely stop that light pulse inside
our<00:01:16.670> atom<00:01:16.970> cloud<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.479> then<00:01:18.350> leave<00:01:18.799> it<00:01:18.830> there

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
our atom cloud and then leave it there

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.770 
our atom cloud and then leave it there
for<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.310> while<00:01:19.340> pocket<00:01:20.000> there<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:20.450> then<00:01:20.630> when

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
for a while pocket there and then when

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.180 
for a while pocket there and then when
we<00:01:20.900> feel<00:01:21.110> like<00:01:21.140> it<00:01:21.350> we<00:01:21.530> can<00:01:21.740> send<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.040> life

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
we feel like it we can send the life

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.490 
we feel like it we can send the life
course<00:01:22.460> back<00:01:22.700> on<00:01:22.850> its<00:01:23.000> way<00:01:23.180> revive<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:24.200> we

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
course back on its way revive it we

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.010 
course back on its way revive it we
generate<00:01:24.950> it<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.250> how<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:25.640> comes<00:01:25.880> or<00:01:26.780> we<00:01:26.930> are

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
generate it and how it comes or we are

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.740 
generate it and how it comes or we are
seeing<00:01:27.260> is<00:01:27.440> actually<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.520> album

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
seeing is actually the album

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.560 
seeing is actually the album
really<00:01:30.470> because<00:01:30.620> what<00:01:31.250> we<00:01:31.400> as<00:01:31.970> I<00:01:32.120> mention<00:01:32.450> we

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
really because what we as I mention we

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.510 
really because what we as I mention we
get<00:01:32.750> this<00:01:32.900> really<00:01:33.440> cold<00:01:33.680> equator<00:01:34.070> is<00:01:34.250> really

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
get this really cold equator is really

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.180 
get this really cold equator is really
cold<00:01:34.790> atoms<00:01:35.180> and<00:01:35.420> we<00:01:36.050> usually<00:01:36.260> need<00:01:36.650> basically

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
cold atoms and we usually need basically

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.280 
cold atoms and we usually need basically
used<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.610> do<00:01:37.730> that<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.630> then<00:01:38.750> eventually<00:01:39.020> all

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
used to do that and then eventually all

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.440 
used to do that and then eventually all
these<00:01:39.590> laser<00:01:40.130> beams<00:01:40.280> that<00:01:40.730> we<00:01:40.850> see<00:01:41.060> you<00:01:41.390> know

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
these laser beams that we see you know

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.450 
these laser beams that we see you know
there<00:01:41.690> will<00:01:41.900> be<00:01:41.960> running<00:01:42.230> around<00:01:42.460> crisscross

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
there will be running around crisscross

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.000 
there will be running around crisscross
and<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.760> whole<00:01:43.910> optics<00:01:44.630> table<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.170> they<00:01:45.680> all

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
and the whole optics table and they all

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.280 
and the whole optics table and they all
converge<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:47.060> main<00:01:47.240> vacuum<00:01:47.480> chamber<00:01:48.080> where

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
converge the main vacuum chamber where

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.860 
converge the main vacuum chamber where
the<00:01:49.010> action<00:01:49.520> is<00:01:50.060> happening<00:01:52.210> very<00:01:53.210> special

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
the action is happening very special

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.170 
the action is happening very special
episodes<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:54.650> is<00:01:54.950> where<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.400> sodium<00:01:55.850> atoms

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
episodes that is where the sodium atoms

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.180 
episodes that is where the sodium atoms
are<00:01:56.450> coming<00:01:56.810> from<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.290> they<00:01:57.710> are<00:01:57.830> hot<00:01:58.040> to

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870

start with we actually have to hit them
to<00:02:00.530> create<00:02:01.190> a<00:02:01.220> gas<00:02:01.490> of<00:02:01.729> sodium<00:02:02.090> atoms<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.780> at

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
to create a gas of sodium atoms and at

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.180 
to create a gas of sodium atoms and at
the<00:02:03.020> time<00:02:03.229> when<00:02:03.410> we<00:02:03.530> started<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.890> go<00:02:04.010> after

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
the time when we started to go after

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.290 
the time when we started to go after
cold<00:02:04.580> atoms<00:02:04.970> I<00:02:05.200> did<00:02:06.200> not<00:02:06.380> have<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:06.590> clue<00:02:06.890> that

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
cold atoms I did not have a clue that

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.580 
cold atoms I did not have a clue that
some<00:02:08.300> years<00:02:08.450> later<00:02:08.570> I<00:02:08.929> would<00:02:09.200> start<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.560> look

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
some years later I would start to look

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.710 
some years later I would start to look
at<00:02:09.830> slow<00:02:10.010> light<00:02:10.220> forces<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:11.180> that's<00:02:11.540> really

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
at slow light forces and that's really

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.140 
at slow light forces and that's really
an<00:02:11.900> example<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.530> if<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:13.340> get<00:02:13.520> your<00:02:13.670> hands<00:02:14.030> on

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
an example of if you get your hands on

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.720 
an example of if you get your hands on
an<00:02:14.360> exciting<00:02:14.720> new<00:02:14.959> system<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.459> start

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
an exciting new system that you start

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.210 
an exciting new system that you start
you<00:02:16.850> start<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.240> poke<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:17.840> see<00:02:18.770> what<00:02:18.950> comes

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
you start to poke it and see what comes

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.270 
you start to poke it and see what comes
out<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:21.020> what<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.620> really<00:02:21.950> hope<00:02:22.130> is

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
out and and and what you really hope is

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.710 
out and and and what you really hope is
that<00:02:22.400> something<00:02:22.790> totally<00:02:23.330> unexpected

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
that something totally unexpected

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.440 
that something totally unexpected
totally<00:02:24.650> exciting<00:02:25.100> will<00:02:25.400> come<00:02:25.610> out<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.150> I

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
totally exciting will come out and and I

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:36.770 
totally exciting will come out and and I
think<00:02:26.660> that's<00:02:26.959> what<00:02:27.170> happened<00:02:27.530> in<00:02:27.590> this<00:02:27.680> case

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780
