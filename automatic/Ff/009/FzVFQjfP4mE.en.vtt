honestly<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.130> would<00:02:05.399> still<00:02:05.670> rather<00:02:05.820> use<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
honestly I would still rather use the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.330 
honestly I would still rather use the
favoring<00:02:06.780> room<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.200> if<00:02:07.439> I'm<00:02:07.680> playing<00:02:07.860> against

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
favoring room but if I'm playing against

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.570 
favoring room but if I'm playing against
all<00:02:08.580> enemies<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.590> if<00:02:10.590> i<00:02:10.739> had<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:10.950> burn<00:02:11.370> on

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
all enemies and if i had the burn on

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.400 
all enemies and if i had the burn on
this<00:02:11.760> then<00:02:12.060> i<00:02:12.090> would<00:02:12.300> use<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.629> but<00:02:12.810> I

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
this then i would use it but I

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.080 
this then i would use it but I
have<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.800> burn<00:02:13.980> version<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.850> don't<00:02:15.000> have

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
have the burn version of it I don't have

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.150 
have the burn version of it I don't have
the<00:02:15.210> version<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.510> has<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.780> solar<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.680> think<00:02:17.100> it

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
the version that has a solar I think it

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.350 
the version that has a solar I think it
comes<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.460> solar<00:02:17.640> when<00:02:17.940> are<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.090> getting<00:02:18.180> from

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
comes to solar when are you getting from

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.110 
comes to solar when are you getting from
school<00:02:18.630> i'm<00:02:18.960> not<00:02:19.080> sure<00:02:19.140> but<00:02:19.350> i<00:02:20.000> would<00:02:21.000> rather

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
school i'm not sure but i would rather

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.510 
school i'm not sure but i would rather
use<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.600> may<00:02:21.900> be<00:02:21.960> for<00:02:22.410> prison<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.160> elders<00:02:23.340> i

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.580 
use this may be for prison of elders i
don't<00:02:23.940> know<00:02:24.030> but<00:02:24.660> since<00:02:24.900> i<00:02:25.020> have<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.320> version

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
don't know but since i have the version

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.930 
don't know but since i have the version
that<00:02:25.620> doesn't<00:02:25.710> have<00:02:26.040> any<00:02:26.220> burns<00:02:26.490> i<00:02:26.790> would

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
that doesn't have any burns i would

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.090 
that doesn't have any burns i would
rather<00:02:27.090> use<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.480> Fate<00:02:27.690> bringer<00:02:28.050> because<00:02:28.800> it

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
rather use the Fate bringer because it

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.680 
rather use the Fate bringer because it
doesn't<00:02:29.130> have<00:02:29.460> firefly<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.210> doesn't<00:02:30.570> have

doesn't have firefly it doesn't have
explosive<00:02:31.200> round<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.800> its<00:02:32.550> really<00:02:32.850> only<00:02:33.090> good

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
explosive round and its really only good

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.660 
explosive round and its really only good
against<00:02:33.600> fallen<00:02:33.930> enemies<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.530> for<00:02:35.100> PvE<00:02:35.430> I'd

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
against fallen enemies so for PvE I'd

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.250 
against fallen enemies so for PvE I'd
rather<00:02:35.880> use<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> favoring<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.720> favor<00:02:37.020> your

the<00:03:27.510> recoil<00:03:28.320> there's<00:03:28.650> honestly<00:03:29.070> really<00:03:29.610> not

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
the recoil there's honestly really not

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.820

that<00:03:30.030> large<00:03:30.600> of<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.900> recoil<00:03:31.290> it's<00:03:31.440> really<00:03:31.680> easy

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
that large of a recoil it's really easy

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.740

to<00:03:31.950> get<00:03:32.100> used<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:33.150> definitely

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
to get used to and I definitely

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.210 
to get used to and I definitely
recommend<00:03:34.050> this<00:03:34.410> if<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.709> guys<00:03:34.830> don't<00:03:34.980> have

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
for PvE it's like the Fate bringer if

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.420 
for PvE it's like the Fate bringer if
you<00:03:39.420> don't<00:03:39.690> have<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.080> favor<00:03:40.290> use<00:03:40.860> this<00:03:41.100> if<00:03:41.340> you
