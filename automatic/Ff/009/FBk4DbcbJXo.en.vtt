flying<00:01:24.330> down<00:01:24.600> here<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.580> pretty<00:01:26.820> basic<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
flying down here so it's pretty basic to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.600 
flying down here so it's pretty basic to
spawn<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.530> took<00:01:28.740> me<00:01:28.920> time<00:01:29.100> before<00:01:29.579> I

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
spawn it in it took me time before I

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.700 
spawn it in it took me time before I
found<00:01:29.850> out<00:01:30.000> how<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.270> spawn<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.110> it's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
found out how to spawn it in but it's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.749 
found out how to spawn it in but it's
just<00:01:32.100> soul<00:01:32.579> signed<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:35.729> wither<00:01:36.060> skull

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
just soul signed and the wither skull

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.130 
just soul signed and the wither skull
because<00:01:38.759> you're<00:01:39.060> going<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.240> need<00:01:39.509> three<00:01:40.049> of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
because you're going to need three of

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.580 
because you're going to need three of
them<00:01:40.579> so<00:01:41.579> actually<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.119> made<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> fail<00:01:42.689> first<00:01:43.259> I

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
them so actually I made a fail first I

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.429 
them so actually I made a fail first I
thought<00:01:43.920> its<00:01:44.130> what<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:45.270> was<00:01:45.509> like<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:46.909> but

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
thought its what it it was like this but

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.630

that<00:01:49.439> suck<00:01:49.740> when<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.159> looks<00:01:50.430> like<00:01:50.640> penis<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.450> I

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
that suck when it looks like penis so I

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.429 
that suck when it looks like penis so I
thought<00:01:53.640> why<00:01:54.540> not<00:01:54.570> make<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.899> as<00:01:55.110> two<00:01:55.259> iron

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
thought why not make it as two iron

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.690 
thought why not make it as two iron
golem<00:01:56.240> thing<00:01:57.259> so<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.290> made<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.430> and

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
golem thing so I made it like this and

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.179 
golem thing so I made it like this and
when<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.149> put<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.479> here<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.380> see<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.770> weather
