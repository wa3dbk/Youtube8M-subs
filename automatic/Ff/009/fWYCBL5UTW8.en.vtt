00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hey what's up and today a new episode 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.089
 the desk tutorials I'm so halfway 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.340
 again madame so I do not have more 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:13.559
 say so much cold and yes this time 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.030
 again what factor station that would be 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.350
 already a bit stupid when I was 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.940
 only one thing would have done so 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.920
 I'll do a little more now 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.240
 some come and then rails and 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.949
 armor and so on 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.630
 this is going to happen now in the future 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.220
 a bit more common than one 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.740
 a little more of there and now 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.359
 so to speak I just have one of the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.210
 things started at the factory station 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.280
 note is here in creative and have 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.950
 At the beginning of the barrel it looks like that 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.690
 not at least put in the text 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.040
 Of course you have another package 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.059
 texture pack city â€‹â€‹a bit different 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.710
 from here looks just from wieden almost like 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.219
 a barrel in minecraft can look like 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.980
 let's say this quite briefly, we the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.629
 forces animal needs 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.969
 I'll go the ground to ensure no I 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.730
 go over the yes it is so perfect 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.079
 you can take down tree trunks euro me 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.149
 just take oak wood and 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.640
 then you need a wood level too 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.799
 your style is all about wood and wood 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.110
 then you have his barrels to power 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.110
 they now have a few more 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.030
 Ten pieces also what feels good then 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.630
 Let's go inside it is one 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.369
 bit stupid and why we NEN us 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.590
 nice place I have already here full 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.640
 I think I would have really times 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.640
 who cares? 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.840
 Let's do this good here 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.490
 Place the hammer and place well 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.750
 the barrel barrel is of course something 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.000
 store differently 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.770
 what can participate here i can do it 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.840
 click on it and then I have there 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.270
 what I clicked on it 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.490
 right click that's in there and 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.610
 above a small number indicating how 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.319
 a lot i can only do one thing 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.149
 Just pack a thing if I'm there now 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.009
 what to do with it then it is not there 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.460
 me again a capital indicated 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.759
 just go in stones so completely again 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.450
 We'll just come to stones and look 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.759
 times a 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.000
 we can even more than first 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.280
 do it purely and do a lot 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.959
 I do not even know 64 6 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.180
 or so we can all there 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.239
 place rows and that would never happen 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.170
 because I'm so sure 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:21.900
 256 stone left left is creative on it 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.720
 Mode that is not so good about it 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.590
 I do that again three sticks 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.260
 pure or good 46 and I think tomorrow 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.670
 creative mode rausmachen to here 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.459
 left click I can always steak after 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.750
 get others out of the way and we have 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.760
 that's good then we'll do it 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.380
 well, in a nutshell, I'll be fine 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.370
 must show what then quite useful 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.650
 is ultimately the mode is so 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.859
 mode factory station is with it 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.870
 compatible with these subjects, so to speak 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.329
 So with the fashion of these creatures here 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.709
 makes and namely the pneumatic tubes there 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.150
 I've already done something like 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.340
 you see, it does not work cool 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.100
 I just have to creative for a short time 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.000
 mode to do otherwise I lose to it 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.730
 I had to pick up a few more 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.880
 you feel good there you do that 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.079
 at matic tubes we have here and there 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.880
 make it so easy times the inside 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.200
 or output seems to be too 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.120
 It's also a bit logical 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.160
 actually I have to get a barrel now 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.989
 let's say so 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.790
 and yes, we'll just do it differently 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.420
 I need certainly a tool 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.260
 here 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.260
 one 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.090
 that's why I'm not on my god 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.530
 the tool as is the tool too 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.420
 what I'm not doing me so 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.220
 awkward come here we go 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.890
 like no one else wants here 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.780
 Now here again I have it 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.730
 Now , do not get it wrong 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.780
 we just take courage here 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:56.890
 a button on it and good is the button 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.750
 and then tips simply fix and 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.730
 then of course a turbo s comes in like that 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:08.220
 Let's see, it does not work 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:16.959
 we stone times stone stone steel 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:18.579
 stone stone really was wrong small 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.229
 moment so I'm there I have 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.660
 of course the stupidest mistakes again 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.630
 ever made my mistake the output 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.250
 i am mine the input is up and 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.410
 that's why it did not work if we did 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.210
 what wanted to get out and the output too 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.560
 say is down that means if i am now 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.220
 here on this bridge come here stones 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.050
 out below and in the crate pure 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.720
 that means if I press here then 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.740
 if they do not come from here then that works 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.330
 I would not have to be here again 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.550
 maybe use a retriever or 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.500
 maybe I'll take that away 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.160
 we maybe smarter yes that we 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.889
 Maybe yes and of course the pipes 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:59.250
 sit properly and maybe it works 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:59.250
 yes then come on 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.300
 so is in it says go tell 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.850
 affiliated 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.380
 so if we want to do something clean 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.050
 up in when we lead us out 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.490
 want to get out there so that's you 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.320
 So as you said you can now 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.479
 Retrievers use there are gates too 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.479
 and you can use a filter there 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:25.370
 There's also a tutorial and I'm 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.139
 but still a little colds so good 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.600
 that works well that works 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.490
 useful agree partially to lighter 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.810
 to save things there now that there are now 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.639
 no big tour leader the convention 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.590
 You have to give yourself a bit more 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.900
 Actually, change keeps changing how could 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.510
 something like this as an image is that 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.520
 I wanted to say that's always a 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.750
 beautiful nice opportunity 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.539
 save things 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.740
 and now we have the barrels where we are 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.479
 can do a great deal in it 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.370
 I do not know if that works now 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.880
 I killed 111 times no 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:01.340
 does not work well but you can see 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.930
 that recording is quite nice so 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.490
 It is quite nice to record videos 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.960
 You always see how many stacks in there 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.270
 there you can always count better 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.580
 with and if that is not in full strength 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.260
 is then just plus and the number like that 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.120
 that's just good that was the tutorial 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.830
 to the barrel because you still have questions 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.370
 you are welcome to ask if you want 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.120
 you can also write in the 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.340
 Comments 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.539
 and if it was helpful I 'm sorry 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.820
 that would help 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:28.570
 and then I would say to you 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.570
 next episode
