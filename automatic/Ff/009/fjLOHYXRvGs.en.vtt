00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
factor analysis no no I think he's just

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.150 
factor analysis no no I think he's just
a<00:00:38.850> year<00:00:39.059> removed<00:00:39.329> from<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.930> injuries<00:00:40.350> he's

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
a year removed from the injuries he's

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.400 
a year removed from the injuries he's
growing<00:00:41.940> all<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.120> time<00:00:42.239> he's<00:00:42.600> improving<00:00:43.170> he's

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
growing all the time he's improving he's

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.750 
growing all the time he's improving he's
he's<00:00:44.280> maturing<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> leader<00:00:46.280> he's<00:00:47.280> just

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
he's maturing as a leader he's just

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.459 
he's maturing as a leader he's just
getting<00:00:47.940> better<00:00:48.059> he's<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.020> prime<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.260> his

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
getting better he's in the prime of his

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.959 
getting better he's in the prime of his
career<00:00:49.649> right<00:00:50.010> now<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.190> think<00:00:50.520> what<00:00:50.670> he<00:00:50.730> went

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
career right now I think what he went

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.360 
career right now I think what he went
through<00:00:51.149> last<00:00:51.180> year<00:00:51.719> was<00:00:52.530> frustrating<00:00:53.160> for

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
through last year was frustrating for

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.939 
through last year was frustrating for
him<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> think<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.059> drove<00:00:54.329> him<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.920> have<00:00:55.920> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
him and I think that drove him to have a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.220 
him and I think that drove him to have a
good<00:00:56.070> hard-working<00:00:56.850> summer<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.930> don't<00:00:58.109> think

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
good hard-working summer I don't think

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.840 
good hard-working summer I don't think
it's<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.440> contract<00:00:58.890> at<00:00:59.039> all<00:00:59.160> i<00:00:59.190> think<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.579> who

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
it's a contract at all i think it's who

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.180 
it's a contract at all i think it's who
he<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.149> he<00:01:00.570> wants<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.930> be<00:01:00.960> good<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.980> do<00:01:02.100> you

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
think he spent a lot of time with Brad

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.700 
think he spent a lot of time with Brad
this<00:02:00.630> summer<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.110> they've<00:02:01.259> talked<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.590> lot

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
this summer and they've talked a lot

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.590 
this summer and they've talked a lot
about<00:02:01.770> basketball<00:02:02.189> brad<00:02:02.820> has<00:02:03.000> individually

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
about basketball brad has individually

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.670 
about basketball brad has individually
got<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.960> court<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.350> they've<00:02:04.469> worked

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
got on the court and they've worked

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.140 
got on the court and they've worked
really<00:02:04.829> hard<00:02:05.070> together

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
really hard together

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.940 
really hard together
I think<00:02:07.420> that<00:02:07.450> mutual<00:02:07.930> respect<00:02:08.350> is<00:02:08.500> growing

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
I think that mutual respect is growing

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.420 
I think that mutual respect is growing
by<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.250> day<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:10.210> just<00:02:11.080> think<00:02:11.320> that<00:02:11.530> uh<00:02:11.590> he's

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
by the day and I just think that uh he's

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.270 
by the day and I just think that uh he's
in<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.610> really<00:02:12.790> good<00:02:12.970> place<00:02:14.130> rumors<00:02:15.130> of

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
in a really good place rumors of

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.700 
in a really good place rumors of
surrounded<00:02:15.820> him<00:02:15.970> since<00:02:16.270> four<00:02:17.080> years<00:02:17.290> do<00:02:17.650> you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
surrounded him since four years do you

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.260 
surrounded him since four years do you
expect<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.130> be<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:18.520> whatever<00:02:18.850> reason

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
expect that to be for whatever reason

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.910 
expect that to be for whatever reason
yeah<00:02:19.540> but<00:02:20.140> do<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.260> expect<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.680> be<00:02:20.800> even

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
yeah but do you expect it to be even

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.260 
yeah but do you expect it to be even
more<00:02:21.130> amplified<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:21.730> year<00:02:21.880> coming<00:02:22.030> in<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.240> a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
more amplified this year coming in to a

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
more amplified this year coming in to a
concert<00:02:22.600> oh<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:23.590> mean<00:02:23.770> it's<00:02:24.150> yeah<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.570> guess<00:02:26.050> so

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
concert oh I mean it's yeah I guess so

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.090 
concert oh I mean it's yeah I guess so
just<00:02:26.860> because<00:02:27.190> i<00:02:27.220> think<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.980> know

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
just because i think that the you know

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.400 
just because i think that the you know
there's<00:02:30.310> been<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:31.000> lot<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.570> people<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:32.110> just

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
there's been a lot of people that just

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.470 
there's been a lot of people that just
have<00:02:32.500> flat-out<00:02:33.130> made<00:02:33.490> stuff<00:02:33.790> up<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.330> it's

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
have flat-out made stuff up and it's

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.990 
have flat-out made stuff up and it's
become<00:02:34.870> hot<00:02:35.080> topics<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.800> very<00:02:36.610> credible

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
become hot topics and very credible

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.570 
become hot topics and very credible
people<00:02:37.270> have<00:02:37.660> made<00:02:37.840> things<00:02:38.080> up<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:39.550> even

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
people have made things up and that even

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.190 
people have made things up and that even
makes<00:02:39.970> it<00:02:40.120> worse<00:02:40.270> so<00:02:40.540> yeah<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.720> think<00:02:40.870> that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
makes it worse so yeah I think that

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.750 
makes it worse so yeah I think that
there's<00:02:41.380> probably<00:02:41.709> a<00:02:41.950> lot<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.400> people<00:02:42.670> out

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
there's probably a lot of people out

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.400 
there's probably a lot of people out
there<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:43.090> still<00:02:43.209> have<00:02:43.780> some<00:02:44.080> sort<00:02:44.320> of

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
there that still have some sort of

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.520 
there that still have some sort of
belief<00:02:44.770> that<00:02:45.190> there<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.209> some<00:02:46.450> truth<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.140> in

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
belief that there is some truth and in

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.070 
belief that there is some truth and in
the<00:02:47.800> rumors<00:02:48.130> that<00:02:48.280> go<00:02:48.400> on<00:02:48.550> out<00:02:48.760> there<00:02:48.790> but<00:02:49.240> I

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
the rumors that go on out there but I
