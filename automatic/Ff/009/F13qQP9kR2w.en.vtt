so I push that so for the end for this
case<00:01:40.730> I<00:01:41.000> don't<00:01:41.270> really<00:01:41.420> care<00:01:41.630> that<00:01:41.660> you<00:01:41.810> see

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
case I don't really care that you see

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.570 
case I don't really care that you see
the<00:01:42.020> code<00:01:42.200> because<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:43.100> car<00:01:43.310> is<00:01:43.370> gonna<00:01:43.490> be

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
the code because the car is gonna be

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.830 
the code because the car is gonna be
here<00:01:43.790> for<00:01:43.970> a<00:01:44.000> couple<00:01:44.180> hours<00:01:44.330> and<00:01:44.600> we'll<00:01:44.720> come

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
here for a couple hours and we'll come

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.910 
here for a couple hours and we'll come
back<00:01:44.870> and<00:01:45.020> get<00:01:45.260> it<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:45.830> I'm<00:01:46.160> gonna<00:01:46.430> put<00:01:46.790> in<00:01:47.920> nine

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
back and get it so I'm gonna put in nine

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.280 
back and get it so I'm gonna put in nine
six<00:01:49.820> five<00:01:50.630> zero<00:01:51.820> okay<00:01:52.820> that's<00:01:53.510> my<00:01:53.780> code<00:01:54.050> now

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
six five zero okay that's my code now

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.130 
six five zero okay that's my code now
this<00:01:54.470> works<00:01:54.890> just<00:01:55.460> like<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.730> hotel<00:01:56.240> safe<00:01:56.540> so

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
this works just like the hotel safe so

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.810 
this works just like the hotel safe so
you<00:01:57.230> can<00:01:57.470> put<00:01:57.650> any<00:01:57.830> code<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.250> you<00:01:58.400> want<00:01:58.580> in

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
you can put any code that you want in

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.960 
you can put any code that you want in
every<00:01:59.630> time<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.140> if<00:02:00.230> you<00:02:00.320> want<00:02:00.470> to<00:02:00.500> use<00:02:00.680> the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
every time so if you want to use the

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.580 
every time so if you want to use the
90650<00:02:01.970> next<00:02:02.630> time<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:02.960> can<00:02:03.140> if<00:02:03.290> you<00:02:03.380> want<00:02:03.530> to

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
90650 next time you can if you want to

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.330 
90650 next time you can if you want to
use<00:02:03.680> a<00:02:03.710> different<00:02:03.920> code<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.790> can<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:05.360> hit<00:02:05.840> enter

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
use a different code you can I hit enter

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.950 
use a different code you can I hit enter
it's<00:02:07.340> gonna<00:02:07.460> tell<00:02:07.700> me<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:08.000> re-enter<00:02:08.480> the<00:02:08.690> code

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
it's gonna tell me to re-enter the code

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.410 
it's gonna tell me to re-enter the code
for<00:02:09.740> for<00:02:10.250> an<00:02:10.340> example<00:02:10.760> that<00:02:11.030> make<00:02:11.210> sure<00:02:11.330> you

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
for for an example that make sure you

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.980 
for for an example that make sure you
don't<00:02:11.540> make<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.170> mistake<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:13.100> nine<00:02:13.430> six<00:02:14.240> five

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
don't make a mistake so nine six five

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.480 
don't make a mistake so nine six five
zero<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:16.220> now<00:02:16.730> my<00:02:17.000> option<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:17.510> luck<00:02:17.980> so<00:02:18.980> now<00:02:19.190> Oh

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
zero and now my option is luck so now Oh

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.550 
zero and now my option is luck so now Oh
see<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.210> messed<00:02:20.510> something<00:02:20.570> up<00:02:20.870> there<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:21.470> I'm

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
see I messed something up there so I'm

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.800 
see I messed something up there so I'm
gonna<00:02:21.680> retry<00:02:21.980> here<00:02:22.220> oh<00:02:22.430> I<00:02:22.940> hit<00:02:23.150> nine<00:02:23.360> six<00:02:23.600> five

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
gonna retry here oh I hit nine six five

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.220 
gonna retry here oh I hit nine six five
eight<00:02:23.960> so<00:02:24.410> that's<00:02:24.530> why<00:02:24.800> nine<00:02:25.460> six<00:02:25.790> five<00:02:25.970> zero

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
eight so that's why nine six five zero

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.220 
eight so that's why nine six five zero
