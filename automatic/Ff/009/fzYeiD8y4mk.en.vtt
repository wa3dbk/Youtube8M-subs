00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
I'm just going to hop onto this platform

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.070 
I'm just going to hop onto this platform
down<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.540> left<00:03:46.780> here

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
here y on the map so it's right around

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.960 
here y on the map so it's right around
this<00:03:53.240> bend<00:03:53.920> over<00:03:54.920> while<00:03:55.160> we<00:03:55.400> were<00:03:55.490> just<00:03:55.730> stop

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
this bend over while we were just stop

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
at and there's a little pipe through

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.620 
at and there's a little pipe through
here<00:03:59.860> this<00:04:00.860> happens<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.400> be<00:04:01.490> that<00:04:01.610> pipe<00:04:02.150> that

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
here this happens to be that pipe that

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.470 
here this happens to be that pipe that
we<00:04:02.810> saw<00:04:03.050> the<00:04:03.110> datacron<00:04:03.770> in<00:04:04.090> so<00:04:05.090> come<00:04:05.300> on<00:04:05.450> over

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
we saw the datacron in so come on over

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.700 
we saw the datacron in so come on over
drop<00:04:06.260> down<00:04:06.760> there<00:04:07.760> sure<00:04:08.000> your<00:04:08.240> aim<00:04:08.480> plus<00:04:09.200> 2
