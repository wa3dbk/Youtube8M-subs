00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
would say is fuel and in most boats will

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.089 
would say is fuel and in most boats will

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:52.579 
those every say eight months isn't too
bad<00:05:50.369> at<00:05:50.550> all<00:05:50.699> obviously<00:05:51.659> they<00:05:51.990> could<00:05:52.169> say<00:05:52.289> I

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:52.589 
bad at all obviously they could say I

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:55.069 
bad at all obviously they could say I
can<00:05:53.009> vary<00:05:53.490> drastically<00:05:53.879> depending<00:05:54.479> on<00:05:54.899> your

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:55.079 
can vary drastically depending on your

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:57.679 
can vary drastically depending on your
usage<00:05:55.319> of<00:05:55.709> the<00:05:55.860> gas<00:05:56.209> one<00:05:57.209> thing<00:05:57.449> that<00:05:57.599> I<00:05:57.659> just

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:57.689 
usage of the gas one thing that I just

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:59.329 
usage of the gas one thing that I just
mentioned<00:05:58.019> then<00:05:58.319> was<00:05:58.499> the<00:05:58.619> boat<00:05:58.829> license

00:05:59.329 --> 00:05:59.339 
mentioned then was the boat license

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:01.159 
mentioned then was the boat license
which<00:05:59.969> is<00:05:59.999> definitely<00:06:00.360> something<00:06:01.019> to

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
which is definitely something to

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.309 
which is definitely something to
consider<00:06:01.430> now<00:06:02.430> basically<00:06:02.849> a<00:06:03.180> boat<00:06:03.479> license<00:06:03.990> is

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 
consider now basically a boat license is

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.709 
consider now basically a boat license is
not<00:06:05.009> really<00:06:05.339> a<00:06:05.369> license<00:06:05.879> as<00:06:06.029> in<00:06:06.149> you're<00:06:06.509> able

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
not really a license as in you're able

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:09.049 
not really a license as in you're able
to<00:06:06.959> drive<00:06:07.259> this<00:06:07.529> but<00:06:07.949> then<00:06:08.399> equivalent<00:06:08.909> of

00:06:09.049 --> 00:06:09.059 
to drive this but then equivalent of

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:11.329 
to drive this but then equivalent of
road<00:06:09.360> tax<00:06:09.629> I<00:06:09.959> suppose<00:06:10.289> where<00:06:10.680> you're

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:11.339 
road tax I suppose where you're

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:13.489 
road tax I suppose where you're
basically<00:06:11.550> paying<00:06:11.999> your<00:06:12.449> money<00:06:12.749> for<00:06:13.199> the<00:06:13.229> up

00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:13.499 
basically paying your money for the up

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:16.369 
basically paying your money for the up
to<00:06:13.529> the<00:06:13.860> canal<00:06:14.309> network<00:06:14.729> and<00:06:15.110> obviously<00:06:16.110> but

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:16.379 
to the canal network and obviously but

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:18.439 
to the canal network and obviously but
being<00:06:17.009> able<00:06:17.129> to<00:06:17.309> use<00:06:17.550> it<00:06:17.759> and<00:06:17.879> have<00:06:18.119> these

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:18.449 
being able to use it and have these

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.309 
being able to use it and have these
wonderful<00:06:18.749> sort<00:06:19.289> of<00:06:19.349> experiences<00:06:20.449> on<00:06:21.449> a<00:06:22.139> boat

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 
wonderful sort of experiences on a boat

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.980 
wonderful sort of experiences on a boat
like<00:06:22.499> Tilly<00:06:22.919> that<00:06:23.369> is<00:06:23.729> a<00:06:23.759> yearly<00:06:24.149> cost<00:06:24.509> of<00:06:24.779> at

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
like Tilly that is a yearly cost of at

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.139 
like Tilly that is a yearly cost of at
the<00:06:25.110> minute<00:06:25.409> around<00:06:25.709> five<00:06:26.249> hundred<00:06:26.279> and<00:06:26.699> fifty

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:27.149 
the minute around five hundred and fifty

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:30.379 
the minute around five hundred and fifty
pound<00:06:27.389> to<00:06:27.539> think<00:06:27.749> and<00:06:29.059> obviously<00:06:30.059> you<00:06:30.209> pay

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:30.389 
pound to think and obviously you pay

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.569 
pound to think and obviously you pay
that<00:06:30.629> every<00:06:31.050> year<00:06:31.229> and<00:06:31.680> obviously<00:06:31.829> the<00:06:32.159> prices

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:32.579 
that every year and obviously the prices

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:35.449 
that every year and obviously the prices
vary<00:06:33.240> for<00:06:33.689> various<00:06:34.079> reasons<00:06:34.589> and<00:06:34.860> you<00:06:35.279> can

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:35.459 
vary for various reasons and you can

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:37.009 
vary for various reasons and you can
imagine<00:06:35.639> it's<00:06:35.999> the<00:06:36.089> sort<00:06:36.300> of<00:06:36.329> thing<00:06:36.389> that<00:06:36.539> over

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:37.019 
imagine it's the sort of thing that over

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:40.999 
imagine it's the sort of thing that over
time<00:06:37.199> is<00:06:37.469> gonna<00:06:37.680> rise<00:06:38.039> and<00:06:38.339> rise<00:06:38.490> and<00:06:39.449> if<00:06:39.930> I<00:06:40.680> had

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.009 
time is gonna rise and rise and if I had

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:42.649 
time is gonna rise and rise and if I had
a<00:06:41.039> much<00:06:41.309> bigger<00:06:41.519> boat<00:06:41.819> then<00:06:42.180> you<00:06:42.209> could<00:06:42.539> be

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:42.659 
a much bigger boat then you could be

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:43.980 
a much bigger boat then you could be
looking<00:06:42.779> at<00:06:42.990> a<00:06:43.050> thousand<00:06:43.439> pounds

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
looking at a thousand pounds

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.900 
looking at a thousand pounds
so<00:06:44.650> these<00:06:44.889> are<00:06:45.100> the<00:06:45.190> sorts<00:06:45.490> of<00:06:45.580> things<00:06:45.789> that

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910 
so these are the sorts of things that

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.999 
so these are the sorts of things that
you<00:06:46.180> should<00:06:46.419> be<00:06:46.449> researching<00:06:47.020> into<00:06:47.560> before

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:48.009 
you should be researching into before

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:50.370 
you should be researching into before
you<00:06:48.130> think<00:06:48.400> right<00:06:49.240> nothing's<00:06:49.750> gonna<00:06:49.930> cost<00:06:50.139> me

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
you think right nothing's gonna cost me

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.650 
you think right nothing's gonna cost me
any<00:06:50.530> money<00:06:50.800> but<00:06:51.460> I'll<00:06:51.580> let<00:06:51.789> you<00:06:51.850> research<00:06:52.360> into

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660 
any money but I'll let you research into

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.300 
any money but I'll let you research into
that<00:06:52.690> so<00:06:53.020> you<00:06:53.080> can<00:06:53.319> figure<00:06:53.500> out<00:06:53.620> yourself<00:06:54.069> how

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310 
that so you can figure out yourself how

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.680 
that so you can figure out yourself how
much<00:06:54.520> and<00:06:54.729> sort<00:06:54.910> of<00:06:54.970> boat<00:06:55.120> you're<00:06:55.300> after<00:06:55.509> that

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690 
much and sort of boat you're after that

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.420 
much and sort of boat you're after that
might<00:06:55.840> cost<00:06:56.080> you<00:06:56.319> on<00:06:56.470> a<00:06:56.500> yearly<00:06:56.710> basis<00:06:57.280> and

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430 
might cost you on a yearly basis and

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.490 
might cost you on a yearly basis and
really<00:06:58.300> the<00:06:58.479> only<00:06:58.750> other<00:06:58.870> thing<00:06:59.080> is<00:06:59.319> any

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
really the only other thing is any

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.499 
really the only other thing is any
general<00:07:00.400> maintenance<00:07:00.910> that<00:07:01.060> you<00:07:01.150> might<00:07:01.300> want

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:01.509 
general maintenance that you might want

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:03.839 
general maintenance that you might want
doing<00:07:01.810> mean<00:07:02.319> for<00:07:02.620> example<00:07:03.099> this<00:07:03.400> boat<00:07:03.669> was

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:03.849 
doing mean for example this boat was

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:05.969 
doing mean for example this boat was
replated<00:07:04.750> when<00:07:05.050> I<00:07:05.080> bought<00:07:05.380> it<00:07:05.410> which<00:07:05.800> was

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:05.979 
replated when I bought it which was

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:07.290 
replated when I bought it which was
something<00:07:06.190> I<00:07:06.400> was<00:07:06.490> very<00:07:06.520> interested<00:07:06.970> in

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:07.300 
something I was very interested in

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.540 
something I was very interested in
having<00:07:07.479> so<00:07:08.229> hopefully<00:07:08.860> once<00:07:09.130> again

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.550 
having so hopefully once again

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.150 
having so hopefully once again
touchwood<00:07:09.970> that<00:07:10.780> means<00:07:11.110> that<00:07:11.500> I<00:07:11.680> won't<00:07:11.979> have

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 
touchwood that means that I won't have

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.070 
touchwood that means that I won't have
to<00:07:12.310> do<00:07:12.460> any<00:07:12.639> major<00:07:12.970> way<00:07:13.330> through<00:07:13.720> it<00:07:13.840> for<00:07:14.050> a

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 
to do any major way through it for a

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.129 
to do any major way through it for a
long<00:07:14.289> time<00:07:14.319> and<00:07:15.130> it<00:07:15.250> should<00:07:15.460> touch<00:07:16.060> one<00:07:16.360> stay

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:17.139 
long time and it should touch one stay

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:19.890 
long time and it should touch one stay
afloat<00:07:17.560> for<00:07:17.949> a<00:07:17.979> long<00:07:18.190> time<00:07:18.490> and<00:07:19.389> that's

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:19.900 
afloat for a long time and that's

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.930 
afloat for a long time and that's
something<00:07:19.990> that<00:07:20.320> you<00:07:20.710> do<00:07:20.860> have<00:07:21.009> to<00:07:21.160> do<00:07:21.310> every

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:21.940 
something that you do have to do every

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.999 
something that you do have to do every
now<00:07:22.090> and<00:07:22.240> then<00:07:22.360> is<00:07:22.720> get<00:07:23.349> it<00:07:23.470> out<00:07:23.560> of<00:07:23.620> the<00:07:23.830> water

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:24.009 
now and then is get it out of the water

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:26.219 
now and then is get it out of the water
and<00:07:24.370> after<00:07:24.639> the<00:07:24.729> bottom<00:07:25.150> painted<00:07:25.630> stop<00:07:26.080> it

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:26.229 
and after the bottom painted stop it

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:28.920 
and after the bottom painted stop it
resting<00:07:26.680> away<00:07:26.919> and<00:07:27.849> that's<00:07:28.509> the<00:07:28.660> sort<00:07:28.870> of

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:28.930 
resting away and that's the sort of

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.870 
resting away and that's the sort of
thing<00:07:29.139> that<00:07:29.169> once<00:07:30.070> again<00:07:30.310> you<00:07:30.490> could<00:07:30.639> be<00:07:30.669> like

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 
thing that once again you could be like

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.120 
thing that once again you could be like
in<00:07:31.000> between<00:07:31.120> five<00:07:31.870> hundred<00:07:31.900> thousand<00:07:32.889> pound

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.130 
in between five hundred thousand pound

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.310 
in between five hundred thousand pound
for<00:07:33.490> some<00:07:34.360> people<00:07:34.690> say<00:07:34.990> that<00:07:35.020> that's

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:35.320 
for some people say that that's

for some people say that that's
something<00:07:35.710> you<00:07:35.800> should<00:07:35.830> do<00:07:36.070> every<00:07:36.430> year

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 
something you should do every year

personally<00:07:44.650> I'd<00:07:44.860> say<00:07:45.069> if<00:07:45.250> I<00:07:45.400> could<00:07:45.580> afford<00:07:45.909> it

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:46.419 
personally I'd say if I could afford it

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:49.379 
personally I'd say if I could afford it
and<00:07:47.070> reasonably<00:07:48.070> get<00:07:48.250> two<00:07:48.400> marinas<00:07:48.880> to<00:07:49.060> do<00:07:49.210> it

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:49.389 
and reasonably get two marinas to do it

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:51.839 
and reasonably get two marinas to do it
I<00:07:49.630> would<00:07:50.229> love<00:07:50.680> to<00:07:50.860> do<00:07:50.979> it<00:07:51.130> every<00:07:51.430> year<00:07:51.610> just

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:51.849 
I would love to do it every year just

00:07:51.849 --> 00:07:53.790 
I would love to do it every year just
for<00:07:52.000> the<00:07:52.150> safety<00:07:52.750> sake<00:07:53.169> and<00:07:53.380> knowing<00:07:53.650> that

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:53.800 
for the safety sake and knowing that

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.820 
for the safety sake and knowing that
it's<00:07:53.949> done<00:07:54.419> but<00:07:55.419> in<00:07:56.020> actual<00:07:56.409> fact<00:07:56.440> it's

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:56.830 
it's done but in actual fact it's

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.560 
it's done but in actual fact it's
probably<00:07:57.280> gonna<00:07:57.430> be<00:07:57.520> every<00:07:57.820> two<00:07:58.030> years<00:07:58.060> that<00:07:58.509> I

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:58.570 
probably gonna be every two years that I

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.600 
probably gonna be every two years that I
get<00:07:58.840> this<00:07:58.990> painted<00:07:59.469> and<00:07:59.830> the<00:08:00.219> minute<00:08:00.460> she's

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:00.610 
get this painted and the minute she's

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:12.430 
get this painted and the minute she's
looking<00:08:00.880> very<00:08:01.150> rusty<00:08:02.190> anyway<00:08:03.190> moving<00:08:03.400> up

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:12.440
