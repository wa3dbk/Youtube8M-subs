00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.389 
these little rascals and I'm doing it a
little<00:00:49.899> bit<00:00:50.050> different<00:00:50.469> this<00:00:50.620> time<00:00:50.680> we've

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
little bit different this time we've

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.610 
little bit different this time we've
kind<00:00:51.670> of<00:00:51.760> played<00:00:51.969> put<00:00:52.539> these<00:00:52.719> custom<00:00:53.170> content

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
kind of played put these custom content

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.060 
kind of played put these custom content
pieces<00:00:53.890> in<00:00:54.309> in<00:00:55.239> an<00:00:56.020> outfit<00:00:56.320> kind<00:00:56.649> of<00:00:56.710> setting

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
pieces in in an outfit kind of setting

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.650 
pieces in in an outfit kind of setting
almost<00:00:57.399> like<00:00:57.520> a<00:00:57.550> lookbook<00:00:57.760> but<00:00:58.120> not<00:00:58.239> quite<00:00:58.449> and

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
almost like a lookbook but not quite and

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.630 
almost like a lookbook but not quite and
I<00:00:59.440> just<00:00:59.859> think<00:01:00.010> it's<00:01:00.100> kind<00:01:00.250> of<00:01:00.280> a<00:01:00.370> good<00:01:00.460> way<00:01:00.550> to

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
I just think it's kind of a good way to

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.099 
I just think it's kind of a good way to
see<00:01:00.879> what<00:01:01.000> they<00:01:01.090> look<00:01:01.239> like<00:01:01.270> in<00:01:01.570> game<00:01:01.840> and

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
see what they look like in game and

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:03.660 
see what they look like in game and
actually<00:01:02.410> paired<00:01:02.980> with<00:01:03.129> something<00:01:03.519> that

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
actually paired with something that

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.490 
actually paired with something that
makes<00:01:03.850> sense<00:01:04.059> instead<00:01:04.479> of<00:01:04.570> something<00:01:04.960> crazy

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
makes sense instead of something crazy

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.469 
makes sense instead of something crazy
so<00:01:06.369> we're<00:01:06.460> going<00:01:06.550> to<00:01:06.610> go<00:01:06.729> ahead<00:01:06.970> and<00:01:07.180> start<00:01:07.360> off

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
so we're going to go ahead and start off

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.050 
so we're going to go ahead and start off
with<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:07.810> boys<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.890> first<00:01:09.100> piece<00:01:09.550> I<00:01:09.759> really

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
with the boys the first piece I really

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.080 
with the boys the first piece I really
liked<00:01:10.450> it's<00:01:10.660> just<00:01:10.840> as<00:01:10.990> casual<00:01:11.640> I'm<00:01:12.640> sweatshirt

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
liked it's just as casual I'm sweatshirt

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.419 
liked it's just as casual I'm sweatshirt
it<00:01:13.270> comes<00:01:13.479> with<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.380> different<00:01:15.009> types<00:01:15.220> of

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 
it comes with the different types of

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:17.969 
it comes with the different types of
like<00:01:16.090> textures<00:01:16.660> this<00:01:16.840> one<00:01:17.050> here<00:01:17.229> it<00:01:17.440> I<00:01:17.649> think

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
like textures this one here it I think

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.790 
like textures this one here it I think
it<00:01:18.160> is<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.490> London<00:01:19.140> flag<00:01:20.140> texture<00:01:20.590> just

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
it is the London flag texture just

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.339 
it is the London flag texture just
because<00:01:20.950> it<00:01:21.070> says<00:01:21.220> London<00:01:21.550> on<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.179> shirt<00:01:22.390> then

00:01:23.339 --> 00:01:23.349 
because it says London on the shirt then

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.109 
because it says London on the shirt then
we<00:01:23.530> have<00:01:23.709> the<00:01:23.920> one<00:01:24.039> that<00:01:24.160> says<00:01:24.340> sweatshirt
