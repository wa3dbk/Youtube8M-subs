all right so staff obviously what the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.450 
all right so staff obviously what the
PDW<00:01:22.409> now<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.530> attachments<00:01:23.070> are<00:01:23.189> quite

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
PDW now the attachments are quite

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.670 
PDW now the attachments are quite
they're<00:01:24.240> quite<00:01:24.360> stranger<00:01:24.900> guess<00:01:25.080> I've<00:01:25.320> got

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
they're quite stranger guess I've got

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.130 
they're quite stranger guess I've got
FMJ<00:01:26.310> or<00:01:26.640> full<00:01:26.880> metal<00:01:27.180> jacket<00:01:27.570> which<00:01:27.750> obviously

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
FMJ or full metal jacket which obviously

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.569 
FMJ or full metal jacket which obviously
that<00:01:28.350> allows<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.920> shoot<00:01:29.100> through<00:01:29.310> bullets

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
that allows you to shoot through bullets

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.990 
that allows you to shoot through bullets
look<00:01:29.790> shufu<00:01:30.630> like<00:01:31.520> metal<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.729> things<00:01:32.909> like

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
look shufu like metal and things like

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.670 
look shufu like metal and things like
that<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.210> all<00:01:33.840> objects<00:01:34.259> pretty<00:01:34.409> much<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> lot

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
that like all objects pretty much a lot

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.620 
that like all objects pretty much a lot
more<00:01:34.829> easier<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.790> works<00:01:36.030> really<00:01:36.240> well<00:01:36.360> it's

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
more easier it works really well it's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.060 
more easier it works really well it's
probably<00:01:37.049> strengthens<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.619> get<00:01:37.740> them<00:01:37.860> up<00:01:37.950> in

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
probably strengthens to get them up in

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.710 
probably strengthens to get them up in
you<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.310> i<00:01:38.340> obviously<00:01:38.729> i<00:01:39.030> do<00:01:39.090> strafe<00:01:39.540> when

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
killed it's really annoying when that

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:51.920 
killed it's really annoying when that
happens<00:01:51.180> because<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.420> didn't<00:01:51.689> even<00:01:51.810> get<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
happens because you didn't even get the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.289 
happens because you didn't even get the
UAV<00:01:52.350> now<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.950> also<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> extended<00:01:54.000> clip

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
UAV now you also have the extended clip

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.069 
UAV now you also have the extended clip
so<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:54.659> over<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.590> over<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.070> fast<00:01:56.850> fast<00:01:57.750> mag

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
so it's over it's over the fast fast mag

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.249 
so it's over it's over the fast fast mag
or<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.740> extended<00:01:59.130> clip<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.719> the<00:02:00.719> main<00:02:00.960> reason

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
or the extended clip and the main reason

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.690 
or the extended clip and the main reason
i<00:02:01.290> chose<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.590> extended<00:02:02.009> clip<00:02:02.130> was<00:02:02.280> mainly

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
i chose the extended clip was mainly

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.800 
i chose the extended clip was mainly

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
because of Newtonian I'm going to be

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.420 
because of Newtonian I'm going to be
honest<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.229> don't<00:02:04.530> we<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.890> reloading<00:02:05.310> too

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430

I<00:02:11.160> also<00:02:12.120> use<00:02:12.650> perkone<00:02:13.650> greed

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
I also use perkone greed

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.980 
I also use perkone greed
so<00:02:14.460> we<00:02:14.520> use<00:02:14.730> hard<00:02:15.060> line<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.420> ghost<00:02:15.600> obviously

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
so we use hard line and ghost obviously

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.200 
so we use hard line and ghost obviously
for<00:02:16.140> nuketown<00:02:16.320> I<00:02:16.470> switch<00:02:16.740> out<00:02:16.980> ghost<00:02:17.310> for<00:02:17.670> flat

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
for nuketown I switch out ghost for flat

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.640

that<00:03:26.400> but<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.820> probably<00:03:26.970> made<00:03:27.180> them<00:03:27.300> just

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
that but it probably made them just

because<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:52.260> way<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.380> play<00:03:52.620> hard<00:03:52.860> point<00:03:53.070> anyway

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
because the way I play hard point anyway

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.560 
because the way I play hard point anyway
it's<00:03:53.760> it's<00:03:54.390> basically<00:03:54.959> full-on<00:03:55.370> full-on<00:03:56.570> just

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
it's it's basically full-on full-on just

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.199 
it's it's basically full-on full-on just
objective-based<00:03:58.290> because<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.850> way<00:03:59.940> hard

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
objective-based because the way hard

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.360 
objective-based because the way hard
point<00:04:00.450> is<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:01.560> get<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:01.920> much<00:04:02.040> XP

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
get buffed and then I compared them to

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.240 
get buffed and then I compared them to
the<00:05:07.850> old<00:05:08.060> guns<00:05:08.360> or<00:05:08.630> you<00:05:09.140> know<00:05:09.260> if<00:05:09.470> someone's

got a great opinion that the for

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.080 
got a great opinion that the for
instance<00:05:12.020> the<00:05:12.050> MSMC<00:05:12.380> is<00:05:12.560> better<00:05:12.800> than<00:05:12.920> the<00:05:13.090> PDW

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
instance the MSMC is better than the PDW
