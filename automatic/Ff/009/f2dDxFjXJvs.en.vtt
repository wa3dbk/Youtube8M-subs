00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.370 
here is a handy dandy little thickness

sander I need oh yeah that's a thickness
sander<00:00:12.440> most<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.590> us<00:00:13.710> several<00:00:14.040> are<00:00:14.460> aware<00:00:14.910> of

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
sander most of us several are aware of

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.120 
sander most of us several are aware of
the<00:00:15.269> big<00:00:15.480> expensive<00:00:16.379> thickness<00:00:16.710> sander<00:00:16.890> is

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
the big expensive thickness sander is

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.880 
the big expensive thickness sander is
most<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.640> us<00:00:17.760> can<00:00:18.000> afford<00:00:18.150> them<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.900> sure<00:00:19.529> can't

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
most of us can afford them I sure can't

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.720 
most of us can afford them I sure can't
but<00:00:20.850> for<00:00:21.000> small<00:00:21.769> items<00:00:22.769> we<00:00:23.070> don't<00:00:23.250> really<00:00:23.430> need

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
but for small items we don't really need

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.460 
but for small items we don't really need
all<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.449> expense<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:26.550> big<00:00:26.760> one<00:00:27.470> this

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
all that expense of a the big one this

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.939 
all that expense of a the big one this
is<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> an<00:00:29.340> eight<00:00:30.029> segment<00:00:30.420> walnut<00:00:31.170> ring<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.740> do<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
is a an eight segment walnut ring I do a

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.310 
is a an eight segment walnut ring I do a
lot<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.430> segmentation<00:00:33.030> work<00:00:33.480> where<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
lot of of segmentation work where the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.340 
lot of of segmentation work where the
thickness<00:00:34.770> has<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.489> be<00:00:35.610> equal<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.300> both<00:00:36.719> sides

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
thickness has to be equal on both sides

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.830 
thickness has to be equal on both sides
and<00:00:37.739> plane<00:00:38.730> from<00:00:38.969> one<00:00:39.149> side<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.570> other<00:00:40.370> the

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
and plane from one side to the other the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.250 
and plane from one side to the other the
segmentation<00:00:42.840> work<00:00:43.739> does<00:00:43.980> not<00:00:44.160> allow<00:00:44.430> for

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
segmentation work does not allow for

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.040 
segmentation work does not allow for
much<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.469> line<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:47.239> discrepancy<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.570> we

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
much in the line of discrepancy so we

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.630 
much in the line of discrepancy so we
have<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.260> be<00:00:49.379> pretty<00:00:49.559> accurate<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.340> they<00:00:50.489> have

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
have to be pretty accurate and they have

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.479 
have to be pretty accurate and they have
to<00:00:50.760> be<00:00:50.910> cleaned<00:00:51.180> or<00:00:51.420> sand<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.289> properly<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.980> I

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
to be cleaned or sand it properly so I

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.720 
to be cleaned or sand it properly so I
made<00:00:53.730> up<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.149> rig<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:55.129> on<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.460> H

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
made up this little rig and on this H

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.430 
made up this little rig and on this H
segmented<00:00:57.360> ring<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:59.210> want<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.390> make<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.989> exactly

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
segmented ring I want to make it exactly

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.479 
segmented ring I want to make it exactly
flat<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:02.070> each<00:01:02.309> side<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:03.920> even<00:01:04.920> thickness<00:01:05.159> all

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
flat on each side and even thickness all

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.630 
flat on each side and even thickness all
the<00:01:05.610> way<00:01:05.729> around<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.360> what<00:01:06.930> they<00:01:07.020> do<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.640> they

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
the way around so what they do is they

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.690 
the way around so what they do is they
just<00:01:08.930> raised<00:01:09.930> my<00:01:12.890> drill<00:01:13.890> press<00:01:13.920> table<00:01:14.340> up

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
just raised my drill press table up

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.600 
just raised my drill press table up
while<00:01:15.450> sliding<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.380> hoot<00:01:16.560> until<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> can

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
while sliding this in a hoot until I can

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.840 
while sliding this in a hoot until I can
just<00:01:18.390> feel<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.659> touching<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> guy<00:01:19.439> okay<00:01:20.250> once

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
just feel it touching the guy okay once

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.120 
just feel it touching the guy okay once
I<00:01:20.970> feel<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> touch<00:01:21.420> thing<00:01:21.600> i<00:01:21.720> know<00:01:22.170> i'm<00:01:22.380> fine<00:01:22.650> i'm

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
I feel a touch thing i know i'm fine i'm

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.429 
I feel a touch thing i know i'm fine i'm
wanting<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.790> take<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> little<00:01:24.330> bit<00:01:24.540> off<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.170> I'll

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
wanting to take a little bit off so I'll

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.210 
wanting to take a little bit off so I'll
tighten<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:27.390> there<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.770> start<00:01:29.009> up<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
tighten it there and we start up the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.010 
tighten it there and we start up the
drill<00:01:29.430> press

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
drill press

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.570 
drill press
and<00:01:31.579> speed<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.920> as<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.460> hear<00:01:35.820> it

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
and speed it in as you can hear it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.420 
and speed it in as you can hear it
this<00:01:38.210> pink<00:01:38.450> little<00:01:38.960> tail<00:01:39.620> off<00:01:39.770> we<00:01:40.100> don't<00:01:40.310> want

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
this pink little tail off we don't want

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.570 
this pink little tail off we don't want
to<00:01:40.550> take<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.730> lot<00:01:40.970> off<00:01:41.000> anyways<00:01:41.890> no<00:01:42.890> take<00:01:43.250> it<00:01:43.430> out

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
to take a lot off anyways no take it out

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.020 
to take a lot off anyways no take it out
and<00:01:43.850> I'll<00:01:44.600> turn<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.930> over<00:01:45.610> I'll<00:01:46.610> do<00:01:46.760> the<00:01:46.790> other

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
and I'll turn it over I'll do the other

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.470 
and I'll turn it over I'll do the other
side

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.359 

like<00:01:53.780> that

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.960 

and<00:01:59.369> then<00:01:59.549> just<00:01:59.760> to<00:01:59.939> be<00:02:00.090> sure<00:02:01.009> I'll<00:02:02.009> get<00:02:02.909> a

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
and then just to be sure I'll get a

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.440 
and then just to be sure I'll get a
pencil<00:02:03.560> will<00:02:04.560> make<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> little<00:02:05.180> squiggly<00:02:06.180> line

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
pencil will make a little squiggly line

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.740 
pencil will make a little squiggly line
all<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.470> way<00:02:07.770> around<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:09.119> might<00:02:09.330> not<00:02:09.509> show

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
all the way around it might not show

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.390 
all the way around it might not show
very<00:02:09.989> good<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.380> video<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:10.890> guess<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.220> is

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
very good on the video but guess this is

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.510 
very good on the video but guess this is
walnut<00:02:11.670> if<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.630> was<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:13.069> maypole<00:02:14.069> or<00:02:14.250> I'll<00:02:14.370> a

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
walnut if it was a maypole or I'll a

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.090 
walnut if it was a maypole or I'll a
color<00:02:14.790> would<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.120> would<00:02:15.330> show<00:02:15.569> very<00:02:15.900> well<00:02:16.140> and

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
color would it would show very well and

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.350 
color would it would show very well and
we'll<00:02:17.370> run<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.640> back<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:22.550> we're<00:02:23.550> taking<00:02:23.730> very

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
we'll run it back in we're taking very

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.860 
we'll run it back in we're taking very
very<00:02:25.459> small<00:02:26.459> amount<00:02:27.000> off<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:28.850> yes<00:02:29.850> as<00:02:30.209> I

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
very small amount off and yes as I

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.080 
very small amount off and yes as I
