00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.000 
gave me instant relief instance it was
like<00:04:25.280> it<00:04:26.280> was<00:04:26.460> unbelievable<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:28.380> relief<00:04:28.740> that

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
like it was unbelievable the relief that

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.940 
like it was unbelievable the relief that
came<00:04:29.370> over<00:04:29.520> so<00:04:29.940> quickly<00:04:30.380> today<00:04:31.380> at<00:04:31.470> Daniel's

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
came over so quickly today at Daniel's

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.950 
came over so quickly today at Daniel's
and<00:04:32.310> now<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:32.490> know<00:04:32.850> I<00:04:32.880> can't<00:04:33.240> give<00:04:33.419> medical

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
and now I know I can't give medical

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.450 
and now I know I can't give medical
advice<00:04:34.020> over<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.860> Internet

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
advice over the Internet

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.450 
advice over the Internet
so<00:04:35.790> this<00:04:36.000> is<00:04:36.270> just<00:04:36.690> an<00:04:36.930> opinion<00:04:37.530> tigey<00:04:38.070> it<00:04:38.280> for

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
so this is just an opinion tigey it for

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.820 
so this is just an opinion tigey it for
what<00:04:38.610> it's<00:04:38.760> worth<00:04:38.850> it's<00:04:39.540> not<00:04:39.900> medical<00:04:40.500> advice

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
what it's worth it's not medical advice

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.280 
what it's worth it's not medical advice
but<00:04:42.470> Jack<00:04:43.470> Daniels<00:04:44.130> is<00:04:44.520> definitely<00:04:45.450> the<00:04:46.080> way

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
but Jack Daniels is definitely the way

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.360
