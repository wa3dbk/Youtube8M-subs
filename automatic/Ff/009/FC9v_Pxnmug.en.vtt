make<00:04:31.889> sure<00:04:31.919> you<00:04:32.189> crisscross<00:04:32.729> them<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.270> then

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
make sure you crisscross them and then

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.149 
make sure you crisscross them and then
hook<00:04:33.659> them<00:04:33.689> up<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.379> reason<00:04:34.710> you<00:04:34.770> crisscross

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:35.159 
hook them up the reason you crisscross

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:36.950 
hook them up the reason you crisscross
them<00:04:35.430> is<00:04:35.819> because<00:04:36.030> if<00:04:36.270> your<00:04:36.419> trailer<00:04:36.659> ever

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
falls off it will land on the crisscross

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.059 
falls off it will land on the crisscross
part<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.199> it'll<00:04:40.319> stop<00:04:40.560> your<00:04:40.680> trailer<00:04:40.979> from

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
hitting the bottom on this one because

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.679 
hitting the bottom on this one because
this<00:04:43.620> trailer<00:04:44.099> is<00:04:44.129> brakes<00:04:45.000> assigned<00:04:45.389> to<00:04:45.569> it
