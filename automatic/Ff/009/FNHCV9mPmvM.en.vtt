00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.620
 great homemade peppers we are going to 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.950
 check how much iron there really is in 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.950
 the cereals 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.010
 for this we need a little water 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.260
 or a blender if you do not have power 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.220
 buy it down in the description 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.900
 cereals with high iron content 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.180
 we have to look at the box that 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.980
 put at least 11,000 grams and a magnet 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.720
 of neodymium like this if you do not have it 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.340
 you can get it also down in the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.100
 description the first thing we have to 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.580
 do is throw a few cereals in the 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.580
 blender 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.290
 then we throw water 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.760
 we cover it 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.380
 and once we have everything ready what 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.300
 plug in 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.300
 and now you know how to reed 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.670
 we miss him a little more 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.670
 and we keep giving him cane 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.880
 and once we have it ready we're going 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.880
 throwing in the hermetic bag 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.900
 if seen it has been very thick 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.250
 you just give it a little water 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.250
 until it looks like a texture like that 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.750
 and once seen the question is really 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.190
 there is iron that can be there 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.410
 to check it we just have to 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.790
 pass the magnet across the surface of 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.790
 our cereal and water mix 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.330
 Y 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.560
 Y 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.519
 Y 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.310
 Y 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.450
 as we have been able to verify the 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.189
 foods that have a large amount 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.500
 of iron we are really eating 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.450
 the iron, however strange it may seem, but 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.310
 do not worry , iron is great 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.530
 for health helps us transport the 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.120
 oxygen is also essential for 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.040
 some functions of the brain as per 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.480
 example the ability to learn by 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.960
 what you already know before going to class 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.580
 eat many cereals 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.140
 It makes us stronger 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.930
 diseases makes us beat 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.600
 less and also it is very good for hair 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.680

 you have at home so you can check the 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 iron that cereals have though 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.650
 You can also try another type of 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.150
 foods that have high content in 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.850
 iron and especially so do not forget 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.950
