00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:12.049
 Let's start the video. 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:17.960
 m4 Walker Bulldog is a light-crane, but based on quick maneuvering and attack power, 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:22.700
 This can help you move quickly where you need help 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:28.880
 2 Overall orientation is prevalent. If you look at the current situation 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:32.740
 The earthquake is annihilated by the aliens and you can see the occupation hierarchy window 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.740
 I will move to prevent this. 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:47.809
 It's because of the fastest speed because of the self -cup. 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:52.460
 I went crazy and did not get to me fast and fell downwards. 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:57.940
 I can see the rear view and support it quickly . 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.940
 Unfortunately, I failed. I can see seven days. 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:10.680
 I put it in once. 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.620
 Here ally suited to write a nearing to the front and baby 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:19.170
 I'll run quickly. 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:22.670
 Table 6 Typical attacks after c type thrashing 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.670
 Reset signature coloring 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.540
 I easily heard coming 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.290
 I did it once. 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.850
 Tom is there. 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:43.490
 Unfortunately, the last shot did not fail 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:46.190
 After the video starts here , m41 Walker Blue sleeps. 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:52.010
 It's the situation with 10 guns . 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.960
 Even though it's a classic gun, it has a lot of shells in one clip. 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:58.970
 A piece of work to do not much 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:02.080
 The attack is fast and powerful, and the response to the tanks that follow 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:06.010
 That's the advantage. 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:12.220
 Because of the failure of the chaff of the tram 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.660
 m41 Walkerbloom can take part in battle for reloading time in about 36 seconds 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.920
 I will not 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.340
 But there is one more vehicle to support the ally, so we need to move quickly. 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.340
 There is not 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:39.500
 The Aja-tanks are in the public domain. 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:44.900
 However, because the enemy has fired, it is defenseless during reloading time. 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:49.500
 Although the Azzie M Walker Bulldog 2 did not finish sleeping, 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:55.170
 I'll get the enemy tank 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:59.700
 But that party is intensifying enemy tanks attacked a hiding to avoid the other train your Giro 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.640
 Walker bulldog moves faster than m than that 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:08.390
 It was 3 trillion won 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.390
 It succeeded in receiving the attack of access to the prefecture in this way 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.470
 m41 Walker Bulldog is a light vehicle 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:23.090
 In the calculation of two main parts of ah 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:30.310
 There is a role of enemy, 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:34.500
 It is also possible to take advantage of the fact that there is no enemy on the frontline, 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.500
 How does it work itself? 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:52.400
 Now it looks clear. Because the street of the enemy tank is now a little closer. 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:54.700
 Moving the train back a little more , it is not qualified to be found clearly from the enemy 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.700
 I'll try. 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:08.269
 m41 Walker Bulldog's Hill Having a quick address to the stocking address can help you 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.620
 Little that can be safely applied due to the fast continuous shooting 10 feet 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:16.569
 If you fit 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:16.569
 It can do more damage than a medium-sized heavy tank 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.760
 But usually , 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:31.330
 Not a strong honor in battle 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:35.100
 Most of the battles are left to the friendly 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.100
 You will receive reconnaissance assistance. 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:44.190
 m4's walker block is also aggressive 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:50.300
 It is only for the powerful self, but the actual battle begins 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.300
 It is recommended that you do forsake this Whippet arrested gameplay 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:57.830
 Now ever so often find pool 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.830
 To defeat them. 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:05.380
 I do not know exactly one side. 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.720
 I drilled it coolly . 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:12.810
 I attacked. 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.810
 After that, I watched invisibly. 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.080
 Chair and turn sleeping boyija 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.979
 I'll take the promise to the wall. 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.979
 Increasingly gm 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:35.430
 I moved a little bit like this 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:38.269
 When pointed out to discover enemy 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.599
 Upon discovery of the approach 

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:44.379
 In a way that awaits a friendly full support shot 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.379
 You can proceed. 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:06:00.440
 1 operator found 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:00.440
 You can defeat enemy tanks with the support fire of sub- division 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.120
 5 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.120
 U 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:19.290
 Oh well , you can win over the evil driver or enemy tanks fighting power. 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:24.840
 When you reach the step 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:28.420
 Light traction This is where I think it's safe without a great crowd 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:35.920
 It is also the method of occupation 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:41.970
 Whippet referred the case to try the occupation Main Battle Tank is a significant move covers the wire 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.970
 Urgent cases geureotjanahdo Cause gonna enemy in a disadvantageous situation 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:57.080
 Let me put it together. 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:07:01.580
 m4 Walker Bulldog is a light-duty vehicle that uses a high-speed fast stop 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:07.310
 Supportive attack is possible and with high instantaneous firepower 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:13.010
 That is as good as the activity of the higher level of streetcar 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:15.800
 When you move alone, gradually you cry together. When you move 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:23.150
 Focus on supporting attacks 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:27.730
 You will also be easier to remove low-grade highly poisonous to the m41 Walker fire 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.730
 Let's do the actual video here. 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.640
 Look thank you for coming 

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.210
