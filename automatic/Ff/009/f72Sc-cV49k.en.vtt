00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
about this a little bit before so I know

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.560 
about this a little bit before so I know
a<00:01:41.430> little<00:01:41.520> bit<00:01:41.729> about<00:01:41.939> there<00:01:42.150> are<00:01:42.210> no<00:01:42.299> buttons

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
a little bit about there are no buttons

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.380 
a little bit about there are no buttons
on<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> side<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.790> see<00:01:45.119> there's<00:01:45.299> no

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
on the side so you can see there's no

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.850 
on the side so you can see there's no
buttons<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> side<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> power<00:01:46.380> button<00:01:46.649> and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
buttons on the side the power button and

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.490 
buttons on the side the power button and
volume<00:01:46.950> are<00:01:47.369> actually<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.030> back<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.290> let's

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
volume are actually on the back so let's

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.679 
volume are actually on the back so let's
see<00:01:49.680> how<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.920> all<00:01:50.220> right<00:01:50.850> that's<00:01:51.060> actually<00:01:51.450> you

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
see how it all right that's actually you

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.789 
see how it all right that's actually you
know<00:01:51.810> what<00:01:52.020> that's<00:01:52.200> actually<00:01:52.560> pretty

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
know what that's actually pretty

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.310 
know what that's actually pretty
comfortable<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.880> hold<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.390> turn<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
comfortable to hold and turn on the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.080 
comfortable to hold and turn on the
volume<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.740> was<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> little<00:01:56.340> bit<00:01:56.430> skeptical<00:01:56.939> when

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
volume I was a little bit skeptical when

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.810 
volume I was a little bit skeptical when
I<00:01:57.119> read<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.740> that's<00:01:58.740> how<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.549> would<00:01:59.640> be

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
I read that that's how you would be

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.760 
I read that that's how you would be
turning<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.329> off<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.810> know<00:02:00.990> what<00:02:01.170> that

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
turning it on off but you know what that

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.730 
turning it on off but you know what that
is<00:02:01.799> exactly<00:02:02.219> where<00:02:02.640> my<00:02:02.939> index<00:02:03.659> finger<00:02:03.780> would

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
is exactly where my index finger would

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.100 
is exactly where my index finger would
sit<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.700> I'm<00:02:06.030> pretty<00:02:06.509> happy<00:02:06.630> about<00:02:06.899> that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
sit so I'm pretty happy about that

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.400 
sit so I'm pretty happy about that
actually<00:02:08.209> looking<00:02:09.209> at<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.360> camera<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:10.020> looks

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
actually looking at the camera it looks

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.900 
actually looking at the camera it looks
really<00:02:10.860> nice<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.280> don't<00:02:11.430> know

of getting used to using a screen where

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.280 
of getting used to using a screen where
you<00:02:47.940> know<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.060> have<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.480> kind<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.750> reach<00:02:48.960> it<00:02:49.140> kind

of got used to using it where I do kind

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.240 
of got used to using it where I do kind
of<00:02:51.540> have<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.690> move<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.050> in<00:02:52.170> my<00:02:52.320> hand<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.890> phone

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
of have to move it in my hand I phone

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.220 
of have to move it in my hand I phone
you<00:02:53.550> know<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:53.970> could<00:02:54.180> reach<00:02:54.330> anywhere<00:02:54.810> with<00:02:55.050> it

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
you know I could reach anywhere with it

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.930 
you know I could reach anywhere with it
with<00:02:55.830> my<00:02:56.010> thumb<00:02:56.040> without<00:02:56.370> having<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.790> really

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
with my thumb without having to really

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.450 
with my thumb without having to really
maneuver<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.840> but<00:02:58.050> here<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.920> know<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.070> learn

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
maneuver it but here you know you learn

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.060 
maneuver it but here you know you learn
to<00:02:59.490> kind<00:02:59.850> of<00:02:59.940> hold<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.240> a<00:03:00.300> certain<00:03:00.510> way<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:01.110> I

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
to kind of hold it a certain way so I

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.550 
to kind of hold it a certain way so I
think<00:03:02.610> it's<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.790> lot<00:03:02.940> easier<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.510> go<00:03:03.720> from<00:03:03.960> that

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
think it's a lot easier to go from that

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.680 
think it's a lot easier to go from that
the<00:03:04.830> nexus<00:03:05.130> 5<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:05.880> and<00:03:06.330> we<00:03:06.420> can<00:03:06.540> talk<00:03:06.630> more

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
the nexus 5 to this and we can talk more

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.990 
the nexus 5 to this and we can talk more
about<00:03:06.960> this<00:03:07.230> in<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.650> bit<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.040> we<00:03:08.340> will<00:03:08.550> move<00:03:08.760> on

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
about this in a bit and we will move on

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.970 
about this in a bit and we will move on
to<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.510> accessories<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.560> stuff<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.770> comes

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
to the accessories and stuff that comes

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.280 
to the accessories and stuff that comes
with<00:03:11.190> it<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:11.970> again<00:03:12.420> we<00:03:12.540> have<00:03:12.630> this<00:03:12.750> nice<00:03:12.960> red

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
with it so again we have this nice red

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.110 
with it so again we have this nice red
box<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.710> actually<00:03:14.070> really<00:03:14.460> like<00:03:14.610> this<00:03:14.640> color<00:03:14.910> it

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
box I actually really like this color it

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.670 
box I actually really like this color it
might<00:03:15.240> seem<00:03:15.420> like<00:03:15.570> a<00:03:15.600> minor<00:03:15.810> point<00:03:16.110> but<00:03:16.320> I

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
might seem like a minor point but I

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.620 
might seem like a minor point but I
think<00:03:16.860> it's<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.010> really<00:03:17.040> nice<00:03:17.340> touch<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:18.390> here

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
think it's a really nice touch so here

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.140 
think it's a really nice touch so here
we<00:03:18.750> have<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:20.190> charger<00:03:20.490> of<00:03:20.880> course<00:03:21.410> the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
we have the charger of course the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.170 
we have the charger of course the
microUSB<00:03:24.150> is<00:03:24.390> this<00:03:25.230> see<00:03:25.530> now<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:26.610> it's<00:03:26.850> micro

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
microUSB is this see now it's it's micro

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.710 
microUSB is this see now it's it's micro
USB<00:03:27.510> it's<00:03:27.780> not<00:03:28.459> not<00:03:29.459> USBC<00:03:29.820> unfortunately<00:03:30.600> but

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
USB it's not not USBC unfortunately but

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.300 
USB it's not not USBC unfortunately but
you<00:03:30.870> know<00:03:30.990> what<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:31.680> can't<00:03:31.920> really<00:03:32.070> complain

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
you know what you can't really complain

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.520 
you know what you can't really complain
and<00:03:33.380> next<00:03:34.380> we<00:03:34.500> have<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:35.420> this<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.930> battery<00:03:37.320> or

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
and next we have is this the battery or

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.000 
and next we have is this the battery or
a<00:03:37.560> spare<00:03:37.950> battery<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:40.230> know<00:03:40.380> what<00:03:40.560> I'm<00:03:40.770> not

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
a spare battery you know what I'm not

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.570 
a spare battery you know what I'm not
sure<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:42.050> think<00:03:43.050> this<00:03:43.170> is<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.560> battery<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:44.190> don't

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
sure I think this is the battery I don't

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.020 
sure I think this is the battery I don't
I<00:03:45.260> don't<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.739> doubt<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.520> would<00:03:47.580> come<00:03:47.850> with<00:03:48.000> a

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
I don't I I doubt it would come with a

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.120 
I don't I I doubt it would come with a
spare<00:03:48.480> battery<00:03:48.660> right<00:03:49.050> let's<00:03:49.800> see<00:03:49.890> if<00:03:49.980> there's

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
spare battery right let's see if there's

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.560 
spare battery right let's see if there's
anything<00:03:50.310> underneath<00:03:50.610> here<00:03:51.030> probably<00:03:51.450> not

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
anything underneath here probably not

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.229 
anything underneath here probably not
that<00:03:52.470> doesn't<00:03:52.709> look<00:03:52.770> like<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.070> okay<00:03:53.430> so<00:03:54.209> all

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
that doesn't look like it okay so all

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.860 
that doesn't look like it okay so all
right<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:54.630> basically<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.560> box<00:03:56.390> I<00:03:57.390> don't<00:03:57.780> know

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
right so basically the box I don't know

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.910 
right so basically the box I don't know
if<00:03:57.989> this<00:03:58.110> is<00:03:58.140> going<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.380> be<00:03:58.440> different<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:58.860> think

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
if this is going to be different I think

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.270 
if this is going to be different I think
some<00:03:59.430> people<00:03:59.760> have<00:04:00.510> reported<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.830> don't

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
some people have reported the I don't

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.080 
some people have reported the I don't
know<00:04:02.340> if<00:04:02.400> this<00:04:02.489> is<00:04:02.520> the<00:04:02.610> trial<00:04:03.000> version

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
know if this is the trial version

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.520 
know if this is the trial version

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
I could you know it's not that much

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.170 
I could you know it's not that much
heavier<00:04:40.949> with<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.160> battery<00:04:41.460> it<00:04:41.880> feels<00:04:42.120> very

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
heavier with the battery it feels very

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.170 
heavier with the battery it feels very
light<00:04:42.509> I'm<00:04:42.780> happy<00:04:43.229> with<00:04:43.320> the<00:04:43.440> weight<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:44.180> yes

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
light I'm happy with the weight and yes

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.749 
light I'm happy with the weight and yes
so<00:04:45.419> this<00:04:46.050> was<00:04:46.259> the<00:04:46.289> battery<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:47.070> would<00:04:47.669> have

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
so this was the battery I would have

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:48.980 
so this was the battery I would have
been<00:04:47.850> surprised<00:04:48.210> if<00:04:48.389> it<00:04:48.479> came<00:04:48.570> with<00:04:48.720> an<00:04:48.780> extra

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
been surprised if it came with an extra

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.499 
been surprised if it came with an extra
battery<00:04:49.169> here<00:04:49.740> we<00:04:49.860> got<00:04:49.979> the<00:04:50.130> micro<00:04:50.490> sim<00:04:50.880> and<00:04:51.210> we

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
battery here we got the micro sim and we

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.450 
battery here we got the micro sim and we
also<00:04:51.630> have<00:04:51.840> a<00:04:51.870> micro<00:04:52.199> SD<00:04:52.259> card<00:04:52.770> slot<00:04:52.889> in<00:04:53.310> here

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
also have a micro SD card slot in here

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.189 
also have a micro SD card slot in here
so<00:04:53.580> that's<00:04:53.729> really<00:04:53.880> cool<00:04:54.150> i<00:04:54.360> think<00:04:54.810> i<00:04:54.960> read

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
so that's really cool i think i read

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.050 
so that's really cool i think i read
that<00:04:55.259> goes<00:04:55.530> up<00:04:55.710> to<00:04:55.830> 128<00:04:56.490> gigabytes<00:04:56.910> it

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
that goes up to 128 gigabytes it

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.500 
that goes up to 128 gigabytes it
supports<00:04:57.479> so<00:04:57.990> that<00:04:58.020> is<00:04:58.500> really<00:04:58.530> cool<00:04:59.070> and

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
supports so that is really cool and

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.000 
supports so that is really cool and
something<00:05:00.510> that<00:05:00.630> my<00:05:00.810> nexus<00:05:01.139> 5<00:05:01.320> does<00:05:01.560> not<00:05:01.740> have

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
something that my nexus 5 does not have

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.060 
something that my nexus 5 does not have
so<00:05:02.430> let's<00:05:03.180> put<00:05:03.360> this<00:05:03.510> back<00:05:03.750> on<00:05:03.780> and<00:05:04.320> see<00:05:04.919> we

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
so let's put this back on and see we

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.129 
so let's put this back on and see we

really<00:05:52.740> come<00:05:52.889> across<00:05:53.010> a<00:05:53.190> phone<00:05:53.520> before<00:05:53.669> that

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
really come across a phone before that

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.689 
really come across a phone before that
has<00:05:54.510> no<00:05:54.870> buttons<00:05:55.229> on<00:05:55.500> the<00:05:55.650> side<00:05:55.830> whatsoever

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
has no buttons on the side whatsoever

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.170 
has no buttons on the side whatsoever
there<00:05:57.000> are<00:05:57.030> none<00:05:57.389> and<00:05:57.659> the<00:05:58.530> all<00:05:59.220> right<00:05:59.400> so<00:05:59.430> the

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
there are none and the all right so the

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.750 
there are none and the all right so the
mic<00:06:00.840> port<00:06:01.229> is<00:06:01.349> on<00:06:01.470> the<00:06:01.560> bottom<00:06:01.860> the<00:06:02.430> headphone

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
mic port is on the bottom the headphone

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.060 
mic port is on the bottom the headphone
port<00:06:03.000> rather<00:06:03.180> so<00:06:03.750> that's<00:06:03.930> that's<00:06:04.710> something

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
port rather so that's that's something

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.680 
port rather so that's that's something
that<00:06:05.099> the<00:06:05.250> iphone<00:06:05.580> adds<00:06:05.789> that<00:06:05.970> the<00:06:06.030> nexus<00:06:06.479> is

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
that the iphone adds that the nexus is

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.420 
that the iphone adds that the nexus is
on<00:06:06.810> the<00:06:06.930> top<00:06:07.110> I<00:06:07.440> think<00:06:07.830> I<00:06:07.860> actually<00:06:07.949> preferred

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
on the top I think I actually preferred

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.000 
on the top I think I actually preferred
on<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:08.669> bottom<00:06:08.970> so<00:06:09.120> that's<00:06:09.270> good<00:06:09.510> and<00:06:09.750> i<00:06:10.710> guess

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
on the bottom so that's good and i guess

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.110 
on the bottom so that's good and i guess
it<00:06:11.130> was<00:06:11.159> not<00:06:11.340> really<00:06:11.520> much<00:06:11.639> else<00:06:11.699> to<00:06:11.940> talk

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
it was not really much else to talk

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.010 
it was not really much else to talk
about<00:06:12.300> it<00:06:12.449> looks<00:06:12.599> like<00:06:12.690> there's<00:06:12.870> two

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
about it looks like there's two

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.830 
about it looks like there's two
different<00:06:13.199> leds<00:06:13.620> one<00:06:14.520> this<00:06:15.479> is<00:06:15.570> a<00:06:15.599> feature

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
different leds one this is a feature

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.420 
different leds one this is a feature
we've<00:06:16.080> been<00:06:16.229> seeing<00:06:16.440> some<00:06:16.800> phones<00:06:17.010> recently

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
we've been seeing some phones recently

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.350 
we've been seeing some phones recently
on<00:06:17.520> the<00:06:17.550> iphone<00:06:17.940> for<00:06:18.900> different<00:06:19.830> lighting

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
on the iphone for different lighting

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.189

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
situations and there's also i believe a

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:28.279 
situations and there's also i believe a

it<00:06:49.730> seems<00:06:50.000> to<00:06:50.180> be<00:06:50.210> something<00:06:50.540> that<00:06:51.320> they<00:06:51.560> are

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
it seems to be something that they are

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.540 
it seems to be something that they are
you<00:06:52.730> know<00:06:52.850> going<00:06:53.420> after<00:06:53.900> and<00:06:54.200> promoting<00:06:55.100> so

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
you know going after and promoting so

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.980 
you know going after and promoting so
I'm<00:06:55.640> going<00:06:55.760> to<00:06:55.790> do<00:06:55.970> a<00:06:56.000> lot<00:06:56.360> of<00:06:56.390> testing<00:06:56.840> with

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
I'm going to do a lot of testing with

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.410 
I'm going to do a lot of testing with
the<00:06:57.080> camera<00:06:57.530> a<00:06:57.710> lot<00:06:58.430> of<00:06:58.550> low<00:06:58.700> light<00:06:58.970> testing

00:06:59.410 --> 00:06:59.420 
the camera a lot of low light testing

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.900 
the camera a lot of low light testing
specifically<00:07:00.260> and<00:07:00.500> we'll<00:07:01.430> see<00:07:01.670> how<00:07:01.880> it

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:01.910 
specifically and we'll see how it

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.730 
specifically and we'll see how it
performs<00:07:02.420> so<00:07:02.960> definitely<00:07:03.110> look<00:07:03.440> out<00:07:03.530> for<00:07:03.680> the

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 
performs so definitely look out for the

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.840 
performs so definitely look out for the
four<00:07:03.950> of<00:07:03.980> you<00:07:04.160> in<00:07:04.250> the<00:07:04.310> next<00:07:04.460> few<00:07:04.640> days

four of you in the next few days

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.820
