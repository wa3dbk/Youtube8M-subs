rubber stopper on the bottom of the pike

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.880 
rubber stopper on the bottom of the pike
so<00:00:58.720> we're<00:00:58.900> going<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.140> scratch<00:00:59.380> up<00:00:59.560> the<00:00:59.590> paint

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
so we're going to scratch up the paint

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.680 
so we're going to scratch up the paint
on<00:01:00.070> it

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.660 

and<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:05.500> whole<00:01:05.710> thing<00:01:05.740> breaks<00:01:06.190> down<00:01:06.400> into

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
and the whole thing breaks down into

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.110 
and the whole thing breaks down into
three<00:01:07.390> separate<00:01:07.750> pieces<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.440> pike<00:01:08.620> itself

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
three separate pieces the pike itself

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.000 
three separate pieces the pike itself
breaks<00:01:10.120> down<00:01:10.390> right<00:01:10.660> there<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.790> safer

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
breaks down right there and the safer

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.000 
breaks down right there and the safer
we'll<00:01:15.010> come<00:01:15.220> apart<00:01:15.550> at<00:01:16.480> that<00:01:17.010> disjunction

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
we'll come apart at that disjunction

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:26.070 
we'll come apart at that disjunction
right<00:01:18.400> here<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:23.200> it's<00:01:23.440> running<00:01:23.890> a<00:01:24.720> believe<00:01:25.720> an
