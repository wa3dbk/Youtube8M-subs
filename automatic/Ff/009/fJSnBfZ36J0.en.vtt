00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
with a seventy two percent chance to

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.399 
with a seventy two percent chance to
block<00:01:11.250> meanwhile<00:01:12.250> we<00:01:12.520> have<00:01:12.790> escaped<00:01:13.450> which<00:01:14.049> is

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
block meanwhile we have escaped which is

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.410 
block meanwhile we have escaped which is
another<00:01:14.799> stance<00:01:15.400> which<00:01:15.729> is<00:01:15.880> similar<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:16.210> these

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
another stance which is similar to these

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.170 
another stance which is similar to these
two<00:01:16.920> which<00:01:17.920> makes<00:01:18.159> you<00:01:18.280> run<00:01:18.460> through<00:01:18.640> percent

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
two which makes you run through percent

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.399 
two which makes you run through percent
faster<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:19.689> you<00:01:19.750> have<00:01:19.869> a<00:01:19.900> thirty-five

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409

percent<00:01:20.590> chance<00:01:21.040> to<00:01:21.460> block<00:01:21.700> so<00:01:22.329> basically

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
percent chance to block so basically

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.030 
percent chance to block so basically
when<00:01:22.900> you're<00:01:22.990> running<00:01:23.140> through<00:01:23.350> an<00:01:23.439> area<00:01:23.680> not
