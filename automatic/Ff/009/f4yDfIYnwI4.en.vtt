00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.140
 Good afternoon, I'm Carlos Rodríguez. 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.450
 is a language sports in a video 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.960
 very tiny very tiny and short 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.820
 if I do not give them much more much about this 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.920
 function that we have here the cobra coal 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.440
 of 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.359
 from picasso 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.070
 I wanted to make a comparison with others 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.750
 two models could not be because no 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.489
 they have arrived on time but I want 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.760
 Take out this rifle now so they can see that the 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.760
 true 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.260
 authentic hey 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.820
 I'm going to take it apart 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.000
 because this has to see the signs 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.579
 see the finish that has good what 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.930
 first I shot 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:09.560
 see this how it shoots and what I want is 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.310
 that they see the finish that has of guide and 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.460
 the finish that the cannon has 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.750
 it really is awesome I thought about it 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.610
 when I asked for it I did not think sushi 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.619
 had out so good very good 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.960
 very good finish very good very good no 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.759
 I'll get tired of repeating the finish of the 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.860
 pipe the mechanism as you can see is the 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.259
 mechanism and the new cylinder head which is the 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.119
 butt is not as wide as the last 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.369
 which comes as the previous models of 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.720
 the wv that was more was more thickened 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.630
 here was for hands like a tad 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.399
 older this comes more straight guy type 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.350
 the century not exactly the same but very 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:46.310
 similar and then have a mechanism of 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.080
 shot that is super sensitive 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.060
 lovers of picasso have again 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.930
 a good full spades that is what 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.990
 I can guarantee it and then the head 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.730
 is an open head is a head 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.440
 open for double comma if you want it 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.610
 use 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.460
 the truth that the idea 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.880
 the idea of ​​putting one rubber and the other rubber 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.069
 later 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.869
 more down the truth that goes 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.760
 spectacular because doing the test 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.040
 to mount one album and the other the two 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.540
 Rubber bands do not touch each other absolutely 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.910
 nothing the truth is that the idea is 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.060
 fabulous a head that is very good 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.060
 finished 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:29.250
 and nothing else I said that it was short even 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.250
 that you like come a hug to all
