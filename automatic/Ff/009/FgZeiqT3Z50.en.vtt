video<00:00:04.259> I<00:00:05.629> increased<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.810> level<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.350> water

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
video I increased the level of the water

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.709 
video I increased the level of the water
this<00:00:07.830> time<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.460> show<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:08.670> guys<00:00:08.940> the

this time to show you guys the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:10.669 
this time to show you guys the
difference<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.200> makes<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.500> you<00:00:10.559> can

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
difference that it makes and you can

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.009 
difference that it makes and you can
actually<00:00:10.800> see<00:00:11.160> bubbles<00:00:11.550> occurring<00:00:12.389> when<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.750> do

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
actually see bubbles occurring when I do

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.749 
actually see bubbles occurring when I do
this<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:14.009> can<00:00:14.130> see<00:00:14.250> them<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.429> little<00:00:14.639> bit

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
this you can see them a little bit

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.200 
this you can see them a little bit
better<00:00:14.910> if<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.230> camera<00:00:16.590> can<00:00:16.880> kind<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.000> let

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
better if the camera can kind of let

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.939 
better if the camera can kind of let
some<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.630> light<00:00:18.869> out<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.170> little<00:00:19.500> bit<00:00:19.710> so

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
some of the light out a little bit so

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:53.619 
some of the light out a little bit so
it's<00:00:20.100> not<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.550> bad<00:00:23.330> but<00:00:25.430> let's<00:00:26.430> check<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.880> out

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.380 

you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.780> see<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.050> sweet<00:00:55.379> blue<00:00:56.210> don't<00:00:57.210> try<00:00:57.329> to

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
you can see that sweet blue don't try to

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.150 
you can see that sweet blue don't try to
get<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.570> side<00:00:57.839> shot<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.350> can't<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:58.769> see<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
get a side shot I can't really see the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:43.730 
get a side shot I can't really see the
camera<00:00:59.489> very<00:00:59.640> well<00:01:01.010> I<00:01:09.680> can<00:01:10.680> turn<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.759> ball

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.070 

well<00:01:44.370> not<00:01:44.700> one<00:01:44.880> cord<00:01:45.180> starting<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.659> float<00:01:45.900> up

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
well not one cord starting to float up

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.149 
well not one cord starting to float up
but<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.369> bet<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.909> might<00:01:48.030> be<00:01:48.180> arcing<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:49.159> it

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
but I bet it might be arcing on the it

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.380 
but I bet it might be arcing on the it
might<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:50.460> arcing<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:50.940> some<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.270> other

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
might be arcing on some of the other

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.960 
might be arcing on some of the other
cords<00:01:51.950> let's<00:01:52.950> see<00:01:53.100> what<00:01:53.220> happens<00:01:53.520> when<00:01:53.670> they

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
cords let's see what happens when they

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.030 
cords let's see what happens when they
when<00:01:54.750> they're<00:01:54.840> closer<00:01:55.290> together<00:01:55.619> when<00:01:55.950> the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
when they're closer together when the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:12.979 
when they're closer together when the
probes<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:56.460> closer<00:01:56.610> together<00:02:09.890> well<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:12.810> looks

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
probes are closer together well it looks

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.300 
probes are closer together well it looks
like<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.290> bubbles<00:02:13.650> more<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:13.890> don't<00:02:14.160> know<00:02:14.220> if

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
like it bubbles more I don't know if

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.770 
like it bubbles more I don't know if
that's<00:02:14.489> just<00:02:14.550> because<00:02:14.730> it's<00:02:15.000> agitating<00:02:15.690> the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
that's just because it's agitating the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.320 
that's just because it's agitating the
water<00:02:16.100> more<00:02:17.100> or<00:02:17.310> what<00:02:17.580> when<00:02:17.940> they're<00:02:18.090> closer

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
water more or what when they're closer

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.070 
water more or what when they're closer
but<00:02:18.630> now<00:02:18.720> it's<00:02:18.870> really<00:02:19.260> close<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.810> let's<00:02:21.840> see

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
but now it's really close so let's see

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:39.890 
but now it's really close so let's see
what<00:02:22.200> happens<00:02:22.620> now<00:02:36.140> all<00:02:37.140> right<00:02:37.410> well<00:02:38.900> let's

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
what happens now all right well let's

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.590 
what happens now all right well let's
see<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.230> damage<00:02:44.060> let's<00:02:45.060> see<00:02:45.239> what<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.450> did<00:02:45.569> to

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
see the damage let's see what it did to

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:55.630 
see the damage let's see what it did to
our<00:02:47.480> electrical<00:02:48.480> cord<00:02:49.790> or<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.820> wiring<00:02:51.450> all

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.710 

right<00:02:56.640> let's<00:02:56.910> see<00:02:57.000> if<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.120> can<00:02:57.269> do<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.420> against

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
right let's see if I can do it against

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.699 
right let's see if I can do it against
the<00:02:57.900> surface

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.959 

where<00:03:03.709> it<00:03:03.950> jumped<00:03:04.249> out<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.519> water<00:03:04.670> and

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:04.969 
where it jumped out of the water and

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.020 
where it jumped out of the water and
stuff<00:03:05.239> it<00:03:05.390> started<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.900> burn<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.200> tip<00:03:06.379> of<00:03:06.530> it

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
stuff it started to burn the tip of it

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.399 
stuff it started to burn the tip of it
but<00:03:08.030> other<00:03:08.209> than<00:03:08.359> that<00:03:08.599> you<00:03:08.840> know<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.260> whole

anyway<00:04:36.310> there's<00:04:36.820> a<00:04:36.880> little<00:04:37.060> bit<00:04:37.180> of<00:04:37.270> fun<00:04:37.420> with

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
anyway there's a little bit of fun with

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.620 
anyway there's a little bit of fun with
a<00:04:37.630> microwave<00:04:37.990> transformer<00:04:39.120> with<00:04:40.120> electric

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
a microwave transformer with electric

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.470 
a microwave transformer with electric
with<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:42.060> connections<00:04:43.060> come<00:04:43.210> off<00:04:43.360> the

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
with the connections come off the

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.730 
with the connections come off the
secondary<00:04:43.960> submerge<00:04:44.440> into<00:04:44.620> water<00:04:46.560> so<00:04:47.560> I'm

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
secondary submerge into water so I'm

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.830 
secondary submerge into water so I'm
gonna<00:04:47.920> do<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:48.610> better<00:04:48.910> way<00:04:49.120> to<00:04:49.150> where<00:04:49.540> I<00:04:49.570> have

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
gonna do a better way to where I have

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.280 
gonna do a better way to where I have
little<00:04:51.150> tabs<00:04:52.150> mounted<00:04:52.600> in<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.750> water<00:04:52.930> that<00:04:53.200> I

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
little tabs mounted in the water that I

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.810 
little tabs mounted in the water that I
can<00:04:53.440> connect<00:04:53.740> these<00:04:53.890> electrical<00:04:54.400> connections

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
can connect these electrical connections

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.240 
can connect these electrical connections
to<00:04:55.030> so<00:04:55.780> I<00:04:55.840> haven't<00:04:55.990> even<00:04:56.110> spacing<00:04:56.500> and<00:04:56.950> I<00:04:57.070> want

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
to so I haven't even spacing and I want

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.620 
to so I haven't even spacing and I want
to<00:04:57.340> be<00:04:57.490> able<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:57.670> make<00:04:57.820> an<00:04:57.940> adjustable<00:04:58.360> one<00:04:58.450> so

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
to be able to make an adjustable one so

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.930 
to be able to make an adjustable one so
I<00:04:58.870> can<00:04:59.830> see<00:04:59.980> what<00:05:00.100> happens<00:05:00.490> is<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.700> spacing

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
I can see what happens is the spacing

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.560 
I can see what happens is the spacing
gets<00:05:01.570> closer<00:05:02.669> I've<00:05:03.669> noticed<00:05:04.030> kind<00:05:04.150> of<00:05:04.360> when

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
gets closer I've noticed kind of when

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.680 
gets closer I've noticed kind of when
the<00:05:04.750> spacing<00:05:05.200> gets<00:05:05.350> closer<00:05:05.620> it<00:05:06.570> causes<00:05:07.570> that

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
the spacing gets closer it causes that

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.580 
the spacing gets closer it causes that
plasma<00:05:08.230> effect<00:05:09.960> where<00:05:10.960> you<00:05:11.110> see<00:05:11.290> the<00:05:11.410> bright

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
plasma effect where you see the bright

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.970 
plasma effect where you see the bright
yellow<00:05:11.770> instead<00:05:12.220> of<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.370> blue<00:05:12.580> and<00:05:12.880> so<00:05:13.980> we'll

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
yellow instead of the blue and so we'll

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.020 
yellow instead of the blue and so we'll
see<00:05:15.220> I'll<00:05:15.490> do<00:05:15.580> a<00:05:15.610> little<00:05:15.880> bit<00:05:16.000> more

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
see I'll do a little bit more

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.730 
see I'll do a little bit more
experimenting<00:05:16.720> and<00:05:16.810> show<00:05:17.800> you<00:05:17.860> guys<00:05:19.740> this

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
experimenting and show you guys this

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.250 
experimenting and show you guys this
right<00:05:20.980> here<00:05:21.280> just<00:05:21.550> so<00:05:21.610> you<00:05:21.669> know<00:05:22.140> these<00:05:23.140> are

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
right here just so you know these are

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.150 
right here just so you know these are
some<00:05:23.350> parts<00:05:23.620> that<00:05:23.710> came<00:05:23.860> out<00:05:24.010> of<00:05:24.040> the

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
some parts that came out of the

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.390 
some parts that came out of the
microwave<00:05:24.520> this<00:05:25.330> right<00:05:25.570> here<00:05:25.810> is<00:05:25.900> a<00:05:25.930> fan<00:05:26.290> and<00:05:26.590> I

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
microwave this right here is a fan and I

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.870 
microwave this right here is a fan and I
can<00:05:27.730> connect<00:05:28.300> it<00:05:28.480> directly<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:29.800> this<00:05:30.550> power

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
can connect it directly to this power

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.570 
can connect it directly to this power
cord<00:05:31.180> right<00:05:31.330> here<00:05:31.890> and<00:05:32.890> plug<00:05:33.130> it<00:05:33.250> in<00:05:33.340> and<00:05:33.490> it

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
cord right here and plug it in and it

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.690 
cord right here and plug it in and it
works<00:05:33.730> great<00:05:34.950> it<00:05:35.950> work<00:05:36.160> really<00:05:36.340> good<00:05:36.520> as<00:05:36.669> a

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
works great it work really good as a

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.750 
works great it work really good as a
cooling<00:05:37.060> fan<00:05:37.090> to<00:05:37.510> cool<00:05:37.890> if<00:05:38.890> I<00:05:39.040> were<00:05:39.430> to<00:05:39.490> put<00:05:39.730> a

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
cooling fan to cool if I were to put a

cooling fan to cool if I were to put a
heatsink<00:05:40.150> on<00:05:40.330> this<00:05:40.570> transformer<00:05:41.500> and<00:05:41.650> blow

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
heatsink on this transformer and blow

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.820 
heatsink on this transformer and blow
the<00:05:42.669> falen<00:05:43.030> I'd<00:05:43.150> keep<00:05:43.450> my<00:05:43.500> transformer<00:05:44.500> cooler

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
the falen I'd keep my transformer cooler

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.220 
the falen I'd keep my transformer cooler
a<00:05:44.860> little<00:05:45.130> bit<00:05:45.270> and<00:05:46.270> then<00:05:46.660> these<00:05:46.960> are<00:05:47.080> just

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
a little bit and then these are just

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.290 
a little bit and then these are just
some<00:05:47.350> electrical<00:05:47.860> connections<00:05:48.310> that<00:05:48.970> are<00:05:49.120> in

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
some electrical connections that are in

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:57.870 
some electrical connections that are in
there<00:05:49.510> and<00:05:50.380> then<00:05:50.500> I<00:05:50.590> found<00:05:51.540> take<00:05:52.540> it<00:05:52.660> apart

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.550 

just<00:05:58.880> some<00:05:59.060> cool<00:05:59.479> little<00:05:59.660> pieces<00:06:02.229> this<00:06:03.229> little

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
just some cool little pieces this little

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.430 
just some cool little pieces this little

motor that the glass tray sits on plug

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.290 
motor that the glass tray sits on plug
that<00:06:06.650> you<00:06:06.740> can<00:06:06.860> plug<00:06:07.039> that<00:06:07.190> in<00:06:07.340> with<00:06:07.460> 120<00:06:08.030> volts

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
that you can plug that in with 120 volts

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.520 
that you can plug that in with 120 volts

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
it's 2100 volts AC I can get the light

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.969 
it's 2100 volts AC I can get the light
shining<00:06:27.620> on<00:06:27.740> it<00:06:27.770> right

this<00:06:30.979> camera<00:06:31.280> is<00:06:31.310> so<00:06:31.370> poor<00:06:31.729> at<00:06:31.880> reading<00:06:38.380> at

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
this camera is so poor at reading at

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.670 
this camera is so poor at reading at
reading<00:06:39.889> at<00:06:40.430> being<00:06:40.729> able<00:06:40.850> to<00:06:40.940> see<00:06:41.500> letters<00:06:42.500> and

reading at being able to see letters and
stuff<00:06:42.889> on<00:06:43.100> things<00:06:43.340> golly<00:06:43.699> I<00:06:44.030> need<00:06:44.180> to<00:06:44.270> get<00:06:44.330> a

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:44.389 
stuff on things golly I need to get a

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:53.020 
stuff on things golly I need to get a
better<00:06:44.539> camera<00:06:50.470> anyway<00:06:51.639> it's<00:06:52.639> a<00:06:52.699> pretty<00:06:52.849> good

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
better camera anyway it's a pretty good

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.589 
better camera anyway it's a pretty good
sized<00:06:53.210> capacitor<00:06:53.810> it's<00:06:54.740> AC<00:06:54.949> I<00:06:55.460> don't<00:06:56.419> know<00:06:56.509> if

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 
sized capacitor it's AC I don't know if

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.390 
sized capacitor it's AC I don't know if
I'll<00:06:56.780> put<00:06:56.960> AC<00:06:57.139> as<00:06:57.380> well<00:06:57.560> I<00:06:57.590> would<00:06:57.889> imagine<00:06:58.099> so

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
I'll put AC as well I would imagine so

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.420 
I'll put AC as well I would imagine so
since<00:06:58.639> it<00:06:58.729> says<00:06:58.880> AC<00:07:00.130> but<00:07:01.130> you<00:07:01.190> can<00:07:01.310> always

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430 
since it says AC but you can always

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.850 
since it says AC but you can always
rectify<00:07:01.940> it<00:07:02.000> so<00:07:02.750> I'm<00:07:03.260> just<00:07:03.289> going<00:07:03.470> to<00:07:03.530> buy<00:07:03.650> some

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:03.860 
rectify it so I'm just going to buy some

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.850 
rectify it so I'm just going to buy some
high<00:07:04.430> voltage<00:07:04.729> rectifiers<00:07:05.410> so<00:07:06.410> that<00:07:06.590> I<00:07:06.620> can

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
high voltage rectifiers so that I can

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.029 
high voltage rectifiers so that I can
change<00:07:07.070> high-voltage<00:07:07.580> AC<00:07:08.289> current<00:07:09.289> that

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 
change high-voltage AC current that

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:11.740 
change high-voltage AC current that
comes<00:07:10.340> through<00:07:10.699> out<00:07:11.000> of<00:07:11.060> capacitors<00:07:11.659> and

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:11.750 
comes through out of capacitors and

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.909 
comes through out of capacitors and
stuff<00:07:11.960> to<00:07:12.229> DC<00:07:12.849> but<00:07:13.849> alright<00:07:14.389> I<00:07:14.710> hope<00:07:15.710> you<00:07:15.800> guys

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 
stuff to DC but alright I hope you guys

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:18.000 
stuff to DC but alright I hope you guys
liked<00:07:16.220> it

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.010 
liked it

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.080 
liked it

have a good day keep experimenting

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.740 
have a good day keep experimenting
yourself<00:07:24.080> and<00:07:24.409> get<00:07:25.220> involved<00:07:25.510> more<00:07:26.510> people

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:26.750 
yourself and get involved more people

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.899 
yourself and get involved more people
that<00:07:26.810> work<00:07:26.960> on<00:07:27.110> it<00:07:27.169> better<00:07:27.590> we<00:07:28.220> are<00:07:28.250> and<00:07:28.820> the

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:28.909 
that work on it better we are and the

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:32.800 
that work on it better we are and the
faster<00:07:29.360> that<00:07:29.570> that<00:07:30.260> this<00:07:31.039> problem<00:07:31.430> is<00:07:32.360> gonna

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:32.810 
faster that that this problem is gonna

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.420 
faster that that this problem is gonna
get<00:07:32.930> solved<00:07:33.289> with<00:07:33.440> being<00:07:33.650> able<00:07:33.770> to<00:07:33.860> run<00:07:34.039> a<00:07:34.220> car

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:34.430 
get solved with being able to run a car

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.240 
get solved with being able to run a car
on<00:07:34.460> water<00:07:34.729> and<00:07:35.210> also<00:07:35.599> running<00:07:35.900> well<00:07:36.770> I<00:07:36.800> guess<00:07:37.130> I

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:37.250 
on water and also running well I guess I

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.820 
on water and also running well I guess I
should<00:07:37.400> say<00:07:37.580> run<00:07:37.880> a<00:07:37.909> car<00:07:38.180> on<00:07:38.530> fracturing<00:07:39.530> water

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:39.830 
should say run a car on fracturing water

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.490 
should say run a car on fracturing water
into<00:07:40.370> hydrogen<00:07:40.520> and<00:07:40.880> oxygen<00:07:41.000> gases<00:07:41.539> and<00:07:41.990> then

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:42.500 
into hydrogen and oxygen gases and then

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.290 
into hydrogen and oxygen gases and then
also<00:07:42.860> running<00:07:43.099> other<00:07:43.370> things<00:07:43.639> off<00:07:43.849> of<00:07:44.120> those

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:44.300 
also running other things off of those

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.010 
also running other things off of those
gases<00:07:44.599> like<00:07:45.139> creating<00:07:45.500> electricity<00:07:47.020> and

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.020 
gases like creating electricity and

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.930 
gases like creating electricity and
different<00:07:48.289> things<00:07:48.440> like<00:07:48.560> that<00:07:48.620> so<00:07:49.010> alright

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:49.940 
different things like that so alright

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.889 
different things like that so alright
have<00:07:50.479> a<00:07:50.539> good<00:07:50.630> one<00:07:50.690> guys<00:07:50.810> take<00:07:51.650> care<00:07:51.770> bye
