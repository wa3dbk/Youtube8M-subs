00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.550
 i 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.570
 good is how it is 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.670
 environment secretariat very happy 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.190
 german darío germán told me that 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.470
 you had environmental practices to 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.870
 who supports mind can do permissions 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.850
 and tell me what practices you have through 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.030
 of behavior 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.410
 well we do several little things 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.870
 one of them you can see some crafts 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.170
 with materials that is all that waste 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.020
 that normally then people when 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.930
 they are like this in any way they throw it at 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.030
 water are holiday dishes that makes 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.879
 one said positioning and ccoo by 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.930
 packaging of those from the supermarket of 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.790
 fruit or some the ico because all 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.460
 people say it's so hard to be 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.070
 recycle that pollutes both the environment 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.409
 very good all these figures that 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.830
 you are doing and here what is with 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.470
 bottles and these bottle materials 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.810
 of soda 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.600
 that sometimes makes us cut us 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.100
 so to give some forms also be 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:22.280
 more beautiful in the form of flowers and 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.130
 soap bottles is that for grooming 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.370
 of the home very nice that with the day 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.370
 candles 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.890
 tell me other things this container 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.020
 cited on the inside has an echo by shredding 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.870
 when we cut scissors in 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.550
 form of strips and then we make a 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.160
 cross cut that give 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.140
 these squares the easiest to put 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.600
 here in the background in these spaces as well 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.540
 that are small then if we compress it 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.700
 with a rod 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:14.810
 here I have a bag with comfort 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:17.330
 also from brawn gp always this 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.950
 Imagine even sell one 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.170
 in the form of balls and can not do it 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.120
 and you can not reuse all the ico by 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.900
 of the holidays and all that is for 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.120
 December is used to make cushions 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.970
 they place it inside the cushion to 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.920
 that remains so that it softens tecos 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.390
 so if it is not but having a little 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.950
 of a discipline time habit like that 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.390
 how it makes us so long for so many 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:48.230
 other things but with that it's a great 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.540
 company that yes everything I could do 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.840
 in everyday life and a few days by 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.939
 future 11 already when things are thrown 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.129
 later on and one gives one as more 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.629
 satisfaction see a transformation of 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.579
 a material that the jewel itself is not 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.739
 let me be more and they also told me that 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:07.389
 you had a compostera here in the 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.389
 apartment like me yes I want you are 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.560
 two 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.630
 look I tell you here is a material 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.170
 organic that people know him as 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.740
 compost when transformed 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.660
 we have several stages 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.510
 initially in these bags we put 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.910
 a few layers of dried leaves from the garden 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.380
 monkey material crush that is the same 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.480
 closes all day here outside of 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.970
 garden garden when one sweeps the 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.970
 little leaves one is improving for example 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.650
 you are cascaritas we crush it 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.680
 here with this 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.470
 these can be appointments to take away the 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.459
 space but do it like this from here and 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.459
 then diagonally 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:05.379
 when they have more surface the material 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:08.319
 organic the decomposition is going to be more 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:11.859
 quick true once is in this form 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:14.530
 you put it here in these little sheets and the 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:17.340
 is putting like with layers of leaves 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.340
 he is covering them 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.860
 then we passed here 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.520
 here is a container if you look 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.200
 here in the middle there is an empty space 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.520
 that we do not do with a bottle so 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.520
 to get air 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.020
 two 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:50.460
 here is a little messy but yes 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.700
 is in improvement we have it 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.060
 well numeral true 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.280
 These are Costalitos as the Square 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:03.240
 where the potatoes they have are coming from 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.310
 they enter the air very easy certain us 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.639
 we are waiting for eight weeks each 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.990
 week we do a rotation so that 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.570
 have a little bit of aggregation and 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.330
 movement and in the last week already with 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.730
 We serve a sieve and take out the 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.470
 so finer material and they told me 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.940
 brother that everything is a process here 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.320
 also with water that is very 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.210
 important to recognize because it is that 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.400
 We are in an apartment on a causeway in 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.410
 taken throughout the city in the part 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.740
 urban and you have a whole process of 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.900
 water reuse like the simile 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.910
 so it 's a very simple thing where 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.400
 We wash the dishes 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:42.180
 we wash the vegetables the fruits we put 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:45.960
 a pot and aluminum when washing that water 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.990
 will run by the drain of the nails 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.630
 We have already arrived a few buckets of water 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.210
 that is already reused is not going to do 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.890
 water to drink the drinking water that is 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.300
 an amazing good that we have here in 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:01.370
 she 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:07.639
 so we get from the tap 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:09.650
 but the other one missing from the bathroom 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.009
 of the sanitary we closed the 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.770
 tank tap 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:17.169
 in each download the downloads go to 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.889
 do with that reused water 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.889
 periodically 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.830
 German the mayoralty of Medellin throughout 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.630

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.060
 life that we are doing loves you 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.780
 make a special recognition that what 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.910
 I'm going to read

 german I give everything in a strap your good
