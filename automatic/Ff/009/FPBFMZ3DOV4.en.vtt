00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 today is Friday and I advise you to 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.870
 eat fish a little like tradition 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.690
 Italian and in fish I recommend the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.179
 red snapper, a sea fish that 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.269
 it has an oval body covered by large 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.199
 One card scales is really very much 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.180
 fine fine soda with a delicate flavor 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.170
 is sold fresh or 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.470
 frozen food 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.529
 of course nothing against 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.050
 frozen fish that is often life 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.260
 many rip-offs but the fact is that the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.040
 real red snapper has a good red snapper 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.440
 light blue gray color is iridescent 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.739
 on the back with numerous dark spots with 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.700
 silvery reflections at the sides must 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.800
 have a pleasant delicate odor 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.039
 absolutely not ammoniacal in short 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.710
 general fish when it is not fresh 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.870
 smells of fish but the scent of the sea that 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.280
 it is a very different concept 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.620
 the appearance of the teeth must be there 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.400
 the rigid and firm body is brilliant 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.189
 beautiful adherent scales the gills must 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.670
 be a definite red and the eye 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.049
 the eye of the teeth must be alive 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.619
 protruding with the black pupil 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.720
 absolutely not circled in red 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.909
 attention on the markets there are two others 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.630
 species of snapper and the so-called 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.390
 snapper corazzere and the big red snapper 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.479
 both of poor quality but there 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.150
 they could have veils cut off 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.110
 trim by paying yourself back naturally 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.210
 like red snapper, the classic red snapper 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.759
 just bought the snapper like everyone 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.399
 the fish must be well eviscerated e 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.920
 washed under running water in a manner 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.110
 really accurate so it is possible in 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.180
 this case or cook it save it in 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.909
 refrigerator but in this case in the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.850
 refrigerator cover it well with the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.610
 food film or with a 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.100
 typical container of fish because of 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.380
 avoid all the rest of the gods 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.550
 your foods in the refrigerator know of 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.900
 sony snapper cano summit 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.910
 feel more often hear about the 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.650
 scene success also in Italy not 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.690
 there are many but they are a lot of 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.490
 things have you ever thought of doing business with 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.490
 the Chinese had a wonderful idea
