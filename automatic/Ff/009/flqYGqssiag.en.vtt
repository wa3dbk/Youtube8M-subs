00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
mitt is pretty stiff and in times he

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.270 
mitt is pretty stiff and in times he
comes<00:02:36.120> across<00:02:36.270> as<00:02:36.750> less<00:02:37.380> than<00:02:37.410> genuine<00:02:37.980> but<00:02:38.190> he

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
comes across as less than genuine but he

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.520 
comes across as less than genuine but he
does<00:02:38.580> have<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.880> very<00:02:39.450> good<00:02:39.660> command<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.170> facts

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
does have a very good command of facts

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.740

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
and when he's in his element he can do

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.380 
and when he's in his element he can do
some<00:02:42.960> serious<00:02:43.380> debating<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.280> then<00:02:45.090> and
