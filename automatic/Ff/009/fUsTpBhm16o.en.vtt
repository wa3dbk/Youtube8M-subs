there<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:30.689> there<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> chimpanzee

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
there but there we have a chimpanzee

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.430 
there but there we have a chimpanzee
with<00:00:32.309> its<00:00:32.460> gut<00:00:32.669> there<00:00:33.150> on<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.720> left<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.230> a

with its gut there on the left and a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.170 
with its gut there on the left and a
human<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.949> about<00:00:35.129> the<00:00:35.220> same<00:00:35.400> dimensions<00:00:36.059> with

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
its got on the right and in terms of

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.000 
its got on the right and in terms of
absorptive<00:00:38.940> area<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.720> gut<00:00:40.010> chimpanzees

absorptive area in the gut chimpanzees

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.560 
absorptive area in the gut chimpanzees
have<00:00:41.190> got<00:00:41.370> about<00:00:41.520> three<00:00:41.820> or<00:00:41.910> four<00:00:42.120> times<00:00:42.390> as

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
have got about three or four times as

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.500 
have got about three or four times as
much<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.920> they<00:00:44.489> need<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
much as we have and they need that and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.549 
much as we have and they need that and
they<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.719> much<00:00:45.870> more<00:00:46.020> powerful<00:00:46.410> enzymes

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
they have much more powerful enzymes

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.619 
they have much more powerful enzymes
than<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.340> we've<00:00:47.910> lost<00:00:48.120> many<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.539> our

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
than we do we've lost many of our

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.209 
than we do we've lost many of our
digestive<00:00:49.050> enzymes<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.590> allow<00:00:49.800> us<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.070> break

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
digestive enzymes that allow us to break

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.970 
digestive enzymes that allow us to break
down<00:00:50.489> our<00:00:50.730> raw<00:00:51.180> meat<00:00:51.420> let's<00:00:51.690> say<00:00:51.899> they<00:00:52.739> need

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
down our raw meat let's say they need

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.380 
down our raw meat let's say they need
that<00:00:53.129> because<00:00:53.340> they<00:00:53.579> can't<00:00:53.820> cook<00:00:54.090> their<00:00:54.360> food

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
that because they can't cook their food

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.779 
that because they can't cook their food
interestingly<00:00:55.199> enough<00:00:55.649> if<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.250> feed<00:00:56.489> pet

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
interestingly enough if you feed pet

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.970 
interestingly enough if you feed pet
chimpanzees<00:00:57.390> or<00:00:57.660> cooked<00:00:57.930> food<00:00:58.170> they<00:00:58.620> become

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
chimpanzees or cooked food they become

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.400 
chimpanzees or cooked food they become
obese<00:00:59.370> just<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> same<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.420> we<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.809> okay<00:01:01.289> so

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
obese just the same as we do okay so

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.349 
obese just the same as we do okay so
maybe<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.219> raw<00:01:02.430> food<00:01:02.699> diet<00:01:02.730> has<00:01:03.180> got<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
maybe the raw food diet has got a

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.020 
maybe the raw food diet has got a
certain<00:01:03.660> amount<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.770> commend<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.489> so

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
certain amount to to commend it so

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.639 
certain amount to to commend it so
that's<00:01:06.240> another<00:01:06.420> way<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.869> which<00:01:07.200> we've<00:01:07.380> lost

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
that's another way in which we've lost

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.330 
that's another way in which we've lost
our<00:01:08.750> our<00:01:09.750> abilities<00:01:10.320> compared<00:01:11.039> to<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
our our abilities compared to the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.760 
our our abilities compared to the
ability<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.880> must<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.240> been<00:01:12.360> held<00:01:12.570> by<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
ability that must have been held by the

ability that must have been held by the
common<00:01:14.069> ancestor<00:01:14.550> of<00:01:14.580> ourselves<00:01:14.880> and

personal sperm has had a chance to
impregnate<00:03:10.950> her<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.820> spines<00:03:12.150> make<00:03:12.450> it

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
impregnate her and so the spines make it

impregnate her and so the spines make it
very<00:03:12.720> difficult<00:03:12.960> for<00:03:13.290> her<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.440> get<00:03:13.680> away<00:03:13.770> our

cats have them too which is why cats

androgen<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.570> male<00:03:48.780> sex<00:03:49.170> hormone<00:03:49.650> we<00:03:50.370> have

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
androgen is the male sex hormone we have

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.510 
androgen is the male sex hormone we have
an<00:03:50.940> missing<00:03:51.570> androgen<00:03:52.230> receptor<00:03:52.800> compared<00:03:53.310> to

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
an missing androgen receptor compared to

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.660 
an missing androgen receptor compared to
nearly<00:03:53.970> all<00:03:54.150> or<00:03:54.630> many<00:03:54.870> other<00:03:55.080> mammals<00:03:55.770> so<00:03:56.370> that

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
nearly all or many other mammals so that

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.070 
nearly all or many other mammals so that
it's<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.940> presence<00:03:57.360> of<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.600> androgen

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
it's the presence of the androgen

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.990 
it's the presence of the androgen
receptor<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.650> picks<00:03:58.920> up<00:03:59.130> some<00:03:59.459> testosterone

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
receptor that picks up some testosterone

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.210 
receptor that picks up some testosterone
from<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.540> bloodstream<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.320> persuades

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
from the bloodstream and that persuades

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.340 
from the bloodstream and that persuades
these<00:04:02.610> spines<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.150> grow<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:03.750> we<00:04:03.930> don't<00:04:04.170> have

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
these spines to grow and we don't have

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.870 
these spines to grow and we don't have
that<00:04:04.590> receptor<00:04:04.920> you'll<00:04:05.130> see<00:04:05.280> at<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.489> top<00:04:05.670> the

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
that receptor you'll see at the top the

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.670 
that receptor you'll see at the top the
chimps<00:04:06.180> macaques<00:04:06.570> and<00:04:06.750> mice<00:04:06.959> have<00:04:06.989> got<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.410> the

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
chimps macaques and mice have got it the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.979 
chimps macaques and mice have got it the
red<00:04:07.890> triangle<00:04:08.400> in<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.580> box<00:04:08.790> but<00:04:09.209> we<00:04:09.360> simple

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
red triangle in the box but we simple

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.630 
red triangle in the box but we simple
don't<00:04:10.260> simply<00:04:10.590> don't<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.190> we<00:04:11.310> don't<00:04:11.489> have

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
don't simply don't and we don't have

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.110 
don't simply don't and we don't have
spines<00:04:12.000> as<00:04:12.810> well<00:04:13.110> so<00:04:13.709> that<00:04:14.040> too<00:04:14.310> is<00:04:14.730> really

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
spines as well so that too is really

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.220 
spines as well so that too is really
quite<00:04:15.840> startling<00:04:16.500> ok
