improvement there is as you'd expect the

improvement there is as you'd expect the

in you 390 ax

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.720 
in you 390 ax
well<00:00:22.199> because<00:00:22.650> it's<00:00:22.830> officially<00:00:23.519> an<00:00:23.580> old

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
well because it's officially an old

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.519 
well because it's officially an old
model<00:00:24.090> now<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.720> price<00:00:24.990> difference<00:00:25.320> is

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
model now the price difference is

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.500 
model now the price difference is
significant<00:00:26.160> but<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.340> all<00:00:26.550> know<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.240> three

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
significant but we all know the three

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.660 
significant but we all know the three
nany<00:00:27.689> axis<00:00:28.109> actually<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.619> tweak<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.220> naayak's

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
nany axis actually a tweak to naayak's

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.150 
nany axis actually a tweak to naayak's
basically<00:00:30.570> rebrand<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.500> what<00:00:31.679> makes<00:00:31.830> up<00:00:32.009> this

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
basically rebrand so what makes up this

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160 
basically rebrand so what makes up this
big<00:00:32.399> price<00:00:32.669> difference<00:00:32.700> let's<00:00:33.570> go<00:00:33.719> ahead<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
big price difference let's go ahead and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:01:33.230 
big price difference let's go ahead and
find<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.530> out

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.870 

so<00:01:34.240> for<00:01:34.420> sure<00:01:34.450> d<00:01:34.750> r9<00:01:34.960> 390x<00:01:35.650> has<00:01:35.890> improved<00:01:36.250> a<00:01:36.490> lot

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
so for sure d r9 390x has improved a lot

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.880 
so for sure d r9 390x has improved a lot
over<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.210> two<00:01:37.480> maniacs<00:01:37.690> at<00:01:38.440> first<00:01:38.740> that

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
over the two maniacs at first that

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.650 
over the two maniacs at first that
didn't<00:01:39.100> really<00:01:39.250> expect<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.850> see<00:01:40.000> such<00:01:40.180> results

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
didn't really expect to see such results

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.660 
didn't really expect to see such results
but<00:01:41.050> I<00:01:41.080> was<00:01:41.290> positively<00:01:41.890> surprised<00:01:42.400> in<00:01:42.550> this

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
but I was positively surprised in this

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.520 
but I was positively surprised in this
case<00:01:42.910> the<00:01:43.270> 290x<00:01:43.810> doesn't<00:01:44.140> look<00:01:44.290> all<00:01:44.470> that

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
case the 290x doesn't look all that

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.950 
case the 290x doesn't look all that
powerful<00:01:45.130> anymore<00:01:45.610> in<00:01:45.760> these<00:01:45.970> charts<00:01:46.390> but<00:01:46.840> in

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
powerful anymore in these charts but in

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.140 
powerful anymore in these charts but in
its<00:01:47.260> defense<00:01:47.770> it's<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.430> lot<00:01:48.580> cheaper<00:01:48.610> as<00:01:49.120> well

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
its defense it's a lot cheaper as well

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.420 
its defense it's a lot cheaper as well
aim<00:01:49.630> D<00:01:49.960> managed<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.500> improve<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.800> noise

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
aim D managed to improve the noise

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.340 
aim D managed to improve the noise
levels<00:01:51.820> a<00:01:51.880> little<00:01:52.000> bit<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:52.420> most<00:01:52.810> importantly

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
levels a little bit and most importantly

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.140 
levels a little bit and most importantly

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
now offers a total of eight gigabytes so

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.360 
now offers a total of eight gigabytes so
twice<00:02:20.050> as<00:02:20.230> much<00:02:20.380> which<00:02:20.650> can<00:02:20.980> come<00:02:21.220> in<00:02:21.250> handy

twice as much which can come in handy

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.970 
twice as much which can come in handy
especially<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.720> future<00:02:23.080> however<00:02:23.590> if<00:02:23.860> you

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.620 
works video editing and so on it'll do
well<00:02:30.280> there<00:02:30.550> it's<00:02:30.850> a<00:02:31.000> bit<00:02:31.120> hard<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.360> judge<00:02:31.600> the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
well there it's a bit hard to judge the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.570 
well there it's a bit hard to judge the
price<00:02:32.020> performance<00:02:32.260> ratio<00:02:32.620> here<00:02:33.190> especially

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
price performance ratio here especially

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.250 
price performance ratio here especially
since<00:02:34.150> most<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.660> will<00:02:34.840> have<00:02:34.989> different

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
since most of you will have different

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.140 
since most of you will have different
opinions<00:02:35.530> but<00:02:36.160> for<00:02:36.370> now<00:02:36.489> I'm<00:02:36.640> going<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.970> say

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
opinions but for now I'm going to say

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.000 
opinions but for now I'm going to say
the<00:02:37.390> 390<00:02:37.930> acts<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.260> good<00:02:38.530> price<00:02:38.800> performance

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
the 390 acts is a good price performance

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.699 
the 390 acts is a good price performance
ratio<00:02:39.340> but<00:02:39.910> for<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.150> little<00:02:40.450> more<00:02:40.660> NVIDIA<00:02:41.530> has<00:02:41.620> a

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
ratio but for a little more NVIDIA has a

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.560 
ratio but for a little more NVIDIA has a
more<00:02:41.980> efficient<00:02:42.520> offering<00:02:42.940> but<00:02:43.300> then<00:02:43.420> again

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
more efficient offering but then again

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.290 
more efficient offering but then again
