00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.639
 and here I bring you my first gta video 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:08.080
 5 and good as I have seen there has already been 

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:10.180
 many videos of many curiosities 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.130
 here to retract one of the ones that has most 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.809
 called friend attention that is a 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.790
 triathlon the truth is that it is very curious 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.140
 I put the new things that they have put and 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.329
 I liked it 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.769
 very much is to say that I have already made one 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.329
 but between that I did not know very well the 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.400
 buttons and I did not hear much about the 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.109
 I arrived a lot and I was very 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.849
 bad so I 'm going to repeat what I'm going to 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.349
 try to get there first I already know how 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.269
 the resistance works which is what 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.689
 most important in this test so 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.879
 nothing 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.090
 we started swimming after bicycle and 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.620
 then to run I take the character 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.140
 older than the game of the three that 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.730
 you can select so I do not know how 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.230
 I think it does not have much 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.670
 resistance but good I think I can 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.620
 win 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.140
 warm up and see if the bar and down to the 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.760
 right to have resistance position and 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:58.859
 then the quick time later on nothing and 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.859
 then we keep it to the limit 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.699
 the rival already you see that if you put a little 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.410
 close you can push him not in fact to 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.430
 Real post but good has already 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.960
 removed a rival I will try to hold 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.360
 here the swimming that is where you most 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.680
 tires I believe then to the bike the truth 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.200
 is that pretty quiet is almost what 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.190
 you can drop down the slopes and that 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.930
 you have to control a bit the 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.210
 direction but swimming tires 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.610
 very much and arrived it arrives quite 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.470
 burst the character in the room 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.810
 fourth is fine I think that among the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.070
 first five is fine that I do not go 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.630
 being far behind that does not escape 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.730
 no one of course if it does not give me day and 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.650
 I do not have time to get there 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.540
 but with them also by the way there is a 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.120
 button I've seen before that if you get to the 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.500
 circle and leave it for a while pressed you 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.210
 it puts like a kind of aerial camera 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.920
 from a helicopter that is as if from 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.240
 television was broadcasting I'm going to 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.950
 try now because he was very cool 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.170
 but before I tried and it has arrived 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.180
 enough because you do not change your view 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.230
 You do not start to see it as not diagonally 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.180
 the front view you're seeing 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.590
 now and then it means faster 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.960
 joystick and you can take enough 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.030
 you have to be careful if you try it 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.830
 because I have already arrived enough come 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.060
 third is fine I have a lot of bar 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.670
 still energy that's fine 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.500
 although also what tires a lot is the 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.630
 race look there you see how I twisted 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.860
 a little good you could have seen some 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.600
 seconds later I put it in the race 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.790
 which is quite easier for you 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.560
 ye see and you have to be very careful 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.730
 because people are running around the 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.590
 bikes and take the first one that itches 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.790
 so as you are not careful, you 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.440
 they can remove in the face and you have to 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.880
 waste a lot of time look at another rival that 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.270
 It has taken away from me well, well, I 've already 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.210
 removed 2 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.880
 let's go 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:35.510
 it's not that it was dominated 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.960
 to god of 208 you run out of bike look for yourself 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.610
 the life that I keep yours comes 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.170
 come come now as I say very 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.120
 quiet that does not waste much energy the 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.710
 bicycle that is not needed here 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.240
 you have to be careful with the curves and 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.240
 Not to leave you 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.970
 and quietly quiet 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.200
 simple in the rhythm and third right now 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.490
 third is fine I go with one in front 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.980
 that you are guiding me that is very good 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.470
 also because it is not traveled to me like that 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.220
 I'm going out where I have to go as 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.220
 michael yourself 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.379
 on the rise to the right I think now 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.450
 right again again be careful with the 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.810
 lamppost that gives me as you remember another 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.120
 normal mother looks like I've risked 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.129
 that the danger I have and I think they are 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.560
 two or three more curves and I have to run 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.230
 so I'm going to save energies that are not 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.580
 be very tired that the race is what 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.830
 what else cause by difference I think 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.930
 in the final stretch with the resistance very 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.110
 low and it keeps you down lives and not 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.670
 then where are you going do not pass me 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.790
 no one else can not pass me anymore 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.200
 one more than if we would not give and these that 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.270
 they are waiting here that well thanks 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.010
 thank you very much for waiting for me 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.180
 to see if I can win I go first now 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.530
 he put me first after I 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.540
 they will wait but I do not think 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:00.270
 what disgust of controls looks look like me 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.270
 he said look how I put myself a while 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.540
 It's beautiful the truth is that that 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.700
 camera is beautiful but always in 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.100
 lyon the controls are gone and I finished 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.720
 standing something like that we're not going 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.570
 to accelerate that is approaching 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.740
 very much one behind is not much left 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.989
 what career do I think is the rise 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.920
 until the end and then left as well 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.510
 I'm not going to fool comes to 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.910
 win to have been pocket I have it 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.260
 pretty good lose control is this 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.310
 to be pressing the button all the time 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.340
 he had always looked at me no no 11 11 11 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.280
 has the improvement of the end do not fuck let's go 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.410
 come on you have to carry straight end of 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.640
 final straight final line is not the 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.080
 Left curve with a left 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.580
 just come on let's go I have it I have it 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.840
 I have done it, it has no residence 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.699
 per I hope you can hold 666 666 yes 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.370
 good well good good to second of 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.520
 finally got finally I get 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.689
 to second 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.279
