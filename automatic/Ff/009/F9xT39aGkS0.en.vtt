00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.070
 I am also very nice in the field 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.080
 studio or location work by myself 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.550
 directly from the camera in lightroom 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.670
 in photographing 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.900
 the whole is called the shooting and 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.720
 I just have mine for this now 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.940
 Camera once connected via USB cable 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.300
 Unfortunately, the camera offers a USB-2 more 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.580
 not right now with my lightroom or 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.379
 my calculator is ready and 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.980
 can start it now by saying tv 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:40.969
 start recording gives the whole one 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.649
 Names of the man is the studio 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.839
 Camera from where I would like to have it 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.339
 and can now also some things here 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.899
 For example, define how the file 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.280
 That's what I should mention to everyone 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.159
 case as well as the normal one 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.729
 import dialog also here once 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:58.010
 define gives the whole one more 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.929
 additional names can be metadata here 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.569
 define and can also use keywords 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.729
 define that so I leave that on 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:06.409
 ok and he recognizes the camera the same and 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.130
 I could now use the camera either 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:14.030
 take it here and take some photos or 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.190
 i could also jump out of lightroom that 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.610
 Whole trigger by just here 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.200
 go and press the trigger button 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.990
 the advantage is that of course I 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.340
 Sifting things directly can be bigger 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.980
 feed is that I go here now 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.570
 can and say this picture here 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.710
 I edit once so I go in 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.340
 the development attitude and 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.780
 sadism basically be much lighter 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.250
 define after white point until 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.380
 clipping the black dot to the 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.610
 clipping a bit the deep ones 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.200
 and could now say here at the 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.810
 development settings i want that 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.160
 whole as before that is to say 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.450
 the next picture will be mine now 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.150
 development settings I just 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.250
 have defined with take over and the same 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.080
 I can adapt and so I can be very nice 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.390
 according to my attitude already 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.920
 make direct checks on the calculator 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.630
 and eventually I will too 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.440
 automatic focus edi finger took 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.010
 also sharp pictures 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.010
 Have fun trying
