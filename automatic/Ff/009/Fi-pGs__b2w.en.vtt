00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.520
 We were kids one for ever we are here 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.109
 in a new video of gta 5 and good this 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.540
 once I've come to see the omni flyer that 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.040
 it's supposed to come out here at 3 o'clock 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.990
 tomorrow when we have completed the 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.999
 100% game I will not teach that here what 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.880
 I have completed just passed it to me 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:18.170
 100% here you see ready for 100% all 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.280
 complete has cost me a lot and the 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.020
 truth is that I was excited I know that 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.370
 this has already uploaded some others 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.020
 youtubers but I was not much 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.090
 illusion since good happens to me of 100% and 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.260
 I do not know I want to see it there are two others that 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.430
 I'll also put it later but now 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.570
 these are the shots going live 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.940
 ok and the other two because 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.190
 show them later and nothing we have 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.920
 to wait for three and teach 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.760
 exactly where is the location worth 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.800
 here you see that it is next to the 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.079
 cable car this is worth in the mountain of 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.510
 minds to the top here you see that there 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.659
 you have a house and so and so here 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.030
 you have all the viewpoints and good just 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.469
 here below we put is written in 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.879
 English that puts you back here when 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.429
 you have the complete game is worth that 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.229
 it means that you have one hundred percent 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.850
 so good as we are already we are 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.800
 here we already have it complete because we are going to 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.940
 see if it comes out I will pass this fast and 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.060
 good as soon as the oven comes out and we 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.070
 we see 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.080
 the kids, here we are and good 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.340
 here you see the UFO it was worth it 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.770
 looking for here back but good 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.930
 has finally appeared here so what 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.730
 The only thing you have to do is have a 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.170
 rainy weather with storm is worth that if 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.150
 they do not know how to do it because in the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.620
 description leave the trick simply 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.930
 you have to change the weather one and the other 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.370
 time until you get stormy and 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.860
 then levels will appear on 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.900
 three and do not know what time takes the 5th 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.910
 well the truth and good now after you 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.290
 I will teach the other two UFOs that come out 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.000
 also when you complete you play at 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.560
 one hundred percent but they do not need a 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.690
 special weather and nothing like that 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.979
 that I will not record in like but 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.030
 well I'll put it right now after 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.890
 well here we see that it was already 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.110
 disappearing worth yes it 's like it's going 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.740
 good good and appears again is when 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.710
 we approach 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.049
 ok the yellow one is going it's going good 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.399
 a total paranoia and nothing kids 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.430
 I hope you like and nothing you now 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.750
 I'll put the next two good UFOs 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.399
 We are already here, I hope that 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.140
 you liked the first omni and now 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.520
 I bring you the remaining two and as I have 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.080
 said before, so you do not need any 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.270
 special condition to see it 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.710
 just spend a hundred percent and 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.060
 good as you see I will mark the locations 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.319
 on the map and the only thing that you have to 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.780
 to do is go there and take a 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.120
 helicopter and go up and up vale are 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.650
 very high so in principle I do not know 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.150
 You will see that it is worth it until you get very close and 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.890
 then good when it's already enough 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.260
 close so they appear are like 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.150
 invisible so to speak and good 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.970
 also tell you that if you get too close 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.350
 the UFO emits a very loud sound and what 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.549
 what it does is that it unlocks the 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.260
 helicopter and it makes it fall 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.870
 directly in freefall is worth so 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.720
 do not get too close and if not after 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.340
 be careful, you have to give it 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.319
 quite strong to the helicopter if not yes 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.209
 you are not going to fall down and good 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.350
 curiosity is there is also a moment in 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.390
 that I get on the UFO with the 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.370
 helicopter and I directly die another 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.690
 time nothing happens to me and even under the 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.880
 helicopter I start to run by the 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.380
 UFO in person but good finally 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.490
 it ended up falling and well you will see that the 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.130
 screen sometimes 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.770
 and it looks like scratched, it's not like it's 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.180
 poorly captured but that is an effect of 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.190
 game that when they get close to the nih 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.440
 because there are as interferences there is no 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.390
 a lot of radiation or whatever and it emits a 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.370
 very big and good sound practically 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.680
 had a lot of life just with 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.150
 get closer and good then finally dies 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.320
 of that you fall or anything like that 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.600
 nothing kids, I hope you liked it 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.030
 As you already know, you have the location of 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.920
 the three omni as I said you have to 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.050
 spend 100% of the game is worth it if we do not 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.980
 will come out none of the three so 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.360
 Nothing kids, I hope that I have 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.100
 liked that you vote life favorites 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.650
 teach your interested friends 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.430
 in gta 5 and nothing we see in the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.430
 next video chao
