00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.670
 hello good here we are maybe wiesel to 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.830
 one more time to bring them in this case 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.930
 a new mini game called protects 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.730
 the Queen 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.140
 the map in which it is rinsed is the scream 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.290
 of the invoker although in reality it was 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.210
 you can play even in domains or in the 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.790
 twisted forest players 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.890
 would normally be 5 against 5 with a 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.540
 queen per team a queen will be a 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.730
 female character and I explain more 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.500
 go ahead but you can play while there 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.570
 a queen per team you can play the 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.980
 teams that you want our goal goes 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.239
 to be killing the team queen 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.850
 enemy the greatest number of times 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:39.149
 possible before the time runs out 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.219
 the areas of the game we have an area 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.019
 of struggle that you can invest if 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.850
 you can do the dragon zone 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.430
 as an alvaro action struggle zone for 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.050
 rest area where fighting is 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.480
 you are going to play with dinners two queens and 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.030
 you're going to try to kill them and the area 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.430
 Rest for each team will be your jungle 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.650
 where the queen will wait 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.630
 that has died 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.490
 the duration of the game will be about 20 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.220
 minutes we have calculated that 20 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.470
 minutes is a reasonable time and here 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.060
 equal more than 20 minutes it becomes heavy and 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.890
 least you do not have time to develop 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.170
 the game but if you agree 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.580
 we can lengthen everything you want not 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.440
 will be able to train the subjects of 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.760
 the lines but if those in the jungle go 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.060
 to be able to get gold through the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.420
 jungle that will not happen to the queen 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.940
 because the queen can only have the 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.100
 oracle the elixir of the oracle and only goes 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.460
 to be able to cure manna and life to their 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.229
 soldiers the teleport e is prohibited 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.300
 you have to walk to all the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.490
 sites is not right that you have the 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.080
 teleport and when the two queens are 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.229
 alive will have to be located in the area of 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.229
 fight 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.200
 when one queen dies the other may 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.210
 continue in the fight and the other 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.790
 team that his queen is dead can 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.800
 try to kill her before she leaves or 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.040
 You can leave the rest area to 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.350
 let it get a little life 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.540
 or simply rest from the stress of 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.640
 have to be running from the other 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.119
 team can not kill anyone outside 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.459
 of the fight zone in fact if someone 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.560
 kill someone has to retire up 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.100
 let the next round begin 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.780
 you can only buy when you die if 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.670
 you kill for any child not 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.450
 anything you have a round of 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.450
 penalty 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.670
 the queen will be a female character only 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.330
 may be equipped with the elixir of the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.900
 oracle 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.610
 so we point out how the spells reign 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.550
 of invoker will be clairvoyance and cure 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.730
 because you can benefit your soldiers 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.310
 with these two computers you will not be able to use 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.900
 the skills for example so we have 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.450
 post fund may not use those 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.070
 skills but you will be able to use the 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.920
 spells from the walker to help his 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.900
 soldiers who have to protect it must 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.490
 indicate when she is alive to start the 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.650
 next round you have to communicate 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.110
 very well you have to be fair not to do 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.480
 traps I recommend you have a 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.630
 referee that although then even though he goes with 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.030
 three minutes late 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.010
 in the viewer mode you can go pointing 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.500
 the many to then know who wins 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.960
 really because people when they are 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.580
 with colleagues is pretty tricky is 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.460
 where it starts only when the two 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.510
 queens are in the fight 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.540
 usually they are a team fight 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.860
 in what is not in the jungle but let's go 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.170
 to be able to move through the jungle 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.450
 dodging the thing is that in addition to 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.640
 make you the jungle and such go for the 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.620
 another queen if the queen gets out of the 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.330
 fight area during the round there is 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.490
 where the referee enters he must commit suicide 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.190
 against the enemy team as the referee 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.600
 will not be or will it be in mode 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.330
 spectator and he's going to have three minutes of 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.430
 delay what you can do is that if the 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.620
 queen gets out of the fight zone the 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.620
 referee gives a bit to the opposing team 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.860
 the soldiers are the rest of the players 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.780
 they can not buy objects that they grant 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.489
 accumulations to not gain advantage 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.590
 against others who have not 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.209
 got as much gold as they the 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.769
 clairvoyant spells cure are 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.420
 forbidden since it is going to be the queen 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.950
 where they will give that extra 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.170
 Mana and life 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.910
 and if they die executed by a subject or 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.170
 for a tower they must remain in the 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.480
 rest area until the start of the 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.980
 next round they will not be able to protect 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.140
 to his queen and therefore he will stay 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.329
 with a soldier less and will have more 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.209
 possibilities of dying 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.699
 and well this is all like if you subscribed 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.680
 you are not, surely you will have many 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.449
 doubts of this mini game so 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.000
 leave them in the comments the 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:31.000
 we will answer and until the next video
