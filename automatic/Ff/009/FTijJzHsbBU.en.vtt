00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
actually it started at $200 so that was

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.310 
actually it started at $200 so that was
kind<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> little<00:00:53.250> bit<00:00:53.399> over<00:00:53.670> budget<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.320> what

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
kind of a little bit over budget so what

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.310 
kind of a little bit over budget so what
I<00:00:55.350> decided<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.370> was<00:00:56.730> find<00:00:57.570> replacements

some 800 grit sandpaper and cleaning it
all<00:02:19.670> up<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.150> then<00:02:20.270> taking<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.080> get<00:02:21.200> it

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
that's what I'm doing let's see what

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.010 
that's what I'm doing let's see what
they<00:02:40.850> look<00:02:40.880> like<00:02:41.180> when<00:02:41.420> they're<00:02:41.540> on<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.810> car

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
now the wheel covers are actually

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.700 
now the wheel covers are actually
retained<00:02:44.330> by<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.630> lug<00:02:44.930> nuts<00:02:45.200> I'll<00:02:45.410> show<00:02:45.650> you

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
retained by the lug nuts I'll show you

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:54.490 
retained by the lug nuts I'll show you
when<00:02:46.040> I<00:02:46.690> take<00:02:47.690> them<00:02:47.870> off<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:53.900> each<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.380> the

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
when I take them off so on each of the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.490 
when I take them off so on each of the
lug<00:02:55.040> nuts<00:02:55.280> there's<00:02:55.820> this<00:02:56.060> ring<00:02:56.420> on<00:02:56.600> there<00:02:56.900> and

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
lug nuts there's this ring on there and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
lug nuts there's this ring on there and
what<00:02:58.010> was<00:02:58.160> really<00:02:58.400> weird<00:02:58.820> on<00:02:59.180> this<00:02:59.630> vehicle<00:03:00.020> is

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
what was really weird on this vehicle is

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.020 
what was really weird on this vehicle is
that<00:03:02.470> when<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.500> when<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:04.220> first<00:03:04.520> started<00:03:04.910> working

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
that when I when I first started working

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.130 
that when I when I first started working
on<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.480> car<00:03:06.610> every<00:03:07.610> wheel<00:03:07.850> only<00:03:08.450> had<00:03:08.660> two<00:03:08.959> of

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
on the car every wheel only had two of

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.970 
on the car every wheel only had two of
the<00:03:09.230> factory<00:03:10.600> stays<00:03:11.600> on<00:03:12.110> there<00:03:12.350> for<00:03:12.590> lack<00:03:12.740> of<00:03:12.770> a

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
the factory stays on there for lack of a

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.980 
the factory stays on there for lack of a
better<00:03:13.010> word<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.820> I<00:03:14.209> actually<00:03:14.330> had<00:03:14.630> to<00:03:14.660> go<00:03:14.870> on

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
better word and I actually had to go on

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.690 
better word and I actually had to go on
my<00:03:15.140> lathe<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.830> make<00:03:17.680> some<00:03:18.680> for<00:03:19.130> all<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.459> ones

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
my lathe and make some for all the ones

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.670 
my lathe and make some for all the ones
that<00:03:19.970> were<00:03:20.090> missing<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.780> original<00:03:21.200> owner

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
that were missing the original owner

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.490 
that were missing the original owner
only<00:03:22.550> took<00:03:22.700> it<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.150> dealer<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:24.230> have<00:03:24.380> it

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
only took it to the dealer to have it

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.050 
only took it to the dealer to have it
worked<00:03:24.709> on<00:03:25.690> including<00:03:26.690> tires<00:03:26.989> so<00:03:27.950> I<00:03:28.370> hate<00:03:29.030> to

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
worked on including tires so I hate to

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.290 
worked on including tires so I hate to
think<00:03:29.360> that<00:03:29.480> they<00:03:30.280> took<00:03:31.280> those<00:03:31.519> off<00:03:31.850> for<00:03:31.880> their

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
think that they took those off for their

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.350 
think that they took those off for their
own<00:03:32.450> use<00:03:32.750> but<00:03:33.019> it<00:03:33.110> was<00:03:33.230> sure<00:03:33.410> was<00:03:33.620> weird<00:03:34.360> that

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
own use but it was sure was weird that

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.780 
own use but it was sure was weird that
there<00:03:35.540> was<00:03:35.660> only<00:03:35.840> two<00:03:36.350> on<00:03:36.769> each<00:03:37.130> wheel<00:03:37.489> and

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
there was only two on each wheel and

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.290 
there was only two on each wheel and
that<00:03:38.570> two<00:03:38.810> were<00:03:39.019> missing<00:03:39.530> on<00:03:39.950> each<00:03:40.459> wheel<00:03:40.760> so

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
that two were missing on each wheel so

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.800 
that two were missing on each wheel so
anyways<00:03:41.720> so<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:43.730> cap<00:03:43.940> comes<00:03:44.209> off<00:03:44.510> it's

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
anyways so the cap comes off it's

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.880 
anyways so the cap comes off it's
retained<00:03:46.300> in<00:03:47.300> the<00:03:47.480> well<00:03:47.660> you<00:03:47.690> can<00:03:47.959> see<00:03:48.410> how

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890
