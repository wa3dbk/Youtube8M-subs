00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.820
 of age 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.350
 hear until they 're touching me but I'm afraid 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.809
 that we have your hot dish 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.030
 what a delight in this would be the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.440
 what is the first step we are going to start the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.590
 meat that told us what he said to the 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.590
 beginning 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.990
 Y 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:21.180
 we are there exactly 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.560
 we go and that we take it to read when seeing 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.899
 that we already have our 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:31.270
 pan very well in this meat 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.780
 perfect something else came to the bean there 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.970
 true this accompanies us to the good fire 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.720
 add the meat in the water already 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:45.659
 we have here boiling very well then you 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.659
 let's put the salt that's to taste 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.860
 there is a lady and while the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.280
 meat 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.980
 he told me about a very nice song and 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.710
 from an author sheet metal far to see singing 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:06.570
 a little white piece on the side but a 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.090
 little piece of white daisy flowers 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.920
 one day 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:23.400
 we silently cut and I 'm going to 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:26.190
 mourn better not not well I remember 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.830
 like the kitchen and the song 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.940
 songs like they connect us and average 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.370
 also Aragon with people with moments 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.019
 we live thank you very much for sharing 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.019
 this song with us 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.340
 but the reality is this song of the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.520
 I have here in the heart I do not have 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.370
 margaritas to that we remove year are 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.680

 what rose from the flesh 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:10.069
 and now we are going to put the bean very 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:13.209
 It is important to remove them, not 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:16.510
 It gives bad taste that of the blood of the 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.510
 of the network 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.790
 we stir and how long it will take more or 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.069
 less than cooking well it will take as 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.610
 half an hour very well we can do something 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.290
 while it is already going, if we do not get 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.080
 cry with firewood 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.530
