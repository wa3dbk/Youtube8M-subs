00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
low-pass filters this one's got a newly

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.400 
low-pass filters this one's got a newly
designed<00:01:30.520> low-pass<00:01:31.120> filter<00:01:31.570> that<00:01:31.690> they<00:01:31.870> say

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
designed low-pass filter that they say

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.130 
designed low-pass filter that they say
has<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.070> results<00:01:33.520> of<00:01:33.700> not<00:01:34.360> having<00:01:34.690> a<00:01:34.780> low-pass

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
has the results of not having a low-pass

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.010 
has the results of not having a low-pass
filter<00:01:35.560> but<00:01:35.680> without<00:01:35.920> having<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.750> moiré

filter but without having the the moiré

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.870 
filter but without having the the moiré
a<00:01:38.050> and<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.530> color<00:01:38.770> fringing<00:01:39.040> issues<00:01:39.550> that<00:01:39.730> can

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
a and the color fringing issues that can

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.090 
a and the color fringing issues that can
come<00:01:40.120> from<00:01:40.150> removing<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.200> low-pass<00:01:41.560> filter

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
come from removing the low-pass filter

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.100 
come from removing the low-pass filter
so<00:01:42.850> let's<00:01:43.150> take<00:01:43.300> a<00:01:43.330> look<00:01:43.510> at<00:01:43.600> this<00:01:43.659> one<00:01:43.870> close

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
so let's take a look at this one close

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.280 
so let's take a look at this one close
up<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.440> run<00:01:44.590> through<00:01:44.800> some<00:01:44.980> of<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.190> specs

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
up and run through some of the specs

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.200 
up and run through some of the specs
look<00:01:47.290> it<00:01:47.470> certainly<00:01:47.770> feels<00:01:48.010> really<00:01:48.520> nice<00:01:48.909> in

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
look it certainly feels really nice in

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.810 
look it certainly feels really nice in
the<00:01:49.330> hand<00:01:49.360> it<00:01:49.780> feels<00:01:50.159> unusually<00:01:51.159> rugged<00:01:51.550> and

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
the hand it feels unusually rugged and

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.660 
the hand it feels unusually rugged and
you<00:01:52.270> know<00:01:52.390> well<00:01:52.720> built<00:01:53.020> for<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.770> camera<00:01:54.370> of<00:01:54.490> this

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
you know well built for a camera of this

you know well built for a camera of this
kind<00:01:54.880> of<00:01:55.060> size<00:01:55.300> I<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:56.050> know<00:01:56.170> looking<00:01:56.710> at<00:01:56.860> it<00:01:56.979> I

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
kind of size I you know looking at it I

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.410 
kind of size I you know looking at it I
expected<00:01:57.580> it<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.729> feel<00:01:58.000> a<00:01:58.030> little<00:01:58.270> bit

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
expected it to feel a little bit

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.180 
expected it to feel a little bit
plasticky<00:01:58.659> but<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.229> really<00:01:59.500> doesn't<00:01:59.860> at<00:02:00.159> all

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
plasticky but it really doesn't at all

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.820 
plasticky but it really doesn't at all
even<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.240> screen<00:02:01.600> has<00:02:01.930> you<00:02:02.350> know<00:02:02.470> a<00:02:02.500> good

even the screen has you know a good
build<00:02:03.130> quality<00:02:03.220> it<00:02:03.700> feels<00:02:03.940> like<00:02:04.060> it's<00:02:04.240> all

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
build quality it feels like it's all

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.540

really<00:02:04.540> well<00:02:04.810> reinforced<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:05.710> seems<00:02:06.370> like

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
really well reinforced it seems like

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.740 
really well reinforced it seems like
something<00:02:06.850> that<00:02:06.909> I<00:02:07.060> could<00:02:07.210> actually<00:02:07.540> use

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
something that I could actually use

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.229 
something that I could actually use
without<00:02:08.319> destroying<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:09.129> also<00:02:09.580> comes<00:02:09.849> with<00:02:09.970> an

without destroying it also comes with an
optional<00:02:10.420> battery<00:02:11.080> grip<00:02:11.349> unfortunately<00:02:12.010> this

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
optional battery grip unfortunately this

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.280 
optional battery grip unfortunately this
one<00:02:12.430> isn't<00:02:12.879> of<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.299> same<00:02:13.480> build<00:02:13.750> quality<00:02:13.989> it

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
one isn't of the same build quality it

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.039 
one isn't of the same build quality it
is<00:02:14.440> more<00:02:14.739> of<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:14.920> plastic<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.459> feel<00:02:15.760> but<00:02:16.569> it

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
is more of a plastic you feel but it

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.289 
is more of a plastic you feel but it
does<00:02:17.260> complement<00:02:17.799> the<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.340> camera<00:02:18.730> well<00:02:18.940> and

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
does complement the the camera well and

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:20.580 
does complement the the camera well and
make<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.720> into<00:02:20.019> a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
much easier to hold and control system

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.380 
much easier to hold and control system
and<00:02:23.260> as<00:02:23.650> well<00:02:23.800> as<00:02:23.950> introducing<00:02:24.519> extra<00:02:25.030> dials

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
little bit which is an apparent when you

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.330 
little bit which is an apparent when you
use<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:37.720> rear<00:03:37.930> LCD<00:03:38.170> screen<00:03:38.829> which<00:03:38.859> is<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.160> bit

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
use the rear LCD screen which is a bit

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.819 
use the rear LCD screen which is a bit
of<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.489> surprise<00:03:39.639> but<00:03:40.480> let's<00:03:40.660> run<00:03:40.870> some<00:03:40.900> high

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
of a surprise but let's run some high

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.300 
of a surprise but let's run some high
iso<00:03:42.370> tes<00:03:42.639> here<00:03:42.910> I'll<00:03:43.090> shoot<00:03:43.900> it<00:03:44.049> from<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:45.130> base

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
iso tes here I'll shoot it from the base
