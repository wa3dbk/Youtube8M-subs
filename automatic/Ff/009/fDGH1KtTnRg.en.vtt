ball and adapts to the velocity of your
swing<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.719> would<00:00:45.989> recommend<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
swing I would recommend this to a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.680 
swing I would recommend this to a
four-point-oh<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> an<00:00:47.670> open<00:00:47.940> level<00:00:48.090> player<00:00:48.390> I

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
four-point-oh to an open level player I

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.299 
four-point-oh to an open level player I
really<00:00:49.260> enjoy<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.739> take<00:00:49.950> technology

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
really enjoy the you take technology

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.549 
really enjoy the you take technology
which<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.390> probably<00:00:51.629> why<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.899> chose<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
which is probably why I chose one of the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.770 
which is probably why I chose one of the
rackets<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.039> their<00:00:53.190> line<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:54.329> really<00:00:54.539> tell

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
rackets on their line I can really tell

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.209 
rackets on their line I can really tell
the<00:00:54.899> difference<00:00:54.930> between<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.680> radical<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the difference between the radical and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.369 
the difference between the radical and
the<00:00:56.280> prestige<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.480> prestige<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> little

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the prestige the prestige is a little

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.170 
the prestige the prestige is a little
bit<00:00:58.500> more<00:00:58.649> flexible<00:00:59.190> offering<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.820> little<00:00:59.940> bit

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
bit more flexible offering a little bit

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.119 
bit more flexible offering a little bit
more<00:01:00.420> control<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:01.020> my<00:01:01.199> shot<00:01:01.469> from<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
more control on my shot from the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.399 
more control on my shot from the
baseline<00:01:02.460> when<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.879> took<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.149> long<00:01:03.449> fast<00:01:03.809> swing<00:01:04.140> I

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
baseline when I took a long fast swing I

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.050 
baseline when I took a long fast swing I
really<00:01:04.949> felt<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> racket<00:01:05.580> stiffen<00:01:05.970> up

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
really felt the racket stiffen up

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.940 
really felt the racket stiffen up
allowing<00:01:06.360> me<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.689> control<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> ball<00:01:07.320> easier<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
allowing me to control the ball easier I

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.830 
allowing me to control the ball easier I
needed<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.640> put<00:01:08.820> more<00:01:08.970> pace<00:01:09.210> behind<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.630> ball

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
needed to put more pace behind the ball

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.590 
needed to put more pace behind the ball
and<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.650> head<00:01:10.799> size<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> little<00:01:11.549> small<00:01:11.880> at

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
and the head size is a little small at

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.179 
and the head size is a little small at
the<00:01:12.720> net<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.110> felt<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> racket<00:01:13.950> really

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the net I felt that the racket really

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.100

adjusted<00:01:14.640> my<00:01:14.729> game<00:01:15.000> helping<00:01:15.659> me<00:01:15.780> get<00:01:15.930> more

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
adjusted my game helping me get more

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.469

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
for my taste the mid head size is a

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.290 
for my taste the mid head size is a
little<00:02:24.800> bit<00:02:24.920> too<00:02:25.070> small<00:02:25.400> for<00:02:25.640> me<00:02:25.760> I<00:02:25.790> like<00:02:26.120> to
