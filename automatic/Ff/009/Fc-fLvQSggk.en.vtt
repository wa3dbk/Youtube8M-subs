00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
seeing those clearing conditions so we

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.220 
seeing those clearing conditions so we
have<00:00:35.040> dry<00:00:35.399> air<00:00:35.670> moving<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.180> for<00:00:36.750> your<00:00:36.899> Thursday

to<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> West<00:00:41.070> right<00:00:41.309> now<00:00:41.460> but<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.149> will

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
to the West right now but that will

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.760 
to the West right now but that will
approach<00:00:42.510> as<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:42.840> go<00:00:42.960> through<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.379> day<00:00:43.530> Friday

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
temperatures still well above average

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.430

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
then on Friday this is when we start to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.630 
then on Friday this is when we start to
see<00:01:04.049> maybe<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.680> little<00:01:04.949> bit<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.159> rain<00:01:05.309> approach

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
see maybe a little bit of rain approach

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.700 
see maybe a little bit of rain approach
this<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.970> Friday<00:01:06.270> 9:00<00:01:06.630> a.m.<00:01:06.810> we'll<00:01:07.409> see<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
this is Friday 9:00 a.m. we'll see the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.160 
this is Friday 9:00 a.m. we'll see the
clouds<00:01:07.950> around<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:08.610> any<00:01:08.850> rains<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.750> early

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
clouds around and if any rains and early

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.410 
clouds around and if any rains and early
enough<00:01:10.439> north<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.979> west<00:01:11.189> mostly<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> Poconos

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
enough north and west mostly the Poconos

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.120 
enough north and west mostly the Poconos
we<00:01:12.840> could<00:01:13.049> still<00:01:13.260> see<00:01:13.290> temperatures<00:01:13.860> cold

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
we could still see temperatures cold

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.010 
we could still see temperatures cold
enough<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:14.490> some<00:01:14.700> freezing<00:01:15.060> rain<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.780> is

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
enough for some freezing rain so that is

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.109 
enough for some freezing rain so that is
certainly<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.409> possibility<00:01:16.650> into<00:01:17.520> Friday

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
certainly a possibility into Friday

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.030 
certainly a possibility into Friday
morning<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.229> get<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> majority<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
morning then we get a majority of the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.320 
morning then we get a majority of the
rest<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.460> rain<00:01:20.610> by<00:01:20.790> Friday<00:01:20.820> afternoon

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330

rest of the rain by Friday afternoon
still<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.229> trying<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.590> show<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.830> maybe

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
still just trying to show that maybe

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.030 
still just trying to show that maybe
freezing<00:01:24.630> rain<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.140> Poconos<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.740> we<00:01:25.890> go

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
freezing rain in the Poconos as we go

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.620 
freezing rain in the Poconos as we go
into<00:01:26.250> Friday<00:01:26.400> afternoon<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.060> then<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.450> see
