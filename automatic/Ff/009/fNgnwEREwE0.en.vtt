00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
going a little more and we're in a

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.530 
going a little more and we're in a
rainforest<00:02:47.930> everything<00:02:48.890> just<00:02:49.070> looking<00:02:49.340> out

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
rainforest everything just looking out

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.860 
rainforest everything just looking out
it<00:02:50.540> would<00:02:50.660> just<00:02:50.810> change<00:02:50.840> like<00:02:51.140> that<00:02:55.630> you<00:02:56.630> see

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
it would just change like that you see

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.110 
it would just change like that you see
just<00:02:57.320> people<00:02:57.830> sleeping<00:02:58.160> on<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.340> streets<00:02:58.790> you

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
just people sleeping on the streets you

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.870 
just people sleeping on the streets you
you<00:02:59.780> know<00:02:59.900> you<00:02:59.960> kind<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.710> get<00:03:00.860> a<00:03:00.890> sense<00:03:00.980> of<00:03:01.490> of

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
you know you kind of get a sense of of

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.990 
you know you kind of get a sense of of
the<00:03:02.480> poverty<00:03:02.930> but<00:03:03.200> it's<00:03:03.500> almost<00:03:03.710> all<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.160> blur

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.130 

one<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.090> those<00:03:08.180> things<00:03:08.450> you<00:03:08.570> had<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.810> count<00:03:09.020> I

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
one of those things you had to count I

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.180 
one of those things you had to count I
almost<00:03:09.290> see<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.830> believe

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
almost see to believe

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.560 
almost see to believe
I<00:03:10.750> think<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:11.960> uh<00:03:11.990> our<00:03:12.620> our<00:03:13.240> lowest<00:03:14.240> of<00:03:14.360> lows

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
I think that uh our our lowest of lows

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.870 
I think that uh our our lowest of lows
here<00:03:14.930> would<00:03:15.110> probably<00:03:15.290> be<00:03:15.590> middle<00:03:16.130> class<00:03:16.160> over

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
here would probably be middle class over

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.680 
here would probably be middle class over
there<00:03:17.830> poorest<00:03:18.830> of<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.040> poor<00:03:19.130> and<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:20.330> United

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
there poorest of the poor and the United

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.240 
there poorest of the poor and the United
States<00:03:20.930> would<00:03:21.110> be<00:03:21.170> pretty<00:03:21.560> well<00:03:21.770> off<00:03:22.010> in

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
States would be pretty well off in

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.040 
States would be pretty well off in
Ethiopia<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:24.739> while<00:03:25.580> Africa<00:03:26.270> was<00:03:26.540> making<00:03:26.930> an

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
Ethiopia and while Africa was making an

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.750
