00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
 the forest looks even more laughing then 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.120
 you also still before the pot channel 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.560
 i come with cake hey people so 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.120
 I see myself as a pretty 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.110
 positive thinker at the same time 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.820
 many people think of me 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.469
 the opposite is true of me 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.969
 had to hear things like these so far 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.410
 so pessimistic at me always so 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.760
 negative about why can this 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.619
 classic as half full as half empty 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.880
 casually consider this saying 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.800
 it always was with it 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.359
 water filled the glass half full with 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.920
 Sour milk is probably better than 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.269
 he only says half-naked 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.289
 Let's go on, I do not want to 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.730
 Sometimes the things that I can lie are lying 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.019
 say anklam not be negative for 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.189
 example as I have mine 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.329
 i wrote once 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.350
 Suppose that's the worst note 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.550
 I just get it 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.840
 mentally prepare for it 40 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.550
 would fail or when I at one 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.960
 state championship puzzles have said 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.370
 I place myself second before the match 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.420
 is also quite good or above all 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.620
 at the girls always when I am 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.820
 Prepare to ask girl 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.539
 I think every single situation 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.950
 by how I get a lift 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.870
 Could I know how I am in such a way 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.190
 a scenario could react to me 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.480
 I do not know what to do if she does 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.309
 would say and that would be correct 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.449
 then it will be unpleasant 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.649
 Whenever I think of my girlfriend 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.030
 family say this and say 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.649
 they criticize me in my opinion 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.030
 Negative I was sure you can do that 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.410
 We too all know this one friend 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.940
 or a family member which mister 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.379
 or miss is positive and equal to the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.180
 blanket falls as soon as the least 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.470
 thing she says a little negative what the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.119
 People do not even know about me 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.500
 my closest friends is my family 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.659
 not really positive 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.790
 thinker am really exaggerated positive 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.040
 I see the glass in my own head 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.970
 as half full myself I tell myself 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.380
 always that one gives it in each one 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.970
 situation should look no matter how bad 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.200
 It may look like i say these things 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.490
 suddenly louder than if people 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.350
 Bad things happen and you 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.270
 are exaggerated positive it is very 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.650
 often as insensitive or rude over 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.579
 I have to think so often 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.350
 through hard times and hard times 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.970
 situations helped me again 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.350
 I'll just give you these examples with it 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.210
 can see like me in my head 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.439
 Positive I would stay these things 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.640
 Never speak out loud and you 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.750
 should not believe me too 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.939
 do not want to say these things out loud 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.320
 My big one is no matter how bad that 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.240
 things are even in the worst 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.009
 if there is a negative there must be 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.009
 even positive life is just to find 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.850
 what 's the matter you 've found out 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.950
 that my friends are cheating on me, doing something 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.820
 I'm really shitty and that's it 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.470
 that's what I'm probably in this 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.090
 would say it is not exactly 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.290
 what i think i said my head 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.880
 if I have an exaggerated positive 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.979
 person and it will look like this when i am 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.030
 that would say what i really think 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.670
 what is going on , I have found out 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.509
 that my friends are cheating on me that is 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.590
 wonderful bro 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.580
 There was no time for that 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.030
 waste to find out if you 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.780
 one is rather what you can do my grandpa 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.300
 died 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.100
 what a great guy that's unfair that 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.840
 I'm really sorry broke that 's really 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.310
 I'm sad again that's something 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.600
 I would say but my thoughts are 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.519
 real man and i would go after that 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.230
 Positive ones are looking for something here 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.050
 one goes my grandpa has died 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.610
 such a great guy that is unfair to me 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.900
 Sorry to hear that but I think 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.160
 Everyone has to die sometime 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.720
 I mean, if we live forever 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.769
 we would all be dead because of that 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.819
 exponential growth of 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.470
 we would have human population 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.880
 not the resources so it is 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.530
 somehow not the worst thing of the world 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.700
 world 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.190
 I just do not think anyone like that 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.930
 what does a tin plate do what someone has 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.850
 All your tickets are gone from the laundry room 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.470
 they were worth 100 dollars together 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.120
 that's shit on me who's doing that 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.730
 because what you know how it works 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.620
 what's up somebody has out all their cards 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.140
 the laundrette andrÃ© tap together 100 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.220
 dollar worth good for by whats that is 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.980
 a compliment that means a good one 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.810
 taste for clothes hate sows her 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.680
 Actually, that's positive stuff though 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.670
 now you know probably have something 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.720
 I said you should be yours 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.799
 Keep this exaggerated head 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.329
 Positive thoughts make this one 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.680
 situation not better, however, they help 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.030
 a case about it was I away 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.530
 I know it's hard to stay positive 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.820
 if you were sad it is angry 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.260
 if you have these moments makes you 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.130
 I would be there before and give positive 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.030
 thoughts 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.709
 oh my god I'm only 16 what should 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.370
 I do 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.480
 Now you need the next nine 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.470
 Do not be afraid to spend months 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.870
 to get pregnant 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.970
 i can never fall asleep i hate mine 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.200
 Insomnia is still better than 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.010
 I can wake up and in one 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.049
 coma to lie 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.079
 The forgotten manager Luca is always 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.310
 again that is really coming from before 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.000
 that they are so in the diet 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.250
 It could help to quietly kick it in 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.359
 just there hundkacke hellmann it 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.590
 could be worse after all knows 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.630
 no people shit or the dog 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.370
 myself or a hiv understood here 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.440
 or casual 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.850
 Thanks to my stomach it hurts when I enter 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.200
 little caution is perhaps not there 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.180
 and i feel better god 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.550
 after all, not your white tricks today 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.440
 underwear white underwear white 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.760
 underwear white underwear 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.709
 I just can not believe that 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.580
 my cat forever forte is someone 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.350
 I know your dog 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.060
 I just can not believe that mine 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.480
 Dog was over forever I was yours 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.100
 cat 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.870
 I just can not believe that me 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.579
 my cat and my high lost 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.140
 at least you can still catwalk 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.230
 see online to make you feel better 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.560
 what is cat you do not know what catwalk 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.810
 is 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.950
 Hahn I feel too old now my 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.690
 spectators if this reference is up 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.060
 understand or you will get rid of this scene 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.169
 do not put it in the video but I can 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.700
 this scene does not even take that out 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.530
 video already online of course you can 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.930
 she still filmed her just as well 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.280
 She is also not meditating on this scene 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.410
 is so confusing i just take it 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.410
 out or some people will understand 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.340
 My animals are but what makes this 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.570
 scene does not want to ask the video 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.770
 I know how you see it 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.210
 No matter how bad things are 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.980
 or how bad things look there 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.630
 always something positive in everything 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.250
 our world is balanced it can 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.390
 nothing negative and something positive 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.710
 go live maybe that may 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.630
 glass which is about half empty 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.800
 It looks like it's you and only you 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.300
 the power of decision has to do with that 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.770
 make glass half full and if you can 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.000
 then there is not in this 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.390
 universe I have ever back down 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.390
 can pull 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.620
 this definitely sour and I should 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.540
 probably in the waiting room before me 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.990
 god an entry today I do not mean 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.990

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.290
