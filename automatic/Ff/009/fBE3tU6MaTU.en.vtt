hi I'm Lauren and today I'm going to
show<00:00:02.220> you<00:00:02.250> how<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.700> do<00:00:03.000> on<00:00:03.179> one<00:00:03.360> legged

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
show you how to do on one legged

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.749 
show you how to do on one legged
cartwheel<00:00:04.069> before<00:00:05.069> you<00:00:05.160> do<00:00:05.279> it<00:00:05.400> when<00:00:05.520> they<00:00:05.640> get

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
cartwheel before you do it when they get

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.120 
cartwheel before you do it when they get
cartwheel<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.420> need<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.660> stretch<00:00:10.130> by

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
cartwheel and you need the stretch by

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.180 
cartwheel and you need the stretch by
putting<00:00:11.610> each<00:00:11.969> side<00:00:12.330> for<00:00:13.139> 10<00:00:13.320> seconds<00:00:13.980> and

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
putting each side for 10 seconds and

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.300 
putting each side for 10 seconds and
then<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:15.030> middle<00:00:15.269> for<00:00:15.450> 10<00:00:15.480> seconds<00:00:16.310> stretch

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
then the middle for 10 seconds stretch

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:28.130 
then the middle for 10 seconds stretch
your<00:00:17.460> ankles<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:21.289> your<00:00:22.340> wrists<00:00:26.570> and<00:00:27.570> also

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
your ankles and your wrists and also

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.390 
your ankles and your wrists and also
before<00:00:28.289> watching<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.800> video<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.160> should

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
before watching this video you should

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.250 
before watching this video you should
watch<00:00:29.580> my<00:00:29.910> video<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.539> how<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.750> do<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> cartwheel

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
watch my video on how to do a cartwheel

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.290 
watch my video on how to do a cartwheel
because<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.219> can't<00:00:32.430> do<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> one-legged<00:00:32.969> cart

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
because you can't do a one-legged cart

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.680 
because you can't do a one-legged cart
without<00:00:33.420> be<00:00:33.750> able<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.380> do<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> regular<00:00:34.710> Cardwell

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
without be able to do a regular Cardwell

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.119 
without be able to do a regular Cardwell
so<00:00:36.690> when<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.899> do<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.320> one-legged<00:00:37.710> cartwheel

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
so when you do a one-legged cartwheel

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.799 
so when you do a one-legged cartwheel
you<00:00:38.579> should<00:00:38.730> always<00:00:38.850> form<00:00:39.120> up<00:00:39.239> by<00:00:39.540> doing<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
you should always form up by doing the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.190 
you should always form up by doing the
regular<00:00:39.960> cartwheel<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:45.000> whatever<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:46.079> do

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
regular cartwheel so whatever you do

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.740 
regular cartwheel so whatever you do
when<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:46.500> car<00:00:46.829> go<00:00:47.120> well<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.420> would<00:00:48.629> all

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
when they car go well this would all

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.540 
when they car go well this would all
night<00:00:48.930> cover<00:00:49.170> looks<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:54.680> you<00:00:55.680> start<00:00:56.010> off<00:00:56.190> on

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
night cover looks and you start off on

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.639 
night cover looks and you start off on
one<00:00:56.820> leg<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.870> could<00:00:58.020> either<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.410> just

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
one leg so you could either be just

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.200 
one leg so you could either be just
slightly<00:00:58.920> above<00:00:59.219> ground<00:00:59.520> or<00:00:59.789> could<00:00:59.940> be<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.120> an

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
slightly above ground or could be in an

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.270 
slightly above ground or could be in an
arabesque<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.020> then<00:01:02.030> you<00:01:03.030> land<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.570> either

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
arabesque and then you land it either

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.890 
arabesque and then you land it either
you<00:01:05.280> could<00:01:05.430> leave<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> ground<00:01:06.360> or<00:01:06.720> like

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
you could leave it on the ground or like

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.880 
you could leave it on the ground or like
in<00:01:07.049> an<00:01:07.140> Airbus<00:01:07.500> also<00:01:09.049> but<00:01:10.049> before<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.710> try

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
in an Airbus also but before you try

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.300 
in an Airbus also but before you try
starting<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.640> one<00:01:12.180> leg<00:01:12.420> or<00:01:13.159> landing<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.250> one

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
starting on one leg or landing on one

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.690 
starting on one leg or landing on one
leg

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
leg

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.070 
leg
you<00:01:15.060> should<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.360> get<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.570> motion<00:01:15.960> of

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
you should just get the motion of

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.499 
you should just get the motion of
sifting<00:01:16.380> your<00:01:16.500> legs<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.970> start<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.360> like

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
sifting your legs so you start it like

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.630 
sifting your legs so you start it like
you<00:01:18.659> would<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.810> regular<00:01:18.869> cartwheel<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.830> then

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
you would a regular cartwheel and then

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.670 
you would a regular cartwheel and then
in<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> middle<00:01:21.090> you're<00:01:21.479> gonna<00:01:21.659> think<00:01:22.560> about

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
in the middle you're gonna think about

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.789 
in the middle you're gonna think about
putting<00:01:23.220> your<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:25.080> did<00:01:25.229> left<00:01:25.409> cartwheel

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
putting your if you did left cartwheel

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.660 
putting your if you did left cartwheel
you're<00:01:25.920> gonna<00:01:26.009> think<00:01:26.100> about<00:01:26.220> putting<00:01:26.490> your

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
you're gonna think about putting your

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.460 
you're gonna think about putting your
left<00:01:27.150> leg<00:01:27.390> down<00:01:27.540> first<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.140> do<00:01:28.259> right

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
left leg down first if you do right

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.440 
left leg down first if you do right
contre<00:01:28.890> you're<00:01:29.520> gonna<00:01:29.640> think<00:01:29.880> about<00:01:30.000> putting

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
contre you're gonna think about putting

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.340 
contre you're gonna think about putting
your<00:01:30.689> right<00:01:31.170> leg<00:01:31.380> down<00:01:31.530> first<00:01:32.630> so<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.110> start

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
your right leg down first so you start

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.789 
your right leg down first so you start
like<00:01:34.500> regular<00:01:34.799> Kotla<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:37.680> could

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
like regular Kotla and then you could

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.609 
like regular Kotla and then you could
put<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.130> your<00:01:38.659> left<00:01:39.659> leg<00:01:39.810> down<00:01:39.960> first<00:01:40.290> and

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
put this your left leg down first and

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.389 
put this your left leg down first and
then<00:01:40.850> this<00:01:41.850> one<00:01:42.060> either<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> air<00:01:43.049> bats<00:01:43.399> or

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
then this one either in the air bats or

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.660 
then this one either in the air bats or
straight<00:01:44.670> or<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:44.880> down<00:01:45.920> so<00:01:46.920> once<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.399> have

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
straight or just down so once you have

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.460 
straight or just down so once you have
the<00:01:47.909> motion<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.630> doing<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:51.470> then

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the motion of doing it like this then

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.030 
the motion of doing it like this then
try<00:01:52.740> starting<00:01:53.100> with<00:01:53.490> one<00:01:53.970> leg<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:55.040> landing

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
try starting with one leg and landing

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.590 
try starting with one leg and landing
with<00:01:56.189> one<00:01:56.369> leg

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.770 

okay<00:02:03.369> so<00:02:04.369> just<00:02:04.640> practice<00:02:05.210> that<00:02:05.360> a<00:02:05.420> lot<00:02:05.630> because

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
okay so just practice that a lot because

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.719 
okay so just practice that a lot because
this<00:02:06.079> is<00:02:06.350> harder<00:02:07.040> to<00:02:07.220> do<00:02:07.340> than<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.549> regular

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
this is harder to do than a regular

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.900 
this is harder to do than a regular
karva<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:08.929> might<00:02:09.140> take<00:02:09.349> you<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.590> while<00:02:09.910> the

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
karva so might take you a while the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.790 
karva so might take you a while the
hardest<00:02:11.239> part<00:02:11.450> of<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.690> is<00:02:11.840> switching<00:02:12.590> your

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
hardest part of it is switching your

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.850 
hardest part of it is switching your
legs<00:02:13.040> in<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.340> air<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:14.630> yours<00:02:15.110> might<00:02:15.440> look<00:02:15.709> like

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
legs in the air so yours might look like

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
legs in the air so yours might look like
this<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:18.590> will<00:02:18.739> just<00:02:18.890> put<00:02:19.099> this<00:02:19.310> part<00:02:19.580> let

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
this you will just put this part let

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.020
