we<00:00:39.710> do<00:00:39.830> see<00:00:40.040> a<00:00:40.070> lot<00:00:40.190> of<00:00:40.250> handwritten<00:00:40.640> texts<00:00:41.680> but

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
we do see a lot of handwritten texts but

forensics<00:00:59.269> is<00:00:59.570> obviously<00:00:59.900> a<00:00:59.989> great<00:01:00.260> help<00:01:00.530> but

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
forensics is obviously a great help but

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.729 
forensics is obviously a great help but
but<00:01:01.489> it's<00:01:01.729> fairly<00:01:02.210> easy<00:01:02.449> to<00:01:03.140> be<00:01:03.260> anonymous

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
but it's fairly easy to be anonymous

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.820 
but it's fairly easy to be anonymous
online<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:05.089> certainly<00:01:05.720> to<00:01:05.869> feel<00:01:06.170> anonymous

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
online and certainly to feel anonymous

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.250 
online and certainly to feel anonymous
online<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.150> can<00:01:08.180> be<00:01:08.479> difficult<00:01:09.080> for

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
online and and it can be difficult for

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.320 
online and and it can be difficult for
the<00:01:09.350> police<00:01:09.470> to<00:01:09.830> trace<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:11.090> particular

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
the police to trace the particular

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.780 
the police to trace the particular
origin<00:01:11.600> of<00:01:11.900> a<00:01:11.990> message<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:12.860> in<00:01:13.100> those<00:01:13.250> sense<00:01:13.580> is

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
origin of a message so in those sense is

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.160 
origin of a message so in those sense is
that<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:14.150> need<00:01:14.299> for<00:01:14.330> forensic<00:01:14.869> linguistics

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
that the need for forensic linguistics

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:24.530 
that the need for forensic linguistics
is<00:01:15.500> growing<00:01:15.950> rather<00:01:16.310> than<00:01:16.580> shrinking

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.780 

the<00:01:25.540> woman's<00:01:25.900> mobile<00:01:26.320> phone<00:01:26.560> sent<00:01:27.159> a<00:01:27.340> series

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
the woman's mobile phone sent a series

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.630 
the woman's mobile phone sent a series

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
of this story and believed that some of

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.440 
of this story and believed that some of
the<00:02:11.920> text<00:02:12.160> messages<00:02:12.550> sent<00:02:12.819> during<00:02:13.030> they<00:02:13.269> were

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
the text messages sent during they were

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.850 
the text messages sent during they were
more<00:02:13.690> likely<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.080> be<00:02:14.170> sent<00:02:14.350> by<00:02:14.440> Christopher

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
more likely to be sent by Christopher

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.949 
more likely to be sent by Christopher
Berks<00:02:15.069> than<00:02:15.280> Amanda<00:02:15.670> Berks<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.690> we<00:02:16.840> were

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
Berks than Amanda Berks and so we were

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.559 
Berks than Amanda Berks and so we were
able<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.470> perform<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:18.040> comparison<00:02:18.790> between<00:02:19.269> the

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
able to perform a comparison between the

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.280 
able to perform a comparison between the
two<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:21.790> comparison<00:02:22.360> showed<00:02:22.660> that

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
two and and that comparison showed that

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.350 
two and and that comparison showed that
they<00:02:23.410> both<00:02:23.650> had<00:02:23.890> distinctive<00:02:24.760> styles<00:02:25.239> of

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
they both had distinctive styles of

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.600 
they both had distinctive styles of
texting<00:02:25.840> from<00:02:26.019> one<00:02:26.170> another<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:27.010> were<00:02:27.190> fairly

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
texting from one another and were fairly

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.670 
texting from one another and were fairly
consistent<00:02:28.209> in<00:02:28.329> those<00:02:28.480> styles<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.560> the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
consistent in those styles and that the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.100 
consistent in those styles and that the
disputed<00:02:30.220> messages<00:02:30.670> were<00:02:30.850> more<00:02:31.030> likely<00:02:31.480> were

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
disputed messages were more likely were

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.530 
disputed messages were more likely were
more<00:02:32.290> consistent<00:02:32.890> with<00:02:33.850> Christopher<00:02:34.329> Burks

were given a set of letters and asked

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.860 
were given a set of letters and asked
what<00:05:18.470> sort<00:05:18.740> of<00:05:18.800> person<00:05:19.160> wrote<00:05:19.340> these<00:05:19.520> letters

now what I was able to try and work out

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.210 
now what I was able to try and work out
was<00:05:23.690> that<00:05:23.870> they<00:05:23.990> were<00:05:24.050> a<00:05:24.169> woman<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:24.800> that<00:05:25.070> they

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
was that they were a woman and that they

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.190 
was that they were a woman and that they
were<00:05:25.280> over<00:05:25.490> 60<00:05:26.180> and<00:05:26.300> were<00:05:26.570> from<00:05:26.750> the<00:05:26.840> South<00:05:27.050> of

in the way they use language but to turn
those<00:05:38.660> differences<00:05:39.050> around<00:05:39.440> and<00:05:39.890> say<00:05:40.010> that

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
those differences around and say that

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.770 
those differences around and say that
this<00:05:40.340> these<00:05:40.700> letters<00:05:41.120> are<00:05:41.360> written<00:05:41.630> by<00:05:41.750> a
