00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.090
 since yesterday many are still surprised 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.700
 by the news of microsoft the company 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.980
 I bet everything for his kinect and that 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.240
 it was worth several complaints from the fans now the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.279
 company has decided to change 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.140
 strategy and from June sell to 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.140
 xbox one without the device 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.820
 for the great dating of this story 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.620
 let's do a review for your short 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.610
 but intense history 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.950
 kinect to review like all the big ones 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.090
 projects this little story started with 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.550
 a nice code natal project name 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.500
 were 20 years of incubation this 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.080
 project there was already a long tradition 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.180
 by Microsoft to baptize their 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.430
 projects with names of cities the 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.040
 director alex kipman chose in this 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.199
 occasion the name of the Brazilian city 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.090
 since he was born in that country in addition 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.309
 the meaning was related to the 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.770
 birth concept and for that reason 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.690
 it seemed appropriate his efforts were 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.090
 focused on creating the next generation 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.479
 of home entertainment but what 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.479
 they got 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.609
 when kinect saw the light around the world 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:22.280
 microsoft and the rest of the people lost 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:25.659
 your head you found out about all this 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.659
 has even in the soup 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.800
 in Europe who launched on 10 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.900
 November 2010 in North America six 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.850
 days before microsoft had a 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.800
 budget of 500 million dollars 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.200
 to give ball to your new device 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.479
 rather more than for advertising 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.240
 the console did not settle for the 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.550
 public disney or nickelodeon in series 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.619
 like dancing with the stars or glee in 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.680
 publications like people or in style 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.810
 even in times square it is also 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.850
 they gave in the programs of ofra the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.890
 ellen and the jimmy fallon with this 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.050
 history it did not surprise anyone to see in 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.570
 the pre launch party organized in 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.060
 beverly hills to David Beckham himself 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.369
 with his kids 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.659
 although I have a lot of detractors what 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.220
 true is that the magic of kinect is 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.720
 lot and it is concentrated in only 25 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.180
 centimeters long 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.489
 this is kinect 2.0 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.650
 line xxi brought as expected a 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.959
 kinect completely improved three times 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.120
 more sensitive than its predecessor recognizes 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.129
 even the wrinkles in the clothes plus its 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.859
 Field of view is 60 degrees wider 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:33.439
 perfect for my mansion out of jokes 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:35.989

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:37.549
 Six people at a time measures your pace 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.920
 heart rate depending on your weight and 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.599
 complexion and is able to record the 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.230

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.319
 great for scary games or 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:53.510
 dark rooms if you get a hand 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:56.060

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.769

 has made the night in the world of kinect 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.420
 it happens that dad does not love you anymore 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.030
 It seems that the beautiful story has 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.680
 now a terrible end as we have already 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.810

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.120
