 audio at least so far not yet 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:33.720

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.519
 U.S 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.250
 now besides being able to call for ok go 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:05.030

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:09.769

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:17.269
 Return to g 5 Brazil speaking on ok

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:28.489
 I said that, the woman was coming from here. 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:35.209
 option to choose the application but you 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:38.120
 continues to have that same pattern of 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.690
 opening screen or in this initial screen or 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.420
 here in own in the result itself 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.660
 google search here 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:51.109
 in other screens for example ok the world 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.690
 only or here on this screen 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:56.180
 on these screens, it's okay, google is not 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:01.099
 necessarily on this land that was 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:05.620
 ok with the goal to any home screen or 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.620
 then in that same music score 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:18.549

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:45.680
 here in the English goal with the phone in 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:47.689
 English and other options they have for 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.780
 example ok go 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:05:00.469
 these mackson would be a resource 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:04.729
 similar to shazam to the sound of the round to the 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:06.469
 This is a music remedy, but if you can 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:11.060
 see who is not available in Brazil 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:13.909
 still have a music search feature 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:18.770
 to fetch the music you have played 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:21.909
 now the question here is ok google time 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.909

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:37.960

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:56.440

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:12.180
 if google is not cool 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:16.000
 I hope to google 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:19.830
 and that our support 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.509
 brazilian portuguese as well as pro 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.750
 United States English and 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:29.979
 say ok go now and say what you 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:31.270
 need in Portuguese and have that 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:35.400
 audio return 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:40.509
 I think it would be really cool here, google 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:42.520
 holding does it even if you speak some 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:46.300
 thing has no audio feedback like me 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:51.539
 I said that and I hope you enjoyed it. 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.539
 It was worth the video.
