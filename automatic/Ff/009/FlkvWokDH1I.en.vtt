audra and the spawning pool of course

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.080 
audra and the spawning pool of course
looked<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.340> they're<00:01:41.520> going<00:01:41.700> looks<00:01:42.030> like

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
looked like they're going looks like

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.359 
looked like they're going looks like
it's<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.450> down<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.689> exact<00:01:43.369> relatively

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
it's going down to the exact relatively

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.780 
it's going down to the exact relatively
same<00:01:44.549> time<00:01:44.790> as<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> barracks<00:01:46.790> inducing

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
same time as the barracks inducing

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.550 
same time as the barracks inducing
interesting<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.299> we<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:49.049> drone<00:01:49.409> come

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
interesting and we have this drone come

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.319 
interesting and we have this drone come
out<00:01:49.680> over<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.070> looks<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.460> audra<00:01:50.970> will<00:01:51.149> look

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
out over here looks like audra will look

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.539 
out over here looks like audra will look
to<00:01:51.479> be<00:01:51.600> gaining<00:01:52.439> some<00:01:52.710> scouting<00:01:52.950> information

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
to be gaining some scouting information

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.690 
to be gaining some scouting information
from<00:01:53.729> nams<00:01:54.000> main<00:01:54.329> base<00:01:54.740> if<00:01:55.740> he<00:01:56.250> makes<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.520> over

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
from nams main base if he makes it over

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.950 
from nams main base if he makes it over
there<00:01:56.850> he<00:01:57.000> will<00:01:57.210> see<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.570> there<00:01:57.689> will<00:01:57.840> be<00:01:57.869> a

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
there he will see that there will be a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.609 
there he will see that there will be a
wallet<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.630> with<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.899> information<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.500> will

expansion<00:02:57.310> right<00:02:57.579> now<00:02:58.090> alright<00:03:00.060> looks<00:03:01.060> like

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
expansion right now alright looks like

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.880 
expansion right now alright looks like
as<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:01.660> orbital<00:03:01.959> command<00:03:02.170> is<00:03:02.349> just<00:03:02.590> finished

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
as that orbital command is just finished

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.470 
as that orbital command is just finished
he's<00:03:03.010> not<00:03:03.250> using<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.579> skin<00:03:03.819> it's<00:03:04.060> not<00:03:04.269> send

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
he's not using the skin it's not send

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.990 
he's not using the skin it's not send
out<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.569> scouting<00:03:04.870> SUV<00:03:05.260> yet<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:05.739> namm<00:03:06.010> has<00:03:06.640> no

idea<00:03:07.329> about<00:03:07.390> this<00:03:07.720> natural<00:03:08.140> expansion<00:03:08.379> right

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
idea about this natural expansion right

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.800 
idea about this natural expansion right
there<00:03:08.829> for<00:03:08.980> Audra<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.489> this<00:03:10.090> drone<00:03:10.390> is<00:03:10.540> still

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
there for Audra and this drone is still

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.539 
there for Audra and this drone is still
