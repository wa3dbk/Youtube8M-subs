00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
it you well you can just figure it out

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.340 
it you well you can just figure it out
on<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.340> piece<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.610> cardboard<00:01:56.969> cut<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.960> out<00:01:58.110> and

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
on a piece of cardboard cut it out and

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.740 
on a piece of cardboard cut it out and
put<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:59.009> there<00:01:59.280> where'd<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.149> two<00:02:00.390> stops

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
put it on there where'd you two stops

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.719 
put it on there where'd you two stops
right<00:02:01.020> there<00:02:01.049> where<00:02:01.530> they<00:02:01.619> shouldn't<00:02:01.920> be<00:02:02.070> by

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
right there where they shouldn't be by

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.730 
right there where they shouldn't be by
turning<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.270> around<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.899> determining<00:02:04.710> that

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
turning this around and determining that

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.760 
turning this around and determining that
before<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.520> will<00:02:05.700> them<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.060> there<00:02:06.360> oh<00:02:06.770> it

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
before you will them on there oh it
