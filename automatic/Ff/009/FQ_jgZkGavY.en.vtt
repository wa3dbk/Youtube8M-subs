00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.730 
that would really work to take off the
Sharpie<00:04:11.400> if<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:12.690> do<00:04:12.930> get<00:04:13.140> it<00:04:13.260> on<00:04:13.380> your<00:04:13.500> skin<00:04:13.709> I

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
Sharpie if you do get it on your skin I

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.490 
Sharpie if you do get it on your skin I
already<00:04:14.069> said<00:04:14.250> that<00:04:14.400> once<00:04:14.640> but<00:04:14.970> just<00:04:15.500> touching

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
already said that once but just touching

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.830 
already said that once but just touching
basis<00:04:16.920> um<00:04:19.070> you<00:04:20.070> could<00:04:20.190> just<00:04:20.489> keep<00:04:20.850> on<00:04:21.180> going

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
basis um you could just keep on going

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.670 
basis um you could just keep on going
with<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.740> thumb<00:04:23.040> rule<00:04:23.310> like<00:04:24.200> well<00:04:25.200> I'm<00:04:25.320> doing

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
with the thumb rule like well I'm doing

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.250 
with the thumb rule like well I'm doing
there<00:04:26.150> and<00:04:27.150> just<00:04:27.450> push<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:27.810> down

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
there and just push it down

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.760 
there and just push it down
I<00:04:28.560> really<00:04:29.490> like<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:30.000> thumb<00:04:30.330> rule<00:04:30.960> it<00:04:31.290> really

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
I really like the thumb rule it really

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.909 
I really like the thumb rule it really
helps<00:04:32.750> whenever<00:04:33.750> you're<00:04:33.930> doing<00:04:34.110> this<00:04:34.440> you

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
helps whenever you're doing this you

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.250 
helps whenever you're doing this you
don't<00:04:35.280> want<00:04:35.460> your<00:04:35.550> hair<00:04:35.790> wet<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.780> know<00:04:36.900> you

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
so if you're gonna do this and you

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.970
