purpose<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> clip<00:02:00.390> was<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:01.579> when<00:02:02.579> you

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
purpose of the clip was that when you

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.270 
purpose of the clip was that when you
put<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:02.969> on<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.990> would<00:02:04.140> walk<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
put it on it you would walk and the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.340 
put it on it you would walk and the
Digivice<00:02:05.670> would<00:02:05.880> keep<00:02:06.119> track<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.110> how<00:02:07.290> many

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
Digivice would keep track of how many

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.320 
Digivice would keep track of how many
steps<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.829> took<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.310> basically<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.179> was<00:02:09.300> like

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
steps you took so basically it was like

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.690 
steps you took so basically it was like
a<00:02:09.450> pedometer<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.920> was<00:02:11.039> thought<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.550> was

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
a pedometer so that was thought that was

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.699 
a pedometer so that was thought that was
a<00:02:11.730> pretty<00:02:11.849> cool<00:02:12.120> feature

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
a pretty cool feature

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.600 
a pretty cool feature
and<00:02:13.860> then<00:02:14.370> up<00:02:14.670> here<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:15.540> have<00:02:15.659> these<00:02:16.110> little

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
and then up here you have these little

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.920 
and then up here you have these little
little<00:02:17.610> connecting<00:02:18.209> things<00:02:18.480> these<00:02:18.720> little

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
little connecting things these little

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.160 
little connecting things these little
silver<00:02:19.170> things<00:02:19.500> with<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:21.569> purpose<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.989> these

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
silver things with the purpose of these
