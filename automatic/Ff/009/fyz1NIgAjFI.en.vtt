00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
anyway today's raid is from for PE for

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.950 
anyway today's raid is from for PE for
three<00:00:22.350> are<00:00:22.620> are<00:00:22.920> pretty<00:00:23.400> unique<00:00:23.760> name<00:00:24.030> but<00:00:24.810> he

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
three are are pretty unique name but he

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.660 
three are are pretty unique name but he
stole<00:00:25.200> the<00:00:25.350> theoretical<00:00:25.890> maximum<00:00:26.250> amount<00:00:26.580> of

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
stole the theoretical maximum amount of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.080 
stole the theoretical maximum amount of
dark<00:00:26.910> elixir<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.450> you<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.690> steal<00:00:28.100> 7800<00:00:29.100> so<00:00:30.060> I

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
dark elixir that you can steal 7800 so I

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.910 
dark elixir that you can steal 7800 so I
think<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.600> is<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.900> record<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.440> dark<00:00:31.740> elixir

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
think this is the record for dark elixir

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.080 
think this is the record for dark elixir
I've<00:00:32.160> looked<00:00:32.340> around<00:00:32.430> haven't<00:00:32.759> seen<00:00:32.880> anything

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
I've looked around haven't seen anything

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.790 
I've looked around haven't seen anything
bigger<00:00:33.420> that's<00:00:33.989> probably<00:00:34.200> going<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.500> change

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
bigger that's probably going to change

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.319 
bigger that's probably going to change
