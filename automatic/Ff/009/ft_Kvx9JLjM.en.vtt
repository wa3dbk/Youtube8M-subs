landon<00:02:52.610> woods<00:02:52.880> i<00:02:53.030> think<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.540> could<00:02:53.810> but<00:02:54.440> if<00:02:54.560> it

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
landon woods i think it could but if it

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.559 
landon woods i think it could but if it
couldn't<00:02:54.860> maybe<00:02:55.190> it's<00:02:55.519> a<00:02:55.700> mix<00:02:55.970> between<00:02:56.120> this

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
couldn't maybe it's a mix between this

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.170 
couldn't maybe it's a mix between this
the<00:02:56.840> dodo<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.470> this<00:02:58.250> skimmer<00:02:58.579> plane<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.120> you

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
the dodo and this skimmer plane so you

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.430 
the dodo and this skimmer plane so you
know<00:02:59.299> it<00:02:59.420> looks<00:02:59.450> like<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.780> dodo<00:03:00.110> but<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.319> has

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
know it looks like the dodo but it has

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.990 
know it looks like the dodo but it has
like<00:03:00.650> floats<00:03:01.040> on<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.250> bottom<00:03:01.459> that<00:03:01.819> could

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
like floats on the bottom that could

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.300 
like floats on the bottom that could
actually<00:03:02.120> land<00:03:02.510> on<00:03:02.690> water<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.620> also<00:03:03.769> then<00:03:04.010> sets

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
actually land on water it also then sets

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.580 
actually land on water it also then sets

now obviously the blimped up we've got

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.300 
now obviously the blimped up we've got
in<00:03:08.599> GTA<00:03:08.959> 5<00:03:09.170> at<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.319> moment<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.739> pretty<00:03:10.069> boring

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
in GTA 5 at the moment is pretty boring

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.039 
in GTA 5 at the moment is pretty boring
it's<00:03:10.549> really<00:03:10.819> slow<00:03:11.030> as<00:03:11.150> hard<00:03:11.360> to<00:03:11.450> turn<00:03:11.599> like<00:03:11.930> i

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
it's really slow as hard to turn like i

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.380 
it's really slow as hard to turn like i
said<00:03:12.200> it's<00:03:12.410> just<00:03:12.440> really<00:03:12.799> a<00:03:13.099> pre-order<00:03:14.030> thing

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
said it's just really a pre-order thing

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
said it's just really a pre-order thing
that<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:14.599> could<00:03:14.660> only<00:03:14.900> get<00:03:15.049> once<00:03:15.290> you

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
that you could only get once you

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.960 
that you could only get once you
pre-order<00:03:15.769> there's<00:03:15.950> no<00:03:16.069> other<00:03:16.220> way<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.459> get<00:03:16.790> it

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
pre-order there's no other way to get it

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.520 
pre-order there's no other way to get it
and<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.420> be<00:03:17.480> honest<00:03:17.720> it<00:03:17.870> isn't<00:03:18.200> really<00:03:18.410> that

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
and to be honest it isn't really that

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.470 
and to be honest it isn't really that
good<00:03:18.799> with<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:19.010> faster<00:03:19.489> version<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.239> more

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
good with a faster version and a more

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.970 
good with a faster version and a more
maneuverable<00:03:21.079> version<00:03:21.410> of<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:21.620> that<00:03:21.680> would

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
maneuverable version of this that would

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.250 
maneuverable version of this that would
be<00:03:22.040> absolutely<00:03:22.459> amazing<00:03:23.180> hopefully<00:03:23.959> does

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
be absolutely amazing hopefully does

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.509 
be absolutely amazing hopefully does
look<00:03:24.410> different<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:24.980> doesn't<00:03:25.280> leave<00:03:25.400> you

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
look different and doesn't leave you

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.069 
look different and doesn't leave you
know<00:03:25.670> similar<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.359> other<00:03:26.389> blimp<00:03:26.810> maybe

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
know similar to the other blimp maybe

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.960 
know similar to the other blimp maybe
just<00:03:27.260> different<00:03:27.650> colors<00:03:27.950> that's<00:03:28.459> boring<00:03:28.700> i

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
just different colors that's boring i

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.910 
just different colors that's boring i
want<00:03:29.359> a<00:03:29.480> totally<00:03:29.959> different<00:03:30.380> design<00:03:30.650> if<00:03:30.799> it's

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
want a totally different design if it's

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.800 
want a totally different design if it's
going<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.100> be<00:03:31.160> faster<00:03:31.519> movable<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.359> it<00:03:32.630> needs

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
going to be faster movable and it needs

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:33.699 
going to be faster movable and it needs
to<00:03:32.870> be<00:03:32.989> different<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.380> me<00:03:33.470> is<00:03:33.530> probably

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
to be different to me is probably

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.740 
to be different to me is probably
smaller<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.340> little<00:03:34.430> bit<00:03:34.730> maybe<00:03:35.299> it<00:03:35.510> looks

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
smaller a little bit maybe it looks

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.690 
smaller a little bit maybe it looks
somewhat<00:03:36.139> futuristic<00:03:36.859> in<00:03:36.980> kind<00:03:37.250> of<00:03:37.370> like<00:03:37.519> this

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
somewhat futuristic in kind of like this

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.910 
somewhat futuristic in kind of like this
who<00:03:37.940> knows<00:03:38.120> we<00:03:38.420> don't<00:03:38.450> know<00:03:38.930> yet<00:03:39.170> but<00:03:39.380> we<00:03:39.889> will
