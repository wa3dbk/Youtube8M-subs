00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
description so the problem is some of

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.330 
description so the problem is some of
them<00:00:27.690> are<00:00:27.779> they<00:00:28.020> are<00:00:28.170> quite<00:00:28.440> small<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:28.859> far

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
them are they are quite small so far

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.099 
them are they are quite small so far
their<00:00:29.460> face<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.240> can<00:00:30.359> see<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.810> actually

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
their face you can see it is actually

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.720 
their face you can see it is actually
quite<00:00:31.260> small<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.340> because<00:00:32.610> of

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
quite small and this is because of

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.170 
quite small and this is because of
Minecraft<00:00:33.239> itself<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.900> text<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.410> font

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
Minecraft itself the text and font

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.979 
Minecraft itself the text and font
apparently<00:00:36.180> they<00:00:36.330> are<00:00:36.360> actually<00:00:36.809> gonna

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
apparently they are actually gonna

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.450 
apparently they are actually gonna
update<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.650> a<00:00:37.710> future<00:00:38.070> version<00:00:38.190> of

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
update this in a future version of

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.399 
update this in a future version of
Minecraft<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.510> obviously<00:00:39.659> improved<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:40.409 
Minecraft so that obviously improved the

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:42.170 
Minecraft so that obviously improved the
plug-in<00:00:40.739> but<00:00:41.309> some<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.550> these<00:00:41.640> do<00:00:41.820> work<00:00:41.970> really

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
plug-in but some of these do work really

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.910 
plug-in but some of these do work really
well<00:00:42.390> anyway<00:00:42.780> it's<00:00:42.960> only<00:00:43.080> certain<00:00:43.500> ones<00:00:43.530> that

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
well anyway it's only certain ones that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.770 
well anyway it's only certain ones that
don't<00:00:44.040> display<00:00:44.430> quite<00:00:44.699> as<00:00:44.820> well<00:00:44.970> so<00:00:45.629> for

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
don't display quite as well so for

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.460 
don't display quite as well so for
instance<00:00:46.140> if<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.470> did<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.739> heart<00:00:48.019> that<00:00:49.019> comes<00:00:49.290> up

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
instance if I did a heart that comes up

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.920 
instance if I did a heart that comes up
really<00:00:49.710> well<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.159> normal<00:00:50.430> size<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.030> these

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
really well it's a normal size so these

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.110 
really well it's a normal size so these
also<00:00:52.110> work<00:00:52.409> on<00:00:52.589> signs<00:00:52.979> so<00:00:53.519> I<00:00:53.549> could<00:00:53.850> create<00:00:54.000> a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
also work on signs so I could create a

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:04.880 
also work on signs so I could create a
sign<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.600> this<00:01:03.110> and<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.199> symbols<00:01:04.619> come<00:01:04.769> up

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
sign like this and the symbols come up

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.620 
sign like this and the symbols come up
and<00:01:05.040> they<00:01:05.129> display<00:01:05.489> quite<00:01:05.729> nicely<00:01:05.940> so<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.390> like

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
and they display quite nicely so I like

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.300 
and they display quite nicely so I like
them<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.799> also<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.190> them

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
them like that and you can also do them

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.190 
them like that and you can also do them
in<00:01:08.400> books<00:01:08.640> as<00:01:08.940> well<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.630> instance<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.140> do

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
in books as well so for instance if I do

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.950 
in books as well so for instance if I do
a<00:01:10.290> heart<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.890> could<00:01:11.100> do

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
a heart I could do

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:23.529 
a heart I could do
music<00:01:14.270> by<00:01:18.079> sign<00:01:19.079> the<00:01:19.229> book<00:01:19.409> start<00:01:20.399> music<00:01:22.009> and

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
music by sign the book start music and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.690 
music by sign the book start music and
music<00:01:24.799> sign<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.950> close<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.429> can<00:01:26.520> see<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
music sign in close you can see the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.149 
music sign in close you can see the
title<00:01:27.179> was<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> few<00:01:27.570> notes<00:01:27.810> then<00:01:28.740> if<00:01:28.859> I<00:01:28.950> right

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
title was a few notes then if I right

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.740 
title was a few notes then if I right
click<00:01:29.189> there's<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> symbols<00:01:30.210> inside<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
click there's the symbols inside the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.289 
click there's the symbols inside the
book<00:01:30.899> so<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.219> could<00:01:32.399> also<00:01:32.520> color<00:01:32.909> these<00:01:33.090> as

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
book so you could also color these as

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.730 
book so you could also color these as
well<00:01:33.450> as<00:01:33.689> long<00:01:33.929> as<00:01:34.049> you've<00:01:34.170> got<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.350> plug-in

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
well as long as you've got a plug-in

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.130 
well as long as you've got a plug-in
that<00:01:34.890> supports<00:01:34.950> colors<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.999> books<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.659> haven't

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
that supports colors in books I haven't

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.480 
that supports colors in books I haven't
got<00:01:37.289> one<00:01:37.409> installed<00:01:37.770> at<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.950> moment<00:01:38.249> so<00:01:38.460> I

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
got one installed at the moment so I

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.429 
got one installed at the moment so I
can't<00:01:38.820> actually<00:01:38.969> do<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.170> you've<00:01:40.289> got

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
can't actually do that but if you've got

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.010 
can't actually do that but if you've got
another<00:01:40.590> plug-in<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.130> does<00:01:41.310> handle<00:01:41.640> colors

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
another plug-in that does handle colors

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.060 
another plug-in that does handle colors
also<00:01:43.020> obviously<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.560> need<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.740> plug-in<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
also obviously you need to plug-in the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.770 
also obviously you need to plug-in the
handles<00:01:44.460> colors<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:44.969> signs<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.479> chap

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
handles colors on signs and chap

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.889 
handles colors on signs and chap
essentials<00:01:46.740> does<00:01:46.979> support<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:48.509> you've

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
essentials does support that so you've

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.450 
essentials does support that so you've
obviously<00:01:48.990> got<00:01:49.350> your<00:01:49.530> signs<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.219> set

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
obviously got your signs here that set

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.489 
obviously got your signs here that set
up<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.819> can<00:01:50.969> do<00:01:51.119> multiple<00:01:51.869> signs<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.380> have

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:52.499 
up you can do multiple signs that have

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:54.380 
up you can do multiple signs that have
got<00:01:52.619> different<00:01:52.799> symbols<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.490> there<00:01:53.999> are<00:01:54.149> some

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
got different symbols on there are some

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.760 
got different symbols on there are some
symbols<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.899> are<00:01:54.960> really<00:01:55.319> cool<00:01:55.499> you<00:01:55.710> just
